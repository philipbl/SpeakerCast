At that time there were no stakes, with the largest cities in the mission having only two branches. There were limited opportunities for education and much poverty. With two or three exceptions, all the missionaries were from the United States.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p2" pid="9nVoBSMueUCv8sOYRmfEOg" hash="uBy7Ng">I remember the people of the Nealtican Branch. All buildings in the town were made of adobe, except the Catholic cathedral and the LDS chapel. I remember standing in the small adobe house of the branch president. It had a dirt floor, windows with no glass, and a rug hanging over the entryway. There was no furniture in the house. His family had no shoes.</p>

He told me that they had sold everything they had to buy bus tickets to the Mesa temple, where they were sealed for time and all eternity. Many of the branch members had done the same thing.</p>

The Mexico of today is much different from that of 36 years ago. Nealtican is the center of a thriving stake of Zion. Mexico has 200 stakes and a million members of the Church. Many stake and ward leaders are highly educated and financially secure. Thousands of young men and women from Mexico are serving full-time missions.</p>

The Book of Mormon is their inheritance. Jesus Christ did minister unto their fathers.</p>

He stretched forth His hand and said: “Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</p>

We offer the additional light of Jesus Christ as revealed in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.</p>

By so doing, we honor Joseph Smith, who translated the Book of Mormon “by the gift and power of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p12" pid="I0AfUUzzoUK52tiyonbyiA" hash="3qY9jA">When the ancient prophet Moroni appeared to Joseph, he told him “that God had a work for [him] to do; and that [his] name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

The name of Joseph Smith is known and revered throughout the world, even in the remote village of Nealtican, Mexico.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p14" pid="Ne6VqiLqHEOmXCDFLBpbIA" hash="Di45Aw">Recently, a member in Monterrey, Mexico, told me how the Book of Mormon changed his life. As a teenager, Jesús Santos was impressed by the LDS missionaries he saw walking down the dusty streets. He wanted to talk to them about their church but was told by a friend that you have to wait for them to contact you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p15" pid="bsHMP28KdkKeq0VVZG5eLw" hash="5eIwzQ">Many times he would go to the Church building and look through the iron fence at the missionaries and the Mutual youth playing games. They seemed to be so wholesome, and he wanted to be part of them. He would lean his chin on the fence, hoping that they would notice him and invite him to participate with them. It never happened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p16" pid="COUnbXpn_kStwWd700r7Vg" hash="r3YLzw">As Jesús recounted his story to me, he said, “It is sad. I was a young man and could have served a full-time mission.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p17" pid="ZxzHYzigEkGnOLPWiOoZzQ" hash="Js4-jw">He moved to Monterrey, Mexico. <span class="emphasis">Nine</span> years later he was visiting a friend across town when the missionaries knocked at the door. His friend wanted to send them away. Jesús begged him to let the missionaries talk to them for just two minutes. His friend consented.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p18" pid="8TPJqt3KQU29zXxZ6-JSGg" hash="NK4nLw">The missionaries talked about the Book of Mormon, how Lehi’s family traveled from Jerusalem to the Americas, and how the resurrected Jesus Christ visited Lehi’s descendants in America.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p19" pid="yI7-lSDWWU-fg8l9kzL0mQ" hash="7j2ueQ">Jesús wanted to know more. He was especially intrigued by the picture depicting Christ’s appearance in America. He gave the missionaries his address. He waited for months, but they never made contact with him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p20" pid="t7vmAet2E0Cz0YUeC3E5aA" hash="pUPdYA">
        <span class="emphasis">Three</span> more years passed. Some friends invited his family to a family home evening. They gave him a copy of the Book of Mormon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p21" pid="XvXnnYY4iUKO3bZ9MUsqMg" hash="EK7XtA">As soon as he began to read it, he knew the Book of Mormon was true. Finally, 12 years after he first became aware of the Church, he and his wife were baptized. So many years had been lost. If missionaries had just talked to him, if the Mutual youth had just noticed a lonely teenager looking over the fence, if the missionaries in Monterrey had found him at home, his life would have been different during those 12 years. Gratefully, member neighbors invited him for a family home evening and shared with him that book which has such great converting power, the Book of Mormon.</p>

At the time of His appearance in America, He told the people, “And when these things come to pass that thy <span class="emphasis">seed</span> shall begin to <span class="emphasis">know</span> these things—it shall be a <span class="emphasis">sign</span> unto them, that they may <span class="emphasis">know</span> that the work of the Father hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of the <span class="emphasis">covenant</span> which he hath made unto the people who are of the <span class="emphasis">house of Israel.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p24" pid="mx7hjAyC40-dqvYL-iamcQ" hash="gxK8xA">The Book of Mormon is <span class="emphasis">its own witness</span> to the people of Latin America and of all nations. Its very coming forth in these latter days bears witness that God has once again begun to <span class="emphasis">gather scattered Israel.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p25" pid="8vnh5Z8kA0i8tHmTymCw5g" hash="bf3KVg">In my mind’s eye, I can still see Jesús Santos as a ragged 18-year-old boy looking over the fence at the chapel. Can you see him? Can you invite him and others like him to be one with us? Whom do you know that would respond to your invitation to read the Book of Mormon? Will you invite them? Don’t wait.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/the-book-of-mormon-the-instrument-to-gather-scattered-israel.p26" pid="jfrp6iSh-kSVAFiPztLVSg" hash="QlN0gw">I testify that Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration. The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is the means whereby people from all nations shall be gathered into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This Church is founded upon apostles and prophets, just as it was in ancient days. President Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord’s anointed prophet on the earth today. Jesus Christ is our Savior and our Redeemer. This is His Church and His kingdom. He is our King Immanuel. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

He said that my younger brother had died that morning in his sleep. I was heartbroken. He was only 51 years old. As I thought about him, I felt impressed to share with you some events from his life. I do so with permission.</p>

After serving an honorable mission, he married his sweetheart in the temple. They were blessed with a son and a daughter. His future was full of promise.</p>

He continued his self-destructive behavior for more than a decade, but the Savior had not forgotten or abandoned him. Eventually the pain of his despair allowed a spirit of humility to enter his soul. His feelings of anger, rebellion, and militancy began to dissipate. Like the prodigal son, “he came to himself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> He began to reach out to the Savior and to make his way back home and to faithful parents who never gave up on him.</p>

The previous Friday evening he and his wife attended the temple. On Sunday morning, the day before he died, he taught the priesthood lesson in his high priests group. He went to bed that evening, never to awaken again in this life―but to come forth in the resurrection of the just.</p>
