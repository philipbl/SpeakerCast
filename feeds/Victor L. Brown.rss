I pray that my remarks will be in harmony with the Spirit of the Lord. With his help I will attempt to explore with you some of the responsibilities we priesthood holders have by virtue of the fact that we have been ordained by proper authority to act officially in the name of God. This applies to twelve-year-old deacons as well as to high priests.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p2" guid="3a81d1fa-0801-4e11-b8e1-f79878ba4db0" pid="DUwHvfN4WUaCOvnCoODmCA" hash="T3UG3Q">First, we should understand who we are. Before we were born, our spirits dwelt in heaven with our Heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, who is our elder brother. We were faithful to him during that period of our existence. Had we not been faithful, we would have followed Satan as did one-third of the hosts of heaven. This would have prevented our coming to this earth as mortal beings, which was necessary if we were ultimately to attain eternal life and return to the presence of our Heavenly Father. We were faithful, and we are here in mortality with all the potentiality of exaltation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p3" guid="47d59a3f-3677-4bcd-823f-7432b9a979b0" pid="Nn87h9EMtUiiFsQafDcdTg" hash="ccd_xQ">One of the basic principles upon which his plan was based was free agency. We had our free agency in heaven and made the right choices. As mortal beings now, we also have our free agency. We may choose whom we will follow, either Satan or the Savior. “Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves—to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.23" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 10:23</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p4" guid="67b2c451-b9f2-4d4b-967e-1a48e479dd67" pid="-XoWgASA0Euq0Z2jSyAj8g" hash="aO_YVA">Our mortal environment and its influences upon us may be somewhat different from those of our premortal existence. Nevertheless, there were positive and negative influences in the spirit world. If it were not so, why would one-third of our spiritual brothers and sisters have followed Satan into captivity? The alternatives available to us in this life are the same as they were before. It is either Jesus Christ and eternal life or Satan and bondage. Here is what we find in the scriptures regarding this subject:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p5" guid="30f70fc8-6e4d-41aa-a8a3-f3f34920726d" pid="UlGa3ShXQEiw-ALMdYUZDA" hash="UaU2GQ">“… they who keep their first estate [which includes all of us] shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate [those who followed Satan] shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate [this life] shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.26" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:26</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p6" guid="ee1a6cd7-df5a-4c16-ad4a-6785fe1bff31" pid="RD13cY3GVkCMsFBLD_8ruQ" hash="P-qFrQ">Being sons of God, we were created in his image. In other words, our physical appearance is similar to his, just as it is to our earthly father. Recognizing, then, that we are literally spiritual sons of our Father in heaven—“… And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men … for in heaven created I them” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.5" class="scriptureRef">Moses 3:5</a>)—and recognizing that we are created in his image, that this human form of flesh and bone is the tabernacle for our spirits in this mortal life, that we had the wisdom to make proper choices in the life before this, and further that we who are present in this priesthood meeting have the authority to act in his name and officiate in his holy ordinances here among men—recognizing all of this, it should not be difficult to catch the vision of the responsibilities associated with such blessings, responsibilities far and beyond those held by those who do not hold the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p7" guid="34ea955d-99f1-41e2-9fee-40814b89b5fc" pid="lypXrlpPfUu1H9tndxvCiA" hash="0ELAhA">Let us consider just a few of these responsibilities. In the scriptures we read, “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.27" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:27</a>.) The Lord defined some very basic differences between men and women. He gave the male what we call masculine traits and the female feminine traits. He did not intend either of the sexes to adopt the other’s traits but, rather, that men should look and act like men and that women should look and act like women. When these differences are ignored, an unwholesome relationship develops, which, if not checked, can lead to the reprehensible, tragic sin of homosexuality. In other words, we have a responsibility as priesthood bearers to be examples of true manhood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p8" guid="23beb353-f085-4853-8356-5040d687834d" pid="Splbw0ZZtUm5FLx1bcLtVA" hash="3_3KhQ">The Lord commanded men and women to multiply and replenish the earth. “And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.28" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:28</a>.) To insure that this would take place, he gave to each a powerful emotion which causes a male and female to be attracted to each other. To man he gave a mind with which to reason so that he might have dominion over “every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” With this mind he also expects man to have dominion over himself. He expects man to exercise control over his sexual drives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p9" guid="d7451f6c-61a2-4638-aa84-252d98acd1b6" pid="_iZFlg2iUUyCwmPkCDTOAg" hash="eztc_A">Sexual activity is to be indulged in only within the bonds of marriage. When this is the case, it is one of the most rewarding and satisfying experiences man can have. When this is not the case, the same experience becomes base and evil. Notwithstanding the attitude of much of the world toward sexual permissiveness, the Lord has never changed his commandment in this regard. He said, “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.14" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p10" guid="d0c581ec-7c1a-45ed-995a-efa373500f17" pid="gjH51aRz5kuwb-eUNXo6ZA" hash="FKnjKA">Infidelity and promiscuous sex activity destroy the basic, vital institution of the family, which in turn destroys all that is good in life. If we as priesthood holders are to bring honor to that priesthood, we will refrain from any sexual activity outside the bonds of matrimony. Otherwise, we bring disgrace to ourselves and to the priesthood we bear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p11" guid="9b475943-36a2-4a17-93b6-50438782b2fa" pid="kgizG7euE0OZl91iWAhMvQ" hash="z6hn-Q">Acknowledging the fact that this mortal body is the tabernacle of the spirit and that the spirit was fathered by our Father in heaven, it behooves us to show respect for our bodies by not abusing them through the use of harmful and destructive substances. Here again, one who holds the priesthood has a responsibility far greater than one who does not, a responsibility to abstain completely from the use of such things as alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p12" guid="47364b4e-6b2c-4b43-8663-a6a1bc768349" pid="YyGQo80JOUyLakdSCOhg_A" hash="7X_1XQ">We have been discussing matters which may be classed primarily as moral. Morality, however, is not limited to the question of sex or drugs. It is much broader in its scope. I should like now to branch into another phase of morality. Three statements by President David O. McKay very forcefully introduce this vitally important moral principle:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p13" guid="2f83f57e-acc3-4882-a821-0f9ceaa7da3e" pid="tzbuiPmsVUKDz0-vRuh2lA" hash="hNmghg">“Honesty and sincerity are the basic virtues of a noble character.” (“We Believe,” <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era, </span>September 1963, p. 803.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p14" guid="58d6c1ab-8be1-4529-929b-0a34c20b92b7" pid="2Py3vfNCTEaYjTu550Ybsg" hash="xAWWww">“Honesty … is the first virtue mentioned in the Thirteenth Article of Faith. It is founded on the first principles of human society and is the foundation principle of moral manhood.” (<span class="emphasis">Treasures of Life </span>[Deseret Book Co., 1965], p. 455.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p15" guid="33054c3d-1ce2-44f7-bcca-d5978e3aca3b" pid="nFSS4Vchb0CSF-MHKPMQQw" hash="BVLcRA">“It is impossible to associate manhood with dishonesty. To be just with one’s self, one must be honest with one’s self and with others. This means honesty in speech as well as in actions. It means to avoid telling half-truths as well as untruths. It means that we are honest in our dealings—in our buying as well as in our selling. It means that an honest debt can never be outlawed, and that a man’s word is better than his bond. It means that we will be honest in our dealings with the Lord, for ‘true honesty takes into account the claims of God as well as those of man; it renders to God the things that are God’s, as well as to man the things that are man’s.’” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report, </span>April 1968, pp. 7–8.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p16" guid="883240bf-07d8-4abd-af04-8da31eced839" pid="EzRiX469KEakDEIJdDAc-w" hash="tnLLUQ">Some time ago I had occasion to visit with a man from New York City. He has been in the field of finance for many years. His associates are nationwide. During the course of our conversation, he made a remark that has given me much food for thought. He said: “Over the years, I have had dealings with many Mormons. I have yet to run into a dishonest one.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p17" guid="6ea339dd-0ca5-4bde-92da-c1fbc2494519" pid="PFbR40xIVUuPTIJlM5LSPQ" hash="Qk8ghg">I countered by saying, “If a Mormon truly lives his religion, he must be honest.” However, I indicated that I was afraid there were some who did not live their religion fully, whereupon he replied, “I hope I never have the shattering experience of meeting a dishonest Mormon.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p18" guid="aed47dad-4d74-429b-b1e8-a1c5bbb43c6b" pid="hHGbIsaVW0ubOQ3tAxdDlg" hash="KNBrfg">I had almost forgotten this conversation until the other day when I visited with another financier from New York City. We were discussing a rather negative article published recently about Salt Lake City and the Mormons and some of the feelings against the Church in earlier years. He said, “That may have been true in the past, but now it is a point of distinction to be known as a Mormon,” inferring that being a member of the Church is now considered worthy of great respect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p19" guid="681f404b-59ff-4ace-b8da-022622d58e82" pid="qwXrzKJ3Y0STnARKLsDimw" hash="UY1m9w">Within the next three or four months, over four hundred young men holding the office of priest in the Aaronic Priesthood will be going to Hawaii for employment in the pineapple fields. I am quite sure none of them solicited this job. How, then, did they obtain it? Last year some of our young men found employment with this same firm. Their conduct and performance were so outstanding, the company this year wants four hundred of the same kind. I hope these four hundred young men are present in this priesthood meeting. Each one carries the reputation of the holy priesthood on his shoulders. If they honor their priesthood, they will be honest in all their dealings. They will be men of integrity, totally dependable. If they do this, they will bring honor to themselves, their families, their church, and their God. Certainly their Father in heaven will be proud to acknowledge them as his sons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p20" guid="0dc738eb-1295-4a28-923a-c46b4fcc9156" pid="Nzm2iPcC1EG3MAVs3lhKaQ" hash="JnQFdw">I am told that currently recruiters for major national corporations rank the Master of Business Administration graduates from the Brigham Young University with those from the top four or five business schools in the nation, not because of their academic prowess alone but because of the kind of men they are, men of honesty and integrity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p21" guid="39f34945-3548-4e90-ba0e-0a3d75d1e4bc" pid="SZtFO5Yae0invKGaT1h63w" hash="9tbMzw">You may ask what all of this has to do with the responsibility of a priesthood holder. My answer is, Everything. The Lord has said, “He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/101.7" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 101:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p22" guid="a5ff7cfd-d830-41b6-b14d-9521d5de5d92" pid="z0Et89qW9UK-2ZkmI45hvQ" hash="86BjHQ">Alma, speaking of the people of Ammon, said, “And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the people who were of the church of God. And they were also distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/27.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 27:27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p23" guid="ec694968-0ca4-4d85-b103-86cb80676551" pid="GUQDQlWxtECElA2D7YHw-g" hash="3ytHQQ">The dictionary says integrity implies trustworthiness and incorruptibility to a degree that one is incapable of being false to trust, responsibility, or pledge. Honesty implies a refusal to lie, steal, or deceive in any way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p24" guid="935fe8a2-6a62-4ed1-a7eb-1eb1eae6e0f1" pid="0_LYQ45O7USEtScuft6RfA" hash="Du4R8g">President Joseph F. Smith, in writings to the membership of the Church, summarizes the message I have tried to give tonight:</p>

They ought not only to be qualified to preach the truth, to bear testimony of the truth, but ought to live so that the very life they live, the very words they speak, their every action in life will be a sermon to the unwary and to the ignorant, teaching them goodness, purity, uprightness, faith in God and love for the human family.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p26" guid="644c4017-2aa5-4d8f-8f73-b1115dfe9ee5" pid="GV-qOCSA1EaLRHWesqQ68A" hash="fpK13w">“Let every man’s life be so that his character will bear the closest inspection, and that it may be seen as an open book, so that he will have nothing to shrink from or be ashamed of. Let all men who are elevated to positions of trust in the Church live so that no man can point to their faults, because they will have no faults; so that no man can justly accuse them of wrongdoing, because they do no wrong; that no man can point out their defects as ‘human’ and as ‘weak mortals,’ because they are living up to the principles of the gospel, and are not merely ‘weak human creatures,’ devoid of the Spirit of God and the power to live above sin. That is the way for all men to live in the kingdom of God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p27" guid="72fb518a-2b61-46b5-a25c-b329f79321a9" pid="5pXeTSQ6HkKZlZor4MbCXQ" hash="swltEg">“The first and highest standard of correct living is to be found in that individual responsibility which keeps men good for the truth’s sake. It is not difficult for men who are true to themselves to be true to others. Men who honor God in their private lives do not need the restraint of public opinion which may not only be indifferent, but positively wrong.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-meaning-of-morality.p28" guid="09a8214e-4fed-4d38-afa3-0e4f98391634" pid="RK83vIMtC0mbxz9o_PuQVg" hash="4PdLfQ">“No member in good standing in the Church will be drunken or riotous or profane or will take advantage of his brother or his neighbor, or will violate the principles of virtue and honor and righteousness.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine </span>[Deseret Book Co., 1968], pp. 251–53.)</p>

We are his emissaries in the world. He has shown unbounded love for us through the blessing of the priesthood and through having given his life that we might have eternal life. In return for all of these blessings, he has said, “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.15" class="scriptureRef">John 14:15</a>.) That we may do this more perfectly each day I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

May I share it with you? In June of this year I was invited to attend a graduation exercise conducted by the LDS Institute of Religion and Church Social Services Department held at the Utah State Prison. Seventeen men received certificates of award: nine received their first-year certificates, five their second-year, and three their third. Twenty-four others had participated in religion classes but did not quite qualify for certificates.</p>

All of the others were inmates. Many of them were not members of the Church.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p5" guid="b59e7ad9-be41-4662-a997-78e3a10ca63a" pid="SSTNFLVDR0SC_qb2fSsBEg" hash="GHPQ-g">Men dressed in prison uniforms offered humble, sincere prayers to God, expressing gratitude for their blessings and for the knowledge they now have of his gospel. Several stood at the pulpit and testified that they know God lives, and expressed gratitude for his goodness to them. May I tell you of just two of these men—men whose lives were seriously out of step with society; men with internal, personal problems that really are not much different from those of many who have never been in prison. I shall not identify them by their real names.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p6" guid="bd54cfe2-759f-4e83-a51d-670652d524b6" pid="3DERn0wxd0SLbnP6GzqWjQ" hash="uaErOQ">The first one we will call Jim. Jim comes from a distant state. He is a fine-looking, clean-cut young man not quite thirty years old. He was one of those who opposed the establishment and society in general. He came from a broken home. He had experienced no love in his life. He left home at age seventeen and joined the army. After release from the military, he wandered about the country without goal or purpose in life, finally finding himself in Salt Lake City. He was involved in a theft, arrested, convicted, and sent to prison. He escaped one day, was recaptured, and was placed in maximum security. In his words, “I came out of maximum security and returned to medium, and still did not know what to do with my life.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p7" guid="699fb68d-44ee-40b0-b129-e456760f007b" pid="nY9ae2XGr0aruN8AkJv8YA" hash="w-tFbA">One of the prisoners, knowing of some of the turmoil Jim was going through, sent him to see the LDS chaplain. This was the beginning of a completely new experience in Jim’s life. Even though he found himself in prison, he had taken the first step to a freedom he had not known existed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p8" guid="4095fced-c239-4006-995e-6006b405ed3b" pid="a5tNsePJ_kS8mWMFOBS1_w" hash="G-BWUQ">After a few weeks of exposure to the program of the Church specially designed for prison life, he said he was able to give up smoking. He became involved in the various religious programs sponsored by the Church social service agency. He said, “I haven’t smoked a cigarette since that day. I haven’t had a cup of coffee since December of last year.” He goes on to tell of the good feeling of accomplishment in overcoming bad personal habits.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p9" guid="96cfe208-efd2-4973-a00f-b5c0aede46cd" pid="XEwKKo0XB0muvSRrZErSqA" hash="QhJaKQ">He also tells about the family home evening program conducted by his home teachers. He explained that he would have given up in discouragement many times had it not been for this wonderful couple who had been assigned as his home teachers. He said they actually loved him as a son, something he had never experienced in his life, even as a little boy. In his own words: “I have been in this program since June 16, 1970. For these sixteen months, I probably made more changes in my life—inside these walls away from the rat race of society—that I know are going to determine my whole future more than the first twenty-three years of my life before prison. I had no idea at all what the LDS people were or what the Church was until I went to prison.</p>

I am proud of being a graduate of the program that the LDS people have offered to the inmates at the prison.”</p>

His goal now is to finish paying his debt to society in order to be released from prison so that he might prepare for baptism and membership in the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p12" guid="9d3b6b97-8e9b-42e6-a4df-4a0f8aa12a57" pid="E9UD1G8KCEuWNEO1FeYNRg" hash="RO1PqA">And now about Ed. Ed also comes from a distant city. Ed started stealing when he was nine. He was arrested for auto theft at age thirteen, later convicted of grand larceny, and sent to prison in another state. He came to Utah, was arrested for and convicted of grand larceny again, and was sent to the Utah State Prison.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p13" guid="69249872-c243-4064-b58c-6c6d450f7a9c" pid="SwIC8w75EkKpOgbBgxTmbA" hash="Ip-8Kg">Ed became acquainted with the Church social services program conducted in the prison in much the same way as Jim. Once when Ed was on his way to one of the Church meetings, some of the prisoners ridiculed him, as only hardened convicts could. He responded that when he was on the outside he had acted as they did. Now he wanted to change and no one was going to stop him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p14" guid="c5cc2117-e6d6-43f0-92cd-4be0c64bb655" pid="BPNOXV8_IU6fqRYD0g_7pg" hash="C3eV_Q">Ed had some particularly wonderful home teachers who occasionally brought their own children to the prison to have family home evening with him. The children consider Ed as an older brother. He considers himself a member of their family. Ed was one of those who had been released from prison and had returned to receive his certificate at the graduation exercises. He was invited to speak at the service.</p>

Holding it up to the audience, he said: “You probably can’t read this, but this is the most important document in my life. This is my baptismal recommend that will permit me to be baptized next Thursday.” Ed was baptized. After his confirmation, he walked over to a corner of the room where he could be alone and wept. He wept even more when he was ordained a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p16" guid="3982e557-3307-49cb-b85f-2d4fae98499b" pid="u_B0twqY0kmcVdfz-LpuMQ" hash="9U80rg">What conclusions can we draw from this? Certainly these young men were faced with serious problems. Yes, they had lost their physical freedom by being confined in jail, but this was not the basic problem. Even more serious was the lack of purpose in their lives. They had no place to go. They were lost. Life had no meaning. They had no idea why they were here on earth or where they were going.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p17" guid="6e7cf20f-326a-493c-9b13-9547e5c4a8d0" pid="kaZMUCYiAUCFiSyiRnW4sA" hash="51a7nw">Release from the prison would not begin to solve their most urgent problems; and yet, in the environment of prison, they found the release that could ultimately make them truly free men. They found their Savior, Jesus Christ, and his gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p18" guid="690882da-505e-484a-bc9f-bca18d94de3c" pid="h9zb1zqCtE21qhHq8_bU0g" hash="sUhEcg">There are many who find themselves in circumstances similar to those of Jim and Ed—not necessarily confined to a correctional institution, but nevertheless in prison, a prison from which legal authorities cannot release them, a prison of personal habits such as alcohol, drugs, immorality, selfishness, dishonesty, laziness, aimlessness; yes, these can be more confining and damning than any state prison. Yet there is a way to escape to a freedom that surpasses anything designed by man—the kind of freedom Jim and Ed have found.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/i-was-in-prison-and-ye-came-unto-me.p19" guid="b38f86ab-9090-40db-8769-4684f3ba9795" pid="qfxIgxE7IEuL3JDNHlfb7A" hash="ssZv4A">This freedom can only be found by accepting the divine plan and keeping the commandments of him who gave his life for each of us that we might find eternal life—even Jesus Christ. For did he not say: “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free”? (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.32" class="scriptureRef">John 8:32</a>.) In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

I had difficulty replying. Being shocked was an understatement. I might say that the aftershocks have been much more severe than the original. Notwithstanding this, I have faith and look forward with great anticipation and enthusiasm to the future.</p>

I know that his Son, Jesus Christ, the Savior of mankind, is the head of this church and that he is actively directing the affairs of this, his church today, through his prophet, President Joseph Fielding Smith, who has just borne witness in such a powerful way of his calling and also of mine.</p>

If I did not know these things to be true, I would not have the courage nor the temerity to accept such a call. Even knowing this, it is frightening to contemplate assuming such a sacred trust.</p>

Vandenberg, have been wonderful indeed. I have been associated with him as a member of my stake presidency when I served as bishop of the Denver Fourth Ward, as a fellow counselor in the Denver Stake presidency, and now for more than ten years as one of his counselors in the Presiding Bishopric. I want him and you to know that I love and appreciate him. He is a man of great ability. I am deeply grateful for having had the privilege of being his counselor.</p>

It is a preparatory priesthood preparing its holders for the greater or Melchizedek Priesthood.

There are tens of thousands of wonderful adult male members of the Church who hold the Aaronic Priesthood or who have not been ordained whose spiritual welfare has now been assigned to the elders quorum presidencies of the Church. This program is, and will become even more so, a great blessing to these brethren.</p>

Next was the example of my deacons quorum adviser, who was also my Scoutmaster. Brother Ben Wood was the epitome of what leaders of boys should be. Every boy under his leadership felt his great love. His influence was not limited to Sunday morning or Tuesday evening; it was felt all through the week. I shall ever be grateful to my deacons adviser for the lessons of life he taught me as a twelve-year-old deacon, lessons that have helped me from that day until now.</p>

As we approached the humble, one-room chapel with no air-conditioning, I suggested it might be appropriate to leave our jackets off. President Peters was quick to tell me that they wore jackets in sacrament meeting in their stake—no matter what the temperature—as a means of showing the Lord that they not only worshiped him but they also honored and respected him by being dressed in their very best.</p>

It was a sacred duty. They felt that their appearance helped show the respect and reverence they had for the Lord. I shall never forget their influence of reverence in that meeting. Surely their understanding of their relationship with Heavenly Father is an important step in magnifying their priesthood.</p>

These were the finals in a mission-wide contest held under the direction of President Wayne Beck. Sitting on the stand, acting as judges, were the district counselors. Gathered in small groups through the chapel were the contestants. As they were called up before the judges, they were challenged to repeat from memory scriptures selected at random by the judges and then to explain the meaning of each scripture.</p>

May I introduce the first group to you. They are known as health missionaries, doctors and nurses who have responded to the same missionary call as have the thousands of proselyting missionaries, not only receiving not one cent of compensation, but paying their own expenses. In each case, they labor under the direction of the mission president.</p>

After the flipchart lesson, we played a game with them. They were asked to place foods in the groups where they belonged. Then we gave them a plate and asked them to prepare us a meal, either breakfast, lunch, or dinner, using foods from the basic three. This same health lesson has been given to investigator families as well as member families.”</p>

Malnutrition, complicated by respiratory infection and diarrhea, is the underlying cause.</p>

Through working with the Relief Society, we can develop the health program more. The ladies can depend on each other for help. We give them health concepts; then they can teach their families, sisters in the Church, and their neighbors. We know the health program will work through these organizations as planned. Too, we hope to work with families through the family home evening program.”</p>

We have indicated to them that each family should keep a certain quantity of various foods growing, and as these are used, they should be replaced. We are also encouraging them to try growing their own vegetables, and as a demonstration, we plant a small garden plot at each conference with tomatoes, cabbage, etc., and leave it for the branch to keep up. Extra plants are given to members who are interested in raising their own.”</p>

This young lady came from a good, active Mormon family. The lines of communication had broken down between parents and daughter. She was in serious trouble from a pregnancy and was on the verge of compounding the problem in such a way as to further jeopardize any possibility of a happy, successful life when one of the dedicated staff workers became involved. Through extra effort and wise counseling, he was instrumental in saving her from falling off the precipice. He helped open the channel of communication between mother and daughter, and now, a few years later, this same young woman, through repentance and forgiveness and wise counsel, is happily married to a fine husband and is doing her part to help her neighbors. Instead of failure, she is now experiencing joy and peace of mind through living a worthwhile, fulfilling life.</p>

They hold a regular home evening attended by the home teacher’s family, the prisoner’s family, and the inmate. The example of love shown by the home teaching family, along with the evidence of sincere interest, has performed miracles in the lives of many of these men.</p>

Over 4,000 families have opened their homes to Indian students. Because these families give freely, this service carries with it that most important ingredient of a home—love.</p>

They are largely concerned with the temporal or the financial welfare. This is a large group of dedicated men and women. You might say this group is composed of all the members of the Church who participate in any way in the welfare services program.</p>

It took him at least fifteen minutes to tell the supervisors who he was and where he came from. Although he was a young man of eighteen years, he had great difficulty expressing himself. Part of his young life had been spent in an institution in a neighboring state. Now at the age of eighteen he was on his own.</p>

Soon he had a bishop, and he gradually became active in the Church. Fellow workers at Welfare Square helped him to learn to speak so that he could communicate. He still has great difficulty, but his friends and associates can, with a little patience, converse with him reasonably well. He worked in several different jobs at the storehouse, and today he is an active elder in the Church. Roger now has a job in a large commercial enterprise and at the present time is totally self-sufficient.</p>

She was badly crippled, but she had been able to attend school and had recently graduated from high school. This was a tremendous accomplishment; but now, after several months of searching, her family had found it impossible to obtain employment for her. Her bishop asked if there was something Janey could do. She needed to keep busy. In answer to this challenge, the storehousekeeper suggested that Janey be brought to the storehouse the next morning.</p>

Janey was smiling with pride. She had labeled a dozen cans. There was a pile of spoiled labels on the floor, but they weren’t important. The important thing was her smile. It was there because she felt useful and had pride in her accomplishment. She was willing and anxious to return the next day and continue trying.</p>

She hardly wasted any labels. As her skill in using her hands increased, she was given greater challenges. At the end of three years she was assigned the delicate job of packing eggs after they had been candled.</p>

The wonderful sisters of the Relief Society donated in excess of two million hours in aiding the ill and the aged. They gave compassionate service to 15,000 families at the time of losing a loved one in death. Members of the Church contributed almost two million hours to welfare projects, bishops storehouses, etc., and the Church dispersed over 17 million dollars in cash and commodities, to take care of those in need.</p>

This was accomplished through the regularly constituted ecclesiastical organization of the Church. There is no separate organization to manage welfare. It is an integral part of the Church and has been from the beginning. To re-emphasize its purpose and objective, I shall read a statement of the First Presidency given in 1936:</p>

The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership.” (Heber J. Grant, <span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> October 1936, p. 3.)</p>

A generation raised in idleness cannot maintain its integrity.” (Richard L. Evans, “Faith, Work, and Security,” <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> December 1936, p. 768.)</p>

Bowen, <span class="emphasis">The Church Welfare Plan </span>[Gospel Doctrine Course of Study, 1936], p. 44.)</p>

I am grateful to be with you tonight and to participate in this priesthood meeting.</p>

This decision by the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve will have great impact on the lives of the members of the Church in years to come. President Lee referred to it as potentially one of the most significant changes in the Church in our lifetime. Having been involved in the development of the plan, I can testify to you that it came through inspiration from the Lord.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/the-aaronic-priesthood-mia.p3" guid="5b9a9104-506d-4e57-a1bc-143fb0db05e7" pid="4T0E4yNgDk6eI2uZydw7ig" hash="px1Bjw">In great measure it fulfills the prophecy of President Joseph F. Smith, who said, “We expect to see the day, if we live long enough (and if some of us don’t live long enough to see it, there are others who will), when every council of the Priesthood in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will understand its duty, will assume its own responsibility, … to the uttermost, according to the intelligence and ability possessed by it. When that day shall come, there will not be so much necessity for work that is now being done by the auxiliary organizations, because it will be done by the regular quorums of the Priesthood. The Lord designed and comprehended it from the beginning, and He has made provision in the Church whereby every need may be met and satisfied through the regular organizations of the Priesthood.” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report, </span>April 1906, p. 3.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/the-aaronic-priesthood-mia.p4" guid="39c8439e-1272-436c-9309-bf5cf896e064" pid="JV_dR9mQfE6EycW0anmGdA" hash="RnMbTA">In the Lord’s eyes the basic responsibility for our young people first rests jointly with parents and with the youth themselves. The Church and its organizations exist to aid parents in their sacred callings. It is in this light that we discuss the Aaronic Priesthood MIA this evening. With this change in organization, the Presiding Bishopric as the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood, assisted by the Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Men’s and Young Women’s presidencies and boards, became responsible on the general level for supporting the parents of youth ages 12 to 18. The MIA under this reorganization becomes part of the priesthood and is no longer an auxiliary.</p>

It is my great honor and privilege now to introduce this change, as far as the Aaronic Priesthood MIA is concerned, to the stakes, missions, wards, and branches of the Church. What I shall tell you now has the approval and support of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and all of the General Authorities.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/the-aaronic-priesthood-mia.p6" guid="95428b2f-2c42-44c2-b36a-db72f4268cb3" pid="0YZxHSLbMU-jDpTNdjPA7Q" hash="NeJIcw">Let us begin with the ward organization. The bishopric is the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood. This now means the total priesthood responsibility for Aaronic Priesthood MIA in the ward. The bishopric is directly responsible for all young men and women between the ages of 12 and 18. The bishop is president of the priests quorum and responsible for all priest-age boys and Laurel-age girls. One counselor is responsible for all teacher-age boys and Mia Maid-age girls; the other counselor, for the deacon-age boys and Beehive-age girls.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/the-aaronic-priesthood-mia.p7" guid="601c5ba2-fd29-4152-8570-f6f5e8639bd1" pid="Pvt5pH8Q1EOg8Kf1eqLabQ" hash="nHoYYg">The bishopric will call and set apart four adult male leaders. One will be the president of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Men. He will coordinate all activities of the adult youth leaders in the above three age groups under the direction of the bishopric. He will in large measure assume the responsibilities formerly held by the general secretary-Aaronic Priesthood youth. The other three will be advisers to these specific age groups and will be responsible for all their activities and functions. For instance, the deacons’ adviser will teach the deacons quorum in priesthood meeting, be the Scoutmaster, and be involved in the activities of all the 12-through 13-year-old boys. The other two advisers will have the same responsibilities for their age groups.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/the-aaronic-priesthood-mia.p8" guid="cc823e2c-f1a5-42c0-bf61-727709f0e24b" pid="gkc0mPsnz0GlpyS28VG4iw" hash="dQHaKA">The bishopric will likewise call four adult women leaders. One will be set apart as the president of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Women. The other three will be set apart as advisers to the three age groups, namely, Laurels, Mia Maids, and Beehive girls, just as their counterparts are the advisers to the young men. The Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Women’s president will then coordinate all activities for the young women under the direct supervision of the bishopric, as does her counterpart for the young men.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/the-aaronic-priesthood-mia.p9" guid="1fa2e0fd-b08a-412a-80a8-313a65fb8c32" pid="0xAFiiU5UkKT4fnq5ufiRQ" hash="imTfoQ">A service and activity committee composed of not more than three men and/or women will be called to function under the direction of both presidents to provide leadership in these areas with special emphasis on service. There is a great desire in the hearts of our young people to be of service to their fellowmen—service such as helping a widow with her yard, taking a family home evening program to an elderly shut-in, helping the poor, the sick, the handicapped, or those who are in emotional distress. This limited committee will also be responsible for the activity projects, such as dance, drama, sports, athletics, etc. These leaders will not be known as drama director, dance director, etc., but will function on a broad base.</p>

The committee will have available to them specialists in various areas of activity on a temporary basis. They may be adults or youth. For instance, a drama night will be directed by a member of the activity committee assisted by a specialist whom the bishop calls for that special project only.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/the-aaronic-priesthood-mia.p11" guid="4803759f-1f70-43f8-8f5a-91718badb6cd" pid="TRlH-R8skEWuE5RMgiNcjw" hash="xkvIdg">The two presidents of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA will each have a secretary to complete the ward organization.</p>

Young quorum and class presidencies have much to offer if helped to learn and allowed to perform in their callings. It is of the utmost urgency that every bishop in the Church organize his bishop’s youth committee and help them to function effectively in this new organization. Their involvement and contribution are of great importance to this realignment of responsibilities.</p>

This responsibility is in partnership with parents, and it is essential that the energy and talent of youth themselves be used.</p>

The stake presidency is the presidency of the Melchizedek and Aaronic priesthoods of the stake. One member of the stake presidency will be appointed chairman of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA of the stake. He will supervise matters involving the youth between 12 and 18 in the stake under the overall direction of the stake presidency.</p>

One will be designated as the adviser to the Aaronic Priesthood MIA of the stake. This includes young men and young women. There are no Aaronic Priesthood MIA presidents on the stake level. This high councilor will see that the entire youth program of the stake functions properly, of course, reporting to the chairman. A second high councilor adviser will be responsible for the young men of priest age, another of teacher age, and the third of deacon age. They will also work with the advisers of the young women of the same age group.</p>

One will be set apart as the adviser to the Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Women of the stake. Another will be the adviser to Laurel-age girls, another to the Mia Maid-age girls, and the fourth the Beehive-age girls. To assist these leaders, there will be an assistant stake clerk for the young men and a young women’s secretary.</p>

Again, they will not be known as dance or drama directors, etc. They will function under the supervision of the advisers to the Aaronic Priesthood MIA. As needed, they will have specialists available to them on a temporary basis to perform a stake service or activity for a single project. These may be adults or youth. A stake youth committee will be formed as needed to further involve the young people themselves.</p>

If it seems appropriate to have regional activities, the service will be provided through temporary appointments from the Quorum of the Twelve or, in the case of athletics, through the Melchizedek Priesthood MIA regional organization.</p>

Sufficient information will come through the mail for this to be accomplished. Stake leaders will then train ward officers so that the entire program on both the stake and ward levels will be functioning by September 1 of this year. Until instructions come after June Conference, the ward organization and program should continue as at present.</p>

In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <link>http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman?lang=eng</link>
      <description>A story is told in the Book of Mormon of 2,000 young men who responded to the call of their country to take up arms in its defense. Their leader’s name was Helaman. They became known as the sons of Helaman. We read of them in the book of Alma.</description>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p6" guid="7768196b-4c87-4526-8f4d-ba014b9a9e4c" pid="W6HaTmWyOEysPDtSLPzkGA" hash="Mfby5A">At the present time, there are wars and rumors of wars. Yet, may I suggest that there is another war currently going on in the world—a war more destructive than any armed conflict—yes, a war between good and evil, between freedom and slavery, between the Savior and Satan. Satan’s legions are many. In their battle to enslave mankind, they use weapons such as selfishness; dishonesty; corruption; sexual impurity, be it adultery, fornication, or homosexuality; pornography; permissiveness; drugs; and many others. I believe Satan’s ultimate goal is to destroy the family, because if he would destroy the family, he will not just have won the battle; he will have won the war.</p>

I firmly believe the youth of today understand clearly, more clearly perhaps than their parents, the importance of the family. Just the other day a young lady said to me, and she was talking of so-called “responsible” parents as well as others, “Why can’t parents realize how important the family is?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p8" guid="901c4dfe-db4b-4cfc-87c4-049beefb3e3b" pid="QFFQdejLPUu1gvVYqVyKvg" hash="x5uX6g">May I emphasize that when I refer to this generation I include girls and boys, for if a generation is to thrive in righteousness, and if family unity is to be preserved, the boys must have the same standards and nobility of character as the girls. There is no double standard in the eyes of God.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p10" guid="54f84bad-0134-45e5-872f-34ec7c1ade57" pid="oJIUPdiv1UG4SlTmzfMpFA" hash="cwrRxg">Take for instance the 12- and 13-year-old deacons who raised money to buy lumber so they could build a doll house for a child in a fatherless home, or the young teenager who was addicted to drugs and sought the help of her Laurel class president, one of her peers. This president, through kindness, encouragement, and the work of other class members, helped this girl to freedom.</p>

Some girls on their own initiative made a quilt for the baby of a blind couple. Another group of young people in one ward were concerned about the elderly and visited them, offering to run errands, etc. In this same ward one elderly couple reported that every time it snowed, some person whom they did not know cleared their driveway.</p>

The deacons quorum president, 13 years old, immediately called a presidency meeting. As a presidency they called on the widow, assuring her that she need not be concerned about completing duties around the home or yard, but could count on all those duties being done.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p13" guid="b32aff75-10cf-4ac4-a7ac-cb02a695ca34" pid="EYIxWGjHKEaYYI6CcBGimg" hash="gkS0Yg">In another case, a 12-year-old nonmember, motherless girl from an unfortunate environment was befriended by her peer group of Beehive girls and was made to feel welcome, wanted, and loved. Their adviser commented, “Many of the girls seemed more concerned about her happiness than about their own.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p14" guid="1cd2e928-a259-4dea-9ae1-7b88280c819b" pid="BoOy7ikFyUu-6gUTycIoxQ" hash="W6JnNg">Another class of teenage girls, upon learning of a physical disability of a neighbor, did her home canning for her. A group of young teenagers spent nine months writing, rehearsing, and preparing a readers theater—the subject by their own choice, “How Do I Know God Really Cares About Me?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p15" guid="b81757d8-eacc-4c52-a0fb-ba64224eca38" pid="43qeoPgnwECjBdpFoAm4OA" hash="Y10NCg">Probably none of these activities would ever make the headlines; however, they are strong evidence that this generation of youth has the character to fight this battle against the forces of Satan.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p16" guid="e413365a-d732-4796-8224-2ca393eb707d" pid="YmurAwrqck-b-r-YO2W8ng" hash="rW-S4w">A few months ago something wonderful happened. The Lord through a prophet gave a revelation pertaining to this generation of youth such as has not been given to any other generation. The foundation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is revelation—ancient and modern. Our message to the world is that God lives; the heavens are open; and he, the Lord, speaks through a living prophet, President Harold B. Lee. It was through this process that the Lord directed that the Aaronic Priesthood MIA organization be established. It was inaugurated in the Church on September 1 of this year. In the short time since then, reports indicate that exciting things are happening in the lives of youth as they begin to understand the significant and important principles involved in this change. These are:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p17" guid="0df380f1-97bd-440e-a07f-66f75b799277" pid="gfhnBjF4Rk6_bnMoCyUU3Q" hash="UQKYyA">First, the programs and activities of youth between the ages of 12 and 18 have now come under the umbrella of the Aaronic Priesthood. In other words, the programs and activities for both boys and girls are now priesthood oriented. They have priesthood leadership which draws them closer than ever before to the very lifeline of the Church.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p18" guid="cadee180-e2dd-403d-b21e-6397b0f261de" pid="Qav8j7o2DkaK64UDC704RQ" hash="D3Ucbw">Second, it means involvement of youth to a degree never before experienced. The youth, with shadow leadership from adults, will plan and execute their own programs and activities.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p19" guid="ce35bf9c-246f-4266-91aa-9a3bc8b2599e" pid="Zh_rz0-AVUiGAMn32bRKow" hash="kRkjhQ">Third, the activities of youth will be service as well as activity oriented. This means personal service to others, not just games and parties.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p20" guid="3fe43a18-97fb-45fd-a3f8-d6625c65a254" pid="yjMWHIqPkUKRpMCyTLdH0w" hash="cc8SPQ">Fourth, the entire effort of the Church is now individual boy and girl oriented—not program oriented. The welfare of the individual is the important factor.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p21" guid="ea092cf5-e103-4761-a898-2e638b358076" pid="siEgGI2ti0K6YwzqsaIm6Q" hash="zw5O0g">Fifth, the Aaronic Priesthood MIA is committed to strengthening the family, recognizing it as the basic unit in society and the most important unit in all eternity.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p22" guid="1c42d544-03b4-480f-8355-d608c18f030b" pid="1L7N72tJWUGsAQ7LheMCLA" hash="iPirDQ">Now I should like to discuss in more detail some of these principles which are vital to the raising up of a generation of righteous, stalwart young men and women in these, the last days.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p23" guid="c946e98c-d8c1-4f78-a82e-ec004177fd08" pid="rTtiANxOGUOziZqXmMrNeA" hash="xgp8Ig">What does it mean to be priesthood oriented? The priesthood is the power to act in the name of God. The young men who hold the priesthood are organized into quorums with a president and two counselors. In the case of the priests, the bishop is president assisted by a group leader. The presidency presides over the other young men of their same age. As a presidency they are concerned with the total well-being of each member of their quorum. If the president has been properly introduced to his responsibility in the quorum, he will know he has been called of God through inspiration. He will know the bishopric prayed about his call beforehand. What stronger motivating force could a young man have than to know he is called of God?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p24" guid="e46fe682-ccca-43cc-8721-583968573fc5" pid="deHzfHdhZEGPcZ_OyXfHYA" hash="nBf2ug">To illustrate, one deacons quorum president, missing one of his quorum members at meeting, called him on the telephone. The boy’s father, an elder, answered the phone. He was negative, not caring about his son’s activity. This deacons quorum president immediately called the elders quorum president and said in effect, “You’ve got a problem, and so have I.” He asked the elders quorum president to please labor with the father as he labored with the son and to report his progress.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p25" guid="7f0df5b8-7527-44d9-82a1-64c91650f163" pid="IDrltw9_fEmo-DmPbDxwPw" hash="Bttc5w">Do we catch the significance of peer leadership as well as the example of a young man being true at all times in whatsoever thing he was entrusted?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p26" guid="eb6cf219-0979-456f-9127-4846236c5d30" pid="BYpEWghOuk-jc6e_bn0Daw" hash="u5HY8w">How about the girls? The bishop calls and appoints the class president of each age group. The president then chooses her counselors who are approved by the bishopric. These class presidencies also receive strength in knowing their callings have been inspired.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p27" guid="70bf66d1-41ba-453f-a68b-56d9ec48082c" pid="EaZEr_IJNkeqrt1s0gaLpg" hash="pHFomQ">A 17-year-old girl, going through the trauma of having only one parent in the home as well as the normal problems of adolescence, was called to be president of her Laurel class. Her response to this responsibility was, “I have never been so excited and thrilled about the Church in my life. I love it with all my heart and love every minute I have the privilege of serving.” Then she made another statement equally impressive. She said, “Since having received this call and having felt the responsibility, I have wanted to purify and refine my life so that I would be worthy of the call.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p28" guid="26fbe109-b145-4aa6-86fa-5bdbee7b810b" pid="TFPI2e5feEyYRcNGmX52Qg" hash="TuDu0Q">And yet another example of a young president. May I quote her adviser: “The other night when I took a few of the girls home after our meeting, the Beehive class president was the last girl in the car and wanted to talk about her new calling to be a youth leader. When the bishop visited with her about her responsibilities, he emphasized the importance of her being an example to her class members. As we talked, she mentioned that she had always attended church meetings and kept the commandments but was concerned that her family did not hold family home evening. She knew that she should be involved in family home evening if she were to be an example in all things. She talked to her father, but he was still reluctant to bring the family together on Monday nights. As an alternative, so that she would feel good about fulfilling her responsibilities to her peers, this 13-year-old girl had been reading the Book of Mormon each Monday night.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p29" guid="961fce8a-ec3c-40fc-9d36-74b8e0d47f4a" pid="1DhGEg2pGEWWOF-Yg8TdhQ" hash="sMUBEA">Do we as adults see the powerful, motivating force when young people realize the tie they have with the priesthood? No wonder exciting things are happening as the youth are allowed to lead out under the wise direction of adult leaders. The greatest and perhaps the most difficult adjustment will come to these adults who are now to be shadow leaders. They must have the patience and the sensitivity to stand in the shadows watching the youth grow and develop—a little painfully at times. Nevertheless, these leaders need to stand back and yet have the insight to know when the opportunity is right to take advantage of those choice teaching experiences which come occasionally, but come only once. I pray that adult leaders everywhere will work diligently to become this kind of shadow leader.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p30" guid="6e73c0cf-199a-4ca4-b197-2457c8feceb1" pid="paT2DAXbSkm-1OhHhH9UKw" hash="Mrit7Q">Earlier we talked about the increased emphasis on service. Youth today want meaningful, spiritual experiences. They will have them through service to others, not the kind that causes great excitement, but the kind that is simple and plain and good.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p31" guid="3f08ebe4-52ce-4894-8e1f-5c67deb0db71" pid="7FxgZ1yHK0C-UbpVm7iqGg" hash="ozJCwA">From what has been said I hope we all see the importance of the individual. Surely programs and activities are important, but they are important only as they influence for good the lives of individual boys and girls.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/our-youth-modern-sons-of-helaman.p32" guid="7112b099-a31f-417a-9314-4548516b220d" pid="mnzlNTcMz0CHm9o3CSwz5A" hash="YYhOLA">Finally, the Aaronic Priesthood MIA is committed to strengthening the family. The Church in no way intends to take the place of the family. Its entire effort is to strengthen the family. Parents, the greatest responsibility you will ever have is the responsibility for your family. We plead with you: love your children. Be interested in them. Be an example to them. Teach them correct principles. Bless them with discipline when appropriate and afterwards show forth a greater measure of love. I believe with all my heart that our sons and daughters have all the potential of the sons of Helaman if we as parents with the support of the Church will do our part.</p>

I think I would not be far wrong in estimating that approximately 90 percent of the bishops of the Church are present somewhere in this meeting tonight. I would hope that about the same percentage of Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidencies are present with their bishops. It is to the bishops and quorum presidencies I wish to direct my remarks.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p2" pid="XrLNMXzn70mdoJb3MFWKuA" hash="D-hLBA">At a meeting in the Salt Lake Temple, called by the First Presidency and attended by the Quorum of the Twelve and some of the other General Authorities on April 9, 1972, President Harold B. Lee charged the Presiding Bishopric with our responsibility in the following words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p3" pid="hb4K_SNtTESZB40CGLt28Q" hash="2VBOxA">“Now to the Presiding Bishopric, there are two great divisions of the priesthood as spelled out in the 107th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Melchizedek Priesthood and the Aaronic Priesthood. The ecclesiastical title of those who head the Melchizedek Priesthood is the First Presidency, but their priesthood title is the Presidency of the High Priesthood of the Church. The title Presiding Bishopric is your ecclesiastical title, but your priesthood title is the Presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood of the whole Church. Having that in mind then, you must have clearly in mind that first and foremost of all responsibilities you have is to look after the Aaronic Priesthood. … You will help to bring the focus of the time to young men of these critical ages; and when we refer to the young men, we mean the girls also. We can’t save the boys without the girls. So all through your ministry remember, nothing should be secondary to placing great emphasis on the work of the Aaronic Priesthood, to work with the auxiliaries to see to it that they function in an auxiliary capacity, but always with the thought in mind of magnifying the priesthood and of making certain that no auxiliary takes ascendancy over the priesthood.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p4" pid="KEF75q9MtUuKmJz0xkfKig" hash="1T9TEg">In response to this injunction and through revelation given to a prophet, the Aaronic Priesthood MIA program was given birth. It was announced to the Church one year ago now at April Conference, 1973. It was inaugurated in September of the same year. In effect it brought two auxiliaries, the Young Men’s Mutual Improvement Association and the Young Women’s Mutual Improvement Association, directly under the umbrella of the Aaronic Priesthood. They then became priesthood oriented and priesthood directed.</p>

In just over seven months of operation, we see miracles taking place in the lives of our youth. These wonderful things are happening in every ward and branch of the Church where the adult leaders have caught the vision of the program and understand its source. As to its source, may I quote from President Lee’s address at June Conference:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p6" pid="kYqlNQpB0UOM5puCKncSwA" hash="sul0Pw">“One or two thoughts have impressed themselves upon me as we have witnessed and have listened. During the year that has passed, we have pondered, we have prayed, we have searched, and now we come with a declaration to all of you that you may know with a certainty that defies all doubt that this which you have witnessed, this which you have heard has been divinely inspired.</p>

As you know, he said, “I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.” (<span class="emphasis">Priesthood and Church Government,</span> comp. John A. Widtsoe, Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 100.) In all we and our associates, the general presidencies and their boards, are doing, we are merely trying to teach correct principles, adding a few suggestions and letting you stake presidencies, bishoprics, branch presidencies, and Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidencies govern yourselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p12" pid="AjlyIcs-c0qvUVhhPhVd7g" hash="BxOUaQ">A moment ago I quoted President Lee’s charge to the Presiding Bishopric. Except for scope, that same charge applies to every bishopric in the Church. As you bishops were ordained and set apart, in addition to being set apart as the bishop of your ward, you were set apart as the president of the priests quorum of your ward and, with your counselors, as the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood of your ward. As President Lee said, this is your priesthood title, and it is “first and foremost of all responsibilities.” He further stated, “When we refer to the young men, we mean the girls also.” In other words, the youth of your wards are your first and foremost responsibility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p13" pid="WDdaxbP3L0Ko35neyaHEbQ" hash="zQKRhw">Although the principles we shall discuss would apply to almost any leadership setting, tonight I would like to point them directly at you bishops and you presidencies of Aaronic Priesthood quorums. One of the most stimulating influences being felt in this program today is resulting from peer leadership. You presidents and counselors in Aaronic Priesthood quorums are the file leaders of all members of your quorums, active and inactive. You have a responsibility for the total well-being and activity of each of your quorum members. This means that you not only conduct the quorum meeting Sunday morning or make assignments at the sacrament table, but you provide leadership in all services and activities. This is why you have been appointed to positions of leadership in the Scouting organization. You see, Scouting is a part of priesthood responsibility. As you gain an understanding of your stewardship, you will recognize your responsibility to your members as clearly as elders quorum presidents recognize theirs for the elders and prospective elders in their quorums. The Lord revealed in section 107 of the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p14" pid="ytgwLD0u2UirXoKAXsJ8Ew" hash="_Itjwg">“And again, verily I say unto you, the duty of a president over the office of a deacon is to preside over twelve deacons, to sit in council with them, and to teach them their duty, edifying one another, as it is given according to the covenants.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.85" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:85</a>.) And, of course, the same applies to the teachers quorum president.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p15" pid="xYkDiR9UgkOpmEWJSkYyKQ" hash="uXxmIA">The bishop is president of the priests quorum. He is aided by a group leader. If these young men are to fulfill their stewardship and responsibilities, they must be taught correct principles. You bishops have a paramount role in seeing that they are taught properly. You have assistance, of course, from counselors and advisers, but your role is vital.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p16" pid="9PNbdzYfaEiMV7M02zVqvA" hash="FqPAMg">The most important and impressive lesson these young men will learn will be from you when you call them to these positions. If the call is casual, they will approach their responsibilities in a casual manner. If it is dignified and spiritual and you have by appointment invited the young man to your office for an interview, explaining to him as you call him that he is the one the Lord wants to fill this important office and that you have called him only after prayerful consideration, then he will understand the sacred nature of this important position and will make greater effort than ever to honor his priesthood. That first interview will have a lasting effect on his attitude toward his responsibility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p17" pid="oDFeNJeYGk6tRCH2y1Kgig" hash="2FaNkA">Another very important teaching opportunity that you personally will have with him is the personal, private worthiness interview. Of course, this is not all. He will need to be taught the principles of leadership from other wise and understanding adult leaders. Here again, the adult leaders’ responsibility is not just Sunday morning. It carries over into all church participation. As the boys participate in Scouting, they find the same adult and peer leaders as they saw in priesthood meeting Sunday morning. In other words, they find that priesthood responsibility goes far beyond the Sunday morning priesthood meeting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p18" pid="5d_mMalNeE-UkA9dTLEUEQ" hash="bm22xQ">It is important that adult leaders create an environment that will permit these young men to learn and grow through experience. All too often we adults are impatient to get things done; so rather than letting these young men do them, we do them ourselves. At the same time, it is important that we do not leave them to their own resources. The wise adult leader will be where he should be when he should be there so he can take advantage of teaching opportunities. This, of course, will require great patience, and much of the time he will be in the background. As President Lee used to counsel, he should be a coach and not a quarterback. There needs to be sensitive and wise balance between the youth peer leadership and the adult leadership.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p19" pid="D6Hk249jI0SR2QVkwYfwJQ" hash="jkLVxA">Bishops, one of the most essential and important resources you have in the Aaronic Priesthood area of responsibility is the bishop’s youth committee. The degree to which you organize and properly use this committee will in large measure determine your success as the president of the Aaronic Priesthood in your ward. This is where you can make these youth leaders feel that they are a vital part of this great Church. If you will listen to them carefully, you will learn of their needs. This is where, by your example, you can teach them correct principles of leadership in a most receptive setting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p20" pid="oRYSOEKlSEGNXr6xdKVAbA" hash="Bp1hSw">In all that we do, regardless of the programs and activities, the center of our interest must be the boy. Programs are useful only to the degree that they affect each individual boy’s life for good. As bishops, you and I have been given responsibility in perhaps one of the most unusual periods of time in the history of mankind. The spirits of this generation of youth are some of the most valiant to ever come forth. The fact that the Lord would give a revelation pertaining specifically to their generation would indicate this. I have the utmost confidence that if we, the presidents of the Aaronic Priesthood, will carry the mantle of our offices, we will be blessed to provide a stewardship that will enable these young men to rise above the things of the world and be young men of character, integrity, virtue, and faith. Recently I learned of a group of young people in whose lives a miracle is taking place. They are setting an example for the world to follow. About 3 percent of the students in a particular high school are members of the Church. A few months ago the school principal and superintendent, neither of whom are members, granted permission for these young people to have released time during the school day for seminary. This is the first high school in the entire state in which it is located that has given this permission. Just a few weeks ago, the stake president and bishop reported that the school officials are most impressed with and grateful for the good influence the Latter-day Saint students are having on the entire student body.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p21" pid="CODTgQDpYU-vVJXZIK7GyQ" hash="GK_J0Q">The lives and influences of these young people justify the faith the Lord has in this generation. With the proper guidance from you bishops, your counselors, the advisers, and quorum presidencies, a new high in leadership and devotion of the young men of the Church will be assured. This then will surely further prepare the world for the second coming of the Savior and ultimately assist him in bringing “to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p22" pid="vpcpZLyXXUyf5sIx6xotgg" hash="sbjHRw">There is another responsibility you bishops have that transcends all others that I feel impelled to mention, and that is the responsibility to your families. A bishop’s wife carries an unusual responsibility in the home. May I caution you to be extra sensitive to her needs. Remember President McKay’s counsel, “No success can compensate for failure in the home.” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> April 1964, p. 5.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/aaronic-priesthood-stewardship.p23" pid="O7c1dMwn3EmjN_qMSOgAxw" hash="LqxpoQ">The bishops’ responsibilities are heavy. However, with proper delegation and careful organization of your time, it is possible to successfully discharge your responsibilities to your family, as well as to the Lord. May your wives and your children and all of the youth over whom you preside be blessed with your wise and sound stewardship, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

In the spirit world before the creation of this earth, a great council was held in which God the Father presented his plan having to do with the eternal life of man. The plan was to teach the people righteousness and permit them to exercise their free agency, choosing for themselves which way they would go. Jesus Christ espoused the plan saying, “Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:2</a>.) But Lucifer proposed to amend the plan of the Father saying, “Here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:1</a>.)</p>

He is strongly motivated. In his battle to enslave he will resort to any lie, any trickery, any means to accomplish his end. Perhaps his most pernicious lie is in teaching that there is no God. It is at this point I again declare to the youth of the Church there is a cause, and that cause should motivate all youth to firmly grasp the banner of the gospel of Jesus Christ and carry it to all the world, declaring to all that he does live, that the heavens are open, that there is a prophet on the earth today.</p>

This was the beginning of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth. If we have faith, we can prepare ourselves through prayer and study and gain the same assurance Joseph Smith had that God lives and that he and his Son are separate personages. Jesus of Nazareth then will become the center of our lives. With this assurance, our cause cannot be hindered. Without it, we have no cause.</p>

He can only do this if we let him. If we refuse to walk with him, he will have no power over us, for God gave us our free agency and Satan cannot take it away. So what I am suggesting is that we refuse to even walk on the same street with Satan. In other words, not only should we avoid evil, we should avoid the very appearance of evil.</p>

This includes every deacon, teacher, and priest, as well as adult leaders. Let us share a vision of what the Aaronic Priesthood can become and then join together in a great, continuing effort to make that vision a reality. It should also be said that the principles I speak of apply to our young women. We must not ignore or underestimate them in building this generation of youth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p2" pid="wtoc64JWIEyV5X1-jCbPmQ" hash="PmYWaw">Brethren, sometimes Aaronic Priesthood work is misdirected. Sometimes when leaders see young men losing interest in the Church, they redouble their attempts to devise major events week after week, including super-activities, teen-age parties, and visits to exotic places, hoping thereby to compete with school activities, clubs, or television for the attention of our youth. They may let the priests and teachers play basketball every activity night for lack of other alternatives or because that is what some youth say they prefer. These leaders, lacking vision, do not ask youth to give of themselves or inconvenience themselves for fear of losing them. “Entertaining activities are what our young people want” some leaders seem to think, and “we have to give them what they want if we are going to keep them active.” Even though young people may attend such activities for a time, they experience no conversion through them, often consider it no special honor to hold the priesthood, and then move into adulthood immature and poorly prepared for service to the Church and mankind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p3" pid="xeBFiQijGk2QYXne3q-5mw" hash="PFEv1Q">Although there is usually nothing inherently wrong with athletics, super-activities or parties, a self-serving diet of entertainment fails because it aims in the wrong direction. Instead of setting out to accomplish the work of the ministry which the Lord has assigned to the Aaronic Priesthood quorums, this approach largely ignores service and personal sacrifice and seeks to compete in a worldly way for the attention of our youth. When this happens, the youth may begin to think that the Church exists to indulge their whims and wishes and that they should evaluate the Church by the yardstick of self-indulgence. And if they think this way, they may find the world’s enticements more daring and exciting than any we can properly provide. Then, because we have imitated the world, we lose them to the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p4" pid="MvMz1CNHBkSM-louB3rR_A" hash="2BWrPw">There is a far better approach. We must focus on the priesthood quorum and how it accomplishes the work the Lord has given it. The quorum then makes a vital contribution to the exaltation of its members. When an Aaronic Priesthood leader takes the work of the quorum seriously, he is not afraid to call upon quorum members to inconvenience themselves and sacrifice. When these members experience the sweetness and joy of self-sacrifice, which the world at best can only partially give, they begin to regard the priesthood with solemnity, appreciation, and respect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p5" pid="Kkp1NwtObUaXGeq6-AqOhw" hash="kOwCxA">May I reiterate this. If doing the work of the priesthood is the aim of an Aaronic Priesthood quorum, its members will become active and remain active. Members invariably lose interest if the quorum presidency or adult leadership ignores the work of the Lord and attempts to devise entertainment programs to entice activity. It is a law of life: “Only if you sacrifice for a cause will you love it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p6" pid="8l8Cz3eLxEyuduvxUH34ww" hash="8KnCaA">Each of us knows this from experience. Frequently priests who have been frivolous and immature before their missions rapidly grow up after a few difficult months in the mission field. Testimony, purpose, and peace of mind replace lack of direction, confusion, and apathy. The explanation is simple: they learn to sacrifice for a lofty cause. Brethren, Aaronic Priesthood holders should not have to wait for the mission field before experiencing the joy of sacrifice associated with service to God and mankind. They should not have to wait until they reach the age of nineteen before having cause to love and even defend the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p7" pid="NRkbHFJj1kKF3sWxcOfZnA" hash="otZX2Q">Our young men do not want to be indulged with entertainment. Talk with them; they will tell you this. They would rather hold a cottage meeting where their friends learn about the gospel than go to the movies. They would rather stage a birthday party for an invalid child than play rowdy games in the cultural hall. They would rather plan and carry out a quorum camp-out in order to get close to an inactive quorum member than be taken camping by adults who furnish the finest gear free of charge and cook all their meals for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p8" pid="JrZQD06CkU-r-NzD-sbd_A" hash="nYPR9A">I am not suggesting that we should have all service projects and no recreation. In the great tradition of the Church there must continue to be recreation and social and cultural enjoyment. What I am saying is that there can and should be a balance and a blending of service and recreation. Every activity—even an activity of games—can be planned to help build people, if only those participating. Every activity—even a project in which physical work is done—can be great fun. Spiritual experiences can be built into everything we do. This alone would eliminate poor sportsmanship on the athletic field.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p9" pid="_ephRVgjHU6bBdOQYQvp5g" hash="rkq8mw">I recently reviewed the program of a stake youth conference. The youth leaders themselves chose the program. The topics were (1) Getting to know yourself, (2) Getting to know God, (3) Genealogy and how to use the stake library, (4) Self-discipline and overcoming temptation and temper, (5) Parent-youth relations, (6) Dance workshops (swing and fox-trot), (7) Budgeting your money, (8) How do I get a date? (9) Successful job interviews, (10) Youth leadership training, (11) Preparing and storing food and bread making, and finally, (12) Women—their role and place in society today.</p>

May we remember that they would rather serve than be served. Self-sacrifice brings out their finest characteristics. It teaches them who they really are. They have a right to discover in the Aaronic Priesthood a genuine alternative to the empty self-concern which motivates many of the people of the world. Let it never be said of an Aaronic Priesthood quorum that its members could not find in it personal fulfillment, growth, and the joy of giving of self, as well as fun. Let our quorums be clearly and unequivocably places where the gospel of Jesus Christ is practiced. Never let it become a pale imitation of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p11" pid="MsDdKuFSg0OnGVqsK0xDeg" hash="ndgK3w">May I share with you a story of a young man who witnessed firsthand a demonstration of this crucial principle. He wrote the following: “At one time I attended a ward which had almost no Melchizedek Priesthood holders in it. But it was not in any way dulled in spirituality. On the contrary, many of its members witnessed the greatest display of priesthood power they had ever known.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p12" pid="1N1YelxdC0aQcEwRpOpCQw" hash="f1nhyA">“The power was centered in the priests. For the first time in their lives they were called upon to perform all the duties of the priests and administer to the needs of their fellow ward members. They were seriously called to home teach—not just to be a yawning appendage to an elder making a social call but to bless their brothers and sisters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p13" pid="Eenqemg-IEaQBkIFb-0SEA" hash="pkmDZg">“Previous to this time I had been with four of these priests in a different situation. There I regarded them to be common hoodlums. They drove away every seminary teacher after two or three months. They spread havoc over the countryside on Scouting trips. <span class="emphasis">But when they were needed—when they were trusted with a vital mission—they were among those who shone the most brilliantly in priesthood service.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p14" pid="6De4GLRaiEuNJYNSDJg8QQ" hash="pPn9zg">“The secret was that the bishop called upon his Aaronic Priesthood to rise to the stature of men to whom angels might well appear; and they rose to that stature, administering relief to those who might be in want and strengthening those who needed strengthening. Not only were the other ward members built up but so were the members of the quorum themselves. A great unity spread throughout the ward and every member began to have a taste of what it is for a people to be of one mind and one heart. There was nothing inexplicable in all of this; it was just the proper exercise of the Aaronic Priesthood.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p15" pid="wwx4cr5srU2QL9Ug1ja_rQ" hash="O1tdkw">In the world, many organizations, churches, governments, even families have lost much of their vitality because they are afraid to ask people to sacrifice. It is imperative that we not make the same mistake in the Aaronic Priesthood. We must be fearless in expecting Aaronic Priesthood holders to do the work which the Lord has commanded.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p16" pid="O0fsVq_YIEycH1tUnDcSBQ" hash="ck5htg">To accomplish a great work in the Aaronic Priesthood, no new program is needed. You have either received or shortly will receive the new <span class="emphasis">Aaronic Priesthood Handbook.</span> It outlines the simple principles of organization and operation of the Aaronic Priesthood given in the scriptures and in the teachings of latter-day prophets. Application of these principles will bring about more activity, more conversion, and far better missionary preparation among our young men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p17" pid="QiTreRWR7kux2gawMkENdQ" hash="Isming">For a moment let us contemplate together what young men who hold the Aaronic Priesthood become when leaders at every level zealously apply correct principles as contained in the handbook. Some of you already know what immense good results when a stake president asks for an Aaronic Priesthood accounting from each bishop during the monthly personal priesthood interview. The work accelerates when the stake president, who is the chairman of the stake Aaronic Priesthood committee, asks bishops about service rendered by Aaronic Priesthood quorums and about progress in the preparation of quorum members for missionary work, temple marriage, and fatherhood. This one event, the monthly personal priesthood interview, changes and reinforces a bishop’s concept of his foremost responsibility, the Aaronic Priesthood and the Young Women. Of course, if the stake president fails to hold the personal priesthood interview or does not, in fact, accept the direction that the bishop’s first and foremost responsibility is the Aaronic Priesthood and Young Women, the bishop will have difficulty in fulfilling his stewardship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p18" pid="Mbp14KMaN0GqDUVTgV7Dlw" hash="yTefmg">Reflect next on the results we see when the members of each bishopric properly supervise the work of the quorum to which they are assigned. When bishops’ counselors hold monthly personal priesthood interviews with deacons and teachers quorum presidents, they motivate and inspire by passing on, through careful inquiry and training, the magnificent vision of Aaronic Priesthood work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p19" pid="wb8laf0duU-sGCK8wI6KfQ" hash="1LsK9A">Think of what happens when each bishop really serves as president of his priests quorum, and presides at presidency meetings, and attends every quorum meeting and activity. Inquire of others, if necessary, about what happens when his counselors likewise attend all the functions of the quorums to which they are assigned and get close to each individual young man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p20" pid="AtKN0vBJ30ySGXWkISHAYQ" hash="axVBLA">There is marked and significant development in Aaronic Priesthood leadership when each quorum adviser spends extra time behind the scenes, preparing the president of the quorum to take his proper leadership role. Important things begin to happen when every quorum meeting is preceded by a quorum presidency meeting and every quorum meeting is presided over by the quorum president himself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p21" pid="BtOmDzle9kid_o5XfWfWAA" hash="nKuFsw">Now, let us think ahead to what stature our young men will attain when every quorum fills its calendar with activities and projects which alleviate sorrow or suffering or bring joy into the lives of people in the ward or community, or which enable the quorum to watch over its members and prepare them for missionary work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p22" pid="eZ_8qh7GZkOehvkJk3EJsg" hash="xWRQ9A">Contemplate how much Aaronic Priesthood holders will grow and the Church will be blessed when the quorums carry out all their scriptural responsibilities—for example, when the priests, working as home teachers, exhort families in the Church “to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.51" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:51</a>) and when the teachers and deacons also carry out their revealed duties. How much a part of this great latter-day work our Aaronic Priesthood brethren will become! They will realize that a priesthood quorum is a brotherhood of priesthood officers ordained with the right and privilege of using God’s power to bring happiness and peace and prosperity into the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p23" pid="YG6s3Q3zIkOz20X9JqBL-w" hash="W9LjBg">As all of these things happen, leaders will no longer be tempted to devise programs which imitate the world. We will see that the key to the conversion, the activity, the missionary preparation, and the spiritual growth of our youth is a stake presidency, a bishopric, and an Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidency, which fearlessly and thoroughly organize themselves to carry out the basic, fundamental work of the Aaronic Priesthood as the Lord has outlined it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-vision-of-the-aaronic-priesthood.p24" pid="1o414fhqQkGIGD1XCz6EhA" hash="KPo3kQ">This is the great work we are called upon to perform in these last days. May we faithfully and vigorously carry it to a glorious conclusion.</p>

I have the faith in the bishops of the Church and the stake presidencies that this will be accomplished. And, further, I have faith in the Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidencies themselves, in the maturity, stability, and in the depth of their spirituality that they will rise as no other generation has ever risen in their positions of leadership. I bear this witness and leave my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

In the early days of this, the last dispensation, the Saints were given opportunities to live the law of consecration and were organized into what was called the united order.

As we make our presentation today, I hope each of us will see the relationship between the law of consecration and the Welfare Services program.</p>

Since that time, the Church Welfare Department has developed and assigned to the stakes of the Church an annual commodity budget, supervised the production and distribution of commodities, encouraged the establishment of local production projects and bishops storehouses, supervised Church employment centers, and established Deseret Industries. In the course of these activities, members of the General Church Welfare Committee traveled to stakes and regions teaching the basic principles of Church welfare. President Romney did this for many years.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p4" pid="c4HgPeNZZkmGJcG6TLZOLQ" hash="wYXVMA">During this period and even earlier, the Church continued to develop a variety of other services. In 1919, foster care and adoption were introduced under President Joseph F. Smith through the Relief Society. Indian student placement was introduced through President David O. McKay and Elder Spencer W. Kimball. It began in 1953. Services for those who had emotional and mental problems have been provided for many years and were formally organized in 1960. In 1969 these various programs were brought together under the direction of Elders Marion G. Romney and Marvin J. Ashton. In 1970, the Health Services Corporation was organized to administer a system of hospitals the Church had developed over many years. The Health Services Corporation was also given responsibility for the worldwide health needs of Church members. During these few years of consolidation, the Welfare Department continued basically unchanged.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p5" pid="Wz1d1mfG40-eLTqaDwU52w" hash="PxkJ0g">In 1973 these three areas—Welfare Department, Social Services, and Health Services—were brought together in one organization. The First Presidency appointed the Presiding Bishopric to serve as chairmen of the General Welfare Services Committee. To more clearly describe the functions assigned to each of these departments, departmental names were modified. What was known as <span class="emphasis">the</span> Welfare Department is now called the Welfare Production-Distribution Department, headed by Brother R. Quinn Gardner. This department continues to be responsible for many of the economic aspects of Welfare Services.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p6" pid="3YVtz2klRUiWbya_yAX4pg" hash="SEMfow">Social Services is now part of Personal Welfare Services, with Brother Victor Brown, Jr., as director. This department is responsible essentially for the social-emotional aspects and for employment centers. Legally licensed agencies related to Personal Welfare Services continue to carry the name LDS Social Services.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p7" pid="qwELixB7gk-xuA9nwMEEVA" hash="JkHHDA">Health Services is now absorbed by Developing Welfare Services. This department is directed by Brother James O. Mason. Now that the Church no longer owns or operates hospitals, this department focuses attention on health needs worldwide; however, its major responsibility is to help priesthood and Relief Society leaders in developing areas of the world understand and prepare for the full Welfare Services program of the Church.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p8" pid="7W0WVMpgqESlidB8HJWL4Q" hash="PNbwHw">These, then, are the three departments that comprise Welfare Services: Production-Distribution, Personal Welfare, and Developing Welfare. The Presiding Bishopric, these three department heads, and the General Presidency of the Relief Society constitute the General Welfare Services Committee of the Church. We serve under the direction of the First Presidency.</p>

The Relief Society has been associated with the welfare program since its beginning and has continued to play a vital role as Welfare Services has expanded to embrace these other areas we have discussed. We are grateful to the Relief Society for their unfailing support of Welfare Services. We recognize that the program would be seriously limited without their full involvement.</p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p16" pid="cTtqN1QSyUmZOJX-cDgDxg" hash="T5ZE_Q">Let us look at a representative ward of 625 members and their personal welfare needs. The information that follows is based on reliable Church and government data. The figures are averages for wards within the United States. We recognize that wards vary greatly in composition and that probably no one ward fits this profile exactly.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p17" pid="gE6QGemh2kmnW1VoLkqk0w" hash="aGKPhQ">Within this representative ward live twenty-one persons who will receive temporal assistance from the Church this year, that is, food, clothing, fuel, utilities, housing costs, and so forth. But there are others who have needs every bit as real.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p18" pid="6WNgBvbCHEus1fqWSchvlA" hash="kBJKrg">There are, for example, fifteen heads of families who are out of work and many others who need to upgrade or change their employment in order to earn enough to support their families.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p19" pid="s26mNRgVbUqyDjT5vVPpJw" hash="c0-zcA">Further, at least fifty of the heads of families in the ward are in debt so deeply that their monthly income is often less than their monthly expenses. In many cases the basics of financial management are lacking. For instance, one recent report showed that many American adults do not know how to balance their checkbooks or properly budget their income.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p20" pid="nF9JcAvO0EyffVYFi7GgDw" hash="DrtrzA">Turning to matters of home production and storage, twenty-three individuals of the ward have food stored for more than a year, 242 have a two-month supply or less. Sixty-two have no food reserves at all.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p21" pid="vGfGOwB7_kWRuf5te9HMfQ" hash="2sKotQ">In terms of physical health, we may expect to find one blind child in the ward. Four others have serious hearing impairment. Nine children have some speech problem, five are retarded, two are physically disabled, and two have a learning disability. Considering the adults who have comparable problems, the numbers are even higher.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p22" pid="2XZ0z3neBkieY3r8zzOLAQ" hash="2zaFjA">One of the most serious challenges facing priesthood leaders today is in the area of social and emotional needs. In this ward of 625 members, we may expect 162 people each year to experience the uprooting of friends and the disruption of familiar routine because of moving or because of ward boundary changes. Four children in the ward will suffer from serious nonphysical emotional or mental problems. Two couples, each with three children, will be divorced during the year, experiencing all the problems associated with divorce.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p23" pid="dFIQY-TE10Ompn1ToSRm1Q" hash="calgxg">This year there will be two deaths and one excommunication; four youth will appear in juvenile court; many families will experience parent-child conflicts; and sixty-nine women who are not heads of households, most of them having children at home, will be employed outside the home.</p>

There are few of us who do not need bolstering in some aspects of personal welfare at some time in our lives.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p27" pid="5pJllcUWW0ef695LIte9-Q" hash="eJ1BEQ">Surely the personal welfare needs in this representative ward would be a staggering load for the priesthood and Relief Society leaders if they were charged with carrying these burdens alone. However, this is not the case. It is first an individual and family responsibility to meet these challenges. Then, as is needed, the ward Welfare Services Committee acts as backup to the family’s efforts.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p28" pid="JmeLlnyvQ0WNUHuMYhlt3Q" hash="UF58YA">It is for this reason that we speak of family preparedness and ward preparedness. Family preparedness is the key to self-respect and self-reliance in personal welfare matters.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p29" pid="xJl_SjbpDkCkiOCBNhczhQ" hash="SSK0RQ">In the Welfare Services session of conference held last April, Bishop H. Burke Peterson described family preparedness this way: “When we speak of family preparedness, we should speak of foreseen, anticipated, almost expected needs which can be met through wise preparation. Even true emergencies can be modified by good planning.” (<span class="emphasis">Welfare Services Meeting,</span> April 5, 1975, p. 5.)</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p30" pid="xDeAozLEAEqToVysLo3Ksw" hash="jcvBig">Family preparedness is the key to meeting personal welfare needs for the members of the family.

Our goal is to have every family achieve the following degrees of preparedness:</p>

					<span class="emphasis">Career development.</span> In the prepared family, the breadwinner has prepared himself for his chosen occupation. His children are preparing themselves for a satisfying and adequate vocation.</p>

					<span class="emphasis">Financial management.</span> In the prepared family, the parents know and use the fundamentals of budgeting and financial management. Their children are being taught through practical experience these basic skills. May we refer you to Elder Marvin J. Ashton’s address on this subject given in last April’s Welfare Services meeting. (See “One for the Money,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>July 1975, p. 72.)</p>

					<span class="emphasis">Home production and storage.</span> The prepared family has sufficient stores to take care of basic needs for a minimum of one year. Further, they are, where possible, actively involved in the growing, canning, and sewing, and production of their year’s supply.</p>

					<span class="emphasis">Physical health.</span> The prepared family practices sound preventive health principles relating to nutrition, sanitation, accident prevention, dental health, and first aid. They also understand the appropriate use of health resources. Special attention should be given to the promises made by the Lord in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 89, regarding the health of the Saints.</p>

					<span class="emphasis">Social-emotional strength.</span> The prepared family has developed social-emotional strength through righteous living, gospel study, and loving family relationships. They can deal resiliently with life’s inevitable opposites of sorrow and joy, deprivation and abundance, failure and success, through their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and conversion to the reality of eternal life.</p>

The LDS family that develops this kind of family preparedness will experience serenity in the midst of upheaval, security in the midst of uncertainty, and sustenance in the midst of want.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p38" pid="seCKOnHQFkutPynEUPnwOw" hash="rf363A">Now to those activities requiring licensed or full-time services as they relate to family preparedness. First, social services. This is the function concerned with personal welfare matters which require licensing. Its responsibilities have to do with the unwed parent service, adoptions, Indian student placement, and foster care. Clinical services for members with serious emotional and mental problems are provided, as well as consultant service to the priesthood and help for the Vietnamese refugees.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p39" pid="j2AJtKLkRUWJIiwJj8DZAQ" hash="bI3BXw">Second, employment services. Employment needs throughout the world have become more critical than ever before. Twenty-four employment centers in the United States have been established. These centers are where job opportunities and employment needs are brought together. Through the ward Welfare Services Committee, they serve the family—not only the bread-winner, but youth as well. This function is a basic responsibility of every Welfare Services Committee in the Church. Employment and career planning cannot be overemphasized.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/an-overview-of-church-welfare-services.p40" pid="CesjDohPn0SpglI-ampWUw" hash="qOb0rQ">The goals we have mentioned in family preparedness are not new. They have been taught by the Brethren for many years. However, the signs of the times would indicate an urgency on the part of the membership of the Church to see that their houses are put in order. This should not be construed as a statement of alarm. As long ago as the Savior’s earthly ministry, he taught preparedness through the parable of the wise and foolish virgins:</p>

There is much evidence that there are those who still do not understand or at least do not take seriously the counsel that has been given for many years. It appears that some have the notion that the Church will care for them regardless of what they have done for themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-and-the-family-in-welfare-services.p3" pid="BAnu-_RiXE6PnS2mUD3gDw" hash="viP7wQ">We simply must recognize that the foundation of the Welfare Services program of the Church rests on the degree of preparedness of the individual and family to take care of themselves. If our people could but understand that these teachings come because the Lord loves them and in his infinite wisdom desires that his people be blessed particularly in troublesome times. As has often been quoted, however, this “must needs be done in mine own way.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 104:16</a>.)</p>

It is of critical importance that the members of the Church be converted to this principle. If the Church as a whole would practice these teachings, we would have no need to fear regardless of problems that will undoubtedly arise.</p>

They also help other members with social, emotional, and economic problems as they live the second great commandment of loving their neighbor as themselves. In addition, they help the Church meet the needs of the poor through contributing a generous fast offering each month. These efforts, however, are geared to care for only a limited number of Saints, only those who genuinely cannot care for themselves—the widow, the orphan, the temporarily unemployed, the emotionally distressed, the sick, and so forth.

Let me share the panorama of conditions that could befall each of us individually and the Church collectively. I would like you to see what might happen under three hypothetical but potentially real conditions.</p>

Only a small number of families or individuals in the Church would need to call upon their bishops for temporary health, emotional, or economic assistance. For those families or individuals unable to fully care for themselves, we would use our production projects, storehouses, employment efforts, and fast offering funds to help meet their needs. Appropriate health and social services capabilities of the Church would support the priesthood in administering to these special needs. Our present state of Church preparedness allows us to meet the claims on the Church which Condition One seems to imply.</p>

This could include a depressed economy with serious unemployment, or perhaps localized natural disasters. Society would be unstable and disunited. In order for the Church to meet the needs of those who could not care for themselves, we would be required to produce the maximum from our production projects, reduce the variety of items produced and distributed, provide broad-scale work opportunities, and organize special quorum relief efforts. Health and social services would be needed in many places. Clearly, the material resources of the Church would be taxed heavily to meet this burden, particularly if Condition Two lasted very long or were very widespread.</p>

The economy would be very depressed, perhaps even suffering a near breakdown. Unemployment would be widespread. There would probably be widespread social disunity. This condition could be the result of either economic problems such as severe crop loss, broad-scale natural disasters, or possibly international conflict. <span class="emphasis">Under such circumstances, the Church, relying on its present resources, would very likely not be able to provide any more assistance than that rendered under Condition Two, and therefore could not meet the total welfare needs of the people.</span></p>

The sobering fact is, brothers and sisters, that presently the productive capacity from which we could distribute commodities to needy families and individuals is about $45 million. Therefore, if the time comes that we move out of Condition One into a widespread Condition-Two situation, we are well beyond the current capacity of the Church alone to meet the temporal needs of the Saints.</p>

Particularly in Conditions Two and Three we would encounter social disunity, worry, fear, depression, and all the emotional stresses that accompany such economic and social conditions. Health conditions would be precarious. Families and individuals would need to be prepared emotionally and physically to weather this condition. Members would have greater need than every to rely on each other for strength and support.</p>

No one else is charged with this duty and responsibility, no one else is endowed with the power and functions necessary for this work.</p>

It is his duty and his only to determine to whom, when, how, and how much shall be given to any member of his ward from Church funds and as ward help.</p>

For many years the Brethren from this pulpit have stressed and will continue to stress the need for personal and family preparedness. Personal responsibility is basic to the Lord’s plan. From some of the reports we receive, altogether too many members feel that home storage is the total program. May I remind you of the six elements of personal and family preparedness, all of which should be taught.</p>

Some people have reacted to the theme of preparedness as if it were a doomsday matter. In reality, all six elements of personal and family preparedness are to be emphasized so that the Latter-day Saints may be better prepared to meet the ordinary, day-to-day requirements of successful living.</p>

Quite the contrary, personal and family preparedness should be a way of provident living, an orderly approach to using the resources, gifts, and talents the Lord shares with us. So the first step is to teach our people to be self-reliant and independent through proper preparation for daily life.</p>

He is to search after the needy and administer to their wants. Generally, the finding process will be accomplished by home teachers and Relief Society visiting teachers.</p>

The Lord has provided the bishop with a host of resources to aid him as he ministers to the needs of the members of his ward. These include the ward welfare services committee, Relief Society, the bishops storehouse, Deseret Industries, welfare production projects, and fast offerings.</p>

Through a bishop’s order, those in need can obtain food, clothing, and other items to provide temporary relief for their basic needs. Deseret Industries also serves as a storehouse for nonfood items.</p>

The completed order, which lists needed commodities, is approved and signed by the bishop. Advance arrangements are made with local merchants to fill the signed order at the most reasonable cost. Church welfare funds known as “cash in lieu” are used to pay the merchant for the commodities. Fast offerings are not used for such purposes when a cash bishops storehouse is in existence.</p>

When the need is temporal the bishop should also use both hands—the one with storehouse commodities and the other with the fast offerings. Remember, brethren, the hand with storehouse commodities should be used first. When we use commodities first, we are in compliance with the Lord’s program of frugality and self-reliance, and we also ensure a flow of food and nonfood items into the bishops storehouse system. Fast offerings should be used primarily for cash needs such as house payments, utilities, etc.</p>

The storehouse blesses the recipient not only with material goods, but as a place of work and skill development, creating dignity and generating self-esteem. Through storehouses we not only teach true Christian charity, but we exemplify it in action.</p>

Indeed, the Lord states in the eighty-third section of the Doctrine and Covenants that “the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/83.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 83:6</a>.) President Clark reminds us: “Our storehouses today under the welfare plan are kept, in fact, by the consecrations of the Church, that is, of the membership of the Church. The storehouses we have now are … stocked by the produce raised and materials fabricated for the purpose by the Church members. These contributions are truly consecrations, for they are freely and gratuitously given, with no claim back by the donor either as to the contributions themselves or to compensations therefor.” (President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., address at bishops’ meeting, Oct. 6, 1944.)</p>

This will lead naturally to the establishment of a bishops storehouse, resulting in the implementation of the full program so that our people can literally be “independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world.”</p>

The First Presidency has announced that the responsibility for all youth programs rests with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and has given much of the temporal responsibility of the Church to the Presiding Bishopric. We as a Bishopric have enjoyed greatly our association with youth throughout the world, as well as with our associates in the Aaronic Priesthood and Young Women at headquarters. The fact that this change has taken place does not lessen our interest in or love for youth. We continue to feel that the youth of today are a royal generation with a great destiny and pray for the well-being and success of young people everywhere.</p>

Within the past six weeks, I with one of my counselors have traveled to every area of the Church outside the United States and Canada presided over by a General Authority Area Supervisor. As we have become more intimately acquainted with the rapid growth of the Church in many countries, resulting in stress and strain on the temporal organization of the Church and its physical resources, we can clearly see why the Lord inspired his prophet to make the organizational changes he has in recent months.</p>

It involved a beautiful, young wife and mother from a prominent family. She had gone away from her home and was now in the East. She had gone out into an area where she and her husband had taken up with those in the ghetto, and she wrote me a rather interesting letter, and I quote only a paragraph: ‘Tomorrow my husband will shave off his long, full beard. Because of the request of the stake president and your direction in the <span class="emphasis">Priesthood Bulletin,</span> he must not have the appearance of evil or rebellion if he is to get a recommend to go to the temple. I have wept anguished tears; the faces of Moses and Jacob were bearded, and to me the wisdom and spirituality of the old prophets reflected from the face of my own spiritual husband. It was like cutting out for me a symbol of the good things my generation has learned.’ Then the letter concluded with a challenge to me: ‘We are prepared for clear, specific, hard-line direction as youth. Wishy-washy implications are not heard very well here. We look to you to tell it straight.’</p>

Now, in your letter you tell me that you are saddened because with the shaving off of the beard and the cutting of the hair, which, to you, made your husband appear as the prophets Moses and Jacob, he would no longer bear that resemblance. I wonder if you might not be wiser to think of following the appearance of the prophets of today. President David O. McKay had no beard or long hair; neither did President Joseph Fielding Smith; and neither does your humble servant whom you have acknowledged as the Lord’s prophet.</p>

In that meeting there were recounted the events that led up to their martyrdom. Then the mission president made some significant comments. He said, “When the Prophet Joseph Smith died there were many who died spiritually with Joseph.” Likewise there were many who died spiritually with Brigham Young, and so with others of the presidents of the Church, because they chose to follow the man who had passed on, rather than giving allegiance to his successor upon whom the mantle of leadership had been given by the Lord’s appointment.’</p>

My theme this morning is “Rendering assistance in the Lord’s own way.” My purpose today is to point out again the resources that are available to each bishop to assist him in providing for the needs of his people and perhaps to give a little different emphasis to some of these resources than has been given in the past.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p2" pid="2f5cuxa2oUW9T8tJN1gFyQ" hash="HkOm2w">As we consider the resources available today, we should not forget some of the underlying guidelines from ancient times. As the prophet Alma records:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p3" pid="vD3eydLjSEy-eSmx4q5PVg" hash="91akQQ">“And they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p4" pid="qOJfliHECUmM_wJeb_HAyA" hash="IZ0SCQ">“And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions. …</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p5" pid="x6-ZGgXr-kWnISVwxvEvJw" hash="fSIMIA">“And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.27-28,30" class="scriptureRef">Alma 1:27–28, 30</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p6" pid="gJA72cQtVE-f-m0ZtpflIg" hash="z-RVVQ">As we have been taught so often from the Doctrine and Covenants, the bishop is commanded to search after the poor to administer to their wants. This refers to more than those who are materially poor. It includes those who have emotional problems or are involved in the multitudinous human problems of living. This information comes to the bishop primarily through personal priesthood interviews and reports received from the Relief Society workers. Again, as we have been taught, the first responsibility to solve the problem rests with the individual, then his family; and after they have done all they can, the Church and its welfare services organization is called upon.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p7" pid="ZKJ1Netb7EaC2veij4HWAw" hash="vFRLzw">Recognizing these basic criteria, in the Church today we have an organization which is designed to minister in the Lord’s own way to those who have needs. This system consists of six elements: first, the bishops storehouse system; second, production projects; third, local welfare services resource personnel; fourth, LDS Social Services; fifth, Deseret Industries; and finally, the Church Employment System. These resources are referred to as Church preparedness.</p>
			
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p8" pid="8WmpYWv9w02gGxRx_rkf6w" hash="qpJsFQ">The bishops storehouse system is composed of physical storehouses and a transportation system. It is designed to receive, store, exchange, and distribute commodities provided through the consecration of the members of the Church.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p9" pid="OzEbODA0E0Kf_0GakJy3JQ" hash="veMN5A">The bishops storehouse system is not a commercial enterprise. The commodities contained therein are not for sale. They are available only to those the bishop designates as recipients and only through a bishops order filled out by the Relief Society president and signed by the bishop. As we look to the future, there will be many more bishops storehouses organized throughout the Church. This will be done as the Church matures in the wards and stakes. It will be accomplished in an orderly manner according to plan. A very good example of what a bishops storehouse is and does is found in the one at Welfare Square in Salt Lake City. Anyone who is interested is most welcome to visit this storehouse at any time.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p10" pid="wi2RU2DtZEq7aRntW8IMbA" hash="mvsbtQ">Most of those who work in the storehouse are recipients of commodities. There are a minimum number of full-time staff members. One example of what happens when the spirit of this program permeates the activity is that of a thirty-two-year-old man who came to the storehouse. He was unable to read or write or even to speak. He was deeply disturbed. He was accepted by the other workers with love and understanding and was trained to accomplish a simple task. He learned to become a stock boy, stocking the shelves with commodities. Because he could not read, the staff placed pictures on the boxes so that he could match pictures and properly stack the cartons on the shelves. Through their patience and love, this young man has gained the ability to keep the shelves properly stocked with the proper commodities. Part of his compensation is provided in food which he takes to his parents and other members of his family to help provide for their needs. The happiness and fulfillment shown by this handicapped person as he receives the food to take home is truly an inspiration to all others.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p11" pid="GOY6IUH3Pk2gVU4Z7Ce54A" hash="K5JTlw">Where physical storehouses are not available, a cash system is used. In this case, the bishop signs an order filled out by the Relief Society president and has it presented to a local merchant with whom an advance agreement has been made. The cash to purchase these commodities comes from commodity production budget funds.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p12" pid="wOBGmqvDiUGZc5caPrxj-w" hash="etirjQ">Welfare production projects provide most of the commodities that stock the bishops storehouses. These projects include grain, dairies, beef cattle, honey bee projects, row crops, orchards, and so forth. They also include the manufacturing of some nonfood commodities. When the Church is fully matured, each stake will participate in some way in producing those things that are processed and stored and distributed from bishops storehouses. For those of you who are concerned about acquiring and managing a production project, may I refer you to Bishop H. Burke Peterson’s October 1976 welfare services session address.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p13" pid="lUzM7j4MnEqyfWXta751Pg" hash="b7p6wg">There are some cash needs for such things as utilities and medical expenses. The cash for these needs comes from fast offerings. As has been taught for many years, the commodity assistance should be used before cash. Again, may we reemphasize the importance of teaching the law of the fast so that our people will be even more generous than they are now and not restrict themselves to the cost of two meals.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p14" pid="9W0WNGL-3Eqt1rjmvA_OCQ" hash="9Fs5Uw">One of the inspiring aspects of welfare resources is the Welfare Services missionary program, where approximately 300 Welfare Services missionaries are serving in 39 missions of the Church. Their professional skills as they provide technical assistance to priesthood leaders cover such areas as agriculture, all areas of health maintenance, career development, and financial management. We continue to encourage all couples and single women of the Church who have skills in any of these or related areas to contact their bishop or stake president and make themselves available for this missionary service.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p15" pid="cgeusCbhv0WRGEEWNnTdLg" hash="5nJr1A">Now, as to LDS Social Services: This organization was established to help priesthood leaders assist members who have social-emotional needs. These agencies provide assistance in two main categories—licensed services and clinical services. Licensed services include those functions which are governed by law, such as adoptions, foster care, and Indian student placement. Clinical services include professional therapy for individuals and families.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p16" pid="xlnVC5U_p0a4QYll9yitwg" hash="AWwtbQ">In areas where LDS Social Services agencies do not exist, bishops should maintain a list of reputable professional personnel who provide similar services and who conform to the standards of the Church. With regard to licensed services, priesthood leaders should be careful to conform to local, state, and federal laws when adoption, unwed parent, or foster care services are provided.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p17" pid="ZDQoDvukOEmmIlSbQEW9mA" hash="oMNZ_Q">When professional counseling is being given, the bishop should remain close to the individual to be aware of progress being made or any additional problems.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p18" pid="P7nbPi9PkkO8uHghj8gs5A" hash="_BeXzg">A most touching letter was received recently from a mother expressing her appreciation for her bishop and for a social services worker who had provided assistance in her family. May I quote from that letter:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p19" pid="7n-UwwD-OEG-2jlg5aGsow" hash="g1Tt-A">“The summer will be remembered as ‘the best thing that has happened to Roseanne and David to date’!</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p22" pid="yRxR1IX1R0CAqBbbkUL5gw" hash="Zaf6Fg">“When my bishop suggested LDS day camp I thought, ‘Good! This will be a good summer for them and will solve my baby-sitting problem, since it is necessary for me to work.’ Those two benefits would have made me feel the money invested was worthwhile—but they were just the beginning. Before the summer was over, I saw my son insist on taking the lead in a difficult hike up the canyon. In the past he had been content to follow behind. I saw him ‘rappel’ down the side of a building with the use of a rope, and the look of self-pride as he exchanged smiles with his counselor cannot be bought. By the end of the summer Roseanne had learned to put her frustrations into words and will most often try to reason with me in reaching a solution. This is a new experience for us.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p23" pid="Ef-67phVa0SS_jUPwcAJcw" hash="CNmUyw">“Raising a hyperactive child is a lonely position to be in, because even though friends try to understand, they cannot and usually react as though the child has problems because she is spoiled. It has been great therapy for me to meet weekly with people who do understand.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p24" pid="5KTV427gpEaVUkPYsLinVg" hash="Wp9Dgg">Deseret Industries facilities are generally located only where there are large concentrations of members of the Church. They are established to provide employment for those who are unemployable, such as the aged, the mentally or physically handicapped, and so forth. They are founded on the principles of thrift, giving, working, and sharing. As concentrations of members increase, we would encourage priesthood leaders to investigate thoroughly the establishment of Deseret Industries facilities.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p25" pid="FTvDThdwPEGnaywktWau3w" hash="_T3m7Q">And finally, employment: Employment responsibility rests largely with the priesthood quorum for the brethren and the Relief Society for the sisters. It is important that the system work smoothly and promptly if it is to bless the lives of those who need employment. In some areas where the employment problems are unusually high, full-time employment centers have been organized. This is done only to assist the quorum and the stake and ward welfare services committees carry out their assignment and should only be done with proper approval from headquarters.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/rendering-assistance-in-the-lords-way.p26" pid="dqG4aHTAVEewEIkcOCvZVA" hash="2nwhCA">With these properly functioning and operating resources, the bishops of the Church, along with the ward welfare services committees, should be able to accomplish the work assigned by the Lord in taking care of the poor and the needy.

These sacred funds have blessed many Church members in all parts of the world. Those who received were certainly blessed, but those who gave were even more so. When we give generously to the Lord, we receive from him that which is of greater value than our offering. When we keep his commandments, “He doth immediately bless” us. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.24" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:24</a>.) It is impossible to place the Lord in our debt.</p>

Mason, who was associated with us in the Welfare Services Department, was visiting one of the developing countries of the world. A teenage boy asked him if he would please bring a gift to President Kimball. The gift was a sketch he had drawn of a peacock with its tail feather in full fan. It was done so carefully—each feather in place—in such beautiful color. As we saw it, we marveled at the artistry of the boy and asked further about him. In response, Dr. Mason handed us a picture of this lad. He had no arms. A birth defect had left him crippled, and yet he had developed his artistic talent so as to draw this beautiful, intricate rendering by holding his pencils between his toes.</p>

He found that righteous forces had been at work, preparing the way before him.

Alma ended his fast, and then he and Amulek did a marvelous work which resulted in the righteous being called out of Ammonihah. The remainder of the city, being left without excuse, was found in the full ripeness of iniquity and destroyed.</p>

Their example of faith, self-reliance, and determination is a beacon and a sermon to all. Let me share with you in a little more detail what happens to those who work at Deseret Industries.

He must have broken too many because they changed him to sorting rags. Presently he is cutting off buttons, for which he is paid eighty cents an hour. Can you imagine what eighty cents worth of buttons would be? I doubt that a normal person could cut off eighty cents worth of buttons an hour.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/a-haven-of-love.p13" pid="u_5aLBo_NkG-YD6-7bLg1w" hash="9WQoJg">As she sang “I Am a Child of God,” no one in the audience doubted that indeed Deseret Industries is the most wonderful place in the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/a-haven-of-love.p14" pid="H-3XsKS3HU6eFnc0xUtZ9g" hash="UWxlFA">In May 1938, the Deseret Industries was established. Its charter was outlined by the First Presidency to permit those who have to share with those who have not by giving of their surplus property, such as clothing, furniture, appliances, etc., to Deseret Industries—where the work of renovation would employ the unemployed—and to make available those same articles of good quality at affordable cost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/a-haven-of-love.p15" pid="Ug8MWu6LnUSOvBR1ZLgnvg" hash="qO7E4w">Although it would appear that employment is the prime purpose of Deseret Industries, it is only a means to an end—the end being to bless the lives of these people through work. Not only does it bless those who work, but also those who give. Deseret Industries could not function were it not for the generosity of those who give goods and materials which the workers mend and repair.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/a-haven-of-love.p16" pid="v_UQ1Im8HUO33aMuZ0sNwQ" hash="CuZs5g">Of course, the next step is obvious: this restored merchandise must be sold to complete the cycle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/a-haven-of-love.p17" pid="jzV_rdUzjE-qXtybAE8S2w" hash="17YFIg">You may be interested in what has happened in Deseret Industries from its beginning forty years ago. As of March 1, 1978, there were 1,700 handicapped employees in twenty-two Deseret Industries stores and satellites. Approximately 60 percent of gross receipts goes directly into handicapped salaries. Presently we have units in Utah, Idaho, Arizona, California, and soon-to-be-opened stores in Oregon, Colorado, and Nevada.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/a-haven-of-love.p18" pid="xLEpAEgQ6Uqpf_IC4fc-nA" hash="yUpbBA">My purpose in speaking of Deseret Industries today is two-fold: first, to suggest that those of you who have access to Deseret Industries (or will have in the near future) encourage the members of your wards and stakes to become enthusiastically involved in the program by giving to and then patronizing Deseret Industries; and second, to encourage you leaders who do not have Deseret Industries to analyze the circumstances of your wards and stakes to determine whether or not the time is right to organize the Deseret Industries in your area. If you think it is, make contact through proper priesthood channels with the Welfare Services department here at headquarters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/a-haven-of-love.p19" pid="8RFfkI2RIku1-2V0mm10QA" hash="ohp3uA">We recognize there will be many areas of the Church where limited membership would make it impractical to introduce the program at the present time. It is not, however, inappropriate to use all of your ingenuity in blessing the people with the principles we have discussed, even before it is possible to have the full program.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/a-haven-of-love.p20" pid="kChMTb8EjUes1wgE55zVRw" hash="_5XdAQ">May I close with just one other experience. Let me tell you of one elderly brother who sat in a nursing home just looking at the floor day after day, week after week. Someone who loved him and knew about Deseret Industries arranged for him to come to work. He began by the supervisor placing a wide push broom in his hands, taking him to the end of a corridor, and having him push the broom down the hall to the other end; then turning him around and having him push it back again. This he did time after time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/a-haven-of-love.p21" pid="YAKCU47wXUGVUvjYNtzN0g" hash="CGc7Og">In the process of doing, he started to get a small glimmer of interest in something—in anything—and his eyes raised from the floor. He saw the walls, and he saw the windows. As this process continued, the development of a feeling that everyone needs was nurtured. It wasn’t long until other assignments were given to him which he did very well. In time his faith in himself and his feeling of worth had been restored. He became a supervisor of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/a-haven-of-love.p22" pid="N-WRKVqqw0CIRfglg7-M1A" hash="6jtSuQ">May the Lord bless these wonderful, special people, and may we be blessed as their leaders, that we, through the work of the Welfare Services program, may bless their lives, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

This is a factual account of the accomplishments of a small branch of the Church in the village of Bermejillo, near Torreón, Mexico.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p2" pid="vLr7EnUX_ku6syTO8zc5xA" hash="rKEzNA">Come with me to Bermejillo, a typical village in north central Mexico, with dusty streets and adobe buildings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p3" pid="qHci5KPeKEO768VjO7e9Bw" hash="9xCheA">Eight years ago a small branch of the Church was established here. Church meetings have been held in one room of this rented building [slide shown], which the members call “the prayer house.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p4" pid="owCjJK7Gp0KNbEWv3Fxpyw" hash="Y4RTXQ">A majority of the men in the branch work in the fields on land assigned to them by the government. Their crops consist mainly of cotton, corn, and beans. Their harvest is sent through a small co-op bank, which in return pays them approximately $3.00 to $5.00 a day, hardly enough to take care of only basic needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p5" pid="DtHZHUITBUWhaitlJLnNgA" hash="Ff5StQ">The strength of this small branch rests in the Castañeda family. The mother, her six sons, and one daughter accepted baptism when the gospel was first brought to Bermejillo eight years ago. Since that time, the boys have married and brought their wives into the Church. The family is currently making plans to be sealed in the Arizona Temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p6" pid="iuMLOFdwK0KpoCiaVWfQXw" hash="ly5Y1Q">Julian Castañeda has served as branch president for the past five years and has given direction to the temporal and spiritual affairs of this branch.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p7" pid="tAVhu_kPikylykq6ssetkg" hash="7zd_aA">Since 1975, welfare services missionaries have been visiting Bermejillo on a weekly basis. They teach discussions to the leaders and members on such subjects as personal hygiene and nutrition and serve as a resource to the branch president in welfare services-related matters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p8" pid="S7bnprwnekGDQEYcFkAKYg" hash="BSTZVw">In the years following the welfare services missionaries’ arrival, President Castañeda has met frequently with his welfare services committee. Several projects have been undertaken to help members in the areas of personal and family preparedness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p9" pid="hEl7z0EuYUyv4ZUIgO7v6g" hash="wD2paQ">A couple serving as welfare services missionaries were asked to assist members in planting family gardens. Seeds were obtained by President Castañeda through community resources and distributed to the members. He took the lead by planting the first garden. Almost all of the members followed his example.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p10" pid="l8eXoxcILkG8rgVf-PoP1A" hash="GUxNag">It was soon found that in order to raise a garden, provisions had to be made to keep the pigs from running loose. Pens also had to be constructed for the chickens; it seemed that they were able to scratch out the seeds and young plants faster than they could grow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p11" pid="4QIpicsAfEC6FBvuWKTf0A" hash="sCirEA">In addition to the gardens, storage also became a part of the program. Members were taught how to dry fruits and vegetables, and canning was done on a small scale. Jams and jellies were made, using appropriate local methods. Part of their year’s supply included grains grown in their fields and then stored. They had to learn how to keep them from being infested by insects and rats. Wood which was brought in from the mountains and stored was later used as fuel for cooking as well as for heating water to wash dishes and clean the house.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p12" pid="JZhtDzmVqUKhVfEyKtMvfA" hash="I9vZkw">As cleanliness and sanitation were emphasized, the members began building bathrooms adjacent to their homes. Prior to the project, members in Bermejillo had no bathrooms.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p13" pid="aCkEZzLxsEWp7b49EZRIcg" hash="Th2t6A">In this small building [slide shown], the first flush toilet in Bermejillo was installed with a septic tank dug in the courtyard to contain the waste. A shower was also built. It consisted of a fifty-gallon drum on the roof which was filled with water in the morning, warmed by the sun during the day, and was ready for a warm shower in the evening.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p14" pid="0-ystpBS9kunM-rjnn-NWw" hash="FLz5Hg">Gardens and bathrooms became a reality. Dirty, neglected homes with dirt floors and no beds—where cooking was done inside on open fires of twigs and sticks with no stovepipe or chimney—now have cement floors, cooking stoves with proper ventilation or an outside cooking house, clean tables and chairs, and orderly rooms.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p15" pid="R-0oNUc8lUeJSpGO5fcp7A" hash="pzC6Ww">Five years ago most of the buildings in Bermejillo looked about the same, but now, homes of Latter-day Saints have become the show places of the village. They are easily identified by their fresh paint, green trees, and beautiful flowers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p16" pid="OpSKzYb0CkC4NLjjHDgM4w" hash="-PZdlg">Members in Bermejillo had access to water which was piped from a nearby city but which was unsafe to drink. Boiling the water was too difficult because of the scarcity of fuel. So mothers were taught to purify it by putting three drops of chlorine bleach in each quart of water. Purifying the water has reduced illness due to diarrhea, amoebae, and typhoid fever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p17" pid="1auH_HoO6EeSm1RxCIuJ7g" hash="2fx2TQ">Welfare services missionaries were assigned by the branch president to visit the home of every newly baptized family. In carrying out this assignment, the missionaries often found emergency teaching situations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p18" pid="42e6_hBXoEC99yG4paYGhA" hash="dZAfhg">For example, one day upon entering the home of a newly baptized member, they were greeted by the mother, who invited them to sit own and then began to cry. Her baby was sick. Its stomach was badly bloated.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p19" pid="dh3bQJFLY0G7OY5TsrD-PA" hash="-VNZRA">Upon investigation, it was found that the child had never had anything to eat except flour and water or powdered milk. For eight months the mother had been afraid to give the baby any other food because it was so sick, and it was sick because it was starving!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p20" pid="FhCdoWv-dkaGWSsl7i2d5w" hash="v4p9-w">The missionaries taught the mother how to include cereals, fruits, and vegetables in the child’s diet. Now the child is on the road to normal health.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p21" pid="3yRbir_a9k2G0JtmNHYc1g" hash="l2YNjA">All the result of projects such as this one in Bermejillo, the death rate among member children in the whole mission has dropped from approximately forty per one hundred to ten per one hundred.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p22" pid="5fVvKMtahkemj6F0sCZz7g" hash="W2SPDA">Other personal and family preparedness projects were also carried out, including one planned to help an inactive family clean up their home, which President Kimball has asked all of us to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p23" pid="nxqkP1u7l0u9C_G6WwLJzg" hash="iEAYhw">This eight-member family lived in a little ten-by-twelve-foot one-room home with a dirt floor, two double beds, a small table, and a small kerosene stove. There was neither electricity nor running water.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p24" pid="pNGBKjTq7Eeoi3elSYXitA" hash="lpKCbw">The branch welfare services committee organized to solve the problem. The Relief Society sisters carried many buckets of water to clean the house. They helped the family take the furniture outside in the sun and remove the accumulations of years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p25" pid="AA-RSTgHCka9dC9WyYTfNQ" hash="N0fOJg">Home teachers and other priesthood brethren assisted in the repairing of the furniture.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p26" pid="LGqTo7madUWi2FOirINKiw" hash="uiRmVg">The welfare services missionaries participated by giving lessons on cleanliness and personal hygiene.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p27" pid="DKc4g9fWbUWHMK3cbvXNHA" hash="Cem7sA">Another way the missionaries were of assistance to the branch was through presentations of special lessons, such as baby care, to the Relief Society sisters. They have taught principles and techniques in family health care. The sisters have now learned to make their own clothing and to use sound judgment in shopping.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p28" pid="qBSmfqJD4Umx3Ks7gIRDeQ" hash="IR4Hvw">These activities have increased the sisters’ love for Relief Society, and now, for the first time, regular visiting teaching has become a reality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p29" pid="97iT03vfGU-eDA1Qe0xGKQ" hash="syBCUQ">The children have also benefitted from the personal and family preparedness projects in Bermejillo. The mothers now make sure the children are well groomed before sending them to Primary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p30" pid="oZLWTSIDEkueipRMEBIb0Q" hash="Icc1GA">Older children are developing teaching skills as they help younger children learn the lessons of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p31" pid="CSA10suaCEGK-TufxQgcGQ" hash="SHg8ug">The missionaries have found that just by being an example to the children they teach them important principles. Children have learned of President Kimball’s counsel about saving money for their missions. They also now spend any of their extra pesos on fruit rather than candy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p32" pid="OxaCqUpXL0qo8RI-o7Q5MQ" hash="EhvSYw">Nonmembers have been influenced by the example of members in Bermejillo, and a number have been taught the gospel.</p>

So President Castañeda obtained permission for the use of this plot of land [slide shown], upon which to build a chapel. Other branches in the mission had met with extreme difficulty in obtaining such permission, but the village officials in Bermejillo were aware of the accomplishments of the branch and were pleased at the prospect of having a chapel built here.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p34" pid="B-27ESTTOkqH_BBL-jiwvQ" hash="g2ONPA">A small, temporary, adobe chapel has been erected on the property and is now serving while the Saints raise their share of the funds for their new meeting place, which they have been authorized to build.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p35" pid="Qi8n4c__60WNX_-HVP-wVg" hash="Nh998A">Much of their portion of the money is being earned through branch projects. Every Tuesday and Thursday the Relief Society sisters divide into small groups to make doughnuts and tamales. They then sell them in the parks or door-to-door. One of the sisters reported how difficult it was to sell door-to-door, but she said, “We want our chapel, and we are willing to do whatever it takes to earn enough money.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p36" pid="tC3TwkZJR0SEv5vsnXQsbg" hash="i6xkLg">To date they have met all their commitments, and the construction of a chapel on this site is scheduled to begin before the end of this year.</p>

In four short years, look what these Saints have accomplished. They have begun to raise gardens and store their produce, paint their homes, plant trees and flowers, build toilet and shower units, clean and fix up the interiors and exteriors of their homes, purify their water, properly prepare their food, and provide more nutritious diets for their children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p38" pid="n8xqssJbckeOFU_GKXq02A" hash="FR3Org">Beyond this, the members have extended the hand of fellowship by helping inactive families solve their temporal problems, by friendshipping nonmembers, and by setting a good example of Latter-day Saint living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p39" pid="wVuiv8eN7EuHjFwoBHd8Rg" hash="T7zVwA">The spirituality of this branch has been enhanced through increased member activity, better preparation by class instructors, more effective home and visiting teachers, additional converts to the Church, branch projects, and personal sacrifice. It is interesting to note that there has been more than a tenfold increase in the per capita fast offering donations from this small branch over the past four years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p40" pid="FtyWpiH_UUGg_8jUNP7ZuQ" hash="RZOsWg">The principles of love, service, work, self-reliance, consecration, and stewardship are all evident in the accomplishments of the branch in Bermejillo. Indeed, these members are well on their way to establishing the ideal of Zion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p41" pid="ssT_PTigMUqNl8LTQvVTvA" hash="DSZ41A">I am persuaded that any ward or stake in the Church can experience the same kind of success as the branch in Bermejillo. It will come as a result of organizing welfare services committees and of teaching and living the basic principles of welfare services. Many wards and stakes have their own resource people to call on, but where local resource people are not available, welfare services missionaries may be called through proper channels to assist Church units in emerging areas where temporal problems are critical.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-remarkable-example-of-the-bermejillo-mexico-branch.p42" pid="auRSRXN9O0yvdwaUv71ViQ" hash="nyXMPg">May each of us catch the vision of welfare services as these Saints have in Bermejillo. By working together we can fully establish the latter-day Zion. That we may do this, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="oxIYw7FD2EW90yEAsZGmWg" hash="yi_Qpw">My dear brothers and sisters, I hope you have been able to grasp at least a small part of the significance associated with President Benson’s presentation. It is a most significant step forward in Church government—one which will aid the priesthood to prepare for even greater Church growth than ever before. It will introduce a more effective level of planning and decision making than ever before. I stand in awe as I witness the hand of the Lord direct his servants in this, his kingdom. The introduction of councils at the region, multiregion, and area levels is a most important move. The Presiding Bishopric expresses its enthusiastic, whole-hearted support of all that has been said.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="jEM3AnaFV06e_CKi6t16Sw" hash="XS5QHg">As you are aware, the Presiding Bishopric, under the direction of the First Presidency, has the responsibility for administering many of the temporal affairs of the Church. These include physical facilities, finance, welfare services, materials management, and information systems.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="vSPLLEv7WEaiUy3ELLtBHg" hash="A4Y_EA">We administer this network of temporal functions to support and service priesthood needs and Church activities throughout the world. They are managed in the United States and Canada through our headquarters department managing directors and their management teams. A limited number of these departments are decentralized, such as Operations and Maintenance. Outside the United States and Canada these functions are all decentralized and are managed in each area of the world by directors for temporal affairs. Each area office is responsible for all the activities listed above.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="Tq-GlYyALUOxc7voe8wSHA" hash="ICTRLg">I would like to add further dimension to the four major accountabilities our personnel have in performing their service functions. Since some of these responsibilities, particularly in Welfare Services, have been carried out to this point by stake presidents, local committees and others, I hope you will take special note of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="JwTJVwY04Eus4hdag0Zw_A" hash="ut-CjQ">First, we are to manage operations to service ecclesiastical needs. This means that temporal personnel will manage the acquisition of land, construction of buildings, the operation of Deseret Industries, storehouses, employment centers, social services agencies, the distribution of Church materials, and so forth. This does not include welfare production projects.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="RkJOrD4qvk2vVcLhUWHjYg" hash="PfrPDA">The management team in each of the five headquarters departments and the directors for temporal affairs are each responsible to prepare budgets, control activities, monitor performance, conform to legal and tax constraints, and most importantly, get the job done. We recognize this to be a significant responsibility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="Gj4wekPC3UC_InTGkb04rA" hash="eFacwg">Second, we are to assist in planning through the area council. The strategic planning, while developed mutually by the ecclesiastical and temporal leaders, is directed by the executive administrator. The detailed work, sometimes referred to as tactical planning, is done chiefly by temporal personnel. This includes, but is not limited to, the securing of information appropriate to each department or function, calculating temporal assistance needs, forecasting printed material needs, preparing cost projections, preparing temporal sections of Welfare Services master plans, and so forth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="-iLLwxxnvEq9ks3pPdLOAQ" hash="EvPISw">Third, we are to provide a broad range of technical services. Examples of such services include the design of meetinghouses, conducting operational audits on welfare farms, installing membership systems, and so forth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="0AvSPK6jdEGoQ8hDgqgZcg" hash="B3bvbA">Fourth, we are to assist in training; where, when, and to what extent is determined in the area council. The training assistance available includes both the preparation of materials and the instruction in technical aspects of our services.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="lYHjmkRTD0a4XJfXoLAd1A" hash="idUbug">These responsibilities are to be performed at the lowest possible cost and in the most efficient manner possible. This is true regardless of the part of the world in which we are involved.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="pRYyWqQZ20WkpghGcCY1ZQ" hash="PNOPxA">In several selected areas of the Church, our staff has been performing these functions. I have been grateful to observe that as temporal personnel properly perform their responsibilities, a heavy burden requiring much time and effort has been removed from the ecclesiastical leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="GyTRono1qUGXzQa9nK55VQ" hash="36TdVw">An example of what has taken place is found in the Boise, Idaho, multiregion where the essential cooperative and coordinating process which forms the basis for the council concept has been operating for the past year. We have witnessed a dramatic increase in local welfare self-sufficiency. They have increased the number of locally grown products from seven to twenty-six, a threefold increase; they have increased the number of locally canned products from three to eleven; and have almost eliminated the cash assessment. It has been reduced from $76,000 to less than $3,000. Furthermore, the 1980 plans call for producing eighteen additional items. This means they will be producing the forty-four basic food products contained on the bishop’s order.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="wBLq-LWpWEiM5U5EsIxy2w" hash="IAiQaA">In addition, they anticipate significant increases in the integration of the flow of products between farms. For example, a dairy operation in the welfare program will buy its hay from another welfare farm which produced the hay. Over time, this means they will be selling fewer items on the open market and using more of what they produce within the storehouse resource system. All of this has happened because priesthood leaders in the Boise area caught the vision of what could be done and then developed a plan with the assistance of temporal officers. Plans were then carried out, resulting in substantial progress toward desired self-sufficiency.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="vPbzxue5ZU211eHP8AWqCg" hash="Q-0r1Q">President Benson has instructed us in the overall concept of these councils, which I need not repeat. However, an important difference between the organization of area councils in the United States and Canada with those organized in international areas should be emphasized. The Presiding Bishopric has not appointed directors for temporal affairs within the United States and Canada because circumstances do not require them. Therefore, headquarters functional departments which are decentralized, such as Welfare Services, or those who have heavy field activity, such as the Physical Facilities Department, will assign an area director or other individuals designated by the Presiding Bishopric and their managing directors to interface with the executive administrators. These individuals in the United States and Canada will have the same duties and responsibilities pertaining to their functions as the director for temporal affairs has collectively in international areas.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="mAZBhmKhnUOd1FsbPC5xIw" hash="EaYwyw">In the United States and Canada, where we have extensive Welfare Services operations, it will require several weeks before all Welfare Services area directors are appointed. We ask, therefore, that all field staffs maintain their present reporting relationships and continue their present activities until each new organization is installed in conjunction with an area council meeting. Also at this meeting you will be informed as to how this change will affect your area and function.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="ZFgTab-tf0egOBL9KnZttw" hash="DWPcVg">Multiregion and region councils are organized to administer and correlate activities which involve more than one region or stake as well as to communicate and implement area council decisions. The organizational structure of multiregion and region councils is identical for the United States and Canada and all international areas.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="KtEptwavLECWa0gJx-h7ww" hash="cr43yQ">An important difference between the area council and the multiregion/region councils is that membership at the multiregion and region levels is expanded to include the present Welfare Services councils or committees. This simply means that the chairman of the stake bishops’ council and the designated stake Relief Society president will also attend council meetings as voting members whenever Welfare Services matters are discussed. Outside the United States and Canada, the director for temporal affairs will see that appropriate temporal representatives attend multiregion and region council meetings when agenda items relating to their particular functions are discussed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="_bnMFz3VVkKDyWEPMYe0wg" hash="SFWnuA">To me, one of the most significant aspects of this council approach is the opportunity for the establishment of priorities and plans for each area. As directed by the ecclesiastical line, each executive administrator will develop the priorities that meet the needs of his area. Much of what we as temporal officers do will be in response to these priorities. This is particularly true regarding the Welfare Services effort of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="84Qh3JfQy0CCbS9XTcI1Ww" hash="VeO53w">Over the years I have heard local leaders ask many times, “What should we be doing in our ward, our stake, our region? What aspects of welfare services should we be pursuing?” I am sure that every priesthood leader here has at one time or another asked himself these questions. This is particularly true of leaders whose stakes are not in the western United States where welfare work has been underway for over forty years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="SRLuxt5ht0-L45-lBUjs9g" hash="tnbAoA">Because of the magnitude of Welfare Services, particularly the operations of the storehouse resource system, it requires considerable study in order to be prepared to ask the Lord if our proposed plan is right and have him confirm its acceptability.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="sGQ-jZ6OFkmE8305DLczvQ" hash="hRiqrg">The First Presidency has counseled priesthood leaders to carefully and prayerfully develop a plan that will foster the local self-sufficiency of the Church. This is important in light of changing needs, rapid Church growth, the uncertainty of modern times, the obligation of the Church to care for its members in need, and the Lord’s commandment to be independent. However, this must be done in an orderly way and on a timely basis.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="eIbYrSzsxUu5vzgne8BGVw" hash="1ofNvg">As members of the General Welfare Services Committee visit with you at conference time and during visits to your areas through the world, we find an increasing desire on the part of local leaders to become involved in the broader aspects of Welfare Services. Indeed, we sense that many leaders come to general conference and see Welfare Services operations here in the Mountain West in a very advanced stage and return home strongly motivated to duplicate what they have observed here. Without proper planning, this can lead to premature implementation, frustration, and even failure for both leaders and members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="iVJyROtLgkipdes9AlbuVw" hash="z48hlw">Because we recognize that there are varying circumstances, such as diversity of needs, timeliness, and availability of resources, we have developed planning tools and a planning process to aid you in your efforts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="qKZifIclGUOQQFtSsL6uJQ" hash="qw8jCA">We believe there are two types of planning. They can best be described as first, basic planning and second, master planning.</p>

Each bishop does it as an integral and natural part of holding ward welfare services committee meetings. As its name suggests, it covers only the basics and includes organizing welfare services committees and councils, teaching gospel principles relating to welfare services, fostering personal and family preparedness, and assisting members from fast offering donations.</p>

We hope that under the guidance of your respective executive administrators, each Regional Representative and stake president will respond to the need for welfare services master planning. Please recognize that the more completely you plan, the better we are jointly able to control the appropriate implementation of welfare services in your area. Our Welfare Services personnel stand ready to do their part. They have the forms, the experience, and the perspective which, coupled with your inspiration and insight into local needs, can produce a blueprint to guide welfare services implementation for years to come.</p>

With the help of welfare services missionaries, the branch president and his welfare services committee undertook some basic planning to apply the very basic welfare services program of the Church in their branch. Their work resulted in significant changes in the lives of Church members. They painted their homes, penned their livestock, and taught the essentials of personal and family preparedness, emphasizing good health practices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-temporal-plans-and-priorities.p" pid="WTWe-r5WekWJvz9RV_nvNg" hash="hChZmg">The results today are that a chapel is under construction with most of the work being done by the members, including making their own bricks. President Rodolfo William Mortensen, the mission president, indicates that the branch is now a ward. Nearly every family has a garden; some even produce honey from bees. Most families have started a year’s supply of food. Convert baptisms have increased sharply in the past year. All this has happened because Bishop Castaneda, a convert of eight years, had the vision of how to lead his people in living the gospel in Bermejillo. Basic planning, starting with the welfare of his members and reaching out to touch every facet of their lives, has lifted this ward to heights previously not thought possible.</p>

The Georgia-Alabama multiregion undertook the seven-step process of master planning. After the plan was approved at headquarters, it was implemented through the Welfare Services director, his agents, and in concert with stake welfare services committees and the two region councils that comprise this multiregion. In the fifteen succeeding months, they have acquired twenty-three production projects. Previously they had none. They have raised funds for a storehouse which is presently under construction and should be open by late summer. An LDS Social Services office has also been opened. Bishops have been better trained in caring for the needy, and the Saints have felt a great upsurge of security by being a part of this effort. They all have less need to fear than they had fifteen months ago, for the Lord said, “If ye are prepared ye shall not fear” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:30</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p1" pid="GOpqqZbUM0So_HW2vqAEOg" hash="1i0pGg">I pray my remarks this morning will find lodging in the hearts of everyone who hears them. The subject I have chosen is “Blessing the One.” Welfare services, by their nature, embrace much of everyday life—this is why President Kimball has defined welfare services as the gospel in action. Since the gospel is a resource upon which the individual draws in striving to achieve his or her exaltation, welfare services must needs be such a resource.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p2" pid="OFPoGps0f0-olE82ua6Xaw" hash="i1YnHg">As you may know, the Presiding Bishopric has the responsibility to manage many of the temporal affairs of the Church. This includes overseeing the operation of the welfare services Storehouse Resource System. While this embraces a host of activities and responsibilities, I believe the most important responsibility we have in this regard is to make sure that ultimately this vast enterprise focuses on each individual, the giver and the receiver, in order that the individual is blessed, lifted, and inspired.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p3" pid="af7Sy6BQ10-u1uoclvyxxw" hash="7QOH4A">The more aware I become of the welfare efforts of governments and other organizations, many of which have the highest purposes, the more awed I am by the Lord’s method of blessing those in need by helping them help themselves. I am proud and gratified as I see you local priesthood and Relief Society leaders from many parts of the world focus your attention through the welfare services program on the individual. Many examples come to mind, repeated in ward after ward throughout the Church. In my mind’s eye I see a bishop in a sensitive and confidential interview with a welfare recipient, a quorum president visiting the home of a member just laid off work, a visiting teacher bringing a meal for a young family whose mother has been hospitalized, and a stake high councilor encouraging a beautiful Lamanite youth to stay with the placement program in spite of the many difficulties experienced during the first month at a new high school.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p5" pid="c1MIxvvSbEuifVwpuAd6DA" hash="tIEt8Q">Richard’s life, before joining the Church, was one of welfare checks, food stamps, social worker interviews, public health clinics, and unpaid medical and utility bills. Neither Richard nor his wife knew how to handle even small amounts of money. Richard experienced a marvelous conversion to the Church but came in with many personal deficiencies. He had great difficulty in holding a job. He was referred by his bishop to Deseret Industries for employment. For the first time in his adult life, he began earning a regular paycheck. As Richard worked at Deseret Industries, he began to develop pride in himself. He no longer humped over when he spoke. His wife and children began to develop respect for him as patriarch in the home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p6" pid="rBiVtQ8_dkqJGJ6I0ok6uw" hash="9sj2eA">The Deseret Industries rehabilitation coordinator worked closely with Richard as did his bishop. A checking account was established in his name. A workable family budget was outlined and agreed to. Doctor bills that had remained unpaid for over a year were paid. A two-and-a-half-month-old electric bill was paid the day the power was to be shut off. All other bills were slowly brought up to date and handled properly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p7" pid="aWfX7_3il0SFM66YSDFl7Q" hash="vop9WA">Richard’s life was changing. He felt self-worth and direction. Early in July of this year, the general manager of a large laundry-linen business came to the Deseret Industries. He was looking for good employees. Richard was to be given the chance to interview for a job. He expressed great anxiety about the interview. Richard and the Deseret Industries rehabilitation coordinator practiced interviewing over and over. Richard passed the interview and was hired. A new life-style was about to begin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p8" pid="LHz6Qnei5Eirlwd6CeoL0g" hash="2TeIOA">When Richard left Deseret Industries, a luncheon was held in his honor, during which the following was recorded:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p9" pid="WWt2YfycuUm0B4AcFnmcFA" hash="mXY-Og">“Brothers and sisters, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that I have found a job in the labor market which will pay me more money than I have ever made before. For the first time in my life, I will be able to provide for my family in the way our Heavenly Father wants me to. I am progressing, which is what this life is all about. The bad news, or I should say the sad news, is that I will be leaving all of you. I love you from the bottom of my heart. I am grateful for what Deseret Industries has done for me. I pray that you will all find the happiness I have experienced in working at Deseret Industries. I especially want to thank both Jim Wilson and my bishop who have done so much for me. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p10" pid="InPsMBIqSkOzo4ebZJRsyg" hash="tO63Hw">Richard surpassed his own and his new employer’s expectations. He has recently been promoted and given a handsome increase in salary. A soul, a human life, has been blessed—probably nothing else could have done what a bishop and a Deseret Industries rehabilitation coordinator did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p11" pid="taQBxsaqDUemqR5OosJFjA" hash="HJ7NOQ">And now another example. [Some of the actual names and places have been changed.] In March of 1978, a letter was received by the Wilson family, who live in Idaho. It began, “Dear Brother and Sister Wilson, Just a short note to see how things are going with you and let you know how things are with me.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p12" pid="U5TZnH5bCkScBe1HO85M1w" hash="SngL0A">This letter was written by the Wilsons’ Lamanite foster daughter, Celia Red Horse, whom they had not heard from for several years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p13" pid="lNWDbmoDOEypvfjBfEvfFg" hash="EpqeEQ">The seeds of their relationship had been planted in 1965 in a talk delivered by Elder Spencer W. Kimball, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Brother Wilson, who was a bishop at the time of Elder Kimball’s address, was impressed with the words of a scripture from the Book of Mormon: “I will soften the hearts of the Gentiles that they shall be like unto a father to them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.18" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 10:18</a>). As the meeting continued, Bishop Wilson was further touched in his heart and determined within himself to help with the Indian student placement program. In the fall of 1967, a wonderful new experience came into the lives of the Wilson family when sixteen-year-old Celia Red Horse came to live with them for the school year.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p14" pid="51Ne8zMUN0yUrKj8atYbgw" hash="NL7t6A">To quote the Wilsons: “We enjoyed Celia and had some special times with her. She was a good student and very obedient. When she went home to the reservation, we communicated with her for some time, but gradually, as the years passed, there was less communication.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p15" pid="yHGK3F_Kg0aBla03B_bMQg" hash="wm2bCA">After Celia left, the Wilsons had several other young Lamanites in their home over the years, all of whom they came to love, appreciate, and have a special relationship with. By 1978, when Celia’s letter arrived, eleven years had passed. The Wilson family had grown to include ten children of their own, and they had not participated in the placement program for two years. May I continue to read from Celia’s letter:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p16" pid="wRseb0Mjk0-v6WZIxuQO3Q" hash="3WnCJQ">“Right now, I am working as a secretary. I am saving a lot of my pay so that I can buy clothes for my daughter before she can go on placement.</p>

She is seven and will be going on placement this fall. She wants to go. I have told her all about the program. She has never been away from home in all her seven years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p19" pid="tPDCAYiQQkKJPj4nV56Arw" hash="hLft4w">“Do you remember my brother David? Well, he has already been on his mission, and now he is at BYU. He is coming back this summer to baptize Margaret. He came home in December for the Christmas vacation. Then, while he was back for Christmas, he blessed my brother’s little girl. Before that, he baptized two others in our family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p20" pid="An4ztQM-s0OEv1upgFrdRg" hash="Qy0LSQ">“How old are Joy, Curt, Rhonda, Gary, and Jenny? I remember them all—Joy and her allergy, Curt and his accordion, Rhonda and her ballet lessons, and how Gary used to swim like a little frog in the swimming pool. I can still remember Jenny and her red hair. All of these kids are probably teenagers or older. How are they all doing?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p21" pid="CLrupiW-zEK7JfSsqeQkhA" hash="VorgOA">Celia goes on to mention that the problems of modern youth having to do with alcohol and drugs have infiltrated the reservation as seriously as they have the inner city. She indicates deep gratitude for the Church and its teachings, which have such a profound effect in keeping young people from some of the mistakes of their peers. She also indicates that through the teachings of the Church her family is closer and more secure. She tells us that most of her little brothers and sisters are going to be involved in the placement program this year, and then she goes on to ask:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p22" pid="mBn9cSgSOU-oCwF7rmzwTg" hash="Lf3qkQ">“Are you still participating in the placement program?</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p25" pid="qvuBIQn2MkKomTKaTgFNDg" hash="HXP2GQ">As Brother and Sister Wilson read this lovely letter from Celia, Brother Wilson vaguely remembered a portion of the address he had heard Elder Kimball deliver twelve years earlier. “Elder Kimball had said that success would not be felt in the first generation, but real success would come in the second, third, or fourth,” Brother Wilson recalled. “When this statement came back to me, I felt that we should invite Celia’s daughter to come into our home, for this would be the second generation of the same family in the same home.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p26" pid="J5WSMb4rf0OfnTw5VfZ5RQ" hash="JQDg2A">An inquiry was made through the Indian placement program as to whether it would be possible for Margaret to live with the Wilsons. When Celia found out this was possible, “she immediately called us and with tears said how pleased she would be to have Margaret come to the home where she had once lived,” Brother Wilson said.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p27" pid="jH_4fq-4N0CfCWMf2nv6OA" hash="pIRIKg">Margaret spent the 1978–79 school year with the Wilson family and, like her mother before her, brought as much to the Wilson family as she received from them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p28" pid="PQM9a8K7q0e8iJWfRWxPTQ" hash="tZFyYA">“She is very generous with others,” Sister Wilson said. “If someone comments on something that she has and says, ‘I like that,’ then Margaret will give it to him. Each of our children receives an allowance, and since Margaret is considered one of the children she also gets an allowance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p29" pid="asxiORVbREqJCfr29AxozQ" hash="BjwoFw">“Last Christmas we talked about doing something as a family to help somebody else. Margaret had saved up quite a bit of her allowance, which she gave to the family project.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p30" pid="hhmrRYbThE-zxDiwsTnLsA" hash="Ugg13g">“She helps out with household chores just like any other member of the family. She and Angela, who is also eight, share kitchen duties one night a week. They also have other responsibilities in the home.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p31" pid="WucWga_2zUOAx0Vs7orSRQ" hash="T9zdgA">Brother Wilson recalled that when Margaret first came into their home, she was very quiet and did not express herself very well. Her mother, Celia, had asked the Wilsons to help Margaret learn how to pray and express her feelings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p32" pid="cEkvJtTAeUKVmtaHYzri4Q" hash="theU4A">Now “she asks if she can ask the blessing on the food or if she can offer prayers,” Brother Wilson reports. “And when she prays, the rest of us really listen because she has some very good thoughts.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p33" pid="7nUp46qIb0-tLCy-4SDeDw" hash="Ob_jxA">As the end of the school year approached, the Wilsons made arrangements for Celia to visit with them in Idaho, and a special reunion time was held with her at that time as she came back to her foster home and stayed with her daughter and her foster family. She took Margaret home with her and, in discussion with the Wilson family, decided that Margaret should remain home with her family this year and attend school on the reservation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/blessing-the-one.p34" pid="d0xPSfl9ukCd6AnN88a70A" hash="sbMuvQ">We see exemplified in this experience the blessings associated with giving and receiving. These sentiments were expressed so well by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., in a special meeting of stake presidencies on 2 October 1936:</p>

They have not changed over the centuries, nor will they change in the future. The Lord instructed Adam to subdue the earth with this charge: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 3:19</a>). Thus, in the beginning he taught the principles of work and self-reliance. In modern scripture the Lord declared: “Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:42</a>).</p>

It applied to the stakes of Zion, which at that time were mostly in the western part of the United States and Canada. Production projects, canneries, and storehouses were established among the people. Now, although there is still much to be done, the welfare services activities in the United States and Canada are approaching maturity.</p>

There are presently in operation 802 production projects, 51 central and regional bishops’ storehouses, 20 Deseret Industries, 24 employment centers, and 35 LDS Social Services agencies. These exist as resources from which bishops can help the Saints become self-reliant as well as assist those who are unable to provide for themselves.</p>

With this growth, the welfare services program is being introduced on an orderly basis. While every new member can and should live all gospel covenants relative to welfare, we do not expect branches and new wards to implement the full program until they have the capability to do so. It has taken more than forty years for welfare services to reach their present status in the United States and Canada. We look forward to the day when the whole Church is sufficiently mature to have the entire program fully operative. It will require wise teaching of basic principles, along with careful planning, for measured and timely growth to occur. The basic principles discussed earlier must be taught and lived before the program can appropriately move forward.</p>

Some time ago, Church leaders in one country asked: “When are you going to bring the full program to us? Our people need it desperately.” What they did not understand is that we do not just bring a program to the stakes. It is a part of the complete gospel plan and will develop a step at a time. One does not begin at the top rung of the ladder.</p>

Long-range welfare services master plans have been received from England, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Those stakes in areas where master plans have been approved are moving forward with implementation under the direction of area councils which are well organized and functioning successfully.</p>

However, we still have great concern that as a people we are far short of truly being prepared. The heart of welfare services’ success is not Church preparedness but member preparedness. The increased call by bishops on the resources of the storehouse system is an indication that many of our people do not have their reserves and consequently are unable to take care of their own basic needs. I am afraid some members are laboring under the illusion that in difficult times the Church will take care of them. This is not so. The Church is prepared to take care of a limited number of members for a relatively short period of time.</p>

The fundamental principle of welfare services is that <span class="emphasis">you and I provide for our own needs.</span> If serious economic disruption were to occur, the Church would do all in its power to alleviate suffering by supplementing member efforts. But it would not be able to do for the Saints what we have been taught to do for ourselves for over forty years—that is, to have a year’s supply of food, clothing, and, where possible, fuel; to have savings in reserve; and to possess basic production skills. This counsel has been given at least twice a year for all these years. Some have followed the counsel of the Brethren and are prepared, as were the five wise virgins. Some, like the foolish virgins, do not have enough oil in their lamps. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.1-13" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:1–13</a>.)</p>

This is not even close to a year’s supply. The survey also indicates that financial reserves are low. Only 17 percent could live for more than one year on their financial reserves if income were cut off; 45 percent reported they could only live for three months. The Lord says, “If ye are prepared ye shall not fear” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:30</a>). I suppose each of us knows into which category he falls. What a wonderful thing it would be if all were prepared.</p>

We may give of our time and talents in service to family, neighbors, church, and community.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p2" pid="eV7wH07LcEe2A1aNTjkvtg" hash="Uh0xkg">You will recall that ancient Israel was kept wandering in the wilderness for forty years before the people were prepared to cross over Jordan and enter the promised land. For over forty years we as a people have been taught the importance of personal and family preparedness. We have been taught that the first responsibility for our welfare rests upon our own shoulders and then upon our families. Only when these resources fail do we have call upon the Church. Yet, in recent months, it has been increasingly evident that there are many who are not prepared.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p3" pid="QCtfhxhK-0-kGDeP8vEaEA" hash="a2RU-g">Within the last twelve months, the distribution of fast offerings and commodities by the bishops has been alarming. At the present rate of demand, the Church resources will be almost expended in a short time. As a matter of fact, some commodities have already been depleted, and this when the evidence is that the recession will be of a short duration. It would appear that in altogether too many cases the teachings about preparedness have been either misunderstood or knowingly rejected. Many of our members appear to feel that when difficulty comes, the Church will come to their aid, even when they could have prepared themselves had their priorities been appropriate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p4" pid="FSk1LhI7a0ax2QcoNHcnkg" hash="RlbiKw">Some time ago while visiting two stakes, I saw the evidence of the point I am trying to make. Both stakes were in predominantly Latter-day Saint communities. Both were affected seriously by the same severe but temporary disruption of employment. Generally, when I arrive in a new community for stake conference, I drive around the neighborhood or countryside to get a feel for the kind of people who live there. For example: Are their yards well taken care of? Are their homes well cared for? Are there old dilapidated barns and outbuildings, or are the properties neatly maintained and fenced? In other words, how much pride do the people have in themselves and their community?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p5" pid="-sJSiHUlKUu1sGgxa7VHZg" hash="7ON8rw">In the first stake I refer to, I saw well-cared-for homes and yards. It seemed that this was a prosperous, so-called middle-class area. Some would have thought it an affluent area from the number of recreation vehicles in the driveways—boats, campers, and motor homes. As I met with the stake presidency, I commented on the apparent prosperity of the people. However, when reviewing the welfare needs of the people, I was shocked to see the demands made on the fast-offering funds and the bishops’ storehouse.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p6" pid="RKIASB97CUmZ1VpLxWwDkw" hash="6JZ7CA">The stake president informed me that within a week or two of the closing down of the major employer, many families came to their bishops for assistance. They had very limited reserves from which to take care of themselves. He also mentioned there were some faithful members in his stake who from their reserves had taken care of their own needs as well as assisting some of their neighbors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p7" pid="v3q9WFFYdE6vV89-gxPOQQ" hash="Pl64VA">In the second stake, which was some distance from the first but which was impacted heavily by the same employment problem, I saw few recreation vehicles. As a matter of fact, I saw little evidence of affluence, although the properties were neat and tidy. Here I was surprised to see practically no fast offerings or bishop’s orders being used.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p8" pid="oDOASMNzq0-7YKjyXBySiQ" hash="VfrwKA">I asked the stake president if his bishops understood and were discharging their responsibilities for the poor and those in need. He indicated that, while some families had needed to seek assistance from their bishops, most of the members recognized their responsibility for their own welfare and were prepared to take care of themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p9" pid="OQw8qwa4wkWncOkW4K72Hw" hash="qxiU9w">You see, the priorities of the members of these two stakes were very different. Many in the first stake were not prepared and expected the Church to take care of them, while in the second stake the situation was reversed—the majority of the people had prepared to meet their own needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p10" pid="8jdz5bgb4UKQ94xuaGF59w" hash="hcRQng">May I also share some individual examples which are indicative of a growing problem?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p11" pid="T3uPar0ONU-xevZ3zLjjnA" hash="de-w6Q">A few months ago a young couple decided to cancel their health insurance. They felt they just could not afford it. The high cost of graduate school, in a time of rampant inflation, led them to disregard the counsel of the Brethren. Then came a baby—premature, with serious complications resulting in incredibly expensive care. Heartsick and frightened, they turned first to their families, who responded with substantial help. That not being nearly enough, they then turned to their bishop, who, from the fast offerings, supplied additional help. They would have been almost self-sustaining had they retained their insurance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p12" pid="RBLpZl5GiUmWB6kCxmk6SQ" hash="8f16YA">A young man decided that trade school was too demanding and too expensive. He dropped out of school, got married, and took a low-paying job in a grocery store. When a baby came, he found that his income was not adequate even for the family’s basic needs. Too embarrassed to approach his parents, he turned to his bishop for help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p13" pid="thmfqltRfk-beKkESkoYAA" hash="wQTt3g">Another family chose Monday night sports on television in preference to family home evening. For weeks and months there was no family prayer, no gospel discussions, no reading of the scriptures, no other meaningful family activities. Now a teenage daughter has run away from home, and the parents have turned to the bishop for help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p14" pid="QBAUEzrfu0ClrQ0pIf-0Rg" hash="72vRkA">In each of these examples, the central problem could probably have been avoided if the members had applied the principles of personal and family preparedness. The principles apply universally to all members of the Church all over the world, notwithstanding the fact that the full welfare services program is not in place in most countries outside the United States and Canada. We recognize there may be legal restrictions in some countries on certain phases of the program. Nevertheless, our people should follow these teachings to the extent the law allows.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p15" pid="q632L9YAC0SHbcPkvJ4oew" hash="_D8Gkg">I implore you stake leaders to see that the messages of this welfare services meeting get to the bishops, the quorum leaders, and the ward Relief Society presidents so that the members of the Church can be taught and converted sufficiently to live the basic principles of which we speak and thus put their houses in order (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 90:18</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p16" pid="jBhsr3_g2EWDBfTEArPnbQ" hash="WwFj1A">The bishop is responsible to administer to the needs of the poor and needy. He determines who will receive assistance and in what form that assistance will be. His judgment is basic to the wise administration of this program. He determines whether it blesses the people or becomes simply a dole. He also is responsible to see that no one who should properly be helped is overlooked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p17" pid="h4FEYCt2CUKNVaD4S6_LLw" hash="0jXOSg">Earlier I indicated that these principles have been taught for forty years. As a matter of fact, as President Kimball said, they have been taught for a much longer period of time. President Brigham Young, in remarks given in the Mill Creek Ward on July 25, 1868, had this to say, among other things:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p18" pid="-KWxYZnGLEunqRQH3pwRRQ" hash="Km2d-Q">“I believe the Latter-day Saints are the best people on the earth of whom we have any knowledge. Still, I believe that we are, in many things, very negligent, slothful and slow to obey the words of the Lord. Many seem to act upon the faith that God will sustain us instead of our trying to sustain ourselves. We are frightened at seeing the grasshoppers coming and destroying our crops. … I remember saying in the School of the Prophets, that I would rather the people would exercise a little more sense and save means to provide for themselves, instead of squandering it away and asking the Lord to feed them. In my reflections I have carried this matter a considerable length. I have paid attention to the counsel that has been given me. For years past it has been sounded in my ears, year after year, to lay up grain, so that we might have an abundance in the day of want. Perhaps the Lord would bring a partial famine on us; perhaps a famine would come upon our neighbors. I have been told that He might bring just such a time as we are now having. But suppose I had taken no heed to this counsel, and had not regarded the coming time, what would have been my condition to-day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p19" pid="ISuseE114E2NtJFRIWkRsg" hash="vK70HA">“View the actions of the Latter-day Saints on this matter, and their neglect of the counsel given; and suppose the Lord would allow these insects to destroy our crops this season and the next, what would be the result? I can see death, misery and want on the faces of this people. But some may say, ‘I have faith the Lord will turn them away.’ What ground have we to hope this? Have I any good reason to say to my Father in heaven, ‘Fight my battles,’ when He has given me the sword to wield, the arm and the brain that I can fight for myself? Can I ask Him to fight my battles and sit quietly down waiting for Him to do so? I cannot. I can pray the people to hearken to wisdom, to listen to counsel; but to ask God to do for me that which I can do for myself is preposterous to my mind. Look at the Latter-day Saints. We have had our fields laden with grain for years; and if we had been so disposed, our bins might have been filled to overflowing, and with seven years’ provisions on hand we might have disregarded the ravages of these insects, and have gone to the canyon and got our lumber, procured the materials, and built up and beautified our places, instead of devoting our time to fighting and endeavoring to replace that which has been lost through their destructiveness. We might have made our fences, improved our buildings, beautified Zion, let our ground rest, and prepared for the time when these insects would have gone. But now the people are running distracted here and there. … They are in want and in trouble, and they are perplexed. They do not know what to do. They have been told what to do, but they did not hearken to this counsel.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 12:240–41.)</p>

If we had obeyed counsel we would have had granaries today, and they would have been full of grain; and we would have had wheat and oats and barley for ourselves and for our animals, to last us for years.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 12:241.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/prepare-every-needful-thing.p21" pid="J_fumTiu5kadrJ_FqLLELg" hash="b9stvQ">Quoting further from President Young: “When Moses was on the mount they [the Israelites] went to Aaron and inquired where Moses was, and demanded gods to go before them. And Aaron told them to bring him their ear rings and their jewelry, and they did so, and he made of them a golden calf; and the people ran around it, and said these be the gods which brought us out of the land of Egypt. How much credit was due to them? Just as much as to us, for not saving our grain when we had an abundance, and, when grasshoppers come, crying, ‘Lord turn them away and save us.’ It is just as consistent as for a man on board a steamboat on the wide ocean to say, I will show you what faith I have, and then to jump overboard, crying, ‘Lord save me.’ It may not seem so daring; but is it any more inconsistent than to throw away and waste the substance the Lord has given us, and when we come to want, crying to Him for what we have wasted and squandered? The Lord has been blessing us all the time, and He asks us why we have not been blessing ourselves.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 12:243.)</p>

There are those faithful Saints who have their year’s supply and are taking care of themselves. They know of that peace which comes from being obedient and being prepared. From letters we receive, we know that many other families are planting gardens and working toward their year’s supply of food, clothing, and other necessities. Some parents are striving to get the whole family involved in temporal welfare.</p>

We are concerned that because the Church program includes production projects, canneries, bishops’ storehouses, Deseret Industries, and other visible activities, our people are mistakenly led to believe these things replace the need for them to provide for themselves. This simply is not so. The evidence that this illusion exists is seen in the experience of the last few months as the draw on fast offerings and storehouse commodities has spiraled.</p>

The economy in general seems to be out of control; there is high unemployment in many areas. Inflation is running rampant in most countries of the world. Personal debt is staggering. It seems almost impossible for young people to buy a home. Many who have purchased a home have monthly payments which leave no room to handle the slightest emergency.</p>

There has never been extremism or fanaticism associated with these teachings. I fear we today are somewhat like those referred to by President Brigham Young in this quotation:</p>

Then we had two years of it. We are having two years now. Suppose we have good crops next year, the people will think less of this visitation than they do now; and still less the next year; until in four or five years it will be almost gone from their minds. We are capable of being perfectly independent of these insects. If we had thousands on thousands of bushels of wheat, rye, and barley, and corn we might have said to them, [that is, the insects] ‘you may go, we are not going to plant for you.’ Then we could have plowed up the ground, put in the manure, and let the land rest, and the grasshoppers would not have destroyed the fruits of our labors which could have been directed to the beautifying of Zion and making our habitations places of loveliness.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 12:242.)</p>

It’s because by qualifying thus we can call and the Lord can answer. We can cry and the Lord will say, ‘Here I am.’ Do we ever want to be in a condition where we can call and he won’t answer? We will cry in our distress and he won’t be with us? I think it is time we are thinking about these fundamentals because these are the days that lie ahead, when we are going to need more and more the blessings of the Lord, when the judgments are poured out without mixture upon the whole earth.” (“Listen and Obey,” Welfare Agricultural Meeting, 3 April 1971, copy of typescript, p. 14; Church Historical Library.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/fast-offerings-fulfilling-our-responsibility-to-others.p11" pid="GX3-m5BQpUyPCFx2ybwHHQ" hash="jH5Icg">President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., had this to say: “The fundamental principle of all Church relief work is that it must be carried on by fast offerings and other voluntary donations and contributions. This is the order established by the Lord. Tithing is not primarily designed for that purpose and must not be used except in the last extremity.” (As quoted by Marion G. Romney, “Our Primary Purpose,” Welfare Agricultural Meeting, 3 April 1971, copy of typescript, p. 8; Church Historical Library.)</p>

For many years it was understood that fast offerings should represent the cost of the two meals not eaten. This understanding came into being because, in the early days, members were generally asked to give the actual food saved by fasting. Conditions were so desperate that money would have been of little use. Later, the understanding seemed to be that $1 per capita would be adequate.</p>

It is not the same as tithing, which is 10 percent of our interest annually. The amount is left up to each individual, and yet a living prophet has said we should be very generous. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if our faithfulness would generate fast offering funds sufficient to operate the entire storehouse system?</p>

Hinckley addressed this subject last evening in a special joint meeting with Regional Representatives and stake presidents. May I quote just a sentence or two from his remarks: “I should like to say that sacrifice, where needed, is an important aspect of the gospel. It is of the very essence of true worship. But unnecessary sacrifice, that requested because of extravagance or poor management, is evil.” You bishops should expect that your stake president will meet with you almost immediately upon returning from conference to evaluate both stake and ward budgets. The stake budget, of course, has an important impact on the ward budget.</p>

The subject assigned to me is one of great importance and one that does not necessarily have easy, quick answers. It is: “Steps that can be taken by the leaders and members of the Aaronic Priesthood to reactivate those members who are inactive.” My remarks, therefore, will be addressed primarily to bishops and their associates.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p2" pid="jhsVgyHt-0K3LlQnmDA0CA" hash="udGM3g">I am well aware that all here tonight know what the Aaronic Priesthood is. Nevertheless, may I refresh our memories. The name <span class="emphasis">Aaronic Priesthood</span> comes from Aaron, a brother of Moses. Because Moses was halting in speech, Aaron became his spokesman. They were very close associates and went through many trials together. The Lord chose to give Aaron’s name to the Aaronic Priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p3" pid="WlX1Wk1FVki3uHyJiOZO8w" hash="QZ9b4w">I would think the most important event in all history in exercising this priesthood was when John the Baptist baptized the Savior in the river Jordan. The next most important event took place on May 15, 1829, when the same John the Baptist, now a heavenly messenger, laid his hands on the heads of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, saying,</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p4" pid="pXY2iLf4c0OfxvNafMIVHQ" hash="m60lYQ">“Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/13.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p5" pid="E3tWEsDzJkKaT7_FVTDbLQ" hash="teCWAw">If we just had the capacity to understand the full meaning of the holding of the keys of the ministering of angels and of the gospel of repentance and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, I believe every young man who has gone into the waters of baptism would look forward to receiving the Aaronic Priesthood with all his heart and would do everything in his power to become worthy of it. I am confident there are some who feel this way, but there are many who do not.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p6" pid="T1Ud-jRhz0Gdr-qQeKbaZA" hash="Pvujjg">Each bishop should know exactly how many boys in his ward have not been ordained, how many do not hold the priesthood office they should based on activity and age, and how many do not attend any meetings. Each of these boys is just as much a child of God as are the active youth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p7" pid="l5KolCQH4kKaikLooqOkHA" hash="fgXA_Q">As leaders, what are our attitudes toward percentages as they relate to active versus inactive? You have probably heard the story of the father who had four daughters. As each of them left on a date one evening, he cautioned them to be home by midnight. The first returned at 11:45; the next, at 11:50; and a third came in at midnight, whereupon he locked the doors, turned out the lights, and went to bed. When his wife reminded him that Mary had not come in yet, he said with great satisfaction, “Seventy-five percent of them are home—isn’t that a pretty good percentage?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p8" pid="K0eoRUjZqU-Cj6W4Fwzqow" hash="QUeoCQ">It is so easy to love those who are active and responsive and sometimes so difficult to do the same for those who are inactive and rebellious. To help us be successful leaders of youth, the Lord gave us a lesson we should learn well. It is the story of the prodigal son found in <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.11-32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:11–32</a>.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p9" pid="1lzfY7yMDkmLXugtW5DA1w" hash="ZDDPdQ">You will remember that a father divided his wealth between his two sons, the younger of whom “took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.” When famine came, he tended hogs for a rich man, eating from what he fed the animals.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p10" pid="5l7wdB737kC1u25rZzwmcQ" hash="MINEpA">“And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p11" pid="pY-Nc3_9ikKNGiIkktgPmA" hash="AfK-sA">“And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p12" pid="61Iw4KweGESqGKXwU8s7sQ" hash="72CbNg">“And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p14" pid="CmattAVXH0u6Yrmhoj-lXQ" hash="TUmbJA">When the older brother, who had remained true and faithful, heard how his father rejoiced over the return of his wayward brother, he became angry and complained that no one had given him a party. His father replied: “Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p15" pid="kBrNikj4-UiaqVAj6njGng" hash="3wwyRQ">“It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p16" pid="rqYJ7vI6oUOg1RtqDULxnQ" hash="I0-xow">The lesson I would like to emphasize from this scripture is the importance of love. To be successful as a teacher of youth, one must truly love each of them regardless of his activity. Without sincere love, one can hardly qualify as a leader of young men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p17" pid="B2_m2uGDRUqRSfwSlmSC3A" hash="5Ko7pQ">I in no way wish to imply that all or even most of those who are not active in their priesthood responsibility conduct themselves as did the wayward son. I have great faith in all youth. Notwithstanding this, I feel it is extremely important that those who do not honor their priesthood understand that they have taken a road which, if not changed, will eventually prevent them from receiving the greatest gift of God to man—that of eternal life and exaltation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p18" pid="VKady_NkEEWUvJOZkroJ4g" hash="MfdWHw">I should like now to suggest how we as leaders can be an influence for good in the lives of these young men in order to help them become obedient to gospel laws and thus qualify themselves for eternal blessings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p19" pid="pTztPoIJyESQOYvF9AXh6g" hash="dkxWZA">First, it is important that they know who their leaders are. The bishop is the president of the Aaronic Priesthood in his ward and also the president of the priests quorum. As president of the Aaronic Priesthood he has the ultimate responsibility for each young man between the ages of twelve and eighteen, whether ordained or not. He, of course, cannot possibly do all that is necessary by himself. He must have help. Nonetheless, he determines the spirit in which the work will be done.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p20" pid="U6jPZUhEb02CquGQoKto8w" hash="OZvV5w">A wise bishop will recognize each boy’s father as his most important helper. This sometimes is a problem, particularly when the father is inactive or is not a member, or there is no father in the home. In most cases, however, the father still exerts the greatest influence on his own son. Studies indicate that a large majority of inactive boys have inactive fathers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p21" pid="rqVgmqz8F0qcBeUbeqsA7Q" hash="Zpk-ww">If the father is to have a positive influence on his son, the bishop, through the elders quorum presidency and the home teachers, will exert a positive influence on the father, leading him to activity—or at least to an attitude of encouraging his son to be active.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p22" pid="fEvNKxhkrUGtSF4A4h22aA" hash="Lt7EPg">At the same time, there is another officer who can have a profound influence on the boy, and that is his quorum president, working with his counselors. Too often we do not recognize the importance of peer influence. Of course, if the quorum president is to have much influence he must acknowledge and understand his responsibility for every member of his quorum. If he is called in a casual way and his office is not recognized by his adult leaders, his attitude will probably be very casual and his success very limited. If the bishop delegates the responsibility of the call to anyone else, its importance will be diminished in the eyes of the boy. The call should come from the president of the Aaronic Priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p23" pid="IFlFOzW4VE648OQDHBBbeg" hash="NMwglA">The counselors in the bishopric have vitally important responsibilities, but they do not have the keys of presidency as the bishop does. They participate in the selection process, but the bishop makes the final decision. The quorum president should know how earnestly the bishopric has prayed for direction, and that he has been selected through inspiration from the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p24" pid="NujGaPmkjUKfEZd1_-94sQ" hash="hRIWRw">When a twelve- or thirteen-year-old boy is called to be the president of a quorum and is left alone by his adult leaders, he might well flounder and fail. It is critically important that his adviser and others teach him how to be an effective president. To do this, the adviser, who has a major role to play, will not take over his responsibility but rather will coach him in order to help him grow in the office. One deacons quorum president must have been taught well by his adviser to have had the following experience:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p25" pid="MVL67jGGvESGmeewfmAHMg" hash="4YfLzg">A stake Aaronic Priesthood committee member attended one of the quorum meetings for several weeks in a row. One Sunday morning, he noticed a boy in attendance who had not been there before. To his dismay, this inactive boy was called on to offer one of the prayers. Anyone would know that the first time an inactive boy comes to priesthood meeting he should not be embarrassed by being asked to pray.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p26" pid="Jg_BWl3dl0mOfviI1mYmVQ" hash="uHiM5g">After the meeting, this high councilor asked the adviser why the president of the quorum would do such a foolish thing. The adviser said, “Why don’t you ask him?” When asked, the quorum president replied, “I just spent three days this week teaching him how to pray.” Sometimes these young people have a special touch which only peers seem to have. However, they do need to be taught well how to lead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p27" pid="bb2sqiOR5kuof2exKuMWtw" hash="flS4-g">Even though we have all made an effort to diminish the role of programs and increase the importance of the individual, we have not yet made enough progress. We sometimes develop a program and expect every boy to fit it. If he does not, then it is just too bad. I would hope that each boy is considered as an individual with personal interests, desires, problems, and talents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p28" pid="MXqplvPHI0OCATYHVSJCWQ" hash="7EuaPA">If we accept this proposition, then the member of the bishopric who has responsibility for the quorum, with the quorum presidency and the adviser, will very carefully and diplomatically determine why the interests of the world have become more important to a young man than activity in and devotion to the priesthood. This will result from very carefully listening to every boy’s needs. Leaders will then see that the priesthood appeals are so designed as to prick the interest of each individual boy. I have grave doubts that success can be found in the reactivation of members of the quorums by using a broad brush approach. The approach must be tailored to the boy if it is to be successful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p29" pid="o1mMh8o1wkOPSWCtr3IZbw" hash="ON8U5w">Every quorum activity should have a designated purpose, and that purpose should be gospel oriented. For example, may I relate a story of an Aaronic Priesthood youth in Korea who happened to come from a rather affluent family. One day one of his father’s business associates called the father and inquired if he were having financial difficulties, offering help if it were needed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p30" pid="xlpC9-xejkyc-YIkSX0E0Q" hash="sTqnkA">The father responded that things were going well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p31" pid="fCkp4wuUHEy2HjqX2jI1Sw" hash="bVkz5w">The man asked, “Are you sure?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p32" pid="dkaz23eHJ0mxmLY0SPfgfg" hash="tzMtlQ">The father replied, “Things are fine. Why do you ask?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p33" pid="wHL8Bum-dUydO8Kr-Gh5fw" hash="Zspqhw">The friend then indicated he had seen the young man on a street corner selling newspapers. The father couldn’t believe it. He told his friend that his son received an adequate allowance and asked if there might have been a mistake of identity. The friend responded there was no mistake; he had personally visited with the boy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p34" pid="q485yislaEa2nZzrUdUMcw" hash="Mg8Plw">That evening when his son came home from school, the father asked him if he had been selling newspapers on the street corner. The reply was yes. The father asked, “Why? Isn’t your allowance sufficient?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p35" pid="r-hdunj7Q0iU3-AcA85nvg" hash="9VPyLA">His son responded that it was adequate, but he had a friend at school who was very poor and who was going to have to drop out of school if he didn’t get some financial assistance. As it turned out, this young Aaronic Priesthood holder was using his allowance money to buy newspapers. Then he and some of his classmates were selling the newspapers to raise money to help keep his friend in school.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p36" pid="n4UaLxB6HEGh1COT_jmlCw" hash="8ULXYg">A short time before this, he had asked his mother to pack larger lunches for him. She did so, thinking that as a growing teenager he was just extra hungry. He confessed to his father he had been sharing his lunch with this same friend, who otherwise would have gone hungry.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p37" pid="Fl3wV18TzU6r_P2tkqc34g" hash="An-w1A">The father was obviously touched by his son’s thoughtfulness but asked the reason for such action. The boy replied, “We studied the lesson of the Good Samaritan a few weeks ago. I wanted to know the real meaning of this lesson by being a good Samaritan, not just learning about one.” (See “Profiting for Others,” <span class="emphasis">New Era,</span> June 1979, p. 50.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p38" pid="w8julQOHJUmbM3M6HjJiyg" hash="88b7CQ">When a young man participates in this kind of spiritual experience, his life changes. The priesthood means something to him that it did not mean before, and the chances are he will always be an active priesthood bearer. Such internalizing of the teachings of the Savior in the heart of any boy can become a protection from the evils of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p39" pid="KQYgplM2w0SCmenfH1Sk8g" hash="q6MbEg">There is no magic formula I know of which will cause an inactive boy to become active. It takes interested, caring, loving, consistent leadership on the part of adults and the quorum president, with the help of the quorum members. Whatever they do must be appealing, meaningful, and must result in a fulfilling experience. <span class="emphasis">Fun and games will not save any boy.</span> They may help him feel good about his association, but if he does not gain a testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel which causes him to live the gospel, we will have missed the mark as leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/priesthood-activation.p40" pid="Ta3EN01Mf0GBwHuydRnDcQ" hash="urvtdA">May we be so perceptive as to look through the window of each boy’s heart and then have the wisdom to reach out, take his hand, and walk beside him on the pathway to exaltation and eternal life, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p16" pid="I7FvNxj300G6aiREi2c1ig" hash="qFuVwA">As we contemplate the lessons of this parable, we realize that all ten virgins had oil in their lamps. Five were wise and kept the oil replenished so they would always have sufficient. The other five were foolish and shortsighted. Consequently, they were found wanting when the bridegroom came.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p17" pid="2ei5iO76o0KTFRi3_GPgUA" hash="fUBgIw">We also learn from the parable that preparation necessary to help them meet the immediate circumstances was a simple, everyday task. The arrival of the bridegroom did not require unusual or elaborate preparation. Our preparation should be deliberate and structured to meet today’s problems. We should prepare ourselves one step at a time as the Lord so inspires us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p18" pid="WjSdI9J2dkintDJdN4qimQ" hash="trsteA">President David O. McKay used to tell a story about a railroad engineer. Let me share it with you as recorded by President Harold B. Lee:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p19" pid="rzZA6q0KB0CRNjW3O6XMkA" hash="tbyVsA">“The engineer pulled his train into a station one dark night, and a timid passenger inquired of the engineer if he wasn’t frightened to pull his train out in the dark with 400 or 500 passengers’ lives at stake. The engineer said, pointing up to the bright headlight, ‘I want to tell you one thing: when I pull out of this station I won’t be running in darkness one foot of the way. You see that light a thousand yards ahead? I run my engine just to the edge of the light, and when I get there it will still be on a thousand yards ahead.’ Having said that, President McKay added: ‘I want to tell you something. Through all this dark night of uncertainty, I want to tell you that this Welfare Program will not be running in the dark one foot of the way. You remember it. We can only see the next October as the first circle of light. We have told you what to do six months from now. By the time we get there the light will be on ahead of us, but every step of the way that light will be there. You teach your people to follow the light and they will be safe on Zion’s hill when the destructive forces come in the world.’” (Welfare Agricultural Meeting, 5 Apr. 1969.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p20" pid="ejESMxWzU0qN9QQp4YxJUA" hash="yPz25A">If we will just do as the Brethren have counseled and live each day as it comes, providently and righteously, there will be no need for drastic adjustments in preparation to meet future challenges.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p21" pid="n6EDetA8o0K1bPL1VGMOOg" hash="HTfJHA">I fear that many think the welfare services program was designed primarily for doomsday. This is not true. The principles of the welfare services program are designed to help us live providently each day and to cope successfully with serious problems as they come into our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p22" pid="i8Lm4MmYWUqAZigBttkZgw" hash="gy5Xuw">Just as the virgins did not know that the bridegroom would come in the night when their lamps would be needed, we do not know when serious problems such as illness or unemployment will come into our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p23" pid="kVEUn46pMU22d6WoUniBgA" hash="IgtIQA">It would seem from almost everything we read and hear in the news media today that doomsday has arrived. For instance, in one local daily newspaper, over two-thirds of the headlines and stories exposed problems of the world such as murders, wars, bankruptcies, unemployment, and so on, leaving very little room for stories with a positive impact. One might be persuaded that conditions are impossible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p24" pid="0pWaj8b3bUywE39EhjDydg" hash="3IsHlA">It is true that we live in a troubled world. There are many unemployed. Bankruptcies of individuals, of corporations, and of nations are alarming. Wars and rumors of wars are all about us. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:26</a>.) Man’s inhumanity to man is shocking. Moral values have deteriorated to the level of Sodom and Gomorrah. The list is long.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p25" pid="LhKxScndO0Koqf3ytPBM5g" hash="wrCRHw">Many of these problems exist today because we did not prepare yesterday. These problems are not insurmountable to those who are prepared. Neither do they come as a surprise to those who have been listening. Here are just a few of the areas upon which we have received counsel:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p26" pid="gGhySzg0oESJt1gCuOIP_Q" hash="JdufLA">In 1935, President George Albert Smith said, “This very day upon which we meet here to worship [the Sabbath] has become the play-day of this great nation—the day set apart by thousands to violate the commandment that God gave long, long ago, and I am persuaded that much of the sorrow and distress that is afflicting and will continue to afflict mankind is traceable to the fact that they have ignored his admonition to keep the Sabbath day holy.” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1935, p. 120.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p27" pid="_V_W76HmD0O3myzdr44jpQ" hash="ZEAS2w">In 1937, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said, “Let us avoid debt as we would avoid a plague; where we are now in debt let us get out of debt.” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1937, p. 26.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p28" pid="CgJZevju70OS3bI1hz4duA" hash="nJw3yg">In 1970, President Harold B. Lee said, “For thirty years the leaders of this church have been telling us to store food and to prepare for a rainy day. We have listened, many have paid no attention, and now suddenly disaster begins to strike and some of those who have been slothful are running to the banks and taking out their savings, and buying … foodstuffs.” (Welfare agricultural meeting, 4 Apr. 1970.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p29" pid="HiTZo7xaGkGoaFqvjt60zQ" hash="wIubLw">And, finally, in 1974 President Spencer W. Kimball said, “The earth cannot justify nor continue its life without marriage and the family. Sex without marriage, for all people, young or older, is an abomination to the Lord, and it is most unfortunate that many people have blinded their eyes to these great truths.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p30" pid="erdl5JgxD0S5aQ-s8jYaxA" hash="qUdZaA">“Husbands and wives should love and cherish their spouses. They must not break up their homes with divorce, and especially through infidelity and immorality.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1974, p. 9.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p31" pid="PwruNHLdFEu2YufYNOPZXg" hash="OwMchw">How many of today’s problems could have been avoided or coped with more effectively if we had followed the counsel given in just these few examples?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p32" pid="xAydHzMSBEOAECRkArwwOA" hash="TUaGFQ">Let us now turn to an example of the things we might do to prepare for today’s and tomorrow’s problems. I would like to speak specifically to parents to stress the responsibility they have to teach their children how to obtain an adequate education.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p33" pid="wD_bX2114EGjiWdglktwQw" hash="PUqHvg">The Lord is very clear in his instructions:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p34" pid="2KbEtncCB0mvKyAUj92azw" hash="rPLXCQ">“And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p35" pid="394_5AOpd0qejuXI7IbYsw" hash="O8cdJA">“And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.” (D&amp;C 68: 25, 28.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p36" pid="AHFrS0SBNk601_Orajm--w" hash="MOGENg">Walking uprightly before the Lord includes becoming a responsible individual in all aspects of life. As children attend school, particularly high school, they should be encouraged to take basic courses which may be more demanding than others but which will better prepare them for possible further schooling or for employment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p37" pid="zgf8oYs_mkmmWCIdqH8tMQ" hash="tIwYXw">At whatever level our children complete their formal schooling, they should have learned how important excellence is in all they do. There is always room at the top in any enterprise, and it is always crowded at the bottom. It doesn’t matter what the field of endeavor—plumber, doctor, teacher, lawyer, farmer, carpenter, whatever—if our children learn early in their lives that they should do their very best, they will be eminently better prepared for the responsibilities of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p38" pid="5TiFQyINuESPrWIO01wpGQ" hash="S9tKVQ">We should teach our children the importance of schooling as a help in discovering how to think and to learn. They need to know, and we need to be reminded, that schooling is merely the formal part of education. Education should never stop, but should be a continuing activity throughout life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p39" pid="_hnViyBdikKNFHm7sFEKRw" hash="1IilzA">The world-renowned educator Mortimer Adler once indicated in an interview that his education had begun just twenty-five years earlier. The interviewer in some surprise said, “But you are famous for the many years you were associated with the University of Chicago.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p40" pid="q9ELM23OFU-Le3L-cijoIQ" hash="9CwZYQ">Mr. Adler’s response was, “Those years I was obtaining my schooling. It was only after I had finished my formal schooling that my education began.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/preparation-for-tomorrow.p48" pid="q9NvIctIJECEuiv3Lq54Bg" hash="VHgaQA">Notice that this example of education follows the same systematic course as other preparation. Second grade follows first grade, third grade follows second grade, and so on, until graduation from high school occurs and college or vocational training is finished. This takes us back to the basic premise that adequate preparation for today’s problems is the best preparation for the future.</p>

It goes without saying that to sustain life we must have food, shelter, clothing, and the other necessities. However, we could have all of these in abundance and still be lacking in those things that will sustain eternal life. The Savior taught this in many ways, one of which is the parable of the rich man.</p>

I met him in Milan approximately two years ago, a few months after he had joined the Church. He is a fine, wonderful, clean-cut young man, the kind any parent would be proud of. He was living a good life. He thought he had no needs that were not being met—until he found the gospel of Jesus Christ. I should like to share from his letter a few thoughts having to do with his feelings about himself.</p>

Aware of the plan of salvation and of the great ‘Blessings I can receive upon my head’ (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/10.6" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 10:6</a>), I am trying to do my best to fulfill the assignments which our Father gave me before sending me here on the earth.</p>

Our lives are greatly changed and our hearts are willing to do what our Father in Heaven wants us to accomplish.”</p>

Finding one’s own, intimate identity can be a great blessing in the life of every human being. Everyone can obtain it if he realizes it comes only through the light of truth or, as explained by the Savior, the light of life. In <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.12" class="scriptureRef">John 8:12</a> we read, “I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/finding-ones-identity.p6" pid="ouxpRerxb0iri9T_sgrKOQ" hash="yCPxJg">As we endeavor to understand what it means to have the light of life, which is a most important aid to discovering our identity, we must of necessity know who Jesus is. From the holy scriptures, we are told who he is—the Son of God, referred to as the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. He was born of Mary. He is our Redeemer through whom repentance and forgiveness of sin are made possible. He it is who was condemned to die and even while hanging on the cross forgave his executioners. He is the same who rose from the tomb and by that act broke the bonds of death for all mankind, establishing the resurrection. This is the same Jesus who guides his church in these latter days, which church carries his name, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/finding-ones-identity.p7" pid="rDs8STkBhke1mbrHv8jMVQ" hash="ScFjnQ">Through direct teachings during his mortal life and through instruction given to both ancient and modern prophets which are found recorded in the sacred scriptures, the Savior left all mankind sufficient teachings for each one to understand himself and to find his own, true identity. It comes only through knowledge of and obedience to the commandments. Once it does come, the thoughts, “I’m not worth anything—I’m just a nobody,” will have no place in our lives. By “true identity” I mean the relationship between self-worth and self-subordination. The quest for this is explained in the words of George T. Boyd in a talk he gave some years ago.</p>

Either of these are achievable alone. But how easy it is for a sense of personal worth to turn to an intolerable egoism and self-conceit—or a sense of self-subordination—to turn into a false humility or morbid self-depreciation.</p>

Belonging to such a whole gives him a sense of the value of his own soul, but seen in relation to God reveals his dependence and hence his subordination. … Thus, a devout use of the scriptures nourishes the spiritual life with a calm that displaces the doubts and anxieties which paralyze mankind.” (<span class="emphasis">Views on Man and Religion,</span> ed.

Thus we come to realize that we are to have dominion over all the other creations of God. In this capacity we have been given characteristics which are unique to the human race. Among them—</p>

We live in a materialistic world. Some become confused and seek identity through riches or the accolades of men. The Savior makes it very clear in his teachings that it is not possible to realize the identity of which I speak through such means.

He was asked a question and when he answered it correctly was informed he had won an expensive sports car. It seemed like a dream come true for a teenage boy. A loving bishop was concerned about what such a car might do to the boy, thinking it might draw him away from all we hold dear. He asked him about his feelings. The bishop could hardly believe his ears when the young man indicated he was not going to take the car but would accept a cash award instead. He said, “Now my mission is paid for.” What an outstanding example of proper balance in an attitude toward worldly wealth or recognition and Christlike values.</p>

He had received tremendous recognition as an athlete. He started swimming competitively at age thirteen and would practice upwards of thirty hours every week. He became a national champion and winner of a bronze medal at the 1968 Olympic Games. He was an All-American in college for three years. After graduation he went on to medical school and did very well.</p>

He was struggling for a real feeling of self-worth. In his own words: “I would tell myself, ‘You are an Olympian. You have a good mind, you will become a doctor and have the good life.’ I would tell myself this as I was contemplating suicide. I was full of false and vain pride.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/finding-ones-identity.p35" pid="3maqmBZ56kW-i5HTyB9MFA" hash="qSfmwQ">Fortunately, during his senior year at medical school, he went to live with a country doctor who understood the struggles he was having. With the encouragement of his older mentor, he began to read the scriptures. At first he did so with arrogance, confident that intellectually he could understand all he read, which he found he could not do. Again in his own words: “I was halfway through Genesis and was learning very little when I said to myself, ‘There must be chapters that are written in a way that will be easier to understand.’ I turned to Numbers and found that I understood even less.”</p>

Slowly, as he prayed and studied and prayed some more, he began to realize that he was a child of a loving Father in Heaven and as such had tremendous potential as an individual.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="TUtOcRKlNE25L4UyMvzNGQ" hash="WBbvgg">I deeply appreciate the opportunity tonight to address the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood and their leaders. I have a sincere desire to cause each one to enlarge his vision of what the Aaronic Priesthood means and what a great blessing it is to be entrusted with its power. I think it is very important to recognize that the Lord has entrusted each individual with the responsibility associated with the Aaronic Priesthood. In other words, when I speak of the Aaronic Priesthood, I speak of it as it affects each individual, not just as a large number of boys or men. When one receives the Aaronic Priesthood, he receives it as a personal, private ordination, not just as one of many. Therefore, I hope you will feel that what I have to say tonight should be taken as a personal message—to the deacon in the upper row of the balcony here in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, to the teacher watching the satellite transmission in New Jersey, and to the young priest hearing the broadcast in France or Samoa or Brazil—to each individual young man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="XP1Lb9s1_0iXmH3pjTB8FA" hash="ubwQLA">This summer we all witnessed one of the most wonderful and inspiring exhibitions of youthful accomplishments among athletes that can be imagined. People all over the world were lifted to new heights of faith in mankind through the performance of the men and women at the summer Olympic games in Los Angeles. Their self-confidence and commitment to excel were infectious. I, for one, have unrestrained admiration for all of them, not only those who received medals, but all of the participants; and, of course, the thousands of volunteers who made that great event possible deserve to be recognized as well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="s6Cdj5VjW0imalGflLq2kA" hash="llC70w">I would like to draw some parallels between the experiences of these young people and the experiences, which are far greater and longer lasting, that most of you will have in your life’s contest. I specifically speak to the deacon, teacher, and priest who have had conferred upon them the power and the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="tCY5IjCvbkO1Pb9wBz7Z-g" hash="TKWt5w">Each participant in the Olympics needed to train thoroughly to even qualify to participate. It took many, many hours of practicing, of developing self-discipline, of developing further commitment to achieve the goal. It required sacrifice, and it required a feeling of self-confidence. You as an Aaronic Priesthood holder have qualified to receive that priesthood. Had you not qualified, it would not have been given to you, and you would not be authorized to participate and exercise its power and authority.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="CPVZ7IrJFEW1yfXIQgkexA" hash="phLxXw">You did not have to spend the hours the athletes had to spend to condition and perfect your physical body, but you had to do something more important than that. It was necessary for you to prepare your spirit to receive the blessings of this great honor. Now that you have been accepted, if you expect to succeed, it is essential that you do those things that will bring about success. When you do succeed, which requires not just months but a lifetime of living and proving yourself, you may not receive the applause of men. You will not be performing before large audiences of enthusiastic supporters, but you will have performed many of the necessary labors in private and without expectation of recognition. And that, of course, requires greater self-discipline than just about any other human endeavor.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="5snd3myzY0i0XN3iGkULLA" hash="de_faA">In striving to do their best, these young athletes often looked for inspiration and motivation to those who had performed in prior games, establishing Olympic records. They worked to perfect their talents in order to equal or better those records. You as an Aaronic Priesthood holder have available many examples of those who have honored their priesthood: John the Baptist, Joseph Smith, your own father, and your bishop. You need only strive to be and do your best to follow these examples.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="2cCO3Opwd0aDuvLnZpbZUQ" hash="hN4dMA">Most of the participants in the Olympic games recognized that in athletics, as well as in life, the real competition is with self, not against others. I watched a television interview one day where this was made very clear. The fourteen-year-old figure skating champion of Canada was asked how she felt when she performed to her very best and won. She responded, “Wonderful.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="oC4HqmDWdU2ONJzArpOoJg" hash="8ygM9w">John the Baptist said he came at the direction of Peter, James, and John. The ordination was performed before the Church was organized again upon the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="yuULFm_WD0GxK5LpHrpfdQ" hash="jkHwrQ">The Aaronic Priesthood is a preparatory priesthood. It is an appendage to the Melchizedek Priesthood and has to do largely with outward ordinances and temporal responsibilities. However, in the ordination, John the Baptist said that it “holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins.” These are essential for admittance into the Church of Jesus Christ and to achieve the goal of exaltation in the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="E-MWmJtqy0iZVGXhnjq03Q" hash="MSyeoQ">I feel sometimes we consider the preparation and handling of the sacrament and the collecting of fast offerings and so forth as almost the sum and substance of the Aaronic Priesthood responsibility. This is not true. These activities, of course, are very important, but there is so much more. As a preparatory priesthood it is preparing you ultimately, of course, for eternal life and exaltation. The Lord said, “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>.) And further He has told us that eternal life—exaltation—is the greatest gift of God to man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="7V_SbGOI_kuVOH-XZ2grgA" hash="ZnMaNQ">As a holder of the priesthood you are a servant of our Heavenly Father. If you are to honor the priesthood, you must truly be a servant and serve your fellowmen. If you make this service a part of your life, you won’t have to continually make decisions about what is right and what is wrong. It will become second nature to your way of living because through service you will be drawing closer to your Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="8Hxfz09d7UWtHSEb-ysc2w" hash="FBAPsA">I am very much aware that you and some of your peers are living that way now. For instance, a fifteen-year-old Korean boy took his weekly allowance and bought newspapers with it. Then he and some friends sold these on the streets of Seoul, Korea, to raise money to help a fellow student who did not have sufficient funds to stay in school. This young man also gave part of his lunch to this boy each day so that he would not go hungry. Why did he do these things? Because he had been studying the story of the Good Samaritan and didn’t just want to learn about the Good Samaritan but wanted to know what it felt like to be one by doing what a Good Samaritan would do. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.25-37" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:25–37</a>.) He related these things to his father only after careful questioning by his father about his activities. He had done them without any thought of recognition.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="QoZGXyGrS026sADNeM4ytQ" hash="8tEO9g">I doubt very much that the bishop of this young man would have to worry about how he looked when he came to participate at the sacrament table or whether his heart and hands were clean and pure. I don’t think his father would have to worry about whether or not he was honest in his relationships with others, or whether or not he cheated at school.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="KogsERd9pEGmppjo-LqUuA" hash="A9FkRA">Another father told me of an experience he had with his son who was a priest. This man needed some help around the house with cleaning and repainting and so forth. Pleasantly and cooperatively, this young man went ahead and accomplished much of the work. He is preparing himself for trust and responsibility by honoring his parents and willingly accepting chores at home. He is beginning to put on the whole armor of God, which will assure peace and happiness in this life and in the life to come. He is developing the strength and self- discipline needed to obey all of the commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="ubCgTv65AEuYO67Gc6QMYg" hash="brsr_Q">In another instance, some of the young men and women in one ward found themselves wavering in their testimonies and uncomfortable with Church activity. One day they decided, under the guidance of a very wise bishop, to involve themselves actively with several of the elderly members of the ward who were homebound. They divided into small groups, with each group determined to develop a family-like relationship with one of the homebound members. On a regular basis the young women and young men prepared meals that they and their elderly friends enjoyed together in the homes of the elderly members. Each Sunday the young men took the sacrament into the homes. On occasion, they arranged to hold special family home evenings together. These activities caused a remarkable change in the attitude of the young people toward themselves, toward the elderly, and toward the Church. They found a way to express the gospel of Christ through giving loving service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="NI0zBYyykkuU8P4d89z2HA" hash="T3LDBw">I don’t think any of us will ever forget the sight of hundreds of young athletes marching proudly behind the flags and banners of their respective countries, thrilled to have been chosen to represent their nation at the Olympic games. You, my brother of the Aaronic Priesthood, seated in the balcony here, at a stake center in New Jersey, or in a chapel in France, Samoa, or Brazil, you are a chosen representative of God, having received the authority to act in His name, as has every worthy young man who holds the priesthood. The banner you carry every day may not be seen by millions of people, but it is seen by Him whose banner it is and by those who know who you are, both members of the Church and nonmembers. It is the banner of the Lord, displaying what you really are deep down inside as you show your love of God by keeping His commandments and by serving your fellowmen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-banner-of-the-lord.p" pid="ZNCoQYhnlkK_erNEKzwvpQ" hash="kOnaPg">It is my firm prayer that each of you bishops and quorum advisers of these young men will aid in their understanding what it means to hold the holy priesthood and to put on the whole armor of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The caller in Salt Lake City asked if I planned to attend general conference, which convened the next morning. To this I answered, “No,” whereupon he asked if I could. I responded, “I suppose I can if you want me to.” The caller said, “The President of the Church would like to see you tomorrow morning at 8:00 in his office. Now have a good night’s sleep because it will be your last.” After some twenty-four years, it looks as though I may get that good night’s sleep—perhaps.</p>

I have had the indescribable blessing of being tutored every week, with few exceptions, by four Presidents of the Church and eight different Counselors in the First Presidency, and of course, for eleven years of that time, by a wonderful Presiding Bishop, John H. Vandenberg. It was a great blessing to serve with Elder Robert L. Simpson as Counselors to Bishop Vandenberg. Words cannot adequately express my love and my appreciation for my own faithful Counselors, Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone, Bishop H. Burke Peterson, and Bishop J. Richard Clarke, for their loyalty to me personally, and for their outstanding contribution to the Church during these thirteen years. We’ve been abundantly blessed by men and women of great faith and commitment—both here at home and from all over the world—who joined with us in response to the assignment from the First Presidency to accomplish the temporal work of the kingdom in these latter days. I express my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude to all, wherever they may be, and thank them for the blessing of being associated with them.</p>

I should like to discuss two or three of them today. There are some things that are common to all mankind. Two of the most obvious are that we are born and we die. We take with us in death no more than we brought with us in birth, as far as material things are concerned. The closer I get to the time of departure from this life, the more concern I feel about what I will take with me.</p>

If we accept this statement of the Lord, others will naturally fold into proper place. What does it mean to have the “light of life” and “not walk in darkness”? A rich young ruler may have had this question in mind when he asked Jesus what he should do to inherit eternal life, which is the greatest gift of God to man. The Savior responded:</p>

The Israelite king was very upset with this request because he had no power to do such a thing. Yet, he knew if he did not do it, it could mean war with the Syrians. Elisha, the prophet, heard of the king’s distress and suggested, “Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</p>

I had spent twenty-one years in the commercial aviation industry, and I enjoyed it. We had just moved into a new home in Chicago when a call came from Church headquarters inviting me to come to Salt Lake City for an interview with President David O. McKay. All my prior plans were discarded as I was called to be a Counselor to the new Presiding Bishop, John H. Vandenberg. I had never thought nor aspired to become a General Authority, but there was only one answer possible when President McKay, a prophet of God, called me to this work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/a-lifetime-of-learning.p2" pid="-Ej7bzzgR0GZ5euYi7vAQA" hash="DDQ9GQ">These twenty-eight years following that experience in October of 1961 have provided opportunities for service I never could have dreamed of. I have been blessed with dedicated associates in many countries and at headquarters who have worked faithfully to help build the kingdom of God, often at great personal sacrifice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/a-lifetime-of-learning.p3" pid="WcJR3_ZGX0KAgVPkXMUonA" hash="6o_1vQ">I was privileged to serve very closely under four Presidents of the Church—Presidents David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, and Spencer W. Kimball. As a member of the Presiding Bishopric for twenty-four years, I sat in weekly meetings with the First Presidency and was privileged to be taught by these prophets of God. Prior to President Ezra Taft Benson’s call to be the President of the Church, I was released from the Presiding Bishopric. Although I have not had regular opportunities to meet with him, I have appreciated his leadership and have greatly benefited from his challenge to each member of the Church to study and ponder the truths of the Book of Mormon. Each of these five Presidents under whom I have served as a General Authority has had his own personality and style; yet I testify each is a prophet of God. Through my association with them, I have come to understand why we sustain them as prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/a-lifetime-of-learning.p4" pid="291RPHV58k2qXNojiKSAgg" hash="OyqFxw">In my experience with these Brethren and with other men and women in many parts of the world, I have found that the measure of a man is not necessarily his title or his position, but rather how he treats others—his peers, his supervisor, the cab driver, or the airline clerk after he has missed an important connecting flight. This is particularly true in how a man treats those closest to him—his wife and children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/a-lifetime-of-learning.p5" pid="1kmoKurTv0G9Ol6iwSEdIQ" hash="MqS2HQ">I once overheard a conversation between two friends of mine who are somewhat older than I and very successful in their professional pursuits. One said to the other, quietly, not realizing I could hear his comment, “You may think you love your wife, but I love Elizabeth twice as much as you do Rachel.” Each had been married over fifty years. Their greatest success, in my opinion, is the love and respect they have for their companions.</p>

	<p pid="nyrIumTYE0OXVe3bzlloHQ" hash="BF5BCA">I have been blessed to meet many young Church members who “walk in truth” and who have taught me so much through their quiet obedience to the Lord’s commandments. Let me share with you a few examples:</p>

          <p pid="it_M-SnE1UaHX2uo_lKdwg" hash="IIiHag">A fifteen-year-old Korean boy, a teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood, used his allowance each week to buy newspapers. Then he and his friends sold them on street corners in Seoul, giving the money to a classmate who couldn’t remain in school without this financial help. He wanted to know how it felt to be a Good Samaritan rather than just having an intellectual understanding of the lesson he had studied in the scriptures.</p>

          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="_1TwXGJRM0uGMVicvxmViw" hash="9j200w">Another teacher, a fourteen-year-old Tongan boy, had the same faith the Prophet Joseph Smith did at fourteen. He thought, “If, at my age, Joseph Smith could pray to God and get an answer to his prayers, why can’t I?” He prayed that he might somehow obtain an education to prepare him to help his people. The answer came when he received a full scholarship to the Church College of Hawaii without having applied for it. Since then he has used his education to bless his people.</p>

          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="T_KiEGd8hkOMiFrrnIYGVQ" hash="o80pRA">An eight-year-old girl, reared in a good home with parents who did not believe in God, on her own initiative learned the Lord’s Prayer and recited that prayer privately every day. Eventually she added her own words and finally began offering her personal prayers to her Heavenly Father. She knew He lived, even though her parents did not. A few days ago I had the honor of officiating at her marriage and sealing in the temple. Her mother was with her—the result of her daughter’s example.</p>

When asked afterward if it really was wise to ask a boy to pray who had only been in church the second time, he responded, “But I just spent three days this week teaching him how to pray.”</p>

There, Sister Brown and I, with the wonderful, devoted temple workers, had the privilege of associating daily with faithful members who came to the house of the Lord to perform sacred service. I had always intellectually understood and accepted the purposes and the ordinances of the temple, but now I know to the depths of my being the joyous, peaceful spirit of that service.</p>

The Spirit of the Lord distills upon one’s soul in these holy houses, truly the most sacred places on earth. A new perception comes into focus of who we are, of what this life is really about, of the opportunities of eternal life, and of our relationship with the Savior.</p>

At 5:00 <small>P.M.</small> came the news: his father’s heart ceased to beat. I’ll remember for the rest of my life how miserable and void of hope is a life without the comfort of the certainty of resurrection, of being eternally sealed as a family, of having the opportunity again to be with Heavenly Father.”</p>
