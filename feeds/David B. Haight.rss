      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p1" guid="0a09030b-7ec6-45f1-87c3-f777d634d6be" pid="8T69AhywakSGNswa3UW_Ew" hash="yDgx5Q">At a seminar held in Warsaw, Poland, attended by students and leaders of the Communist party, a student posed this question: “Please don’t be angry, sir, but could you explain the ‘meaning of life?’” Poland’s leading Marxist philosopher reported that as he glanced at the hundreds of pairs of eyes silently staring at the party leadership, he recognized the seriousness of this question and a weakness in their philosophy that has neglected to deal with this challenging problem.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p2" guid="8014a8be-0fce-4d25-8f4b-108c0a32ffbd" pid="MJg8i-gJoE6thSQq1Gk4hg" hash="buGhQA">We as members of this church know the meaning of life. It has been revealed in its truthfulness and purity and is available to all who seek, will listen, and believe. The mission and responsibility of this church and its members have been made abundantly clear—to proclaim the Lord’s teachings unto the entire world. We must be prepared to accomplish what the Prophet Joseph Smith proclaimed—to see that “the truth of God [goes] forth boldly, nobly … till it has penetrated every continent … swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished. …” <span class="emphasis">(Documentary History of the Church, </span>vol. 4, p. 540.) The Lord has said: “Prepare ye the way. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 65:1</a>.) Then it is our duty to prepare all of our members so that we might develop a strong foundation and belief in the true gospel of Jesus Christ. The Church-wide teacher development program was developed to help accomplish this purpose. It is now in various stages of implementation in the stakes and the wards and in English-speaking missions throughout the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p3" guid="3bde6629-f619-4d5f-9e6e-6f90225fe16d" pid="zBqWQelBDEaje4865YaH_w" hash="QlpWXw">The aim of the teacher development program is to improve teaching wherever teaching is done in priesthood quorums, auxiliary organizations, and in our homes so as to bring about worthwhile changes in the lives of boys and girls, men and women. The First Presidency initiated this program knowing full well the importance of the teaching moments in our classrooms and because of their conviction that all teachers can improve. This program combines the most effective teaching techniques with spiritual principles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p4" guid="f4d23780-8634-4337-835d-e93ade9533ef" pid="qkhIDe4wTE2PbEtD7quR_Q" hash="wVIIwg">This priesthood-sponsored program, directed by the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve, places the responsibility for its success with the stake presidents and then the bishops.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p5" guid="052f2f49-18fe-4d1e-854b-12f9b7c1789d" pid="RGRbHACbCkuIKMmgw9QnZQ" hash="uGpCiw">The able and highly competent committee appointed by the First Presidency, with Brother Rex Skidmore as chairman and Brother Ruel Allred, Sherman Sheffield, Stephen Covey, and others, has under inspiration developed what is now considered the most effective teaching program in use anywhere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p6" guid="023316b9-c0f3-4dad-b79b-f66ac89753ba" pid="Y-3ND9JQ3k2Gu5VuCl1U8A" hash="g3vpvA">You stake and ward leaders have performed magnificently with the instruction given to you through the Regional Representatives of the Twelve in organizing, ordering the material, and getting this program off to an auspicious start. There have been shipped to the wards, stakes, and missions 917,598 copies of instructional material. Even with this vast quantity shipped, we apologize to a few who have yet to receive some material, because your orders far exceeded the quantities estimated. A fourth printing was necessary. All back orders are being distributed this week.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p7" guid="759a1d9d-36e5-4439-930f-2f6ed255a0ca" pid="USRhTgkRXEC_C8-eS6hC2w" hash="sUmRIA">I am sure you would like to know how the teacher development program is progressing. The old adage that nothing succeeds like success certainly applies to this program. A stake teacher development director in Idaho reports, “We have now finished our sixth basic lesson in all of the wards. The stake inservice leaders contact me two weeks before the stake leadership meeting to review the filmstrips so they will be properly prepared for their meetings. There is a strong positive response in our stake. Participants taking the first basic course observed our present teaching and were shocked. Their eyes have been opened to the principles of effective teaching.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p8" guid="e466c44a-ed35-426f-b0e0-75918ce223ef" pid="3sIqkK4HjU-PNwGtFSfpxA" hash="tZkwaw">A Regional Representative of the Twelve reports, “Teacher development exceeding expectations. Excellent!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p9" guid="162a2153-fa6f-4fe3-9ca2-df0e628c29df" pid="t0WewsLtfEeibGPeLYvn4w" hash="zXUo8g">From California: “All ten wards in our stake are half through the basic course.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p10" guid="a571f259-8e34-4432-a786-b997302ba0e6" pid="F0hYtgjOlE6I84v_Y89cPw" hash="cpkhBw">When the Primary began these new inservice lessons, they had only one person teaching the entire group. Now the inservice leader has several Primary workers also as teachers, and they break up into smaller groups so everyone can be involved and report their experiences. Some were concerned with micro teaching. Now they use it and enjoy it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p11" guid="7eb3eecb-a8ee-4b32-b63e-5c8777ec5ee2" pid="V_EpNqUtz0iq5XDpoIQWnw" hash="hfIDTw">From a New York stake: “The teacher development materials are excellent and the concepts aid anyone in teaching. I have even used some of these techniques in the public school system.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p12" guid="d1494ee4-d364-4ff4-9d47-a78192c1121b" pid="abYxo_clxUKTT78SCT8TOw" hash="-te0wQ">“Members are asking to be enrolled in the basic course. They are ‘standing in line,’ my wife being one of them.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p13" guid="e7db5497-ef10-4bb5-9d09-9a5b422e35d2" pid="QorhBjbPXUC5yH1KScXvHw" hash="98_qjw">One lady reported her teaching improved after the second lesson. She began to use the <span class="emphasis">“eye </span>to <span class="emphasis">eye” </span>approach. She began to “teach with the <span class="emphasis">spirit </span>and <span class="emphasis">heart </span>rather than with the book.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p14" guid="37c8e605-108d-48da-ac7d-c8876aa17465" pid="0X-EYCaIm0urfg70QrlJxw" hash="poRP1g">This story from a Utah rural area: “Twenty-four years ago, as a young man, I was called to teach a Sunday School class of thirteen- and fourteen-year olds. I thought my first lesson was pretty good, but I didn’t have enough material to last through the class period. During my second lesson, again I was out of material. I resolved it would never happen again, but it did the next Sunday. I gave the books back to the Sunday School superintendent. All of these years I have carried a feeling that I was a failure as a teacher, yet I still wanted to teach.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p15" guid="edb98b97-28a3-4282-a681-b583a243badd" pid="wkoVnIwG-keyvG-P5CgAQw" hash="viicPA">“Now I have taken the basic course. I know what a teacher should be. I know how to prepare. I know how to involve my class, and now I am teaching and fulfilling my lifelong desire. I have developed a foundation for teaching.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p16" guid="64936e59-8209-4802-b95a-2967b01d97bd" pid="xwYhBt4inEmCmTLP76-xmA" hash="zif54Q">I am sure you have been impressed with the advice and encouragement that President Joseph Fielding Smith and President Harold B. Lee give to the entire Church membership in the film <span class="emphasis">You Make the Difference. </span>This film, which every stake has in its library, outlines the need and demonstrates the methods for calling the participants and implementing the program. The proper influencing of the behavior of individuals through enlightened knowledge is our challenge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p17" guid="371cc090-ff8b-44b5-bdb0-ff0c4b180ea0" pid="hMlOZyzgpkGVqYMLqxnkOw" hash="YNyNYQ">As you know, the program is in three phases:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p18" guid="ee5decec-1f94-4bf7-9811-5a053d6fca04" pid="vy38k-bQbUS-byWXh202GA" hash="82eHTA">First: The eleven-week basic course is conducted every week in wards and branches. When one group of participants is graduated, another group starts the course. All officers and teachers, as well as prospective teachers, at some time, should take the basic course.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p19" guid="14a37026-406e-4636-bc7c-a8560d64ee78" pid="uj6Z7wDYLEKMvEGA91HFAw" hash="iR6Zaw">Second: The monthly inservice lessons are for all priesthood and auxiliary officers and teachers, and will be a continuous program. Each year a new series of inservice lessons will be prepared. The second series will begin in September 1971. Inservice lessons for subsequent years are now in preparation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p20" guid="116becc7-f646-4701-beb5-04e72be413e6" pid="9PlmVpYj90qOQX3wguOfEw" hash="lBVOww">Third: “Supervision in Teaching” will be introduced in September 1971 with a supervision manual and other aids to assist the leaders and teachers to understand this new concept of effective supervision. This concept is not in its traditional use but is supervision using priesthood principles of love and understanding.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p21" guid="34f24108-ffaf-436f-b7f3-367840d4bc11" pid="lKTaH-2WoU6-hpeY9vlEng" hash="CluPXA">This entire teacher development program is being made available to units of the Church all over the world. Translation into sixteen languages is in progress. Non-English-speaking missions and stakes are receiving detailed instructions regarding distribution and suggested programming in their areas.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p22" guid="2ac90bf8-e947-4321-8387-8d53a6a19ef7" pid="-ccv2XmYTUimWbNb9I7mzw" hash="-mM_yw">To develop great teachers takes effort, dedication, faith, and believing—the kind of believing expressed by some graduate students involved in this program in one of the student wards at one of the large California universities: “We have studied this program, and we know the program is inspired. Our problem and challenge is to see that it is properly implemented and put into effective use.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p23" guid="401e29c3-47ff-4985-990e-9920b4383511" pid="6Rsr45TJw02BGVZWPBMEag" hash="YGusoA">The Church is now beginning an interesting period when members of this true church in increasing numbers will be able to proclaim “I know,” for they will have been effectively taught.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p24" guid="000880fa-794c-414f-87a2-4d5de70c0ab8" pid="1ux_P_W3Q0SALYws9y9fzA" hash="UBWbyA">It has been said that teaching is one of the noblest professions. The Savior gives us some insight into the importance of our teaching responsibilities as he admonished Peter in that great encounter on the seashore when he queried Peter: “… lovest thou me more than these?” And then, to the dismay of Peter, he repeated his instructions three times, saying, “Feed my lambs,” and then, “Feed my sheep. … Feed my sheep.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.15-17" class="scriptureRef">John 21:15–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/teach-one-another.p25" guid="c6af9c4c-f91e-4e5f-82c6-235dd333c27c" pid="e6Wo4feM_0KJ9mGwcqO-vg" hash="hYu-LQ">We must understand these instructions and our responsibility to “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:77</a>), but to teach it effectively so that all of us, our children, our children’s children, and generations yet unborn will be able to perceive and comprehend the true meaning of life as proclaimed by the Master, and then have a desire to live it and eventually gain exaltation in the kingdom of our Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

It was evident from his appearance and troubled look that he was seeking help. He had been a student at the Brigham Young University, married for two years, and now his wife was requesting a divorce. They had a young son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-foundation-whereon-men-cannot-fall.p3" guid="2a8d4e36-e869-4108-9fc0-f2d8bd93d084" pid="mnT6T2t7rU-phROzSssiiA" hash="8xjW3A">Filled with remorse, he told me how he had been unsuccessful in holding numerous jobs, had tampered with drugs, had taken a so-called treatment at a commune-type ranch, and had not assumed his responsibility of providing for his wife and infant son.</p>

His parents had separated. This young man was the product of a home where the parents ignored the teachings of the Church.</p>

He told of the close bond of love in his family. He said, “My buddies tried to persuade me to go into Saigon and live it up. This went on day after day, but I kept thinking of my family and their influence and the memories of our family home evenings and of my patriarchal blessing. It seemed to give me the courage I needed to resist them.”</p>

It promised me a temple marriage if I was worthy. After a while, my buddies were impressed with my conviction. They started to respect me and then wanted to know more.”</p>

But we are actually witnessing this tragic mistake taking place. Some houses are being built on sand.</p>

I thank the Lord that we will always be a missionary church. The first conversions in this dispensation came through the humble testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. His efforts were directed first to those he loved most. He converted his father, his mother, and his brothers and sisters. He converted his wife, his neighbors, then Martin Harris, and the schoolteacher, Oliver Cowdery, as well as the Whitmer family. They all felt of the truth and power of his simple testimony.</p>

The missionary system must be perpetuated by us. Our young men and women should be reared under the loving guidance and influence of a good home, a home where the blessing of a mission is part of each one’s life’s goal; a home where plans for his future mission become part of his life, such as a simple piggy bank on the shelf in the kitchen marked “For Johnny’s Mission,” a reminder of his dream.</p>

To be “with it,” he started to smoke and soon moved to marijuana and from marijuana to LSD. His father and mother now appeared old-fashioned to him. He moved from his parents’ home to live with his newfound friends in an old house. The house had extra rooms, so they invited a young lady—also on drugs—to move in. His father tried to visit him, to communicate through letters. But this young man now felt completely disenchanted with church and home. After these tragic mistakes, he finally came to his senses and moved home with his parents. He told me, “The devil seemed to be in charge of my life.”</p>

He said, “Bishops and teachers can’t do it all. Parents must teach their children of the pitfalls of evil.” This bishop then compared differences in priorities in the homes as reflected in his interviews with the youth. One girl said, “I know the gospel is true; I live it; I keep the commandments; no problems.” Another young lady remarked, “I don’t accept all of it; I’m battling with some parts; we never discuss it at home.”</p>

Strengthen your home. Teach your loved ones to distinguish between Satan and our Savior. Teach your loved ones that “all things which are good cometh of God; and that which is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, … and inviteth and enticeth to sin.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.12" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:12</a>.)</p>

He encouraged the saints as he wrote: “That the <span class="emphasis">trial </span>of <span class="emphasis">your faith, </span>being <span class="emphasis">much more precious </span>than of <span class="emphasis">gold that perisheth.</span> …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 1:7</a>, italics added.)</p>

When I asked, “You set the right example for the rest of the students, don’t you?” they replied, “We really try.” As they said “we really try,” I could see the light of belief and conviction in those youthful faces. I could begin to understand what Peter meant by our being “called out of the darkness into his marvellous light.”</p>

You of a noble birthright are different from your friends who are not members of Christ’s true church. You are a “chosen generation”; you live “in the world” but you do not follow worldly trends or habits which are contrary to your beliefs. May I remind you of only a few of the very special events in your life that cause you to be different. You have made some promises, and some eternal promises have been made to you.</p>

She wanted to be part of the group and thought, “Surely one little drink wouldn’t hurt—why not?” Then she realized her celestial kingdom goal. After that, she said, the ridicule didn’t matter. She had felt of his spirit and could feel of his influence at that moment.</p>

It has only the military base and a small coconut plantation. This young man has located six other LDS boys and they are now holding regular Church services. He wrote his mother telling of his opportunity now to prepare lessons for their priesthood meetings—young men on a tiny speck of land in a vast ocean recognizing and using their priesthood authority.

Freedom does not mean license, nor does it imply the absence of all restrictions and discipline. The Savior did not teach undisciplined, permissive-type freedom. When he said, “know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.32" class="scriptureRef">John 8:32</a>), he is telling us that his truth, if followed, would free us from falsity, from deception; that his gospel, if followed, would free us to gain eternal life.

The world may not comprehend what he said, but you can. You are different. You are a chosen generation. May you see the power of God resting on him as His prophet, as I testify to you it does, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

The Lord says that he is “to be like unto Moses— … a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the church.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.91-92" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:91–92</a>.)</p>

People were pricked in their hearts and asked, “… Men and brethren, what shall we do?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.37" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:37</a>.) And Peter, with that newly developed depth of conviction, replied, “… Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.38" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:38</a>.)

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/feed-the-flock.p2" pid="t2TophEVH0Cf1ejkChSfTA" hash="nJZBIw">We had stopped at an Army post exchange. Soldiers were milling around, and one of them recognized our Latter-day Saint chaplain. He came over to us with a cigarette partially hidden in his hand. When the chaplain introduced me as “one of the General Authorities,” he was so startled he nearly burned his hand trying to get rid of the cigarette. I put my arm around him and told him we were at the base for a brief meeting with our Church members, and hoped that he would attend. He made several excuses, but I said, “We will be honored if you come to our meeting. The Church cares about you. Come and join us. We’re your friends.” I think he could feel that I meant it. Before our meeting had ended that evening, he slipped in and joined us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/feed-the-flock.p3" pid="cj7NNKqnNUmi83704ibk5w" hash="qrrijA">Eugene Till, our mission president in Seoul, Korea, and Brent Anderson, one of our Latter-day Saint chaplains, were my companions as we traveled from the demilitarized zone to Pusan to visit our military bases. Meeting after meeting we talked to our servicemen, looked into their faces, shook their hands, and listened to their comments about their homes, their loved ones, and their home wards. Increasingly I began to feel some of the loneliness in their hearts. As I asked, “Are you hearing from your elders quorum? Does your family write often and encourage you to live the principles of the gospel?” the disappointment on their faces—and sometimes a cynical smile—gave me my answer. To the question “Does your bishop know you are here?” the reply was, “I don’t even think he cares. He is too busy to be concerned about me.” Of all those who attended our meetings—can you imagine—<span class="emphasis">only one</span> said he knew his ward leaders did care.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/feed-the-flock.p4" pid="3jE9rJds9U-Jwn_Kf3KeqA" hash="Tk0wWg">As we drove from base to base, a kaleidoscope of these disappointed faces kept crossing my mind. “Feed the flock of God which is among you,” Peter admonished. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/5.2" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 5:2</a>.) A clear impression came to me that I was witnessing a needless neglect and that I must tell this story. This lack of interest at home for these young men is not the Lord’s plan, not the way he has taught us. Many of us are not responding to the Church direction, not responding to our charge to “[teach] them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.20" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:20</a>.) This responsibility to teach and to encourage does not cease because they are out of sight; in fact, our interest must be intensified. Our concern is not for the career military Church member who, with his family, adds great strength to local Church units, but for the young men—mostly single, lonely, exposed to the evil enticements and temptations that can be part of military life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/feed-the-flock.p5" pid="snHFSc2cxE-X7NqBJHSOKQ" hash="A3GlfA">There is a growing number without benefit of a mission or college disappearing into the military. The Selective Service has been discontinued. However, the armed forces are successful in recruiting. Your stake reports indicate we now have more in the military than in the mission field. Nearly 20,000 of your sons—and some daughters—are in the military service. President Kimball is asking for more full-time missionaries. Why shouldn’t parents, bishops, and elders presidents treat these 20,000 in the military as missionaries? You know they are—whether for good or not. You are their Church leaders and should be continually encouraging them. What a glorious opportunity. But you might say, “Oh, there is a difference!” Do you recall a modern prophet saying, “Every member a missionary”? Shouldn’t you give your son in the military this same attention? You have the obligation. Many thrilling missionary stories have involved our men in the military. At a base in Thailand, out of 18 members at our meeting, 11 had recently joined the Church, and two had converted their wives back home. These stories go on and on. Unfortunately, there are two sides.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/feed-the-flock.p6" pid="k7jiNbZxKkyCcyUHEDuJMA" hash="e2PA_w">A chaplain reported: “There is a universal absence of mail from home—from parents, from priesthood leaders. Parents, particularly of inactive young people, do not keep in touch with their sons or daughters.” The chaplain continued, “Nobody seems to care but the Latter-day Saint chaplains and the prostitutes, and, sir, that makes competition pretty tough.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/feed-the-flock.p7" pid="P5SoYrHqwEyRjex_BPBdUw" hash="ZzSfAg">A number of Latter-day Saint girls are joining the military. Bishops, counsel our young women concerning the grave dangers and pitfalls because of the lack of moral guidance. A Latter-day Saint chaplain responsible for women on a large base said: “They are painfully alone, many struggling with repentance versus the world and desperately needing to feel support from parents and the Church. Otherwise, they find understanding elsewhere.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/feed-the-flock.p8" pid="F5otQbDjsE--Q_RtJGtoTw" hash="8pzdpQ">Many of the single men are floundering on the cutting edge of sin. They are saying, “<span class="emphasis">Please help me.</span>” There is no hometown moral support that goes unappreciated.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/feed-the-flock.p9" pid="7Yd_V86ULUGZyqtRF2Ftgw" hash="SqU-JA">How important is a letter? At a testimony meeting far from home, a young man said: “The devil had me convinced that I was a forgotten soul. Why not sin a little? Then a letter from Mom, one from my bishop, and a letter from our ward’s executive secretary finally caught up with me—one, two, three. I’d prayed for reassurance, but never had I felt such a sense of being important! Three letters to prove it. All in one mail call! I thank God for those few who care.”</p>

All too often young people enter military service because they feel unwanted or unloved, and they can become completely demoralized in this new environment when there is little or no encouragement to hold high the standards and goals of their lives. One bishop writing to a young man admitted, “While praying for our servicemen, I suddenly realized my prayers were useless without some action.” Then, in a letter, he expressed his love for this boy and asked, “How can I help you?” The young serviceman, with tears, said, “My bishop cares.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/feed-the-flock.p11" pid="qnBD2foNPkSYGND14nU_Yw" hash="JK-zYg">A Latter-day Saint chaplain, whose office was near the mailroom, reported, “Daily, brokenhearted men and boys poured out their sorrow to me after they had looked again and again in their empty mailboxes. Some, in the depths of their hurt, swore they would never write another letter, and some of them, I’m sad to report, kept that unwise threat and watched their family ties disintegrate. Others would say that ‘no mail’ was proof of ‘no love or concern’ and that they were therefore justified in seeking affection from professional lovers. The old saying ‘We live or die at the mailroom’ never was truer than in the military.”</p>

During her busy days caring for our five children and attending school, she completed every day by writing me a letter. Think of it! Almost 400 days without a single miss!”</p>

Flood them with affection, letters, tapes, cards, packages, birthday and holiday greetings of all types. Give your Young Adults, teenagers, and others in your ward a stimulating project. Sixteen-year-old Debbie Trujillo wrote a serviceman, “Hi. My name is Debbie Trujillo, and I’ve just been baptized in the Church. I don’t know much about you, but our class is doing this project, and I think it’s neat.” The serviceman said, “I hope my reply can be as sweet and uplifting as her letter.”</p>

After one of our chaplains had helped a member change his life, the man brought to the chaplain’s office a hand-sculptured model of a sheep and said that he felt as if he had been the one sheep for which we had left the ninety-and-nine. The chaplain writes, “I keep this little sheep on my desk as a reminder that in the military when we leave the 99, we always find more than one.”</p>

The Savior’s mission is to try to save all. The shepherd leaves the ninety-and-nine pastured safely and goes into the mountains to seek that one that has strayed. “When he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:5–6</a>.)

She sweeps previously unswept corners, even lights a candle. By her diligence it is recovered. “And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one … that repenteth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.9-10" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:9–10</a>.)</p>

He said, “We must do things differently and better!” Several times he issued the challenge, “Why can’t we?” (“Lengthening Our Stride,” unpublished Regional Representative Seminar Address, Oct. 3, 1974, p. 4.) Our visits to stakes indicate this message is getting through.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p2" pid="rwwtUtafQEqshkpQLyOrUw" hash="y6s9Ug">Recently I heard of a far-sighted home teacher in an elders quorum who was given the name of an inactive member. On his way to priesthood meeting early one Sunday morning, he called at the home of this member.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p3" pid="jHqIf9-JXU6wqYIQtvYtXg" hash="2Mrxyw">“I’m on my way to priesthood meeting and thought you might like a ride.”</p>

He wondered how the Church got his name.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p5" pid="9JK3Et01eUGUd8gP_UqoMQ" hash="6yNNrA">The following Sunday morning again the doorbell rang. The member opened the door and saw this same individual, bright and smiling, on his way to priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p6" pid="DzRG_Q7vjkCKSZqYnRkePA" hash="HL38vA">“Just dropped by in case you had changed your mind. We would like you to join us.”</p>

The home teacher added, “We have a great group of men. We need you. You’re a member of our quorum. Would you mind if I stop by next Sunday?” This man, who wanted to get lost from activity, decided the only way to stop his early-morning caller was to go to the meeting and prove he was not interested.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p9" pid="kjhMpMctgEKTkPHXOly7jQ" hash="XLFqtA">The next Sunday when the home teacher rang the doorbell, he was not greeted with a “Go away! Leave me alone!” but with a man dressed and ready to prove his disinterest. But the spirit of the priesthood meeting, the friendly handclasps, the sincere interest changed his attitude and awakened the conscience of a man who needed a gentle push.</p>

This challenge should stimulate our best efforts, cause us to ponder, to study better ways. He does not have a magic button to push, only you, the priesthood leaders. He is saying to you, “Why can’t we do better, be better?” He highlights the urgency today—not tomorrow—today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p11" pid="moVAHIMGZ0SjyZACGbnzLA" hash="YXoYmg">The Church could not function effectively in helping the Lord accomplish his divine purpose unless sufficient power and authority were delegated. This is the principal reason for the Lord bestowing on men the holy priesthood to act in his name, to have the power and right to assist him in his divine purpose. The Savior said, “[teach] them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.20" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:20</a>.) Inactive fathers and husbands must first be found and then taught how to live the gospel.</p>

He reports wonderful success in reactivating members. Home teaching is their success tool. They use filmstrips to help teach and motivate the inactive. Seven quorum members have each purchased a film projector which home teachers use in the homes of the inactive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p13" pid="f4UmRRRYu0uOTbXt8Sswfw" hash="ySQPgg">One prospective elder had remarked, “Don’t send the home teachers to my home anymore.” This man and his wife were visiting at the home of another inactive member when the home teachers arrived with their film projector. He saw the filmstrip, his heart was touched, and the home teachers were invited to again visit his home. These understanding home teachers helped bring him back.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p14" pid="DN4CyF4rJkWO7gnPaCRQww" hash="ML7tkQ">The leaders of this quorum selected the best qualified to teach a gospel study seminar, inviting four couples at a time to this discussion group where they learn gospel truths. All ninety-three members of this quorum have been identified and are being contacted. The elders president said, “We don’t have any failures, only minor setbacks.” All but four members are now receiving the home teachers, and, he says, “And we’ll get those four.”</p>

After appointing a husband as chairman of a committee, his wife is called to assist him and becomes involved. The men of this quorum camped overnight in the mountains and for six hours they reported they sat around a campfire discussing the Church. The elders president reported, “We had a real spiritual feast.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p16" pid="ZtM1fpQr60Ccr4vLysX1MQ" hash="lXTStQ">As soon as a man is ready for a calling, the quorum president assists the bishop in developing an appropriate position for him. When the leaders began having proper priesthood interviews, home teaching increased from 30 to almost 100 percent. This quorum has been resourceful in developing new ideas, but they attribute their success to the dedication of home teachers plus the blessings of the Lord.</p>

President Gerloch has caught the vision of how to recover the lost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p19" pid="ssL8ij_5sUSP1nO1s0hFyQ" hash="UdZz3Q">Today stake presidents are calling Melchizedek quorum leaders who are being taught and trained in effective principles of priesthood organization and reactivation. These new leaders are alert and not like the farmer Elder Sterling Sill referred to who was hauling produce to market in his wagon drawn by two horses. The horses were having a difficult time and the grade seemed very steep. Finally the farmer asked a stranger, “How far is it to the top of this hill?” The stranger said, “You’re not on a hill. Your rear wheels are off.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p20" pid="uvB86fRJgkiZNY1ig0ZAJQ" hash="UoPSgw">Recently a man told how he became lost in the middle of a ward with 500 members: “My wife and I had our first contact with the Church when two sweet, spiritual missionaries called. They came, they taught, they converted. We literally lived off their spirit. Like many converts know, the first thing after you are baptized, those two wonderful elders are transferred.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p21" pid="kyA4LXJDjk-TC6tAMT3aVQ" hash="_R4Ckw">“It was extremely difficult for us to keep that same spirit. We felt we could not go it alone. We withdrew from Church activity. My wife told the visiting teachers not to come back, and the home teachers were asked to leave us alone.</p>

One day there came a knock at our front door. As I opened it, I saw a young, smiling, freckled-faced man who said he was the elders quorum president and asked if he could talk to me for a few minutes.</p>

Sometimes he came just to talk. He got me involved in the sports program. He even apologized for anyone who may have hurt our feelings. What did he do that got us back? He loved us. He was sincere. He cared. He gave me his personal testimony. He helped me to search my soul. He helped me to pray to my Father in heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/why-can-t-we.p24" pid="d1kMzXsOgEafdNpaVXVzBQ" hash="Caf0dA">“For the love this man gave my family, we will be eternally grateful.

My wife is teaching Primary and is a visiting teacher. I was lost, but because someone cared, someone took time, someone took the risk of showing his love and concern, I was found and was able to lead my family back to the Lord.” He went on to say, “I plead with all members of the Church to look around and help guide lost children back to their Heavenly Father.”</p>

There occurred an incident which some writers regard as a culminating point of the Savior’s ministry. You recall that he asked the Twelve two momentous questions. First, he asked, “Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.13" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:13</a>.) The apostles spoke words of soberness and truth but made the admission that the Messiah had not been recognized by the world which he came to save. The apostles repeated the guesses of the people. Some said he was John the Baptist; some said he was a new Elijah; others saw in him the tenderness of Jeremiah and thought that <span class="emphasis">he</span> had come. And many looked on him as a prophet. The light had shone in the darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.5" class="scriptureRef">John 1:5</a>.) We can only imagine the disappointment as the Savior directed the second question to the apostles when he said: “But whom say ye that I am?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.15" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:15</a>.)</p>

It is inspiring to watch and, when appropriate, participate with the First Presidency as they prepare for the rapid expansion of the gospel of Jesus Christ to every corner of the earth. It will be successful. It must be accomplished by us. He has declared: “I am Jesus Christ; I came by the will of the Father, and I do his will. Learn of me, and listen to my words.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.24,23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:24, 23</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:25</a>.) As of today the Church is even more effectively prepared to reach and encourage all men to hearken unto His voice, for His everlasting covenant is established and is a standard for His people. They are to be messengers and prepare the way before Him. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.2,9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:2, 9</a>.) Inhabitants of the earth are to receive the gospel that the kingdom of God might go forth. The Lord has said, “Thou [meaning us] shalt declare glad tidings, … publish it upon the mountains, … upon every high place, … among every people that thou shalt be permitted to see.</p>

The theme is “Families Are Forever.” Families are instructed to place a number of items on a table, among which are a marriage certificate, a temple recommend, a picture of a temple, and a baptismal certificate. Family members are then asked to explain their relationship.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/families-are-forever.p6" pid="aGnKlLbdyEq9t8ktGdnIZA" hash="-x9s-g">Church members know that all of these items placed on the table have a relationship to temple marriage and the possibility of a “forever family.” This afternoon I would like to highlight one of those items on the table—the baptismal certificate.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/families-are-forever.p7" pid="YU7hzEQg_kKPrCzOtIgalg" hash="kwJLKg">A “forever family” requires that couple possess baptismal certificates, be worthy members of the Church to qualify for temple recommends, and possess a marriage certificate signifying a celestial marriage. Now what about the millions of our Heavenly Father’s children who, if they were baptized, could receive blessings which would lead to becoming an eternal family?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/families-are-forever.p8" pid="RfYAhJ9DGEyn-sby1xgxJA" hash="98K5Zg">Our full-time missionaries are having increasing success in all parts of the world in bringing souls into the waters of baptism. But their success could be multiplied many times if they had the enthusiastic cooperation of the members of the Church. It would seem most members of the Church have a built-in reluctance to share the gospel with their friends and neighbors. Many of us take pride in referring to the growth of the Church or the success of the worldwide missionary effort but have never fellowshipped an acquaintance or a neighbor. When returning mission presidents are asked, “How could you have had more conversions in your mission,” we hear the same reply: “If only we could get the members to assist the missionaries by preparing their friends and neighbors to receive the elders.”</p>

To a missionary, every hour is precious and must be productive. Do you realize missionaries baptize about one person for every 1,000 homes they tract? These same missionaries will baptize 600 people for every 1,000 who are taught in the homes of members—600 times more converts when members participate with conviction.</p>

Missionaries are going out better trained, better prepared, with higher hopes and aspirations. Every family that has accepted the gospel is obligated to share it with its neighbor. We can interest people in the gospel by just being natural and sincerely showing our love for them.

I think we must change our sights and raise our goals.” (Spencer W. Kimball, “When the World Will Be Converted,” Regional Representatives Seminar, April 4, 1974.)</p>

The name of this woman eventually found its way to some full-time lady missionaries laboring in her city in Pennsylvania. After the missionaries’ first contact with her, they wrote, “Mrs. Davis was extremely gracious. You should have seen the light in her eyes when she met us. Brother Cummings had planted a most fertile seed with his testimony and confidence that he and his loved ones would be together after this life. As missionaries we felt at peace.

They knocked on the door, were warmly greeted, and invited in. An invitation was extended to this neighbor family to come and hear a world leader and a prophet of God. The family agreed to attend.</p>

They are now members of the Church, a potential “forever family.” Before this family was baptized, this high councilor wrote, “I tremble to think that because of my reluctance to share the gospel with my neighbors, this choice family would have lost the blessings of the gospel. Oh, that every Church member could feel this wonderful experience!”</p>

For a brief few hours many in the world, believers and nonbelievers, will have recalled to their minds through pictures, stories, and messages in the media or from church pulpits the final events culminating in the death and resurrection of our Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p4" pid="6WuoP54lLEi1lbpwo0nGHw" hash="gZK2Ig">The fragmentary accounts of the Savior’s brief ministry are sufficient to give us at least a small feeling of His great love. His desire is to help us. He will give to each of us as much of His own spirit as we are prepared to accept. His work and glory is to save all mankind. As I read and ponder Christ’s teachings, given to help us understand His purposes, and as I witness the miraculous events occurring today in the spreading of His work, I feel a swelling in my bosom—a testimony of their eternal truth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p5" pid="IfcJMjzFx0uEkDekS4C7kg" hash="LRf6Ag">Shortly before the Savior’s betrayal and the subsequent events that will be celebrated next week, an event now known as the Transfiguration occurred, which I am sure was meant for our spiritual enlightenment as well as for those who were personal witnesses.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p6" pid="dYOq1gzNiUyk87nbMKep7g" hash="yPB3rw">The New Testament writers tell us the Savior took with Him the three dearest and most enlightened of His apostles and went up a lofty mountain—Luke says simply “a mountain” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/9.28" class="scriptureRef">Luke 9:28</a>)—to find a secluded spot where He could kneel in prayer and prepare for the events soon to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p7" pid="crMCfrQ1bk2daw_3CDGsgw" hash="NOzuoQ">It must have been early evening when the Savior ascended the mountain with those three chosen witnesses—James and John, known as the “sons of thunder,” and Peter, the “man of rock.” Perhaps Jesus felt not only a sense of the heavenly calm which that solitary opportunity for communion with His Father would bring, but even more, a sense that He would be supported in the coming hour by ministrations not of this earth. He was to be illuminated with a light which needed no aid from the sun or the moon or the stars. He went up to prepare for His coming death. He took His three apostles with Him in the belief that they, after having seen His glory—the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father—might be fortified, that their faith might be strengthened to prepare them for the insults and humiliating events which were to follow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p8" pid="w7li2Wi-XUKaUKAzkFVm2Q" hash="PKb5Qw">We learn from what has been written that the Savior, finding a secluded place, knelt and prayed; and as He prayed to His Father, He was elevated far above the doubt and wickedness of the world which had rejected Him. As He prayed He was transfigured. His countenance shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the snow fields above them. He was enwrapped in an aura of glistening brilliance—His whole presence reflected such a divine radiance that the light of the sun or the white of the snow are the only things to which the evangelists can compare that celestial scene. Two figures appeared by His side. There stood by Him Moses and Elijah. When the prayer was ended, the coming ordeal undoubtedly accepted, then the full glory fell upon Him, from heaven—a testimony of His divine Sonship and power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p9" pid="JXrrOLDTbkyoAEAeV_4tKw" hash="XxNRYw">Luke’s account indicates that the three apostles did not witness the beginning of this marvelous transfiguration. The three apostles, as they would later be at Gethsemane, were heavy with sleep, the account says. But they were suddenly startled into wakefulness. Then they saw and heard. In the darkness of the night the apostles saw an intense light and the glorified form of their Lord. Beside Him, in that same glory of light, were two persons whom they knew or heard to be Moses and Elijah. Undoubtedly they spoke with Jesus of His coming death at Jerusalem.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p10" pid="1dbyvlMjR0CXF24c9y1HjA" hash="26TA9Q">As the vision began to fade, Peter, the account says, spoke the first thoughts that came to his mind, and, apparently anxious to delay the departure of the heavenly visitors, said: “Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee and one for Moses, and one for Elias.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/9.33" class="scriptureRef">Luke 9:33</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p11" pid="vvLHRJVzJUmGhgvYsIyahw" hash="6LR2Jw">They may have been surprised at the inappropriate proposal made by the eager Peter, who would yet learn the meaning of the night’s events. But even as Peter spoke, a bright cloud of brilliant light overshadowed Jesus and his heavenly visitors, Moses and Elijah, and also the three apostles; and a voice was heard: “This is my beloved Son: hear him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/9.35" class="scriptureRef">Luke 9:35</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p12" pid="upwDisGwdUqRLYoZ60y2bg" hash="D1PZ5Q">The three apostles fell prostrate and hid their faces. How long it was before Jesus came to them and touched them is not clear from the account; but when they raised their eyes, it was all over. The bright cloud had vanished. The gleams of light, the shining countenances had passed away; they were alone with Jesus. Now only the light from the stars was on the mountain slopes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p13" pid="dXvraP8y3UuefdohrGc1Aw" hash="XUWo1w">After such an experience, the apostles may have hesitated to rise; but Jesus, now appearing as they had seen Him before He knelt in prayer, touched them saying, “Arise, and be not afraid.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/17.7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 17:7</a>.) He was their dear friend.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p14" pid="j8YEG4yxlk-rRSIRGvfHcw" hash="_8faRQ">The day was probably dawning as they descended the mountain. Jesus instructed them to tell no man until He had risen from the dead. The vision was for them; it was to be pondered over by them in depths of their own hearts. They were not even to tell the other apostles. They kept Christ’s instructions but could not understand the full meaning. They could only ask each other, or wonder in silence, what this resurrection from the dead could mean. But they now knew more fully than ever that their Lord was indeed the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p15" pid="iUP0md5eKk2Sj-CHK_tc0w" hash="VlgFJg">Though difficult for us to understand, Jesus himself must have been strengthened and sustained by Moses and Elijah to prepare Him for the suffering and agony ahead for Him in working out the infinite and eternal atonement of all mankind. An angel from heaven would again in a few days strengthen Him when He would sweat great drops of blood in the Garden of Gethsemane.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p16" pid="I-D4B9qQZk6Kk_fkfl_CwQ" hash="LtnSfg">The three chosen apostles were taught of His coming death and also His resurrection, teachings that would strengthen each of them in the eventful days ahead.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/we-beheld-his-glory.p18" pid="4ynqYQe2BEuNBp-gXDqtKg" hash="Ks1D5g">“For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>

These three were yet to be taken to a spot in Gethsemane where they would behold his suffering as He took upon Himself the sins of the world that He might redeem us from the Fall and through His resurrection demonstrate to us that He is the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh and show unto us that He is the Redeemer of the world.</p>

Christ Himself, followed by Moses, Elias, and Elijah, appeared to Joseph and Oliver in the Kirtland Temple, giving authority and committing other essential keys of this dispensation. The Prophet’s own words of this event record:</p>

There still are vast areas of the world living in spiritual darkness and waiting for the true word of God. Even though we as a Church point with pride at the large number of missionaries serving in the world, many more missionaries are needed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/young-women-real-guardians.p3" pid="8DADlh1QIk-1CzRf2FDGKw" hash="ADQLSA">A Church family in a city or a town anywhere in the world will bring another family into the Church. Soon missionaries are involved. A small branch develops, then wards and a stake. The process goes on and on in a miraculous way with local Saints and missionaries bringing the good tidings and new hope to people everywhere. The Church missionary force will continue to grow. The 25,000 young men now serving will become 35,000, then 50,000. No hand can stop the work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/young-women-real-guardians.p4" pid="QuHi-Kiu8E2uGgstAsB_JA" hash="JBBEXA">But it is sad and disappointing to see the names of young men in many wards not able to take advantage of the divine direction: “Send forth the elders of my church unto the nations; … the islands of the sea; … unto foreign lands; call upon all nations.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 133:8</a>.) Some of our choice young men have been caught up in the ways of a permissive society.</p>

I desire to be appropriate and correct in what I say, but because of necessity and the urgency concerning this matter, I must be very direct and candid.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/young-women-real-guardians.p6" pid="1YTiD9IQdkaKPzPMsAN5fA" hash="wWMlaA">Some young men cannot go on missions because they are not worthy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/young-women-real-guardians.p7" pid="cfmQoBYMTUiYtyWnmIkGvg" hash="vIgHAw">I challenge the young women of the Church who associate with and date our young priesthood bearers to become real guardians of their morality. You can. You must. Many of you are. Please do not underestimate your role. I am aware that the total responsibility is not yours. However, on a date you can set the proper atmosphere to encourage your companion to honor the commandments of God. In fact, you have the opportunity to emphasize the Mormon ideals of womanhood in all their honor and glory. I know the Lord expects it to be so.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/young-women-real-guardians.p8" pid="XET1ezXsVEa3icEayjdEsA" hash="zpqBMA">You young ladies have a profound influence on young, masculine behavior. Young men wear clothes they think you like. Their hair will be cut to please you. You can control how fast they drive their cars if you want. They will dress as grubby as you like. You need not dress in the extreme fashions of the world. Are you aware that fashions and styles are promoted because someone has a product to sell? The rightness or appropriateness or effect on a youthful society does not matter as long as it sells. But the day will come when the world will follow the ways of the Church. Its influence will be as though flowing from the stars to affect the actions of men. Your influence with young men is important. You encourage Church standards and dress and conduct.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/young-women-real-guardians.p9" pid="CWnsz_w47kSzTVhNYU5p4w" hash="tq4Sjg">Interviews with some prospective missionaries regretfully indicate that some actions involving young women are most disappointing. Some are even ugly and are far, far different from what is expected of you. The Savior knew so well our weaknesses. He warned: “Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit … is willing, but the flesh is weak.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.41" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:41</a>.)</p>

The young man you are with in a car or at home is needed in the Lord’s work. Hundreds, even thousands more like him are needed—prepared in the Lord’s way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/young-women-real-guardians.p11" pid="AQ7IcnwOMEevQOn_sgdp1g" hash="vJ7xTw">The young men you are dating are in training for missions and hold the priesthood. Bishops have found these young men worthy. Hands have been placed upon their heads. They have received the priesthood of God. Just think. The Lord has given them authority to preach, teach, expound, exhort, baptize—a divine commission to act for and in behalf of the Lord Himself. The young man you may be with probably is a priest. He wants to be worthy to receive the higher priesthood and, if worthy, to someday have authority and keys of spiritual blessings. He is not “just another young man.” He is a very special young man. He is in training. He is going on a mission. You can be a great blessing to him. You, a young lady he admires, can help him avoid serious pitfalls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/young-women-real-guardians.p12" pid="1Jo9gS4fWEafhKeEszZceg" hash="MWT1Qw">Young men—maturing, learning, and forming habits—have ideals and special persons they admire. You may be such a person. In a matter of months these young men will become missionaries and will be blessed so as to be able to teach investigators by the Spirit. The Lord said, “And the Spirit shall be given … by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:14</a>.) Our missionaries teach and testify by the Spirit. But they must be in tune with the Lord. Hoping for the Spirit is not enough. Praying is not enough. Missionaries must do what the Lord requires: live the commandments, be clean, be wholesome in deed and thoughts. “The Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.36" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:36</a>.)</p>

The Psalmist is teaching the necessity of clean actions that comply with divine law—a pure heart, pure thoughts, a desire to live in harmony with the Lord and to love Him.</p>

We drove far up into the hills. No one was near. After several hours he finally revealed the problem he had been hiding and his feeling of guilt. He was ashamed of what he had done. I listened. We talked it out. Then we watched a missionary virtually come to life with the spirit of his calling.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/young-women-real-guardians.p16" pid="3TknVLHglkOoerv0VNxV6A" hash="EETsug">Most missionary concerns are worthiness concerns, the product of their dating and social activities. The Lord’s instruction to “Go ye into all the world, and preach … to every creature” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/16.15" class="scriptureRef">Mark 16:15</a>) involves us all—all who have taken upon themselves the name of Christ. All members of His Church—the old, the young—everyone is involved. Young men at an appropriate age are called by the prophet to leave home and go out in the world. Others serve and spread the gospel at home. Some give financial support. But every member is obligated to be part of the Lord’s plan to spread and share the gospel. You young women have a vital role in this preparation and pretraining of our young men. If you live worthily and develop a strong, positive self-image of your divine role of joint-inheritor of the fulness of all things, you will be a blessing to the young men who may come under your influence.</p>

Help our young men stay morally clean that they might be worthy and spiritually prepared to serve the Lord. You young women also have a duty to serve the Lord, to honor womanhood according to the Church beliefs and not the world’s. One of your most important obligations is to be and remain clean and pure. When you are clean and pure, the young men you date will be clean and pure. If a young man makes inappropriate advances, you have a sacred obligation to say, “No. I do not do that. Please don’t ask me or try to entice me to submit to conduct that is offensive to the Lord.”</p>

Refrain from early dating or going steady. Avoid at all cost the familiarity trap. Instead of spending time in a lovers’ lane, why not develop your minds and your personalities? You both have talents to develop and to share.</p>

It will be accomplished by you, the youth of the Church, through your faith and strength. Don’t be discouraged at seemingly overwhelming odds in your desire to live and to help others live God’s commandments. At times it may seem like David trying to fight Goliath. But remember, David did win.</p>

The Lord, in a rather personal revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1829 to John Whitmer, said, “The thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may bring souls unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/15.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 15:6</a>.)</p>

The Lord said, “If ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work.” Missionaries are expected to serve “with all [their] heart[s], might, mind[s] and strength.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.3,2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:3, 2</a>.) Wouldn’t it be a great source of satisfaction to you young women to know that you have helped a young man visualize the majesty of his call and have encouraged him to become an outstanding modern missionary. Many of our young men are. We need them all to be that kind of missionary. The Lord has said, “The field is … already to harvest; … he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, … bringeth salvation to his soul.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:4</a>.)

You young women have a vital role in converting the world to the gospel of Jesus Christ. You can encourage, influence, and even shield a young man at a critical time in his life. The Lord holds to this promise: “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard … the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:9</a>.) You demonstrate your love for the Lord when you help a young man remain worthy and prepared to serve the Lord.</p>

Sometimes people believe in little or nothing, nevertheless, they give up their lives to that little or nothing. One life is all we have, and we live it as we believe in living it, and then it’s gone. But to surrender what you are, and live without belief—that’s more terrible than dying—more terrible than dying young.” (Maxwell Anderson, “Joan of Lorraine,” New York: Dramatists’ Play Service, 1945, act 2, scene 4.)</p>

May there come forth through your efforts generations of young men in the Church who have spiritually been born of God, who reflect his Spirit in their countenances. You possess a divine key given by the Creator to lock or unlock, destroy or bless, that can make young men become as great as they ought to be.</p>

To this truth I testify in the holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Man and woman have the possibility of a “continuation of the seeds forever and ever” and will never have an end (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 132:19</a>).

I remind you of these eternal principles in a welfare meeting because this is the heart of our welfare services work—to lift, to sanctify, to bless so that individuals who have been helped can become more like God, whose sons and daughters they are.</p>

In the early 1930s times were very difficult. Incomes dropped sharply; some incomes even ceased. Millions were out of work. The event which had caused such suffering was the Great Depression.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-stake-presidents-role-in-welfare-services.p4" pid="9JVRzb99tkOZXePGE87tXQ" hash="cluYBA">The United States’ national income declined more than 50 percent. Farm income fell more than 50 percent. Unemployment rose to 25 percent of the labor force. Statistics, however, only hint at the real story of tragedy and suffering experienced by so many.</p>

The Southgate Ward of the Salt Lake Grant Stake, with 173 families, had 110 heads of families without work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-stake-presidents-role-in-welfare-services.p6" pid="jFv98K9TI0C9Y67FhUUOSw" hash="Vb7EsA">I lived through those hard years and saw firsthand what it was like. I had studied economics and business in college with the desire of becoming a banker. I completed my schooling shortly after the beginning of the depression and came to Salt Lake City, only to find that bankers were, as they then said, “ten cents a dozen.” I found a job in a department store and was paid fifteen dollars per week and was fortunate to have a job. I learned the rewards of hard work.</p>

Anthony W. Ivins, counselor to President Grant, was standing on the steps of the bank. He said to the people, “There’s money here in the bank if you want it. There is no need to cause a run on the bank. There’s money here for your deposits.” And the people started to drift away because Brother Ivins was a symbol of integrity and confidence.</p>

I witnessed how the Church welfare plan successfully helped people to help themselves.</p>

This plan was to establish a system, directed by the leaders of the Church, which would do away with idleness, abolish the dole, and foster industry, thrift, and self-respect among our people. The major objectives of this plan were to help people to help themselves and to re-enthrone work as the ruling principle in the lives of Church members. (See Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 3.)</p>

After all, the Church then was relatively small and its resources limited. It depended entirely on voluntary efforts for money, leadership, and strength. Nevertheless, the intent and guiding principles were clear, and the promise was that faithful adherence to these principles would meet people’s emergency and temporary needs.</p>

In most instances, the world’s way dismissed the principle of individual work and family responsibility and adopted the philosophy that “the government will take care of our needs” or “the government owes us a living.” Individual and family initiative was supplanted by government handouts. The true spirit of love for our neighbor and concern for others as taught by the Savior had been generally ignored.</p>

Today we have second- and third-generation welfare recipients. Millions have learned how to live off the government. Children are growing up without knowing the value and the dignity of work. The government has succeeded in doing what the Church welfare program seeks to prevent.</p>

The inspired Church welfare plan is administered on the principle that an individual is responsible to care for himself; where his resources are not adequate, family members are to assist. Where the family is unable to meet the needs of the individual, the Church stands ready to help. The Lord’s way emphasizes individual work and responsibility and encourages people to help themselves.</p>

W. R. Poage, United States Representative from Texas, in speaking about the state of Utah’s Work Experience and Training program, which is one of the few government programs requiring those receiving assistance to work, “said Utah’s strong work ethic, largely influenced by the philosophy of the Church has helped in establishing this program.” He continued, “‘The <span class="emphasis">government should help people help themselves.</span>’” (<span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> 25 Aug. 1978, p.

There is evidence that some of our people are receiving something for nothing from the government. The fact that this condition exists in the Church highlights the need of our members to be knowledgeable about Church welfare principles. President Kimball has stated: “No true Latter-day Saint, while physically or emotionally able, will voluntarily shift the burden of his own or his family’s well-being to someone else” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>May 1978, p. 79).</p>

Anciently, Zion was portrayed as a very large tent which was held in place by cords fastened to stakes (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/54.2" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 54:2</a>). Your stake is a distinctive entity, in which you and your priesthood leaders teach those divine principles.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Third,</span> you have a stake welfare services committee including yourself, your counselors, the high council, the chairman of the stake bishops’ council, and the stake Relief Society presidency. In this meeting, the principles relating to welfare resources are identified and used by bishops to help those in temporary need. In this committee the establishment or addition of welfare services production projects is carefully analyzed and evaluated. Study is given to such resources as welfare commodity production, the calling of Church service specialists, and the training of bishops and high councilors who teach quorum presidents in personal and family preparedness. This stake welfare services committee meeting, more than any other, makes it possible for each stake president to give inspired leadership to welfare services.</p>

Bishops need to exchange ideas, evaluate the storehouse system, and identify work opportunities for those receiving assistance.

These meetings enable you to teach prevention and rehabilitation aspects of welfare services. Your high councilors assist you in teaching the Melchizedek Priesthood leaders personal and family preparedness, brotherly concern, and mutual help among quorum members. This type of concern is characterized in the scriptures as the pure love of Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>).

        <span class="emphasis">Sixth,</span> through the home teachers, information is given to quorum presidents and bishops, identifying those in need. Presidents, if you don’t have a good home teaching program, you will never really know your members’ needs. Bishops won’t know who are the needy unless home teachers go as friends representing the bishop and quorum leaders to the home of each family and determine if all is well in that home. Are there any sick or in want? Are there family difficulties?</p>

You should use the Lord’s welfare plan in caring for those in need. Forty years of experience have proven that this inspired welfare plan works. Hundreds of thousands of Latter-day Saints have been encouraged to help themselves through the use of these divine principles. So much depends upon our willingness to follow the Lord’s counsel—counsel which not only the Spirit has borne to us is true but which history has proven to be right.</p>

Tens of thousands are accepting the gospel of salvation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="6eJR8-13a0Otsk-8saOUxQ" hash="VP_U0g">A few months ago we drove along the coast of Chile with President Lester Haymore—then president of the Chile Osorno Mission—and Sister Haymore. As we visited cities and drove from village to village, we saw the fruits of our missionary proselyting efforts. We met with many new members, and we were deeply impressed with their faith and humble desire to learn more about the gospel they have accepted. As we continued the journey, our concern centered on ways we could help prevent this growing number of new members from feeling like strangers or foreigners, and help them become fellow citizens with the Saints. How can we help in strengthening their faith so that they can hold on to the iron rod and continue to grow in knowledge?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="RE4rU5JzyUyPshgORU7yuQ" hash="L1amPA">We reflected on the many priesthood, Relief Society, and Sunday School classes where husbands and wives who have been trained in the gospel—many with unusual talents—were not now being fully used. Some stakes are crowded with mature couples fully prepared to accept a mission call, who could not only enthusiastically help in spreading the gospel but strengthen new members in areas of the world where we are growing so rapidly. The thousands of newly baptized members now in the Church, with its somewhat strange, unfamiliar ways, could be encouraged and trained by someone who today is sitting comfortably at home. We thought, if we could only transplant hundreds of our faithful, well-prepared couples out into one of the greatest chapters of their lives!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="3ZL3EwrVGECgRG5ur5bGUQ" hash="-gHNxw">Amulek taught: “And he shall come into the world to redeem his people” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.40" class="scriptureRef">Alma 11:40</a>). Must we not encourage and hold together “his people” and help prepare them for his coming?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="5wMCfm2KDUaejnqBsfuo9w" hash="haoHyw">Some generally think that full-time missionary service is only for younger, unmarried men and women. However, a new social pattern is emerging. The number of men and women retiring from active employment or from professions is continually increasing, at what President Kimball or Elder LeGrand Richards would consider a very early age.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="SCZBx_RD-kauToOBioR98w" hash="bEkCng">Recently in the mail was a query from friends in California, now retiring from schoolteaching, who indicated a desire to return to Utah and who asked, “What can we do for the Church when we return?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="bALfMwMXfUmUXp2TqMh1-g" hash="hGnpeQ">My answer was, “Don’t come to Utah. Your church experience is needed out in the world. Brush up on your Norwegian that you learned as a missionary years ago.” I understand they will soon be on their way. He is thrilled with this opportunity to serve a second mission, and this time he will have an added blessing of keeping the same companion for his entire mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="nK19wsW1ukWbR72c-ZqzhQ" hash="tIYVpA">Many couples are prepared and waiting for the bishop to extend a mission call. Perhaps the bishop, busy with other duties, has overlooked them. Couples who have a desire to serve the Lord need not wait for the bishop, but should knock on his door and say, “We feel we are ready to go.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="c8uKtgcdy02c6YGri6tqbg" hash="ywfIqw">Recently in Mexico I had the opportunity of meeting a wonderful, mature missionary couple, Brother and Sister John Fossum, who commented, “Our greatest need is for trained leadership. Married couples with years of experience in church work could literally work miracles. We have twenty-two scattered branches without, as yet, an organization to train the branch leaders. We are so new and growing so rapidly, and leaders with experience are not available.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="A5LUKLjLrUud-dHaqdWMyw" hash="Gx1A-A">The Fossums continued, “Many blessings have come to us as a result of our mission—blessings we always receive from the Lord whenever we serve without restraint.” They added, “People shrivel up and die in beds and rocking chairs. We didn’t want that kind of retirement; the Lord knew we wanted to go on a mission, and we received the call.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="tLPyU8-M7EuP5WtUcM3Uaw" hash="ELgMOA">Some couples, they continued, “imagine they can’t live without their families close by, and some fear for their own physical well-being. It was reassuring when our stake president set us apart, and he promised us that the Lord would look after our family and that we would have good health to the end of our mission.” They continued, “At our age it is difficult to live up to missionary schedules, but we have found it is possible, and it has its rewards.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="P_ziaFqv-E2Oc4uAVrMt6g" hash="Y7MuSA">And then Brother Fossum said, “Fifty years ago I served a mission in Hawaii and learned to speak Hawaiian. It was difficult then, and it was difficult at our age to go through the Missionary Training Center and learn Spanish; but we did it and it has been a great learning experience. The spiritual treasures alone are worth the effort.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="-4wH1GA7d0aZ7abkiQfA8Q" hash="a6SOUg">Sister Fossum said, “It’s really hard on grandmas to be away from twenty-six grandchildren, but I’m coming through with flying colors—sometimes at half-mast, but they are flying!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="wM3kmEeIcEqEAqUzuYCl9w" hash="ZRIMNA">This dedicated couple concluded: “A mission for those of mature years is a rich, rewarding experience. It’s for those who want to <span class="emphasis">live out</span> their retirement and not just <span class="emphasis">exist.</span>”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/feed-my-sheep.p" pid="Ad0aiHAhqEaw1CYAefzchg" hash="3x3ZIg">Now we need more—many more—couples like the Fossums who are willing, wondering and asking, “What can I do for the Lord?” and willing to use part of their golden years in this vital service.</p>

We met in a coliseum with over 7,000 Saints and investigators. After this moving spiritual experience, we were confronted by three newspaper reporters in the parking lot. They asked: “Why are you in Lima?” “How many members does your church have in Peru?” “Why is your church growing so rapidly?” “What are your church’s future plans?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/joseph-smith-the-prophet.p3" pid="-UBUBUM080eK9L167qbZYQ" hash="ilVc3A">And then a young woman reporter asked, “What is the difference between your church and other churches?”</p>

We were on a close time schedule. It was not an ideal setting, not one I would have chosen to explain the difference between the Lord’s church and others. However, taking advantage of this opportunity, we explained briefly the Apostasy and the Restoration: that there is vast evidence and history of an apostasy from the doctrine taught by Jesus and his Apostles, that the organization of the original Church became corrupted, and sacred ordinances were changed to suit the convenience of men, and that today good people all over the world are confused with contending religions with differing doctrine and methods of worship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/joseph-smith-the-prophet.p5" pid="PlcpMUJfMUSgFGnCin0lKw" hash="0OEYXg">The reporters listened intently. We explained to them that after a long period of darkness there was a heavenly directed restoration of the true gospel of the Savior, that a young man named Joseph Smith was chosen and schooled to be the instrument to perform the foundation labor for the marvelous work which God has established as his church in these last days.</p>

It was an unusual experience. As the Prophet’s facial profile remained in my mind I thought: “If these reporters and the world could only understand the entire story and the significance of the Restoration—of the eternal blessings God has made available to all. If they could only feel as I feel. If they could know, as I know, if they could only realize the calling and the role of the Prophet.”</p>

He did the work Jesus, the Son of God, commanded him to do, and this Church, which the Prophet assisted in organizing, is possessor of the divine keys and authority of the holy priesthood, and is charged with the responsibility to carry God’s plan of salvation to all his earthly children.</p>

The grove became exceedingly light, brighter than he had ever known. Before him stood two glorious personages—defying all description. One pointed to the other and said, <span class="emphasis">“This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!”</span> The Son spoke to the kneeling boy. Joseph was told that all the churches were wrong—they had corrupted the doctrine, had changed the ordinances, and had lost the authority of the priesthood—and that he, unlearned but humble, was to be the instrument through whom the Almighty would reestablish his work. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.15-20" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:15–20</a>).</p>

Truth had become perverted. When the boy prophet came out of the grove, he had no doubts—he knew. He had looked upon the Father and the Son. They had visited him and instructed him. In the Prophet’s own words: “I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.25" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:25</a>).</p>

His Church was organized as anciently. Apostles now held the necessary keys of the priesthood. Joseph’s work was done. There never was a doubt in his mind or his loyal associates’ as to his divine calling, for he had made clear to them his inspired pronouncements.</p>

It teaches that <span class="emphasis">“man was … in the beginning with God” </span>(<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.29" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:29</a>; italics added).

We learn not only of the degrees of glory and those eligible, but that man should strive for the highest “heaven” which is available, and is reachable only through obedience to all of God’s commandments. President George Albert Smith said: “One of the beautiful things to me in the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that it brings us all to a common level. It is not necessary for a man to be a president of a stake, or a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, in order to attain a high place in the celestial kingdom. The humblest member of the Church, if he keeps the commandments of God, will obtain an exaltation just as much as any other man in the celestial kingdom. The beauty of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that it makes us all equal. … As we keep the commandments of the Lord … we have equal opportunities for exaltation” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1933, p. 25).</p>

In a vision he saw someone who had not received an opportunity to accept the gospel while living. A voice declared that all who have died without an opportunity to hear the gospel and accept it while on this earth will have the privilege in the spirit world. If they would have received it, given the opportunity, they will be heirs of the celestial kingdom.

This small village with this very special family was just outside Jerusalem on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives. The family evidently consisted of Martha, Mary, and their brother, Lazarus. This quiet village, though only two miles from Jerusalem, was completely hidden from the bustle of the crowds and must have fed the soul of Jesus with love and peace. He must have felt welcome to share this family’s hospitality. They not only furnished comfort but listened in deep conviction to his words.</p>

If the people follow the teachings of this church, nothing can stop their progress—it will be limitless.”</p>

Their school band started to play (they had more students in the band than we had in our entire high school), and then through the gates came their team. The twelve of us—a full team of eleven plus one all-round substitute—watched in amazement as they kept coming through the gates—all thirty-nine of them in full uniform.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/the-responsibility-of-young-aaronic-priesthood-bearers.p75" pid="QF5xAoQx-0OalE0lNyNDFA" hash="3LxXMA">The game was most interesting! To say it was a learning experience is rather mild. After two plays we didn’t have any desire to have the ball—so we would kick it, and soon they would score. When they got the ball, they would run a baffling play and score. Our problem was to get rid of the ball—it was less punishing.</p>

A wild pass fell into the arms of Clifford Lee, who was playing halfback with me. He was startled, not knowing for sure what to do—until he saw the “Dallas Cowboys” thundering after him. Then he knew what to do. He was fast. He wasn’t running for points, but for his life! Clifford made a touchdown; six points went up on the board. The final score—106 to 6! We really didn’t deserve the six points, but with our torn shirts and socks and our bruises, we took them anyway.</p>

I remember so clearly being ordained a deacon. A new world opened up for me. I was now living on a higher plane. As I would hear people say, “You hold the priesthood,” it was not easy to fully comprehend. But with humble teachers, we began to understand that as deacons we had been given blessings and authority to do sacred things.</p>

We enjoyed being together. We chopped wood for the elderly and the widows, filled the coal bins at church, cleaned the meetinghouse every Saturday afternoon, swept the steps, raked the gravel yard, saw that the sacrament trays and lace sacrament cloths were clean and fresh, and had real pride in the appearance of our little meetinghouse.</p>

We knew it; we felt it! We held the priesthood of God! Understanding teachers guided us and helped us broaden our vision and our ever-expanding role as young men; but more important, they helped prepare us to be called in our youth to be servants of our Savior. He needs every one of you young men who hold the priesthood. I testify that this work is true. I do it humbly, in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Families or individuals wondering how to better share the gospel or to show deeper concern for new members, or missionaries wanting to touch the hearts of those they are teaching, have available to them this heavenly influence. That special ingredient instilled in each of us may bring to us our greatest joy. It will overcome fear, peer pressure, hatred, selfishness, evil, and even sin. This special ingredient must be nurtured as the tiny mustard seed; it is powerful beyond words and was taught by the Savior himself when asked which was the great commandment of the Law. He said:</p>

Whom would you bar from your circle? We might deny ourselves a nearness to our Savior because of our prejudices of neighborhood or possessions or race—attitudes that Christ would surely condemn. Love has no boundary, no limitation of good will.</p>

I have so many happy memories of my boyhood. During those delightful summer and winter evenings we created most of our own activities and amusement. They were wonderful days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/the-sacrament.p2" pid="gZYP1hsqE0acfcAfgZmXHg" hash="EKOzsw">The most important building in our town in addition to the schoolhouse was our ward meetinghouse. The chapel had an imposing, two-tiered, elevated stand. The stand was quite large, and the first raised portion had a table for the ward clerk at one end and a piano at the other end, and right in the center of this elevated area was the sacrament table. On the highest level of the stand was the pulpit with its red plush cover and beautifully carved chairs with red plush seats for the bishopric or visiting authorities. On the rear wall of the chapel were two impressive oil paintings, one of the Kirtland Temple and the other of the Salt Lake Temple. Everyone in attendance had a clear view of the stately pulpit and, of course, the sacrament table.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/the-sacrament.p3" pid="G2CkU_2-iUuYYWr7lvnDZg" hash="h09Yfg">Sacrament meetings were very special occasions. The Lord instructed that “it is expedient that the church meet together often to partake of bread and wine in the remembrance of the Lord Jesus.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.75" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:75</a>.) We of the Aaronic Priesthood knew it was special. We were well trained. We knew exactly what we should do. We had been taught at home and in our quorum meetings of the high honor placed on us as holders of God’s holy priesthood, which authorized us to perform sacred ordinances of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/the-sacrament.p4" pid="uSWaq12KP0amYfjDUBpluA" hash="H8-7Qw">As a deacon, I vividly recall how we admired the two priests seated up on the first level of the raised platform who would administer the blessing on the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. Everyone in the meetinghouse could see them. I’m sure they felt the importance of the occasion. They were neatly dressed in their best clothes and well prepared.</p>

I recall how shiny the bread trays appeared, and the individual glass cups for the water sparkled. Everything about the sacrament table, including the linen, was immaculate and ready on time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/the-sacrament.p7" pid="khFZWo4qv0aZQcev-BM5mg" hash="KShvJA">Everyone was expected to sing the special sacrament hymn. Everyone did sing. Children were trained not only to be reverent but to know some of the words to the most familiar sacrament songs. I can still see Sister Ella Jack, who led the music, standing in full view between the sacrament table and piano, as she would pause and look over the congregation to be sure everyone had a songbook and was ready to sing. She gave special attention to see that the Aaronic Priesthood boys had songbooks. We would all sing. We were learning in our youth that to feel of the Spirit we must experience a change in our hearts, and to be in harmony on this sacred occasion required our singing the sacrament hymns. As we personally sang the words, our souls were better prepared to understand this sacred ordinance. At the Last Supper the early Apostles joined with the Savior in singing. Matthew records, “And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.30" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:30</a>.)</p>

We didn’t have printed cards, but the twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants was open if needed. There were no microphones or speakers.

We carefully watched our own priests officiate in a sacred procedure somewhat similar to the very first such occasion and heard them recite a divinely directed blessing upon the bread and water in remembrance of the flesh and blood of our Savior. As the priest publicly addresses our Eternal Father in Heaven, he might, if spiritually in tune, visualize in his mind a loving Heavenly Father listening to his humble plea,</p>

He was the spokesman for all of the Apostles in addressing our Heavenly Father. Every word in the sacrament ordinance is vital.

We should reflect in our own weekday conduct the spiritual renewal and commitments made on Sunday.

A sordid story was then related to me of drugs, immorality, stealing to satisfy the high cost of drugs, buying illicit sexual favors, and cheap rooming house living. When I expressed a desire to see and help this young man, the officer suggested I not see him at this time because of his emotional condition.</p>

If we understood the full meaning we would have less divorce and its attendant unhappiness. Couples would plan for a happy marriage relationship based on divine instruction. If couples understood from the beginning of their romance that their marriage relationship could be blessed with promises and conditions extending into the eternities, divorce would not even be a considered alternative when difficulties arise. The current philosophy—get a divorce if it doesn’t work out—handicaps a marriage from the beginning.</p>

Most people underestimate the alienation, bitterness, disruption, and frustration between a divorcing couple, and among their children, friends, and relatives. Some never adjust to the resulting emotional consequences.</p>

Children of divorce all too often have a higher delinquency rate and less self-confidence, and tend to be more promiscuous and themselves more likely to have unhappy marriages.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/marriage-and-divorce.p22" pid="wQ9Bv02Li0mxSMshqwOn9w" hash="hrT73Q">Considering the enormous importance of marriage, it is rather astonishing that we don’t make better preparation for success. Usually, young couples date for a few months or for a year or two, enjoying romance and getting acquainted, and then get married. Once married, they soon learn that romance must blend with spiritual beliefs, in-law relationships, money issues, and serious discussions involving ethics, children, and the running of a home.</p>

Fewer marriages would get in trouble, and more would be happier, if couples visited a warm-hearted bishop who might suggest ways of avoiding pitfalls, and encourage husbands and wives to thoughtfully use self-discipline and needed restraint and develop the loving attribute of unselfishness.</p>

Lee received this letter from a married woman: “When we thought that the end was here and that there was only one thing to do and that was to get a divorce, we had been told that we should counsel with our bishop. At first … we hesitated, because he was just a young man. … But he was our bishop so we went to see him. We poured out our souls to our young bishop. He sat and listened silently, and when we ran out of conversation he said, simply, ‘Well, my wife and I, we had problems, too, and we learned how to solve them.’ That is all … he said. But you know there was something that happened as a result of that young bishop’s statement. We walked out of there and we said, ‘Well, if they can solve their problems, what is the matter with us?’” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Jan. 1974, p. 100.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/marriage-and-divorce.p30" pid="2aYT4qso0UmR3EVCdMNktQ" hash="Qu220A">Middle-age divorce is particularly distressing, as it indicates that mature people, who are the backbone of our society, are not working carefully enough to preserve their marriages. Divorces granted to people over forty-five have increased at an alarming rate. When middle-aged people even consider breaking up their marriage—a couple who may have reared their children, who possibly have grandchildren—and now decide to go their separate ways, they need to realize that every divorce is the result of selfishness on the part of one or both.</p>

If, as husband and wife, you are having serious misunderstandings or if you feel some strain or tension building up in your marriage, you should humbly get on your knees together and ask God our Father, with a sincere heart and real intent, to lift the darkness that is over your relationship, that you may receive the needed light, see your errors, repent of your wrongs, forgive each other, and receive each unto yourselves as you did in the beginning.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="BniaJWLbQk67ndYlgG1MjA" hash="ZQ4Wpg">One of the inspired dedicatory prayers offered by President Gordon B. Hinckley implored God our Father to “bless thy saints in their faith … [to] remain true as … [a] covenant people … , that they shall grow in wisdom” he continued, “both spiritual and temporal … [that] they [shall] grow in virtue and in knowledge and in love for thee … [and that] the evil designs of … [thine] enemies be frustrated.” (<span class="emphasis">Church News,</span> 30 Sep. 1984, p. 10.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="QHm5l2XnkEunkIPE6ZgoWQ" hash="buf1-A">It is about the “evil designs of thine enemies” that I shall speak. I have prayed for spiritual guidance, and that I might be able to communicate to you in a thoughtful manner my frank and candid expressions of concern over the spreading of evil in our society today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="zSxY1jwRLE6T_-sdGIabPw" hash="n6VlXQ">Over the past twenty years a plague of pornography has swept across most countries of the world with increasing momentum and devastating impact. What began a few years ago as a few crude picture magazines that startled sensitive people has grown to hundreds of publications, each seeking to outdo the others with increasingly shocking content.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="GPuNRvjjYEOcw1nFRlSdRw" hash="LhRjyg">So-called “adult” bookstores, selling materials that appeal to the prurient mind, are now open in nearly every city. Obscene materials once available only by mail and in a plain brown wrapper now are prominently displayed on the magazine racks of many local convenience stores and other business establishments where they are readily accessible to the young and the old alike.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="ApL9nFy6MU2K6ERTZhn1YQ" hash="Q6YyVA">Theaters showing X-rated films and worse have become established in most cities. It is reported that one particularly offensive movie, filmed at a cost of forty thousand dollars, has earned revenues of over six hundred million dollars.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="0nb9BDQE0kCamJeS74uswQ" hash="wx9Y0g">It should come as no surprise that grand juries have found that 90 percent of all pornography is dominated by organized crime. Large profits from one project become a source of funds for still larger and more sophisticated enterprises as a growing tidal wave of smut dashes against the weakening bulwarks of morality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="WSjogwbyXUe28yQRZnd8BQ" hash="PtItCA">New technologies that can bless our lives in so many positive ways are also being used to spread pornographic corruption. Video recorders now can bring to homes great classics of music, history, art, and drama. But they also bring into some of these same homes lurid portrayals of debauchery that contaminate those who view them and extend their corrupting influence to our communities and society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="qAnITr2hgUmt158z7qkb_A" hash="BrFPDw">Cable television and satellite transmissions, with their powerful capacity for good, are not only being used, but are also being abused. State and national laws necessary to govern their proper use are not yet established, and they are almost totally unregulated. Greedy men have been ready to exploit this vacuum in legal regulation without regard for the consequence to its victims.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="MwvJFyfVZ0G63hdmY-e_TQ" hash="Qlp14g">Some may ask “What is pornography?” It was United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart who said that while he could not exactly define pornography, “I know it when I see it,” he said. (Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378-U.S. 184, 1964.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="QL5EM1uORUGKhzzmPqTzEQ" hash="AjQKSg">Pornography is not a victimless crime. Who are its victims? First, those who either intentionally, or sometimes involuntarily, are exposed to it. Pornography is addictive. (See <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> March 1984, pp. 32–39.) What may begin as a curious exploration can become a controlling habit. Studies show that those who allow themselves to become drawn to pornography soon begin to crave even coarser content. Continued exposure desensitizes the spirit and can erode the conscience of unwary people. A victim becomes a slave to carnal thoughts and actions. As the thought is father to the deed, exposure can lead to acting out what is nurtured in the mind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="tuvTM_r0qUuRydXHLUu4Hg" hash="4ortVQ">But there are other victims. Crimes of violence have increased in the United States at up to five times the rate of population growth. A 1983 University of New Hampshire study found that states having the highest readership of pornographic magazines also have the highest number of reported rapes. Pornography degrades and exploits men, and women, and children in a most ugly and corrupt fashion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="O0wl9V2NTk2lgUE3rnkSSQ" hash="K8vaLQ">Perhaps the greatest tragedy of all is in the lives of children who become its victims. The saddest trend of our day is the alarming, large increase in child abuse. Much of it occurs within families and involves corrupting the divine innocence that children have from birth. We sing, as we did this morning, “I am a child of God, and he has sent me here. … Lead me, guide me, walk beside me, help me find the way [that I might] live with him some day” are part of those words (“I Am a Child of God,” <span class="emphasis">Sing With Me,</span> B-76.) The Savior reserved His harshest condemnation for those who would offend little children. He said: “Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for … it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.10,14" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:10, 14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="g8q9e5RiMUm2CZGq02blgQ" hash="khIBvQ">The Lord further commanded: “Neither commit adultery … nor do anything like unto it.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="uUr5sbXgNUqDKuudKaF4Ow" hash="EPlAVg">“The early apostles and prophets [warned against] sins that are reprehensible … —adultery … infidelity … impurity, inordinate affection … sexual relations outside of marriage … sex perversion … preoccupation with sex in one’s thoughts. … And one of the worst of these [sins] is incest … [or] sexual [relations] between persons so closely related that they are forbidden by law to marry.” (Spencer W. Kimball, <span class="emphasis">President Kimball Speaks Out,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1981, p. 6.) Incest is an ugly sin, and this sin particularly may irreparably damage its innocent victims.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="JMMsVVx9i0K_-7buskiN0A" hash="dip6iw">Yet, what impels these offenders to such terrible deeds? Police report that some 80 percent of those who molest young boys and girls admitted modeling their attacks on pornography they had viewed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="JeY3Y8zIYk-8MRhRmcyGPA" hash="OkZa0Q">How has this evil gained such a foothold in our society? Have we ignored the warnings of our Church leaders? President Kimball declared: “So long as men are corrupt and revel in sewer filth, entertainers will sell them what they want. Laws may be passed, arrests may be made, lawyers may argue, courts may sentence … men of corrupt minds, but pornography and … insults to decency will never cease until men have cleansed their minds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="eZZ0Sqa7lk2HlnJx3uU0Kw" hash="Sv7v9w">Continuing, President Kimball said, “When … [man] is sick and tired of being drowned in filth, … he will not pay for that filth and its source will dry up.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="maVUudgj1E23q-cDaLvbOg" hash="_CZ36g">“Hence it is obvious,” he continued, “that to remain clean and worthy, one must stay positively and conclusively away from the devil’s territory, avoiding the least approach toward evil. Satan leaves his fingerprints.” (<span class="emphasis">The Miracle of Forgiveness,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969, pp. 229, 232.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="wFQqjRUzW0ymS3rpH-n6kQ" hash="TCCUYA">This growing presence of obscenity has been aided by the lowering of media standards for advertising, by relaxed movie ratings, by television soap operas and situation comedies that use their powerful voices to justify, glamorize, and encourage sexual relations outside of marriage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="4LzECxuCvEaDdBmMM7-1KQ" hash="pEioVw">Perhaps we have been intimidated by those who claim that producing, distributing, and using obscene materials is a basic right to be defended. This is not true. Even under the divinely inspired constitutional principles of this land, obscenity is not condoned nor protected. The United States Supreme Court has clearly held that criminal prosecution of those who produce and distribute obscene materials does not violate their First Amendment rights. (Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 1973.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="Ps-mQrZld0yBMelYYG9VKA" hash="-uLxSg">This spreading evil has been aided by a failure to enforce laws designed to prohibit or regulate it. Although some additional legislation may be helpful, those who have been fighting the discouraging battle against pornography in recent years are in agreement that nearly 90 percent of all obscene materials could be eliminated from our communities if existing obscenity laws were strictly enforced. A few courageous cities have performed outstanding service by ridding themselves of X-rated theaters and so-called “adult” bookstores, and by limiting access to hard-core pornographic books and magazines. The citizens of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, formed a citizen action group and determined that they were not going to allow such degrading material in their community. They closed an adult bookshop and a large distribution warehouse, and, as a result of their determined citizens’ organization and involvement, they have had enacted a city public nuisance ordinance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="VSIXtQrI-0Wo1VBWtSmAZA" hash="JIY3Zg">Lawmaking bodies will listen to effectively organized citizens. However, too often the trend is tragically toward citizen apathy and a sense of futility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="qX8Tu2VXNUKQA2VtT530LA" hash="Mq6edA">And who is to blame? We could conveniently point the accusing finger at public prosecutors who are not vigorously enforcing the law. But we need men and women of courage and conviction in these offices of public trust if the awful tide is to be stemmed. But as one accusing finger is pointing toward those who make or enforce the law, another may point to ourselves, who may be equally to blame.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="4GyrOTJ3_k61tapF9qM5RA" hash="l7rJqw">Fortunately, what is deemed legally obscene is partially determined by local community standards. We as citizens, by our own standards, are the ones who can help establish what offensive materials are—which ones are legally obscene—and cannot claim protection from the law.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="_zMj3NmOd0u6uo1NL7YQhQ" hash="oxLUUQ">Unfortunately, many people assume that even hard-core pornography is legal because it is so prevalent. But that is not true. Some public prosecutors may excuse themselves from seeking enforcement of obscenity laws by explaining that community standards determine what is obscene. They therefore conclude that because the community tolerates such material, its presence must reflect the accepted community standard. Concerned citizens—you and I—can change this misunderstanding.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="GQ49qWsYfEOd3OFQKSyuXg" hash="7BNO5Q">What, then, is needed to reverse this ominous insult to ourselves, our families, and our communities? Only when men and women concerned for their families and communities let their voices and their influence be felt in thoughtful, rational ways will we alter the destructive course on which we are traveling. Silent indignation may be misinterpreted as approval. Irrational action may be ineffective because it is regarded as prudish rather than thoughtful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="rePxb-gxSEqcKlhVUNcWZw" hash="XA4d3Q">Albert Camus wrote: “By your actions or your silence, you, too, enter the fray.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="dvk1_h09xECEV_Pr3lY_xw" hash="qtNbXw">May I suggest a few things we could do to halt this deadly evil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="t4AvkbAONUi_qRqYWukqAQ" hash="zg_h9A">First, let each of us resolve this day to keep our minds, our bodies, and our spirits free from the corrupting influence of pornography, including everything that is obscene and indecent. Let it have no place in our homes, our minds, or our hearts. The psalmist David wrote, “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/24.3-4" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 24:3–4</a>.) If those who hear my voice have in their possession offensive materials that should be destroyed, let this be the day of decision and action. If someone listening has been tempted or has thought of, or even considered abusing or offending a child, may he, this day, confess and repent and forsake such evil thoughts or actions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="xkUugktyykyggsHwOjql1w" hash="ifyKkw">James the Apostle and the brother of our Lord wrote:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="k7bSBiLyFkCxiWf7AL4cDw" hash="u_8jSQ">Parents, discuss with your children of appropriate age, and in sensitive ways, the harmful effects and addictive nature of such material. Rigidly monitor the selection of television programs, movies, videocassettes, music, and other forms of entertainment for your family. Let us never, by purchasing these damaging materials, contribute to the financial success of those who deal in this material.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="xuVxQNXgok6P2RaNdfmVFg" hash="0LH6_A">We would encourage you to foster in your homes a love of knowledge through uplifting literature; wholesome books; selective movies and television; classical and exemplary popular music; entertainment that uplifts and edifies the spirit and mind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="uPdo84vzUk2TJhXdfUXdwg" hash="bo9GOQ">Second, let our voices be heard in our communities—members and nonmembers alike. If something offends standards of decency, our voices should be heard. We would encourage members to persevere in their efforts to work with local groups and to establish a visible relationship with other like-minded citizens, and seek to preserve our quality of life by encouraging steps against such material.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="vNsisgNod0K4Fsvcc9EjJA" hash="GtMQiA">Should we not actively approach the management of some stores, movie theaters, bookstores, television and radio stations, with a request to withdraw indecent materials from public display or use or patronage? Of course, such efforts should be consistent with the constitutional process, exercising gentle persuasion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="gY2ldjxuSky-ZbuxWKOOJA" hash="7gaVXw">Some nationally owned and franchised convenience stores and others have responded to the courteous request of their customers to discontinue selling certain degrading materials.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="ywQCV8HfekeghrKllzxF_g" hash="Ya6k_g">And third, we can make our own elected officials and law enforcement people aware that we support the fair enforcement of laws prohibiting obscenity and regulating indecency, thank them for their past service and present efforts, and encourage them to continue the difficult and sometimes thankless task of strictly enforcing the existing laws in a consistent and fair manner.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/personal-morality.p" pid="oSghhYoII0Cd-7dgZih4zQ" hash="TVw0Mg">And fourth, where legislation is needed to meet new technological advances in cable and satellite transmission, let us support the enactment of reasonable laws and regulations that would help reduce the number of those whose lives will otherwise become marred by addiction, child abuse, and many of the other social ills that pornography helps foster. These laws should be carefully drawn within constitutional limitations, so that the freedoms we seek for ourselves now and in the future are not denied for others.</p>

There are some who believe that the pornography industry is out of control, already too powerful to curb. I would disagree with this dim view, but recognize the immensity of the task before us. We know that people of good will, united in such a worthy cause, where the moral fiber of our nations may be at stake, and aided by divine power, can overcome any obstacle and meet any challenge to help our Lord and Savior to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</p>

If you will stay on the Lord’s side of the line, you will be under his influence and will have no desire to do wrong; but if you cross to the devil’s side of the line one inch, you are in the tempter’s power, and if he is successful, you will not be able to think or even reason properly, because you will have lost the Spirit of the Lord.” (<span class="emphasis">The Miracle of Forgiveness,</span> p. 232.)

To the Samaritan woman at Jacob’s Well who said, “I know that Messias cometh … : when he is come, he will tell us all things” came Christ’s declaration, “I that speak unto thee am he.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/4.25-26" class="scriptureRef">John 4:25–26</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-resurrected-christ.p2" pid="Gvm708gYvEGvnwOpPxoSSQ" hash="eqXtNw">Many of the heavenly directed events leading up to and following the crucifixion of our Lord have been narrated by the early Apostles and other witnesses.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-resurrected-christ.p3" pid="KPcQyykRqkq5oLLKs-tUeA" hash="mrs5zQ">According to these accounts, Joseph, a rich man from the village of Arimathaea and one of the Sanhedrin, did not openly declare his belief in Jesus, as he feared the Jewish authorities. But now sorrow, as well as indignation, aroused his courage. He asked Pilate if he could take away Jesus’ body. Pilate gave permission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-resurrected-christ.p4" pid="2fUFJdz5Ck6Unao5-fwChA" hash="BxaB4A">Nicodemus—a noble disciple who had visited Jesus at night lest someone might see them together—assisted Joseph. They wrapped Jesus’ body in fine linen, together with spices, according to the Jewish custom of preparing a body for burial. They laid the body reverently in the rocky niche of a tomb in a garden that belonged to Joseph. The tomb had never been used. It was the day before the Jewish Sabbath. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/19.38-42" class="scriptureRef">John 19:38–42</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-resurrected-christ.p5" pid="acll95Jo-EyjZayPhJmFNg" hash="jc-Qwg">The next day Pilate gave permission for the tomb to be carefully guarded until the third day, so the disciples could not steal the body and then tell the people that Jesus had risen from the dead, as had been prophesied. The chief priests and Pharisees made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and leaving a guard on watch. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/27.62-66" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 27:62–66</a>.)</p>

Looking in and not finding the body, they hurried to find Peter and the Apostles and told them what they had found. Peter and John hastened at once to the tomb. John outran his older companion. Stooping down, he gazed in silent wonder into the empty tomb. Entering, Peter saw the burial clothes lying where the body of Jesus once lay. And then John followed him. And in spite of fear, there dawned upon them the hope, which later would become an absolute knowledge, that Christ had indeed risen, but as yet no one had seen him. The two wondering Apostles returned to their brethren.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-resurrected-christ.p7" pid="f4WgD6FThUS1DAEdabGQuQ" hash="mOgbHw">Mary stayed at the tomb and was grieving at the entrance when someone approached. Thinking it was the keeper of the garden, she asked where he had laid her Lord. Jesus said to her, “Mary.”</p>

She then recognized our Lord and must have attempted to embrace him, for he said, “Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.”</p>

A solemn assembly grants to members the right to participate in the principle of common consent, instituted by revelation, authorizing members to sustain those called to official positions. Individual histories and personal accounts of this historic conference will be a highlight throughout our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord.p3" pid="kU8fWos8TE-NqiBVDZ-nRw" hash="-I4PuA">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaims to the world that this church is a restoration of Christ’s church. A restoration was necessary because prophets and Apostles, who were the foundation of the Lord’s original church, were put to death or otherwise taken. The Church today is built on a foundation of prophets and Apostles, with Jesus Christ as its chief cornerstone. It is therefore not a reformation, a revision, a reorganization, or a mere sect. It is the Church of Jesus Christ restored in these latter days.</p>

Talmage, <span class="emphasis">The Articles of Faith,</span> 12th ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924, p. 296.) Today, the Lord’s Church is guided by the same relationship with Deity that existed in previous dispensations.</p>

Prophets of God receive revelation by this process. Individual members of the Church may also receive revelation to confirm truth. The Prophet Joseph Smith told us that “no man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelation.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1977, p. 328.)</p>

The revelation states that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is a body equal in authority to the First Presidency. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:24</a>.) That means that when the President of the Church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved and the Quorum of the Twelve automatically becomes the presiding body of the Church. That pattern was established with the death of the Church’s first President, Joseph Smith.</p>

Each of the twelve Apostles expressed his views regarding the matter of reorganizing the First Presidency. Present in that meeting was Ezra T. Benson, great-grandfather of President Ezra Taft Benson. On that occasion, Brigham Young, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, was unanimously sustained by members of that body as President of the Church. He selected Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as counselors. This action created a new First Presidency, which was later sustained by the unanimous vote of the Saints at a general conference of the Church held December 24, 1847, in a log tabernacle constructed at Winter Quarters by the Saints for this special conference. This action was later ratified by members of the Church at conferences in Iowa, Salt Lake City, and the British Isles.</p>

After much fasting and prayer, and the seeking of personal revelation to know the mind and will of God, it was confirmed to our souls who should be called—even Ezra Taft Benson. This I know! With that heavenly confirmation to each of those present, Ezra Taft Benson was ordained and set apart on Sunday, November 10, 1985, as prophet, seer, and revelator, and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

Our Heavenly Father is always near. You can reach out and receive His aid through prayer.” On many occasions, our beloved prophet has stated: “[This is] prized above any other advice I have ever received. It has become an integral part of me, an anchor, a constant source of strength.” (Frederick W. Babbel, <span class="emphasis">On Wings of Faith,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1972, p. 85.)</p>

He was assigned to give assistance to members of the Church in Europe who had been devastated by World War II. He witnessed the ravages of war. He saw the hungry, the cold, the destitute.</p>

Thousands of tons of food, clothing, bedding, and medical supplies were delivered to Saints in thirteen nations.

Before the first Cabinet meeting, then-Secretary Benson suggested to President-elect Eisenhower that they commence with prayer. President Eisenhower spoke of the weight of responsibility on the new administration and the need for divine guidance, then called on the Secretary of Agriculture to open the meeting with prayer. That practice continued throughout the Eisenhower administration.</p>

That experience also found him threatened by whirlwinds of the politically ambitious. But seeking strength from the Almighty, as he had done so often in the past, he stood firm in principle and survived efforts to bring about a more politically expedient course of action. Today, the name of Ezra Taft Benson is synonymous with integrity.</p>

I know he loves the Lord and depends upon Him for strength, inspiration, and direction. He loves all our Father’s children everywhere and will go to extraordinary lengths to respond to their spiritual and temporal needs. He loves people of all faiths, of all creeds, of all colors, and of differing philosophies. I know I can speak for all of my Brethren of the General Authorities in saying that we have felt of his love and concern for each of us and for our families and loved ones. We wholeheartedly reciprocate that love to President and Sister Benson and their family.</p>

I can visualize grandfathers, fathers, bishops, deacons, teachers, and priests seated together, some as families or quorums; also full-time missionaries, students, and new converts—all bearers of the Holy Priesthood of God. And beyond this historical Salt Lake Tabernacle are hundreds more such assemblies of priesthood bearers anxiously awaiting encouragement and instruction from our prophet and his noble counselors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/spiritual-crevasses.p2" pid="9lRHQRLsukOsgD6lIfUDUg" hash="8_CH3w">This past summer, Clarence Neslen, Jr., took his family to Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada. They enjoyed exploring the Columbia Icefields, jumping over crevasses in the famous Athabasca Glacier. It was an exciting experience until eleven-year-old Cannon, attempting to jump across a crevasse, missed and fell into the deep chasm. He became wedged between the walls of ice. As his father looked down some thirty feet to where his son was trapped, he was further alarmed as he saw a river of icy water flowing beneath the crevasse.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/spiritual-crevasses.p3" pid="dMe06A3BpEq_rAFhtpbSCA" hash="YXTMqw">Several young men were also exploring the glacier. They heard the cries for help and came running. They had a small rope but soon realized that it was not strong enough to pull Cannon to safety. If it broke, Cannon would most assuredly fall into the rushing river of freezing water.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/spiritual-crevasses.p4" pid="ZXumZcRs4ESW8vjOPkV9CQ" hash="2HX9PA">Sister Neslen and others ran to a nearby lodge for help. The nearest park ranger camp was seventy-five miles away. They learned by telephone that two park rangers were near the icefields. Located by radio, they rushed to the rescue. Time was short, decisions urgent, and silent prayers were sent heavenward.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/spiritual-crevasses.p5" pid="WtmhruYaGUqz4e4Vb7yPpQ" hash="xlU6pA">Brother Neslen tried to calm his son and soothe his fears. Hypothermia was setting in. Young Cannon’s shirt had been pushed up as he fell. His bare skin was now pressed against the cold walls of the glacier. To keep his son from unconsciousness, the father called down to him to keep praying, to wiggle his fingers and toes, and to sing his favorite songs. Over and over Cannon sang, “I am a child of God, and he has sent me here, has given me an earthly home with parents kind and dear” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 301). All were strengthened by Cannon’s faith and determination. But he was beginning to weaken. His father kept assuring him that help would soon arrive and that his Heavenly Father would hear his prayers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/spiritual-crevasses.p6" pid="yzBP3ZMVX06OJtP2yQZupw" hash="xn94pw">The two rangers arrived. Spikes were driven into the ice, and ropes were attached to a ranger, who was lowered to rescue Cannon. But the walls were too narrow for him. Their only chance was to lower a looped rope and pray he was alert enough to grasp it and then have the strength to hold on as they tried to pull him out.</p>

He pleaded with the Lord to save his son’s life. “A feeling of assurance and calm came over me,” he said, “and I knew that he would be saved.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/spiritual-crevasses.p8" pid="0ihS29MQhEGq693VW4D3mw" hash="Cv3gQQ">Cannon had lapsed into unconsciousness. His father called down encouragement, rousing his son sufficiently that Cannon’s icy fingers now were able to catch hold of the rope. “Hold on with all of your might!” his father called down to him. Cannon was carefully pulled up—inch by inch, foot by foot—all thirty feet. When he was finally pulled to safety, he was unconscious. His fingers had miraculously frozen around the rope and had to be pried loose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/spiritual-crevasses.p9" pid="cmfW-uY88kOBZLxPRcKHZw" hash="1XV6rQ">He was immediately wrapped in blankets and rushed to a waiting ambulance, but there was not enough warmth to raise his body temperature sufficiently. A paramedic undressed Cannon, then took off his own coat and shirt and held Cannon against his bare chest so that his body heat would radiate to the boy. Cannon slowly responded to the loving care of his rescuers. The prayers of all had been answered.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/spiritual-crevasses.p10" pid="fa6FWjk-0EajMz77p7lKig" hash="HGv34g">Young Cannon Neslen, a newly ordained deacon, is here in this audience tonight. We thank our Father in Heaven that his life was spared. He was spared for a purpose. He told his father that, while wedged in the ice, he felt a comforting assurance that he would be saved. He knows God loves him and that He has a special mission for him to perform in this life.</p>

On the edge of those ominous crevasses are parents and others who, with fervent prayers, cry for help and assistance. Like Cannon’s father, they, too, pray that their sons or daughters will hold on to the extended lifeline. Their love, and the teachings of the scriptures and the assurance of the eternal blessings of the Savior’s atonement, are sure lifelines to safety.</p>

We should never minimize or underestimate our ability to deal with challenges placed before us. The size or complexity of challenges need not be a cause for alarm or despair.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p3" pid="M3kFOnaeSUyhb6CKNXigRw" hash="w0Q3jA">On one bitterly cold winter night, he was herding sheep for another man when a blizzard set in. The sheep bunched together, as sheep do, in the corner of a fenced area, and many died. Many other sheep on surrounding ranches also died that same night because of the weather.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p4" pid="KQ6whFyzhE6zCx7DVyuGyg" hash="cTvvMA">Though the death of the sheep was no fault of his, James Fugal felt responsible and spent the next several years working and saving to repay the owner for his lost sheep.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p5" pid="tVZXRQneZUy8Iz7_rEBUxw" hash="lHzl1w">This was the type of deep moral honor and accountability that was fostered by scripture-reading, God-fearing settlers on the early frontier.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p6" pid="IszhEeLfT0S3IabTrSK1JQ" hash="OsfuFw">This same desire to live Christian principles was evident in Aurelia Rogers, who was schooled on the plains and founded the Primary organization of the Church. She had a concern for the moral character and social development of children. Leaders of the Primary since Aurelia Rogers have proven to be worthy disciples and continue to teach wholesomeness, virtue, and love for one another as well as to instill a desire to understand and live by traditional values.</p>

In addition to heavenly direction, both would require a membership of honest, virtuous people if their divine purposes were to be realized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p11" pid="w2lHEJvNs0CM6YfeqcEO1Q" hash="4z5GeQ">We attribute the rise of the American nation and its survival to two vital factors. First, God aided the efforts of those who established the republic. James Madison, who is considered the father of the Constitution and to whom President Benson referred this morning, wrote, “It is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in [the Constitution] a finger of that Almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the [establishing of our republic]” (<span class="emphasis">The Federalist,</span> no. 37, New York City: Modern Library, n.d., p. 231).</p>

This is best expressed by Alexander Hamilton, a soldier turned statesman, who wrote that “it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force” (<span class="emphasis">The Federalist,</span> no. 1, p. 33).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p13" pid="_BYqAoBt_0yFEp2XWzimWg" hash="zS1IqA">The important human attributes needed for this new nation to really become a cooperating and workable republic of separate states would be manifested by a people who demonstrated by their lives a belief and desire to live in a society of justice for all mankind. Likewise, the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, also recognized that, like the new nation, the restored gospel would have difficulty enduring without men and women of similar integrity and conduct.</p>

As the concluding statement, the Prophet wrote this inspired code of conduct:</p>

These would be the type of people who could raise up a nation and help it survive, and the kind of people to comprehend the true gospel of Jesus Christ with the needed faith to proclaim it to the inhabitants of the earth.</p>

Only in an atmosphere of freedom and trust could values like honesty and integrity truly flourish and thus encourage others to pursue their rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p18" pid="X7m0SALVFEu2liELVyMOSw" hash="Ss1AhA">Therefore, it is with great alarm that we read newspaper accounts and hear daily media reports that describe the decline of moral decency and the erosion of basic ethical conduct. They detail the corrupting influence of dishonesty, from small-time, childish stealing or cheating to major embezzlement, fraud, and misappropriation of money or goods.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p19" pid="JVte4BXA7EKWotyLSKlYAA" hash="2r-Ovw">Headlines and feature stories dramatically demonstrate the need for honesty and integrity in family relationships, in business affairs, and in the conduct of government officials and religious ministries. Recent cover stories from major national publications with titles such as “Lying in America” (<span class="emphasis">U. S. News and World Report,</span> 23 Feb. 1987) and “What Ever Happened to Ethics” (<span class="emphasis">Time,</span> 25 May 1987) emphasize the need for public concern over the direction in which we are moving.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p20" pid="qfh6il1ZsUyee-xoBNFtvA" hash="OHAvFw">Public virtue, which expects men to rise above self-interest and to act in the public interest with wisdom and courage, was so evident in leaders like George Washington, who, we used to declare, could never tell a lie, and Abraham Lincoln, known as “Honest Abe.” In the past few years we have seen “official after official—both on the national and the local political scene—put self-interest … above the larger public interest. …</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p22" pid="KdX2hD3K60-3BnIo_L8dqw" hash="Vswnhg">One reason for the decline in moral values is that the world has invented a new, constantly changing and undependable standard of moral conduct referred to as “situational ethics.” Now, individuals define good and evil as being adjustable according to each situation; this is in direct contrast to the proclaimed God-given absolute standard: “Thou shalt not!”—as in “Thou shalt not steal” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.15" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:15</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p23" pid="ZshqgSBsv0yMVXv3nrtKww" hash="mDnAhg">A recent Gallup Poll indicates that the vast majority of Americans want schools to do two things: teach our children to speak, think, write, and count; and help them develop standards of right and wrong to guide them through life. However, some teachers avoid questions of right and wrong or remain neutral or guide children into developing their own values, which is leaving many children morally adrift.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/ethics-and-honesty.p24" pid="6QzcvypZQEGO8Ka7MwIaXw" hash="EBJ4iQ">Many of our youth have either lost the knowledge of what is right and what is wrong or were never taught these basic values. President Harold B. Lee’s classic statement that “the most important of the Lord’s work that you will ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home” is most certainly true today. “Ours is the responsibility as parents to teach our children chastity … [and not only to be morally clean but to be] faithful [and] valiant, striving to live [all of] the Lord’s commandments” (<span class="emphasis">Strengthening the Home,</span> Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1973, pp. 4, 7–8).</p>

We were told that this tall building was a church, and after greeting our Saints and inspecting our church building which I was to dedicate, I was curious to visit this other building we had seen from the air with the tall, stately spire. It was very impressive from a distance. However, as we approached the building we discovered that the front door was made of plywood and padlocked. A sign directed us to the back door. This large church building with such an impressive front and its high steeple, we discovered, was only a shell of a building.

Such faith accepts the existence of God our Father, the teachings of Jesus concerning man’s dealings with his fellowmen, and the teachings concerning Christ’s relationship to God as His Son. Once a person has prepared himself to receive and accept truth, it is then sealed upon his heart by the power of the Holy Ghost, who is the Testifier of Truth. It is then incumbent upon him to so conform his life to those standards of truth. This may require fundamental changes in life-style and the seeking of repentance for sins committed.</p>

Moses built a tabernacle in the wilderness for the children of Israel. Solomon built a magnificent temple in Jerusalem. The Nephites built sacred temples. Joseph Smith built houses of the Lord in Kirtland and Nauvoo, and succeeding prophets have built temples throughout the world. These have all been initiated and built under the direction and revelation of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/temples-and-work-therein.p3" pid="SCcSKr8XdUm-loZF461b9Q" hash="_ZSb0A">Without revelation, temples can neither be built nor properly used. They are one of the evidences of the divinity of our Lord’s true gospel. In our day, the Lord has said: “How shall your washings be acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you have built to my name? … that … ordinances might be revealed which had been hid from … the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.37-38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:37–38</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:21</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.26-32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:26–32</a>.) One of these restored doctrines, premortality or preexistence, should give us a greater appreciation for ourselves and the work assigned us, for each one of us existed as a spirit entity before we were born on this earth.</p>

The Lord proposed a plan. … We accepted it. Since the plan is intended for all men, we became parties to the salvation of every person under that plan. We agreed, right then and there, to be not only saviors for ourselves but … saviors for the whole human family. We went into a partnership with the Lord. The working out of the plan became then not merely the Father’s work, and the Savior’s work, but also our work. The least of us, the humblest, is in partnership with the Almighty in achieving the purpose of the eternal plan of salvation.”</p>

By that doctrine, with the Lord at the head, we become saviors on Mount Zion, all committed to the great plan of offering salvation to the untold numbers of spirits. To do this is the Lord’s self-imposed duty, this great labor his highest glory. Likewise, it is man’s duty, self-imposed, his pleasure and joy, his labor, and ultimately his glory.” (“The Worth of Souls,” <span class="emphasis">The Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine,</span> Oct. 1934, p. 189.)</p>

Thus, the sealing powers and ordinances necessary for the dead as well as the living were to be restored. This was accomplished by Elijah’s visit to Joseph and Oliver on April 3, 1836, in the Kirtland Temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/temples-and-work-therein.p16" pid="cNAeKbOWCEibYkETONBBvw" hash="fcCbqA">Elijah’s mission was to “turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 4:6</a>.) The turning of the hearts of the fathers in the spirit world to the children on earth provides for the gathering of ancestral data of their deceased fathers in order that ordinances might be performed in the temples of the Lord. Thus, the living having their hearts turned to their fathers is in accordance with the premortal agreement we made before the earth was formed.</p>

Remarkable indeed is the fact that organized efforts to gather genealogical information began after Elijah came in 1836. In America, the New England Historical and Genealogical Society was organized in 1844, and the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society in 1869, for the purpose of gathering genealogy. What is known as the “Spirit of Elijah” has influenced nonmembers as well as members of the Church in this vital activity. The microfilming of thousands of records is continuing on a large scale throughout the world. (See Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class="emphasis">Doctrines of Salvation,</span> comp. Bruce R. McConkie, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56, 2:122–28.)</p>

[However,] on that very day Elijah did enter—not in the home of the Jews to partake of the Passover with them, but he appeared in the House of the Lord … in Kirtland, and there bestowed his keys.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1936, p. 75.)</p>

A dispensation is also defined as a period when God has revealed his mind and will to man. It “means the opening of the heavens to men; the … dispensing to them the word of God; the revealing to men … the principles and ordinances of the Gospel; the conferring of divine authority upon … chosen ones, by which they are empowered to act in the name … [and] authority of God. … The Dispensation of the Fulness of Times is the dispensation which includes all others,” both in heaven and on earth. It is the dispensation which will fulfill all of the decrees of a loving Heavenly Father for “the salvation of [all] men and the redemption of the earth itself.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 1:xxiii.)</p>

In the heavenly kingdom it was formed before the foundation of the earth. From the very first, the plan of man’s progression and salvation was known.

From the road deep in the canyon floor, most automobile passengers do not see the large, arched portals cut high in the side of the mountain. Few would realize that behind these portals are six large storage rooms cut deep into the solid granite and that in them lie the world’s largest collection of genealogy records. These are not ordinary records, but records listing the births, marriages, and deaths of nearly two billion people who have lived on the earth. They are the product of over fifty years of tireless effort the world over by Church representatives, by microfilm camera operators, and those who care for these records housed row upon row in microfilm cabinets deep in the mountain. The magnitude of this project to gather and preserve these records is awesome to behold.</p>

We identify our ancestors so that we may perform for them the saving ordinances of the gospel in holy temples dedicated to that purpose. It is our responsibility, given to us by the Lord, to help redeem all those of our Father’s children who have lived and died without receiving the sacred ordinances of the gospel—yet all have the opportunity to accept or reject the ordinances performed in their behalf.</p>

We had engaged him to present our claim of discrimination by the city council of Glasgow. We were seeking a building permit, which had been repeatedly denied by the city council at the instigation of an opposing ministerial group as not needed inasmuch as there was an abundance of vacant or unused church buildings. We had been granted a hearing before the secretary of state for Scotland—a member of the prime minister’s cabinet.</p>

But no more! Now we have available a modern miracle called FamilySearch™. FamilySearch is a powerful, innovative computer system. In response to your typing in a name of one of your ancestors at a keyboard, FamilySearch, in just moments, races through millions of names and finds any that match what you typed. It knows how to match names that are spelled differently but sound the same. It can guide you from one small fragment of sketchy information to full screens of information—dates and places of birth, marriage, and death; and names of parents, children, and spouses.</p>

But he wasn’t running for points, he was running for his life! Clifford made a touchdown; six points went up on the scoreboard. The final score—106 to 6!

His faith and determination lifted him from being a tentmaker to become a teacher, a missionary, leader, and organizer of Christian branches. He most certainly wasn’t a “sissy” nor weak. People of great faith know what is right and do it. They have uncompromised determination and commitment and are capable of enduring pressure or hardship. Paul knew what was right, and you know what is right. When you take courage like Paul and do what you know is right, nothing will stop your progress but yourself.</p>

It means adversary—one who wages open war with the truth and those who obey truthful principles. Satan chose the evil course from the beginning. His greatest aim, as taught by Moses and Enoch, is to get men to worship him. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.12" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.49" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:49</a>.) He has had great success. As the professed god of this world, Satan has the adoration and worship of those who live after the manner of the world. All forms of wickedness and evil and rebellion against God’s holy purposes are of the devil. However, we are tested and challenged and must work out our salvation in the presence of evil. Lehi taught: “It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:11</a>.)

They clear their hearts of any feelings which may be out of harmony with the sacred environment and sacred experiences they will encounter in the temple. They will be mindful that feelings of anger, hostility, fear, frustration, haste, or any preoccupation with matters outside the temple will interfere with their ability to fully partake of the feast available within the temple—which is a feast of the Spirit. Those kinds of feelings are left outside the temple when we enter.</p>

When you return, come with an open, seeking, contrite heart, and allow the Spirit to teach you by revelation what the symbols can mean to you and the eternal realities which they represent. Elder Widtsoe thoughtfully provided some counsel about how you might do this. He spoke of the Prophet’s first vision as a model of how revelation, in the temple and elsewhere, is received.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord.p20" pid="XvshzdM6Mk61GL304U28xQ" hash="SR-KlA">“How do men receive revelations?” he asked. “How did the Prophet Joseph Smith obtain his first revelation, his first vision? He desired something. In [a grove of trees], away from human confusion, he summoned all the strength of his nature; there he fought the demon of evil, and, at length, because of the strength of his desire and the great effort that he made, the Father and the Son descended out of the heavens and spoke eternal truth to him.” (Ibid., p. 63.)</p>

Desire and effort are likewise required if we would receive revelation to understand the ordinances of the endowment. He wrote: “Revelation … is not imposed upon a person; it must be drawn to us by faith, seeking and working. … To the man or woman who goes through the temple, with open eyes, heeding the symbols and the covenants, and making a steady, continuous effort to understand the full meaning, God speaks his word, and revelations come. … The endowment which was given by revelation can best be understood by revelation; and to those who seek most vigorously, with pure hearts, will the revelation be greatest.” (Ibid.)</p>

What person would not want these blessings, as expressed by the Prophet Joseph Smith at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple. He said: “We ask thee, Holy Father, that thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 109:22</a>.)</p>

As they approached, they noticed that the crowd was being amused by the antics of a fox-tailed squirrel circling the tree, climbing it, and running back down again. A red Irish Setter dog crouched nearby, intently watching the squirrel. Each time the squirrel ran up the tree out of sight, the dog would slowly creep towards the tree. The squirrel paid little attention as the dog crept closer and closer, patiently biding its time. People watching this entertaining drama unfold knew what could happen, but they did nothing, until in a flash, the dog—catching the squirrel unaware—had it in the grip of his sharp teeth.</p>

Few of all ever created have ever glimpsed such a vision: Peter, James and John, Moses, Abraham, and Adam—only a few—ever.

It would take work—hard work—and everyone’s best efforts to make it happen. They became experienced colonizers and benefactors to our nation and to humanity.

Over eight thousand individuals with special needs came in wheelchairs, each bringing relatives or friends to assist them. One young son paused at the entrance to the temple to carefully clean and polish the wheelchair his father was in before entering the sacred interior of the temple. A devoted father lifted his frail fifteen-year-old daughter in his arms as he carried her from her wheelchair into the bride’s dressing room. She looked around and said, “Oh, this is so beautiful.” With a smile on her lips and with tears in her eyes, she gently laid her head on her father’s shoulder and said, “This is where I want to come to be married someday.” This young girl had come to the temple from the hospital, where she has spent most of the past five years—her wish to see the temple fulfilled.</p>

Some religious practices given in those early days have, no doubt, been corrupted as they have been handed down through the ages. But faithful members who understand the eternal nature of the gospel—of God’s holy purpose to bring to pass the eternal life of man—understand clearly why the history of man seems to revolve around the building and use of temples.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p2" pid="cVtIYiieFUeow8N-EH6axg" hash="26PQpA">A few weeks ago, joy and nostalgia dominated our conversation as Sister Haight and I drove to the airport to see our eleventh grandchild leave for his mission. During our brief visit—with warm greetings and emotional embraces—we recalled some of the historical accounts of how the message of the restoration of the gospel had influenced our family, of how our missionary grandson’s great-great-grandfather, Joseph Toronto, heard and believed the message of the gospel from missionaries in Boston in 1843, 150 years ago.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p3" pid="1bax4fhCSkKOpnQ59eaY7g" hash="53TNnw">Joseph Toronto assisted with the building of the Nauvoo Temple. Brigham Young had made a strong appeal on Sunday, July 6, 1845, for the Saints to “remember [and pray for] the temple” and to “pay your tithing.” The Saints were anxious that the temple be finished sufficiently that ordinance work might begin before the exodus westward. More workers and tithing were desperately needed. Joseph Toronto, the new convert, visited Brigham Young after the meeting and declared that “he wanted to give himself and all he had to the kingdom of God.” He handed Brigham Young $2,600 in gold coins (see “Italian Pioneer,” <span class="emphasis">Church News,</span> 20 June 1981, p. 16). Brigham Young blessed the Italian convert, proclaiming that “he should stand at the head of his race and that neither he nor his family should ever want for bread” (<span class="emphasis">Joseph Toronto: Italian Pioneer and Patriarch,</span> comp. Toronto Family Organization, 1983, p. 10). Later, in 1849, he was called to accompany the new Apostle Lorenzo Snow to his native Italy to open that land for the preaching of the gospel (see <span class="emphasis">Church News,</span> 20 June 1981, p. 16).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p4" pid="rL48ZMudI0ad29d3QFZGiw" hash="Q6gcsg">We also spoke of Hector C. Haight, another ancestor, called from his home in Farmington, Utah, to preside over the Scandinavian Mission in 1856 with little or no ability to speak Danish, Swedish, or Norwegian. But, trusting in the Lord and with the assistance of the Scandinavian Saints, he accomplished his assignment. He reported in 1858 that “2,610 souls had been baptized … and [that] 990 members had emigrated to Zion” (Andrew Jenson, <span class="emphasis">History of the Scandinavian Mission,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1927, p. 128).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p5" pid="O5voXneCmUSccUy-zTJ0Qg" hash="bDUMKA">These ancestors, along with many others, gave inspiration and set the precedent of love for the gospel and its divine truth and for missionary service, which our children and grandchildren inherit but must personally acquire for themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p6" pid="KtieiKs11UmehW0ZS6Xvxw" hash="hPcmPA">Our hearts were filled that morning as we again witnessed the miracle that had already begun and which we knew would continue—not only for the next two years, but for the rest of his life—the transformation of a fine young man into a powerful proclaimer and believer of our Lord Jesus Christ. Our gratitude for and trust in the missionary program of the Church—in all of its spiritual dimensions—and for its continuing influence on our family were deepened and strengthened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p7" pid="PpIOwVGCO0uyTXHyDlrCkg" hash="XJv8DA">While watching family expressions of love and joy and tears at the airport, I thought of the hundreds of young men and women and couples who, week after week, leave our missionary training centers around the world to embark on the grandest experience of their lives—going forth to serve our Heavenly Father with all of their heart, might, mind, and strength. That is indeed one of the great miracles of our time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p8" pid="gZoampAexUSWJ4tW5Y4HzQ" hash="5aaB0g">The <span class="emphasis">Church News</span> recently told of Aaron Thatcher, a young man with a love for baseball. Aaron had had many baseball scouts observe his unique talents, but he told them repeatedly that he would not sign a professional contract until after he had fulfilled his obligations to the Lord by serving a two-year mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p9" pid="vS3LdZWE_U27Og5HrhIZSQ" hash="RIIuKQ">“How could a young man turn down such an offer?” people ask. But he did! His desire to serve the Lord was greater than his desire for instant fame. Aaron explained, “I’m going on this mission not because … my Dad went. I’m going because I have a testimony of the gospel and the prophets have told us that every worthy and healthy young man should serve a full-time mission. I want to go with all of my heart” (<span class="emphasis">Church News,</span> 4 Sept. 1993, p. 5).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p10" pid="egPUthu1kkGvJzFaIydVIw" hash="4diWiA">Brothers and sisters, the Lord is opening the way and making it possible to expand His work throughout the world, and what a blessing it is for all of us—each in his own way—to take part. During the past five years, the number of missionaries serving out in the world has grown from 36,000 to some 49,700 as of right now. The number of missions has grown from 220 to 294. Nearly one and a half million new converts have joined the Church during that same period of time. And our missionaries or representatives are now teaching in over forty additional countries where we were <span class="emphasis">not</span> serving five years ago.</p>

Truly, as the Lord foretold in section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, He is hastening His work in its time (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.73" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:73</a>).</p>

After what he had experienced and knew, the Prophet Joseph Smith could boldly write in March of 1842:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p14" pid="OlydVEk8n0e8Nwi3TQ1BLA" hash="Qwql_g">There is a spirit moving upon our people to want to live their lives in harmony with truth, that they may someday respond to an opportunity to serve. This is the same spirit and heavenly influence that directed John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and others to take leave of the Saints from the city of Far West early on the morning of April 26, 1839, before departing for their missions to Great Britain (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/118.4-5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 118:4–5</a>). On that occasion each prayed in turn at the temple site and bore testimony. Then, after a song, they took leave, directed by revelation, filled with the blessings of heaven and the confirming influence of the Holy Ghost. These early Apostles departed for their missions having been spiritually fed and blessed in a manner that would sustain them and their families throughout their many hardships and inspire their powerful testimonies of the truthfulness of the message of the restored church upon the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/missionary-work-our-responsibility.p15" pid="s6Fgqw_UjkyJlVzNprPmGA" hash="I0dJmg">What a privilege and a blessing to be a small part of this great work! With that heritage, however, comes a great responsibility. The Lord needs messengers to match His message. He needs those who are able to wield the mighty and eternal influence that He has placed in their hands. In section 88, where the Lord speaks of hastening His work, He gives to the laborers of His kingdom a commandment to “prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.74" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:74</a>).</p>

In 1839 an epistle of inspiration and direction was sent by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to those who had been called to spread the gospel. In addition to their blessings and testimonies and prayers, they declared:</p>

To serve the Lord as a full-time missionary is a privilege; the primary purpose of full-time missionary service is the building up of the kingdom of God. And the Lord needs His best.

He wrote of a never-to-be-forgotten baptism in which he had participated of a man and a wife and their two children.

As members of His restored church, it is imperative that we do our utmost to expand our understanding of His premortal commission, His earthly ministry, His unjust crucifixion, the agony of His suffering, His final sacrifice, and His resurrection. Each of us is profoundly indebted to Him, for we were purchased by the shedding of His own precious blood. We are surely obligated to follow His admonition, to believe on His name, and to testify of Him and His word.</p>

The proceedings have been most impressive as a new chapter of Church history begins.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p2" pid="ykmiZYDKC0KX62kGUidyFA" hash="QdPqkw">Only a few months ago we mourned the death and loss of a great leader, President Ezra Taft Benson, who served a lifetime of faithful service, dedicating his time and inspired leadership to the building of God’s kingdom here upon the earth and serving his countrymen with deep loyalty and concern for the nation’s welfare. He has joined his eternal companion, Flora, and their other loved ones on the other side in a continuation of his foreordained calling.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p3" pid="vwGQKmK3L06ZwTl-QH-r-A" hash="dpmzlA">Today we are witnesses to and participants in a most sacred occasion—a solemn assembly to act upon heavenly things. As in olden times, there has been much fasting and prayer offered by the Saints throughout the world that they may receive an outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord, which is so much in evidence here on this occasion this morning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p4" pid="iwVVi7ugXkCMuRBK4eyYbg" hash="jSF6Yg">A solemn assembly, as the name implies, denotes a sacred, sober, and reverent occasion when the Saints assemble under the direction of the First Presidency. Solemn assemblies are used for three purposes: the dedication of temples, special instruction to priesthood leaders, and sustaining a new President of the Church. This conference session today is a solemn assembly for the purpose of sustaining a newly called Church President and other officers of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p5" pid="ShZvZdPZQ0WFT2NOLWZzlw" hash="QcKCcQ">There is a pattern to solemn assemblies that distinguishes them from other general Church meetings where we sustain officers of the Church. That pattern, which was established by the Prophet Joseph Smith, is that the priesthood quorums, commencing with the First Presidency, stand and manifest by the uplifted right hand their willingness to sustain the President of the Church as a prophet, seer, and revelator, and uphold him by their confidence, faith, and prayers. The priesthood quorums of the Church so manifest by their vote. Then the general body of all the Saints stand and signify their willingness to do the same. The other leaders of the Church are similarly sustained in their offices and callings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p6" pid="4VRecLu4zkOAS-pIqWTknQ" hash="qNvXUg">When we sustain the President of the Church by our uplifted hand, it not only signifies that we acknowledge before God that he is the rightful possessor of all the priesthood keys; it also means that we covenant with God that we will abide by the direction and the counsel that come through His prophet. It is a solemn covenant.</p>

Following the voting procedure that I described, the Prophet Joseph Smith recorded, “I prophesied to all, that inasmuch as they would uphold these men in their several stations, … the Lord would bless them; … in the name of [Jesus] Christ, the blessings of heaven should be theirs” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 2:418).</p>

Hunter became the President of the Church began when he was called, ordained, and set apart to become a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—a call that was inspired of the Lord. That calling and ordination placed the newly called Apostle in a priesthood quorum with eleven other men who hold the apostleship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p16" pid="PMaCJnKv40SXQUEq-Xo5Ng" hash="Wjh-8w">Each Apostle is ordained under the direction of the President of the Church, who holds the keys of all of the kingdom of God.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p17" pid="5v_Ez-uUCU6HSZfO7ksqQw" hash="vxpUXA">We declare that the authority to administer in the name of God is operative in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today. We further testify that this power or commission was conferred on the first officers of the Church by ordination under the hands of those who held the same power in earlier dispensations. Joseph Smith received the keys of the apostleship from Peter, James, and John, the same who held the authority of the apostleship in the New Testament times. This authority has come down from the Prophet Joseph Smith to President Howard W. Hunter.</p>

One such was an elder who was sent by Joseph Smith to preach the gospel. It was not long until he proclaimed himself a high priest and that he had been ordained by an angel from heaven. He deceived some Church members. He was called back to Ohio by the Prophet Joseph Smith and questioned about his claims. He soon confessed that he had lied and begged forgiveness. Orson Hyde, one of the Twelve Apostles, recorded the principle that the Prophet then taught all those who were assembled in the School of the Prophets:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p19" pid="7m959qAwpEyaQCnZyZqdjg" hash="k4UFKg">“No true angel from God will ever come to ordain any man, because they have once been sent to establish the priesthood by ordaining me thereunto; … the priesthood being once established on earth, with power to ordain others, no heavenly messenger will ever come to interfere with that power by ordaining any more. … You may therefore know, from this time forward, that if any man comes to you professing to be ordained by an angel, he is either a liar or has been imposed upon in consequence of transgression by an angel of the devil, for this priesthood shall never be taken away from this church” (<span class="emphasis">Millennial Star,</span> 20 Nov. 1846, p. 139).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p21" pid="01HNcUniKESDQNzsIT6nVQ" hash="nhZX8g">“God, having once bestowed the keys of the holy Priesthood on man here on the earth for the up-building of His Church, will never take them from the man or men who hold them [who lead the Church] and <span class="emphasis">authorize others to bestow them”</span> (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 13:47; emphasis added).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p22" pid="StdqX0KLw06C9rfC8KhIGA" hash="x0Js8A">The instructions by the Prophet Joseph Smith and Elder George Q. Cannon should be a warning and testimony to any “pretender” who claims apostolic authority on the basis that he has been visited by angels. It should also be a warning to anyone who may be so deceived as to follow these false shepherds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p23" pid="8viFxsmd_UKWY5j1j-sIGg" hash="eocxaA">We have sustained as God’s prophet on earth a kind, sensitive servant of God—Howard William Hunter. He is a humble, faithful, scholarly, and gentle soul, one who has experienced deep sorrow and suffered serious infirmities and even a threat upon his life, but, with his Scottish ancestral determination, has never given in or given up.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p24" pid="9FcfOnbf_ECXnALKRRUI8A" hash="oUDJeA">How tenderly he cared for his Claire during her illness, sitting by her bedside night after night, caring for her every need.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p25" pid="R-N3NiEguUO3HQYLFjCcSg" hash="7hPc3g">President Hunter understands compassion, thankfulness, graciousness, charity, and gratitude towards individuals and towards mankind, and he has the saintly bearing of a prophet of God. He, in my estimation, is truly Christlike.</p>

Hunter,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1994, p. 101). That blessing has proven true.</p>

Hunter was called to be the new stake president of the Pasadena California Stake by Elders Stephen L Richards and Harold B. Lee. President Hunter not only served his stake members with distinction but assisted the expanding Church in many priesthood leadership assignments in welfare, education, and missionary opportunities, and he had a significant role in the building of the Los Angeles Temple.</p>

McKay in October 1959. On that occasion President McKay said to him, “The Lord has spoken. You are called to be one of his special witnesses, and tomorrow you will be sustained as a member of the Council of the Twelve” (Knowles, <span class="emphasis">Howard W. Hunter,</span> p. 144).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/solemn-assemblies.p32" pid="vAkgN18dv0-de-SOxSrZLw" hash="TkmZ3A">“As one called and ordained to bear witness of the name of Jesus Christ to all the world, I testify … that he lives. He has a glorified, immortal body of flesh and bones. He is the Only Begotten Son of the Father in the flesh. He is the Savior, the Light and Life of the world. Following his crucifixion and death, he appeared as a resurrected being to Mary, to Peter, to Paul, and to many others. He showed himself to the Nephites. He has shown himself to Joseph Smith, the boy prophet, and to many others in our dispensation. This is his church; he leads it today” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1988, p. 17).</p>

Hunter as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the noble men—President Gordon B. Hinckley and President Thomas S.

All are great men of God—faithful and fearless—who, as inspired servants of God, will lead the Church forward, on to greater heights and expansion throughout the world.</p>

As you know, we have some time restraints. There was concern as to how to notify him when his time was up. A little flashing light was put on the podium, and during one of his talks he said, “There’s a light here that keeps flashing.” The next conference they made the light red, but he just put his hand over it. So I might resort to some of that today. As we age, we get to the point where the teleprompter doesn’t work for us anymore; then the printers seem to be doing a poor job in printing the text; and then the ink doesn’t seem to be as good as it used to be, either! But I am honored and grateful to be here with you.</p>

Hinckley. I felt that as he spelled out his words of counsel to us this morning with such firm direction and inspiration, encouraging us to raise our sights for achievement, that the Lord’s voice was being heard. In the eighty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord teaches us that his voice is Spirit (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.66" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:66</a>).</p>

As the choir was singing those words, I was thinking of the strength that I have felt not only in this conference but throughout my life—the strength that we receive by being faithful, obedient members of the Church. Living as we should becomes our strength of character.</p>

My father, Hector, was a teenager when they moved. My mother, Clara, was a teenager living in Tooele, Utah, when her father was asked to move to Oakley and build the first flour mill there. And so Hector and Clara fell in love out in that little Idaho town.</p>

They knew what to do. I remind those of you who may not have your geography straight that in that part of Idaho it is about 180 miles to the Logan Temple. But my parents went to the Logan Temple from that little town to be married on May 15, 1890. I’ve often wondered how they made the trip. Imagine one of the old double-seat surrey buggies without any sides on it, pulled by a team of horses. In spite of spring rains, they set out to go 180 miles in the buggy.</p>

Imagine those young people with some of their party organizing to travel 180 miles. It would take a week. They set out to make the seven-day trip to the temple in that buggy. They were without sleeping bags or winter clothing as we know it today, but they had clothing that was appropriate for that time—blankets and quilts, and some flour sacks filled with food.</p>

Picture in your minds what went on only a few years ago, and your travel to a temple will not seem so inconvenient.</p>

And as part of those tender moments, she fixed a little basket for us to put in the car. She said to me, “David, promise me that you’ll take good care of Ruby.” And I said, “I promise.” I remind Ruby periodically that someday I’m going to meet her mother, and I hope I will be able to look her straight in the eye and say, “I think maybe I’ve done it.”</p>

We’d never been to California before, so when we finally made it to Lake Tahoe, that large lake looked warm and beautiful. I didn’t know that it was icy cold under the first inch of water. We found a little motel and went in and put on our swimsuits. I wanted to demonstrate to her that she had married a real “he-man.” We went on the pier out in the lake, and I thought it looked so wonderful. The sun was just going down. I dove straight down, to demonstrate to Ruby what a “find” she had made. As I dove through the icy water farther down, I thought I was a goner. I clamored to get out.</p>

We found a furnished apartment for forty-five dollars a month. But our second day, when I came home that evening, I discovered that my key wouldn’t work in the door. I finally went to the manager and said, “I’m sorry, my key doesn’t work.” She said, “Oh, that’s all right. Your wife has moved you.” I said, “Moved us?” “Yes,” she said, “we had another apartment that was five dollars less.”</p>

We moved to California on three different occasions. We moved to Illinois twice. We’ve moved back and forth and around. But out of that, we look back upon it all with joy. Now, with our three children and our fifty-plus grand- and great-grandchildren, we say, “What a wonderful life has been ours.”</p>

So as we look upon our family, we are pleased that all who could of our grandsons and some of our granddaughters have served missions. They all understand and can sing “I Am a Child of God” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 301) and other wonderful songs of Zion. We’re proud of them. One member of our family has a little painting, a watercolor, not made by a famous artist. The painting was made by some Armenian children. It was given as a gift of thanks in return for a gift of life because some of the family and some of the grandchildren helped get food across the border into Armenia. Life is rich and full and wonderful. It all falls into place if we help it by the way we live.</p>

I had a phone call from Lenore Romney in Detroit, Michigan. Lenore is the wife of George Romney. She said, “George died this morning.” She wanted to know if I could arrange to attend the funeral. I told her I would be honored to come but that I would need to arrange it with those who are my superiors in the Church.</p>

I walked across the canal over to the area where the Romneys used to live. George’s father’s name was Gaskell Romney. My father was their bishop. I looked at the area. The house wasn’t there anymore. Then I walked along the old irrigation canal bank. I looked at the area where my father baptized me. I looked at where George and I used to swim. Swimming suits in those days were a pair of bib overalls, not the high-fashioned kind you see today but the real denim, old-fashioned bib overalls. We cut the legs off and cut the pockets out so we wouldn’t drown. That’s all we had for swimming suits. We used to sit on the canal bank in a little bit of sunshine and shiver because it was so cold. But swimming was our main recreation. George and I were about the same age. He was my friend. He was my pal.</p>

Abraham Lincoln was only seven when Nancy Hanks died, and they loved each other very much. But in that tender poem, the Benéts reflected that if Nancy Hanks came back today, she might ask, Whatever happened to my boy, Abe? Did he get to town? Did he learn to read? Did he ever amount to anything? (See “Nancy Hanks,” in Edwin Markham, comp. <span class="emphasis">The Book of American Poetry,</span> New York: Wm. H. Wise and Co., 1936, p. 791.)</p>

The governor said George Romney was a great man who never allowed service to man to obscure service to God. The <span class="emphasis">Detroit News</span> said George Romney used his religion as a compass to chart his public life.</p>

Today is the anniversary of the organization of the Church 166 years ago today in the Peter Whitmer farmhouse in Fayette, New York. Just imagine what has happened since then! As we sang “I Stand All Amazed” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 193), I thought about those in attendance in that farmhouse. They would “stand all amazed” if they could see what has happened to that little organization since its humble beginning on 6 April 1830. And the world in general would “stand all amazed” if they, too, realized our growth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/this-work-is-true.p2" pid="jTVFcMi5A0eIu4cMEG8BOw" hash="yIE-2A">I’m glad the opening song was “The Morning Breaks” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 1). Those words were written by Parley P. Pratt and were printed in the first issue of the <span class="emphasis">Millennial Star,</span> published in Liverpool when that first group of missionaries sent by the Prophet Joseph Smith arrived in England. Those words were carefully penned by Parley P. Pratt so that the people out in the world would have some understanding as to who they were. As we sing those words, “The morning breaks, the shadows flee; lo, Zion’s standard is unfurled!” we can envision that standard up on the flagpole, blowing in the wind. We can almost see that flag of freedom and liberty declaring the Restoration of the gospel to all the world. What a wonderful opportunity for us to reflect upon how the gospel has spread throughout the world during the 166 years since the Church was organized.</p>

During their visit, Leo Tolstoi said to Dr. White, “I wish you would tell me about your American religion.” Dr. White explained that there were a number of religions in America. Count Tolstoi said, “I want to know about the <span class="emphasis">American</span> religion. … The Church to which I refer … is commonly known as the Mormon Church.” Dr. White said, “I know very little concerning them.” Count Tolstoi said, “Dr. White, I am greatly surprised. … [They] teach the people not only of Heaven and its attendant glories, but how to live so that their social and economic relations with each other are placed on a sound basis. … If Mormonism is able to endure, unmodified, until it reaches the third and fourth generations, it is destined to become the greatest power the world has ever known” (<span class="emphasis">A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,</span> rev. ed.

As he pronounced these blessings upon little Mark, I had the desire that he might know what I know and feel what I feel about some of the spiritual blessings that have entered into my life. I desired that his life would also be filled with spiritual experiences similar to one I had 26 years ago today when I was called to be an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

I just wanted to find my wife, Ruby, and tell her what had happened. I went up to the ninth floor of the Hotel Utah, where Ruby was visiting with some family. I remember knocking on the door and opening it just a couple of inches so I could motion for her to come out. Of course, she wondered what was happening and came out into the hall.</p>

Finally she stopped me and said, “Well, say something.” Then I looked at her, put my hands on her shoulders, and told her what had happened. She started to cry. The two of us stood there with our arms around one another and people walking by wondering who those silly boobs were crying in the hallway. But we didn’t pay any attention to the traffic because something momentous was happening to us. Our lives had been changed.</p>

I was the junior member of the Quorum of the Twelve. I was there. I was there with the outpouring of the Spirit in that room so strong that none of us could speak afterwards. We just left quietly to go back to the office. No one could say anything because of the powerful outpouring of the heavenly spiritual experience.</p>

The headline in the paper said, “Mormons Give Blacks Priesthood.” And the subheading said, “President Kimball Claims to Have Received a Revelation.” I bought a copy of the newspaper. I stared at one word in that subheading—<span class="emphasis">claims.</span> It stood out to me just like it was in red neon. As I walked along the hallway to make my plane connection, I thought, <span class="emphasis">Here I am now in Chicago walking through this busy airport, yet I was a witness to this revelation. I was there. I witnessed it. I felt that heavenly influence. I was part of it.</span> Little did the editor of that newspaper realize the truth of that revelation when he wrote, “… Claims to Have Received a Revelation.” Little did he know, or the printer, or the man who put the ink on the press, or the one who delivered the newspaper—little did any of them know that it was truly a revelation from God. Little did they know what I knew because I was a witness to it.</p>

All this work is true. I leave you my love, my witness, and I pray that you will live and raise your own families in such a way that you will be part of the great army needed to carry the message of hope and salvation to all the world.

I’m glad that the First Presidency saw fit to have me back on the program. As we get older we have some limitations. I understand mine, and sometimes we can learn to sort of plow around them. If our vision starts getting a little weaker, I’ve found that we can compensate by doing other things and plowing around that little weakness and maybe strengthening some others. But out of all of that, I want you to know of my love for the gospel and for my knowledge of its truthfulness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/prophets-are-inspired.p2" pid="RajacAVKiEudYKlqkyLvQA" hash="1_I2fw">We were singing a great song as the intermediate hymn, “Now Let Us Rejoice,” written by W. W. Phelps (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 3). That was written following an incident in Independence, Missouri, where Brother Phelps was the editor of a little newspaper. He had a printing press, and the people who were unfriendly toward the Church decided to do away with it, and the mob broke in and burned the building and destroyed the printing press. They burned some 200 homes of the Saints in showing their displeasure over the people following this movement. In that despair W. W. Phelps wrote those words, “Now let us rejoice in the day of salvation. No longer as strangers on earth need we roam,” bringing hope to the people and encouragement. With hope that those things will happen in our lives, we move on because of the truthfulness of what we are attempting to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/prophets-are-inspired.p3" pid="fLjA0u8dh0qU6QtM7XQrRw" hash="egKIbA">I want all of you to know that I know that the work that we do is the gospel of our Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, as taught by Him when He was upon the earth, when He called Apostles and the disciples followed Him and He carried on His ministry in teaching them. I’ve often reflected upon the experience of when John and Andrew, these two young men, were introduced to the Savior by John the Baptist and they followed the Savior and stayed with Him that day, as it is recorded by John (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.39" class="scriptureRef">John 1:39</a>). They were in His presence. They would have shaken hands with Him. They would have known the inflection in His voice. They would have heard Him testify who He is, that He came to do the will of the Father. They would have been in that holy presence. After having that experience, Andrew had to share it with somebody, so he found his brother Simon and took him to Jesus. Because of that feeling that Andrew had in his heart—that he had to share what he knew and what he felt and what he had seen—he shared it with his own brother as he brought him to the Savior. The holiness and personal influence of the Savior made an ordinary Simon into an extraordinary Apostle. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.35-42" class="scriptureRef">John 1:35–42</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/prophets-are-inspired.p4" pid="SBt6SKZpVEypHFWh6GFgdg" hash="ChIvrQ">I have been impressed with all of the prophets since the time of the Prophet Joseph Smith—he who by revelation received the message, the visit from God the Father and His Son, as Brother Aldin Porter has explained to us in detail this morning. I know that in order to usher in this work, that visitation took place, giving the Prophet Joseph Smith the vision and the determination and the ability to withstand all that he did in order to help bring about the Restoration. Heavenly messengers and revelations came to the Prophet Joseph Smith to help usher in this great work, which we declare to all the world and that I know to be true. I know that the prophets who have followed since the time of the Prophet Joseph Smith were all called of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/prophets-are-inspired.p5" pid="6HYAGLzS0EWhU9hufmY8ZA" hash="BZKQ8w">It is always thrilling to me to read more of the lives of those wonderful men. One of those I would like to mention this morning was President David O. McKay, who came into my life as the first prophet to teach and influence me personally.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/prophets-are-inspired.p6" pid="mLGULakwwkq6U1lxW_ZP4Q" hash="BVntSw">I was called to be a stake president in California just before President McKay was sustained in a solemn assembly as the President of the Church and as our prophet. My wife, Ruby, and I drove to Salt Lake to be in attendance at that conference. I felt of that spirit, of that leadership, and of the direction that President McKay gave to the Church at that time. Later on I invited him to come to California to dedicate a Church building that we had just finished. That was in the days when we would raise half the money to buy the land and half the money to pay for a building, not like it is today, but where we felt a real ownership in the Church property and in buildings. President McKay came as a result of my invitation, which surprised me. We met him at the train and were pleased to have him in our home. That gave me a new vision of the magnitude and the breadth and the importance of the mission that we have here upon the earth to fulfill.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/prophets-are-inspired.p7" pid="WYOK5GrTNEui3KofPWrT9g" hash="4kXedQ">Later President Spencer W. Kimball became a great influence in my life. I am mentioning only a few Church Presidents because of the shortness of time here this morning. How President Kimball taught us! In his wonderful manner, he taught from the scriptures and discussed principles and policy and doctrine in a way that would help lift our hearts and souls. He told a story of a young soldier who had gone into the army. He had written a letter home to his parents saying that he had been at the shooting range learning how to handle a rifle and that he had been taught how to handle a hand grenade. In writing home, this young man said, “In learning how to handle a hand grenade, we were throwing duds, ones that weren’t real.” Then he said, “When we were throwing duds, I was able to get 35 feet away, but today they gave us the real thing and I got 80 feet away.” President Kimball could touch our lives in a way that helped us see and understand things to be done.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/prophets-are-inspired.p8" pid="lQYxmt_UhkGnHyKKxfBWbg" hash="iJgN4A">I want to remind you that six months ago, following conference on Sunday, we went home to listen to a television program. We were concerned for President Gordon B. Hinckley. (I had the privilege and the honor to watch him for a number of years before he became our prophet and leader. I watched the careful way that he carried on the affairs of the Church that had been his while he was a counselor to three Presidents.) President Hinckley was to appear on a nationwide television program, and we wondered how it would come across. We knew of the importance of it and what it would mean to us. We knew of the work and the hours of prayer and meditation and study that our prophet and leader had done in being prepared for this exposure which would reach, according to the information we have received, some 35 million people. You will remember, as I remember now, the anticipation and the wonderment of how this would come across.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/prophets-are-inspired.p9" pid="v8mJnxXW0km5UYbwdyJH3Q" hash="m3Vt1A">After that program was over, my heart was beating fast, and I felt it would burst. I was filled with joy and thanksgiving to the Lord for the way our prophet and our leader had handled the interrogation by one who had a reputation of attempting to ask questions that might be difficult to handle. What a joy it was for us to witness how our prophet and our leader had been blessed and magnified! As I watched his face on the television, and I’m sure you would have had the same reaction, I realized that a vast number of people were seeing what a prophet of God looked like: a kind, good, and handsome man, clean and intelligent. You could see the outstanding character, the personality of our prophet and leader, who would be exposed to that vast audience of people. And then when the interrogator asked President Hinckley, “Do you really believe that story that heavenly beings appeared to that young boy in that grove of trees? Do you really believe that to be true?” And here our prophet just instantly said, “Of course I do. Isn’t it great?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/prophets-are-inspired.p10" pid="Vz4eFpcN0EeFgIHTCHs8GQ" hash="SjrsnA">Those words have been ringing through my ears ever since that happened. “Of course I do. Isn’t it great?” He made that pronouncement with such confidence and with that wonderful personality he has, declaring it to all of the world. We want President Hinckley to know that since that time, missionary activity in the United States in the area where people who heard that program reside has picked up, and member activity has picked up too. More people have become interested in the Church because they have seen a living prophet in the flesh stand before that immense audience and declare to the world, “Of course I do. Isn’t is great?” We would hope and pray that the missionaries throughout the world would have that same feeling and that same understanding and that same determination—to want to so declare this message of hope and salvation and eternal life to all the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/prophets-are-inspired.p11" pid="hh7aeYczZke0VNmZQ-CgCA" hash="8_3HLA">I thank the Lord every day for the health and determination I have to make the best use of every hour I have upon the earth to help in the spreading of this work. I leave you my love, my witness, and my own deep knowledge and conviction that it is true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

It’s thrilling to stand here and look out on this vast audience in the Tabernacle and then think of what is happening throughout the world. The songs that we have just heard, I think, are quite appropriate. “Where Can I Turn for Peace?” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 129)—we could talk about that topic all evening. Before that, we heard the stirring song “Let the Mountains Shout for Joy,” written by Evan Stephens. As we reflect upon the sesquicentennial year of our pioneers’ arrival, you can imagine the thrill that the Saints must have felt when they sang that song or heard it for the first time. After they had made the trek across the plains and accomplished all that they had done—the suffering and the living in the wagon beds and sleeping out on the ground and walking barefooted and burying the dead out on the prairie—finally to arrive in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, there to establish Zion, you can imagine how they would later sing, “Let the mountains shout for joy, let the valleys sing.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p2" pid="EWloTme87EuMAjB019Z8Mg" hash="1iX5yA">We can do that now as we reflect upon our ancestors who were part of that trek and all that they have done in making the way for us and then envision the Church today. As we heard the statistics read today and as we reflect upon what is happening throughout the world regarding the image of the Church, the growth, and the continued expansion of stakes and wards and membership worldwide into new countries, new areas, again we could sing with great enthusiasm, “Let the mountains shout for joy.” Here we are, and the word is spreading the way it has been predicted and the way it should be done.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p3" pid="kW3GBbpm2kuPa-TKfs8kiQ" hash="mIhlRw">I’m honored to be able to be on the program here tonight. I’m getting old enough now that I just about span the 20th century. I’m missing six years of the beginning of the century—I was born in 1906—and I have three years on the other end, which would cover the 100 years. The other day when President Hinckley was talking about a dedication coming up in the year 2000, he said to me, “And I’m planning on your being there.” I said, “I’ll plan on being there.” So if I can make that date, that would close the three on the upper end and I’m only short the six at the beginning. That would give me 94 percent of the 100 years of this century.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p4" pid="u5Hg5luHxE2cGpMFkuZcrQ" hash="ovwOsA">Now as I reflect upon the 20th century and what I have learned, I would like to say something to the Aaronic Priesthood, particularly about what I have witnessed and what I have felt during that time.</p>

There were 55 stakes. There were 22 missions. There were some 1,500 missionaries as far as I’ve been able to calculate, which would mean about 70 missionaries per mission in 22 missions. The work was moving forward that year that I came into existence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p6" pid="4nvCR-h7D0CjbJQrOtwQ_g" hash="-zTiYw">The story was told by my mother that on the morning I was born, on a Sunday, my father was quite proud. He was the bishop of the Oakley First Ward in Oakley, Idaho, and he went outside to announce it to one of our Scandinavian friends, Brother Petersen, who was walking by. My father asked him to come in and see the new son. My mother said I was the homeliest little child she had ever seen. I was undernourished, wrinkled, and bald headed. And so Brother Petersen after looking at me said, “Sister Haight, do you tink he’s worth boddering with?” Well, that was my entrance into the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p7" pid="S27FJ3zgs0eWut3--GhZ1g" hash="AYhFlQ">And now from that time I’ve seen automobiles come into being, and the first airplanes. I’ve seen radio develop from a little crystal with a “cat whisker” to tune it, to the beginning of the modern electronics world. I remember that we would sit in the Idaho Power Company at night with a little radio and scratch with that little whisker, and we would get some terrible static. We thought we were tuned in to China because we couldn’t understand what was going on.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p8" pid="OHYCMYnsSUipf34VVjYenQ" hash="RqDJZA">As I think of the world that I knew when I was young, the basics that we talk about were in place then. With all of the things that I’ve seen happen since I’ve lived upon the earth, nothing has come along to change the basics. We now have the great ability to communicate as rapidly as we do and in the various ways that we do. We can travel faster—through the air, in automobiles, and so on—but the basics, the eternal principles, haven’t changed a bit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p9" pid="D1d0xakJBkev-Vy2M7SbVw" hash="qBppvQ">Those of you who are young today—and I’m thinking of the deacons who are assembled in meetings throughout the world—I remember when I was ordained a deacon by Bishop Adams. He took the place of my father when he died. My father baptized me, but he wasn’t there when I received the Aaronic Priesthood. I remember the thrill that I had when I became a deacon and now held the priesthood, as they explained to me in a simple way and simple language that I had received the power to help in the organization and the moving forward of the Lord’s program upon the earth. We receive that as 12-year-old boys. We go through those early ranks of the lesser priesthood—a deacon, a teacher, and then a priest—learning little by little, here a little and there a little, growing in knowledge and wisdom. That little testimony that you start out with begins to grow, and you see it magnifying and you see it building in a way that is understandable to you. You can feel the magnitude of it as you start to grow up and prepare for manhood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p10" pid="yAzmg2wS7US1Dpa6tPGLCQ" hash="a7fTkQ">Speaking of preparing for manhood, I remember when I was 12 years old. I was the head man around the house. I was a man by the time I was 12 because my mother expected that of me. She was not looked upon as a widow; she was my mother, to raise, to teach, and to train us and to help us prepare for life. And so I would say to the boys in the Aaronic Priesthood, remember the simple, simple basics that we learn from the beginning, that we’re taught in the scriptures. Starting with Adam, the basics were upon the earth, and with the development of mankind, and the speed of automobiles or airplanes or communication, none of those gospel basics has changed. They’re still in place. We have to be prepared as we move on through life, learning to do the things that are essential for us to advance in the priesthood or advance in positions in society or in whatever it might be, but we have to learn to obey the simple, basic rules of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p11" pid="Kr0nidi6-kS3If1uPm3lIQ" hash="d69m1Q">As the First Presidency came in tonight, one of them said, “Knock a home run,” and someone else said, “Kick a field goal.” That reminded me that a few years ago I told a meeting such as this of a football story that I was involved in when the school board in Oakley, Idaho, was able to raise enough money to buy 12 football outfits (see “The Responsibility of Young Aaronic Priesthood Bearers,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1981, 42). We hadn’t played football; we’d played basketball because that was easy to do and was cheap and wouldn’t require much equipment. But they finally were able to buy 12 uniforms so we’d have a full team and one substitute. Our coach was the chemistry teacher. He had seen a game one time, and so he taught us how to tackle and run up and down the field and run a few simple plays, but we had never seen an actual team play.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p12" pid="LS776iCev0qibAYaUPiROQ" hash="1tB7tw">Our first game was to play Twin Falls, Idaho, who the year before had been the state high school champs. We got in the little Ford cars and traveled to Twin Falls. We put on our suits and basketball shoes and went out on the field, all 12 of us, and after we had run around a little loosening up, the band started to play and in came their football team. They had more in their band than we had in our whole high school. But as their team came in in their big Green Bay Packer outfits, we were amazed. There were 39 of them in full uniform.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p13" pid="8loQjIf3j0eGXI8qnicMRQ" hash="h8TWwQ">Well, as you could imagine, the game was interesting. They kicked off to us, and we tried a couple of plays and didn’t go anywhere, so we kicked it to get rid of the ball. Each time we would get the ball, we would kick, and each time they would get hold of the ball, they would score. It was an interesting afternoon. Near the end of the game, when we were battered and bloody and beaten, they started to get a little reckless, and Clifford Lee, who was playing halfback with me, had one of their wild passes land right in his arms. He wondered what to do with it. But he saw them coming after him and he started to run. He was not running for points; he was running for his life. He scored a touchdown.</p>

The Twin Falls paper just two or three years ago had an article about their great football teams. They listed that game against Oakley, and the score they published in the paper was 106 to 7. I wrote the editor of the paper, and I said, “Dear Editor, I thought you would like to hear from someone who played on the other side.” So I described the game to him, and I said, “We didn’t try an extra point because we didn’t have anyone who could have kicked the extra point. And you should correct the score in your records, because it was 106 to 6.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/the-basics-have-not-changed.p15" pid="RKXhyT6ekkmEUxUZv5IkUg" hash="oiaWTQ">Well, that is part of life and the opportunity we have to be prepared; and when there is something to be done and things to be learned in order to accomplish it, then we have to learn the basics and how to carry them out.</p>

As I think of the missionary force we have out in the world, my, what a great opportunity to carry out the Lord’s work in the way that it must be done. We love you for what you’re doing. You boys in the Aaronic Priesthood, be as good as you ought to be and learn to be clean and honest and pure and forthright and obedient—obedient above all things—that you might be able to carry out the Lord’s work in the majestic way in which it must be done.</p>

I have watched him closely now for more than 20 years, seeing his ability, his talent, his dedication, and the spiritual impact that he brings to the world as he leads this work. This work is true. It will move forward to fill every corner of the earth. People will have an opportunity to hear with their own ears—to hear someone declare that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, which I declare to you. I leave you my love, my witness that this work is true, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I was very moved by it. In just imagining and visualizing what lies ahead of us, I know all he is saying to be true. As I’ve had the opportunity to work with him for some years now and to feel of his spirit, his understanding, his desire, his deep faith, and the inspiration that comes to him in that office, I knew this morning that we were hearing words of the future from a prophet.</p>

My first opportunity to really become acquainted with “Come, Come, Ye Saints” was in a little stone tabernacle in southern Idaho, where I grew up as a boy. Inside that little tabernacle built out of lava rock by the local members of the Church back in the late 1880s there was a stand, a podium similar to what we have here, and then a pipe organ in the back, like this beautiful pipe organ we have here, but smaller. This was before electricity and motors, and it had a pump system. The way air got into the pipe organ is through a bellow system. Someone would sit on a stool and pump the lever at the back of the organ. It was always a great privilege to a young man to be selected to sit on that stool and pump the organ.</p>

You could feel it because of the power, the faith, and the testimony of the members. In that little tabernacle we would have Aaronic Priesthood choruses where we’d learn to sing. It was there we would sing “A Mormon Boy.” We don’t hear that song much anymore. I wish we would. “A Mormon boy, a Mormon boy, / I am a Mormon boy. / I might be envied by a king, / For I am a Mormon boy” (Evan Stephens, in <span class="emphasis">Best-Loved Poems of the LDS People,</span> comp. Jack M. Lyon and others [1996], 296).</p>

Just think of that for a moment. “I might be envied by a king.” Here’s a king with all the power, all the pomp, all the wealth the king would have. But I was beginning to learn that we held, as members of the Church, blessings, priesthood blessings, knowledge, information that the king wouldn’t know about and didn’t have. “I might be envied by a king, / For I am a Mormon boy.”</p>

His father was a teacher, and William had received a good education. He was a good penman, he was good with figures, and he was good at writing and keeping records. He was taught and baptized by the Heber C. Kimball missionary group in the early days of the Church in England. They understood and accepted him readily because of his education and his penmanship. He was just a bright young fellow, 23 years old. Soon he was being used as a secretary, a scribe, or as a bookkeeper by the little organization of the Church over there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/hymn-of-the-obedient-all-is-well.p8" pid="KsO0p_-tnEW_u066wQHpAQ" hash="6C68QQ">By the time he was 24, he and his wife wanted to go to Nauvoo, so they sailed for America. In Nauvoo he met the Prophet and other leaders of the Church. They used him in interesting ways again because he wrote a beautiful hand and he was a good speller. They could use a young man of that kind. But after the Martyrdom of the Prophet he sided with Brigham Young and the Twelve and became one of their scribes and the secretary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/hymn-of-the-obedient-all-is-well.p9" pid="-_kWBespqkGMmguzppLhpA" hash="3Mx5ng">After the Martyrdom of the Prophet, he left with the Brigham Young company and had the experience in Iowa that inspired the writing of this wonderful song that we have today. They left in February; it was now April. Slogging through the fields with the wagons and the horses and the teams and the rain and the mud in Iowa, they were discouraged. The going was difficult, people were dying, and babies were born. They were moving slowly, only traveling a few miles a day. In their discouragement, William Clayton wrote in his journal that he sat on a wagon tongue and wrote a song, hoping it would encourage and give some renewed hope and faith to the Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/hymn-of-the-obedient-all-is-well.p10" pid="ZOQDMPBawkaKr5joo1_u6w" hash="oeqa8A">So he wrote “Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear.” It was difficult. They were discouraged. “But with joy wend your way. / Though hard to you this journey may appear, / Grace shall be as your day.” He was giving them encouragement to keep going, that the situation would get better.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/hymn-of-the-obedient-all-is-well.p11" pid="PsaPKlTT70ugnlTfzafb-Q" hash="DWbTYQ">Then he wrote those wonderful lines, “We’ll find the place which God for us prepared, / Far away in the West.” Even though we’re stuck here in the mud and discouraged, this will all change. If we have the courage and the faith the Lord will answer our prayers; it will all come about. It gave them hope and encouragement. “We’ll find the place which God for us prepared, / Far away … / Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid”—stirring, inspirational words.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/hymn-of-the-obedient-all-is-well.p12" pid="bRxbrtC46UmFWDL_iqfGqw" hash="ldfBGA">And then the last verse that the choir sang so beautifully this morning, “And should we die before our journey’s through, / Happy day! All is well!” So if we die, we’ve done our best. We’re going to die sometime, as we all know. So “Happy day! All is well!”</p>

All is well!”—if we get there and if we have the courage to make it work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/hymn-of-the-obedient-all-is-well.p14" pid="2Zd4XfNr00y7BsFshYTeIw" hash="CcNAGQ">And in his journal he wrote, “I’ve composed a new song—‘All is well’” (<span class="emphasis">William Clayton’s Journal</span> [1921], 19). I like that original title, “All is Well! All is Well!” which explains our lives if we live as we should. We have the outline, we have the procedures, we have the information, and if we can get there and if our lives are spared again then we will be able to sing “All is well! All is well!” That hymn has become the Church’s “national anthem.”</p>

Wards and stakes all over the world have produced wonderful and unusual ways to celebrate the Sesquicentennial.</p>

So when we sing of walking with “Faith in Every Footstep,” I have a grandfather who did that. At 15 you were not riding in the wagon; you were out where the action was, hitting the horses and the oxen and doing whatever would need to be done. And the girl that he later married, Louisa Leavitt, turned 11 when her family arrived in the valley. So Grandmother would have walked across also.</p>

But all of these things are dependent upon how we live, how we accept the truths that we know about, how we live the principles of the gospel, and what kind of examples we become to those people we work and associate with.</p>

The only piece of athletic equipment that we had around our house was an old baseball mitt. We didn’t have footballs in those days. We didn’t have a lot of other things. I thought the great moment in my life would be that I would be playing baseball for the New York Yankees, and this was back in the days when the Yankees were a great team. I would be playing for them in the World Series, the games tied 3 and 3. Now in the deciding game, guess who would get up to bat? As I stood at the plate, the pitcher would pitch the ball exactly where I’d want it, I’d knock it out of Yankee Stadium, and I would become the hero of the World Series. I thought that would be the great moment of my life. But I want you to know that that isn’t true.</p>

We had our sons there with their wives—they’d been married just for a short time—and our sweet daughter was kneeling at the altar, holding the hand of the young man she was to be sealed to. And as I looked around the room I then realized that this was the great moment of my life because I had in that room everything that was precious to me—everything. My wife was there, my eternal sweetheart and companion. Our three children were there with their eternal companions. And I thought, David, in your youth you had things all wrong. You thought some worldly event of some kind might be the great event of your life. But now, I was witnessing that great event. I was there, I was feeling it, I felt a part of it, and I knew in that little white sealing room—clean, sweet, pure in that room—with all of my family there that this was the great moment of my life.</p>

As Latter-day Saints we need to be true to the faith that we profess. True to it. True to the stirring testimonies that we have been given. True to Him whose name we have taken and to so live and to declare and to help in the spreading of this work, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p1" pid="mNL9A48F30eYBqwIcm-JLA" hash="Ic4NFw">My dear brothers and sisters, what a wonderful occasion, what a beautiful day, what a glorious time this is, and particularly for me to have an opportunity to stand here following that stirring declaration and testimony of God’s prophet here upon the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p2" pid="8_H2XLZQ1U6NGtJb1ezqHQ" hash="0nHPFQ">As he held up that copy of the Book of Mormon from the first edition, I thought of an experience we had a few years ago as we attended a mission presidents’ seminar. At the closing of the two-day seminar in the Palmyra-Fayette area, we held a dinner in the reconstructed Peter Whitmer farmhouse, that beautiful little building where the Church was organized 168 years ago this weekend. It was such a moving occasion. The only cooking arrangement they had in that little log cabin was the fireplace. We looked at the fireplace, with a pot hanging where they did their cooking. They didn’t have any of the conveniences of today, of course. There was a well outside for their water.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p3" pid="RKU0kVk_pkubVeueV008xw" hash="tZz9xQ">Near the end of that very spiritual meeting with those mission presidents, I walked up the stairs and looked at the two little bedrooms. The Peter Whitmer family lived there. But they turned one of those rooms over to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and there he did some of the translating of the Book of Mormon. Oliver Cowdery worked with him in that humble little setting. My heart burned with the wonderful feeling I had of just being in that little farmhouse and imagining what took place and the blessings of heaven that had been poured out upon them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p4" pid="FDY7_TqTvUOoRu--SVY52Q" hash="BpU66w">As we left our meeting that evening and left that little farmhouse, there was a full moon shining down through the trees. I said to Ruby, “I can imagine the night of April 6, 1830, after that small group had assembled, the Church had been organized, and six men agreeable to its organization were present to be in harmony with the laws of the state of New York; I can imagine what was said, what was prophesied about the future of the Church, and the testimonies that would have been borne.” Then I said, “I would imagine that on the night of April the 6th, 1830, there was a full moon shining, showing that our Savior was smiling upon that occasion and upon that setting.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p5" pid="K-xN-0ufv0ubE6UBDk9XZQ" hash="ePiCOw">Later I expressed that idea to a group where Brother Chamberlain, who then was the director of the Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake, heard me say it. He was thoughtful enough to get in touch with the naval observatory to find out what might have happened on April the 6th, 1830. They didn’t have records back that far, so he was thoughtful enough to contact the Royal Observatory at Greenwich in England for records that might have been available over there. He later sent me some documents indicating what was happening in the horizon that week of April the 6th, 1830, indicating that there was a full or beautifully beaming moon those days before and after April the 6th. The glories of the Lord had been poured out upon the occasion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p6" pid="HCIN-1QRZky8vw6bXQxS8w" hash="sdAr3Q">I am honored here this morning, as we listen to President Hinckley recall those tremendous events, to have had the opportunity during my life to have been taught, to have experienced events around the world and in the temple, and to have attended the meetings of the Church where I have felt the Spirit of the Lord directing this work, which I testify to you to be true. And as the years march on, I’m honored to have the opportunity just to add my testimony to that of our great prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p7" pid="8n3eclI_5EiCkd_KBvPGpw" hash="uO4wUw">I received a letter a few days ago from a young man, 19 years old, by the name of Kevin Campbell from Juniper, Idaho, and I’m not going to try to tell you where that is, but you could imagine. And Brother Kevin wrote to me and said: “It has come to my knowledge that you are becoming quite old in your years, and I wanted to write you before you passed on to the other side. How is life in your old age? I have often wondered about it, so I pose the question to you, ‘How is life?’ so that I’ll know what to expect when I get old like you are.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p8" pid="SgBEcCBd702SbCJcdMfkvw" hash="wlxySw">I would say to Kevin Campbell, bless his heart, life is wonderful. And the only way I can describe it is that I have been blessed all of my life, and I have been blessed with challenges and opportunities and questions and problems that are part of life. But life is wonderful if we live the simple principles that we have been taught and if we live the way that we know we should live. One of those wonderful blessings we have in our old age is the blessing of having more time with our children and their children and their children, to have that opportunity to assemble and to be with them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p9" pid="YojM8ts3vUun4U5QL6s8ig" hash="7yX8WQ">Just the other night we had the opportunity to attend a baptismal service in the ward meetinghouse where Rachel, a great-granddaughter, was baptized. A few nights before that, Richard, a great-grandson, had been baptized. I had the opportunity to look at them and talk to them and squeeze them and see that sparkle in their eye and of the light of the gospel that seemed to fill their heart and soul. They were so excited about the idea of being baptized to become official members of the Church. Their families had taught them true gospel principles. I remember when I said, “Richard,” as we shook hands, “give me a real missionary handshake.” And with that little eight-year-old hand he almost squeezed my fingers off. As he did it, I said, “Richard, you’ll be a great missionary, just as little Rachel will be a great member of the Church in her right.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p10" pid="_mzaNqeLJkSGYemJzxb6Iw" hash="zwZ43w">On that same occasion we had an opportunity to stand in the circle and to have young Peter Jr. receive the Aaronic Priesthood and to hear his father give him the blessings of the priesthood. And those of us who were older had the chance to stand in the circle and to sense the meaning of the occasion and to feel of it and to know that all present were part of our family. I would want our family to know, as it continues to grow and expand, about their fathers. I use that term in the plural as Helaman used it—the great Book of Mormon prophet Helaman—as he taught his sons about their fathers, including Nephi and Lehi, and of their following the word of God and keeping the commandments and how they left Jerusalem and went out into the wilderness, as revealed in the Book of Mormon. Helaman taught his children that their fathers had done many works and that those works were good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p11" pid="kdLOaGsSNUi8Sl4fiowUyw" hash="DXTRzA">So I would hope that our own children, as the generations go on, would know of their heritage, to know who they are and to know that they had fathers who believed and to know that they had fathers who were challenged, that they had fathers who had investigated and who had been out in the world declaring the truth—not in just quoting scriptures—but feeling it in their hearts and souls that what we do is true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p12" pid="DAOx88GFz0ynjeR93oXxRA" hash="YB1iKg">We’ve had an opportunity to reacquire our old house up in Oakley, Idaho, and to restore it so that our children would know of their ancestry and to know that their fathers and their works were good also. I’m able to hold on to a gold watch that my father was given by the Oakley First Ward when he was the bishop, given to him in 1905, the year before I was born. We have a part, a little of the heritage, a reminder that our parents’ works were good and that they helped in the rolling forth of this wonderful work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p13" pid="JLg3b-yBNE2qgH7GY3OtQA" hash="i5z3Fw">In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord declared that this is “my preface unto the book of my commandments” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:6</a>). The Brethren who met there at Hyrum, Ohio, 18 months after the Church was organized, were to compile those revelations and to print them and have available to the people the commandments that the Prophet Joseph had received. As part of that first section, the Lord explained how He had given Joseph Smith the power, inspiration, and direction from heaven to translate the Book of Mormon and to bring the Church “forth out of obscurity and out of darkness” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.29-30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:29–30</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p14" pid="Fc0EFqEfSUm5WKdRMRViSg" hash="50DD9A">Just reflect in your minds today what is happening with President Hinckley as he travels the world and as he goes out meeting with people. When we talk about bringing the Church out of obscurity and out of darkness, just think what he is doing out in the world with the press, the media, with people of all types. Think of how they have an opportunity to see God’s prophet and to hear him testify and to explain what has taken place. Many influential newspapers and magazines and other publications have had many favorable stories about the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p15" pid="23XOEdZjZkmUBYXw5ZWyeA" hash="5bfx-w">Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the world today would have some real understanding of just the simple Ten Commandments, which the Lord cut with His own finger into tablets? Moses came down from Mount Sinai to show the children of Israel, who were riotous, so that they wouldn’t say they didn’t understand what was said. When Moses brought down the tablets, the people would be able to read the Lord’s own statements: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.3" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:3</a>) and “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.4" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:4</a>)—something else to worship—but they should love the Lord, love God. The Lord said that we should not take the name of God in vain (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.7" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:7</a>), that we should honor the Sabbath day and keep it holy (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.8" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:8</a>), that “thou shalt not kill” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.13" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:13</a>), and that “thou shalt not commit adultery” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.13" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:13</a>). Imagine what that would do in the world today and in the United States and with the political spin doctors. And “thou shalt not steal” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.15" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:15</a>) or “bear false witness” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.16" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:16</a>) or covet your neighbor’s oxen and farms, his wife, or anything that he has (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.17" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p16" pid="vBxFV9drdEyrQ0FvsKDEhA" hash="fvRqAg">The gospel of our Lord and Savior has been restored to the earth. God lives. He is our Father. I know. Jesus is the Christ. I have heard His voice because I have felt of that Spirit as He explains to us, “My voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.66" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:66</a>). I know that is true. Joseph Smith was the restorer and the one who was found and trained and was obedient and valiant in every way as the instrument of the Restoration. And today we have a living prophet upon the world who represents us in such a glorious way throughout the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/live-the-commandments.p17" pid="6b5xBBQ86Em7Y0jy9tCHIQ" hash="t3eQFQ">Brothers and sisters, live the commandments. Do what is right. Take advantage of this great opportunity in your life to live it well, to be good, to have good works, and to influence other people for good. The gospel is true. I hope that every day of my life I might be able to do some good and to encourage somebody to live a better life and to understand what has been restored to the earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I watched the raising of your hands when President Monson was presenting the sustaining of the General Authorities of the Church, but particularly our prophet, and as I watched those hands and the enthusiasm with which you raised them, I thought, “Here we are with all the blessings we have and the comfort that we have,” and I thought of some other such events that took place in the history of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/sustaining-the-prophets.p6" pid="ehQyASIO_UCSelfJgK5kVw" hash="lI1y1A">In my mind’s eye, I thought of the gatherings of our own family, which is scattered across America—in Georgia; Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Pennsylvania; Texas; California; and here in Salt Lake City. Of those little families in whatever the setting might be, there in their home or in the chapel, I thought I could see some of those little ones being taught to raise their hands and to be in harmony, perhaps their parents teaching them what we were doing. When we raised our hands, we not only just did it in motion because it looks like everybody’s doing it, but because we accept and we’re bearing witness about the knowledge we have and the testimony we have that President Hinckley is our prophet and our leader. We not only raise our hands in saying we sustain but that we follow his direction, that we listen, that we counsel, that we pray about it, that we’re mindful of what comes from the lips of the prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/sustaining-the-prophets.p7" pid="N5AEpzy3fUa7WPGxrruv3Q" hash="x3JluQ">The Prophet Joseph Smith had received some instruction regarding the organization of the Church, which we have by way of revelation as set forth in section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Imagine—on April the 6th, 1830, in Fayette, New York, in the Peter Whitmer farmhouse—a meeting in that little log cabin, maybe 20 by 30 feet, where the Church was organized. Just imagine in that little setting, where he blessed Oliver and Oliver blessed him, as they followed the direction that they had received and the Church organization was presented to that little assembly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/sustaining-the-prophets.p8" pid="ZFikHQKeOEuKwJeCvRIQSw" hash="686QqA">Joseph and Oliver and Hyrum and Samuel Smith and the two Whitmers had been baptized and acted in order to be “agreeable to the laws” of New York (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:1</a>). But just imagine as you run through your mind the spiritual setting in that assembly and the feeling that they must have had as the proposition was presented to them to sustain—what we have done here today—to sustain the Prophet and Oliver as the first elders, to set the Church in motion. Some of the diaries and the accounts of that occasion indicate they had the feeling of heavenly beings in that meeting.</p>

Some were baptized on that occasion for the first time, including the Prophet’s father and mother—just imagine! The sacrament was served for the first time in this dispensation in an official meeting of the Church, now organized.

The members of the Twelve were hurrying from various parts of the world, returning to Nauvoo. Think of that setting and the meeting when Sidney Rigdon presented the proposition that he would logically be the one to be called because he was the First Counselor, even though he was in some disfavor with the Prophet. And imagine Brigham Young being there and speaking for the Twelve, explaining to that body of Saints how the faithful brethren had been taught by the Prophet regarding the Twelve and the authority that rested with the Twelve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/sustaining-the-prophets.p11" pid="DgH-V64awk2NNriFER6Zmg" hash="M8ZtRw">After they had presented both sides of the case and the voting took place, some of them stated that they saw and felt a change in Brigham Young as he spoke, that they thought they heard the voice of the Prophet, that they thought they could even see some facial features of the Prophet upon Brigham Young. I’m saying this to you because as the years go on and as we learn more and as we’re more sensitive to the spiritual direction that is in this work, we sense and feel the hand of the Lord in it. But think of the sustaining in that setting in 1844, to have the Church rest in the hands of the Twelve.</p>

Brigham Young had been here in the Salt Lake Valley with that first company of the Saints, but in December he had gone back to the Missouri to meet with the Saints there. And in a setting in Kanesville, there were nine of the Twelve assembled: two were in the valley here, one had gone to Texas, and nine were there. In that setting, in the Orson Hyde home, the First Presidency was reorganized on December the 5th, 1847, but they needed to have it ratified by the Saints. And so that meeting was postponed for three weeks so they could build a little log tabernacle in Kanesville. And in three weeks, with the workmen there and the members of the Church who had come in by wagons getting ready to cross the Missouri and head for the valley, they built a little tabernacle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/sustaining-the-prophets.p13" pid="ndj-OpCk90GFBBVIl_eniw" hash="kGDmzw">In that meeting was presented a proposition that the Presidency of the Church would be reorganized, but they needed a sustaining like we’ve done here today, like that opportunity that is ours to raise our hands and sustain the prophet. So the First Presidency was reorganized; Brigham Young had selected Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards to be his counselors. Thus, it takes the sustaining of the people to give the leaders of the Church the authority that the Lord has designated by revelation that is necessary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/sustaining-the-prophets.p14" pid="E4FANtkAbEWEw12xBKw8Xg" hash="lzHSbg">And so, as we see the work move forward and move on, I would only declare to you as I stand before you today that in those 90 and more years that I’ve had, as I’ve witnessed and felt and seen and been part of the spiritual experiences that have been mine, this is the work of the Lord. It’s just as has been revealed. I’ve sensed it and I feel it, and I so declare to you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/sustaining-the-prophets.p15" pid="YZ6gZOWgW0KVZhY0JDXaow" hash="geklbw">I remind you that the Savior taught, as recorded in Matthew, that whosoever “findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/10.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 10:39</a>). Now, some scholars and others have thought: “Well, that’s a paradox. It’s probably a mistranslation. It really doesn’t make very good sense.” It’s very clear in my mind, and I hope it is in yours, that as we live in the world of materialism, in Babylon that we live in today, and see the happenings of the world, whether you read the financial pages or the political pages or whatever, you can sense and feel that where we find our strength and where we find the answer to our challenges and our problems would be as we listen to the voice of the prophet—God’s prophet here upon the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/sustaining-the-prophets.p16" pid="sa0HyFjIek2g3vpZHzC09g" hash="uNQ9WA">In that statement of the Savior’s, we see that as we live in the materialistic world, we’re concerned with only the materialistic side of life. We think of all we can accumulate for ourselves. We’re not thinking of others or not living to help other people live on a higher plane. The Lord is saying that when you find the life that He exemplifies, then you lose your self-centered life: “But he that loseth his life for my sake. …”</p>

In all that, we find the life that the Savior talks about, the eternal blessings, the heavenly blessings, the temple blessings, all of those blessings of a loving family that we can have.</p>

I look at Ruby sitting over here, bless her heart; this year we will celebrate our 69th wedding anniversary. And so on this day, my heart is filled with gratitude for the blessings that I have received and for the influence that the Church has had upon me and my life, with Ruby by my side, and for the sons that we have raised, Bruce and Robert, and our daughter, Karen, and their families. I can also see in my mind’s eye at this time, not only here in Utah but in California and in Texas and in North Carolina and in Boston, great-grandchildren in front of the television. And they’re probably saying, “That old guy up there is Grandpa. He’s kind of looking old, isn’t he? But he’s our grandpa.” And to all of them I express my love and gratitude.</p>

But in the center of that crest we had emblazed the London Temple. And so on this tie pin was the temple with that crest around it.

It was evidently very early in the morning, and He called out and asked them if they were having any success. They said no, and He told them to cast the nets on the other side.

He asked if I could arrange to come down sometime, and he’d arrange for a fireside. He wanted me to talk to the “snowbirds.” He pointed out that hundreds of people, “snowbirds,” fly into Arizona in the wintertime, coming from various parts of the United States to settle down there during the winter months. And he said, “They’re retired now, wonderful people, well qualified. They come, and are now in the wards.” If you’re a snowbird, you know, you can spend part of the time in Arizona and part of the time somewhere else, and so you’re sort of free to do what you’d like to do.</p>

They were astonished. I read some of their comments later on, of what had happened to them in Mongolia, all of the lives that they touched and the service that they rendered.

After being home long enough to kiss the grandchildren hello and good-bye, they were then called to serve in Hawaii, where he was director of the visitors’ center.

Hinckley announced this building would be built in the year 2000, he then turned to me and said, “David, I expect you to be there.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/faith-devotion-and-gratitude.p2" pid="E0O5f44_xkijOtatNxWu9g" hash="R_HYTQ">President, I’m here. And I hope that if he says that we need another year or so or whatever and that he expects me to be there, I hope that he says so, because I will follow his instructions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/faith-devotion-and-gratitude.p3" pid="JUBHQHH5hUOSRBdnjxV5Tw" hash="ZLIj1Q">It’s a joy to be here with you and to witness this great historic meeting facility. I enjoyed President Hinckley’s comments regarding the walnut from which this pulpit is made. The Tabernacle pulpit had both a red light and an amber light to assist the speaker with his time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/faith-devotion-and-gratitude.p4" pid="Vk7l__3YHEu2Kc3oLd6d-w" hash="b9Iuvw">As we get older, our eyesight usually isn’t as sharp as it used to be. The amber light would come on, and if you didn’t pay attention to that, the red light would start to blink. Brother LeGrand Richards, when the light was first installed, said, “Someone’s put a silly light up here.” He said, “I’ll just put my hand over it.” There isn’t a light here today, so I don’t know when I will end.</p>

As I look at this vast audience and reflect upon our beginnings—our humble, humble beginnings—just imagine the Peter Whitmer log cabin in Fayette, New York. The dimensions as I recall were about 20 feet by 30 feet. There were two little bedrooms upstairs. The Peter Whitmer family lived there. There were no plumbing facilities in the house. There was a well outside and only a fireplace for cooking and heating, but in that humble building 170 years ago the Church was organized. Just imagine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/faith-devotion-and-gratitude.p6" pid="rke4kROFjEuEK4Z4wnFMXA" hash="DG37Wg">The Prophet Joseph had received a revelation with instructions regarding the organization of the Church. And in that humble little cabin, not only was the Church organized but the translation of the Book of Mormon was completed within one of those upstairs bedrooms made available to the Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cowdery. And in that little farmhouse the first elders of this Church were ordained, when the Prophet Joseph ordained Oliver Cowdery and then Oliver ordained the Prophet Joseph Smith. And in that little farmhouse the first sacrament meeting was held after the Church was organized. Just imagine. The sisters brought bread and some grape juice for that first sacrament. Those were the humble beginnings of what we witness here today.</p>

In 1820 at the Sacred Grove, in answer to the Prophet Joseph’s humble prayer, God the Father and His Son appeared to that 14-year-old young man, ushering in this work, the restoration of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/faith-devotion-and-gratitude.p8" pid="ta7SJOsek0CUAi_KcqaV7w" hash="35fOSQ">Think of 1830—the meeting in that little log cabin, which for a while was the headquarters of the Church. Imagine such a historical but heavenly meeting in that 20-by-30-foot frontier cabin. Part of the account tells of Peter Whitmer’s wife, Mary. Mary Whitmer got up earlier that Sunday morning and walked out into the living room, where people were sleeping on the floor covered with homemade quilts. They had come by wagon or buggy or horse—friends and people who had heard about what would be happening on April 6th. There were probably 50 people assembled for the meeting.</p>

We just want to say, “Hallelujah! Thank the Lord for all that’s taken place.” Words come into my mind, as I stand here, of faith, devotion, and gratitude—the faith of the people and the faith that we demonstrate by being here today; the devotion of those early members and the devotion that <span class="emphasis">we</span> have; and our hearts are full of gratitude for what has happened and what lies ahead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/faith-devotion-and-gratitude.p10" pid="AKKwZQG_QUGouZ9EzEqAPg" hash="OGJ_xw">I’m so grateful for my being able to be here, for my ancestry, for my wife, Ruby, for our children and all of our grandchildren. Our family has started a tradition that on this day, wherever we might be living, we stand in front of the television set if we are at home or attend in our meetinghouse or Conference Center and we raise our right hand to sustain the officers of the Church, especially our living prophet. And so in my mind’s eye, I have imagined today our own posterity in Brussels, Belgium; in London; Virginia; North Carolina; Texas; and California—raising their hands to the square on this day, learning how to do it, learning that it’s important in the Church that they sustain the leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/faith-devotion-and-gratitude.p11" pid="IiuBdoWmXkyM4tLqxqpAjQ" hash="aGGSAA">My heart is full of gratitude on this day for the revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith and for all that he did to set in motion the Restoration, the revelations necessary for the on-rolling of this work, line upon line and precept upon precept. Ponder the ruggedness of our beginning—the humble, humble beginning—and then look at us today.</p>

Think about what has happened under the inspired leadership of President Hinckley, the Joseph Smith Building we have today, in the preserving of that wonderful old building that was the Hotel Utah and is now the fine edifice that it is; we saw that come from the inspiration given to President Hinckley. And think of this building, as he explained to us, the direction that had come to him. And so to all of us as we assemble here today, I hope that we have grateful hearts for the knowledge that we have and the testimonies we have and for the feelings we have, that this is only the beginning. This is only a chapter in the on-rolling of this work.</p>

I hope that we feel grateful for the eternal blessings we can receive as we watch and are part of the unfolding of the temple expansion throughout the world and of that blessing coming to the people.</p>

I stood under a tree on the campus of the university there and dedicated Ghana for the preaching of the gospel. Brother Banyan Dadson, who was vice president of the university and a member of the Church, stood there on that day and explained to the people how the natives in Ghana had settled that part of West Africa, and what a blessing it had been for those tribes of people. I know that that problem will be resolved; that will only be a chapter in the on-rolling of this work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/faith-devotion-and-gratitude.p15" pid="8qM0dJMNH0OXFSNurI0tFg" hash="aDnLdA">President Hinckley, in a comment a short time ago, talked about the links of his family, his family chain, and hoping that he would be a strong link in that chain and that <span class="emphasis">his</span> link would remain strong. He told the account of attempting to pull the stump of a tree out of the ground on their property and how the chain had broken. He went to the store to try to get another link to fix the chain so they could pull the tree stump out, which they were finally able to do. He said he thought of his own responsibility to his posterity, to remain a strong link in that chain (see “Keep the Chain Unbroken,” <span class="emphasis">Brigham Young Magazine,</span> spring 2000, 6).</p>

Be sure that those links are strong in your chain and that you pass the testimony that you have, the devotion that you have to future generations. This vast audience here today is only a chapter in what will take place in the spreading of this work throughout the world.</p>

He called out asking if they had caught any fish, and they hadn’t. He asked them to cast their nets on the other side. You remember the story so well.</p>

Hinckley announced that I would be the concluding speaker, I’m sure he was wondering if I could make it to the pulpit all right. He knows that I’ve just had my 94th birthday. So I’m in my 95th year, and he would be wondering.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p2" pid="6-F8IyLrPUOhH4Gd9CqJpA" hash="twKkXw">He also knows that my eyesight isn’t very good, but as my eyesight dims somewhat, I think my vision improves—my vision of the long road, my vision of what lies ahead. And so with all of you here this morning, I am sure you would join with me in saying what a marvelous time to be alive and what a marvelous time to be a member of this Church and how wonderful it is to have the freedoms that we have, the freedom of assembly and of religious gathering.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p3" pid="f5HT3q06RkKW_OTvmJqZSQ" hash="rj_IXg">When Ruby and I knelt at the Salt Lake Temple at the altar on September the fourth, 1930, holding hands and looking at one another, little did we ever realize what would lie ahead for us. We were two young people. I had come out of the country in southern Idaho, and Ruby had come out of Sanpete County, Utah. Our fathers were dead, but we had two wonderful widowed mothers, and they were with us in the temple. As we knelt and made covenants and promises, I knew that that was for real.</p>

And so to all of you I would say, and Ruby would join with me if she could be standing here, that life can be wonderful and so meaningful, but we have to live it in a simple way. We must live the principles of the gospel. For it is the gospel in our lives that makes the difference as we wend our way through life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p5" pid="LQAWiUx-1EKtT6fZFznucw" hash="EojLFA">I have moved our family all over the country. Our children have grown up being in school when they were the only members of the Church in their class. We’ve done that many times, but that added to their own development and their own understanding and helped in the developing of their own testimonies to see the world in action but also to see the blessings of the gospel in our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p6" pid="VadnDrvep0-YVtCQIVzaiw" hash="OY7JEA">Last Sunday, Ruby and I attended a sacrament meeting of a ward here in central Salt Lake. The meeting was most interesting because in that ward there is some affluence as well as people who are living in halfway houses. Just before the testimony meeting, a young lady walked up to the bishop on the stand holding a little baby in her arms, wanting the baby to receive a blessing. The bishop stepped down and took the little baby, and the baby was blessed.</p>

He helped fix a little stool there for her to stand on, his five-year-old sister, and he helped her as she bore her testimony. And as she would falter just a little, he would lean over and whisper in her ear, this little loving seven-year-old brother.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p8" pid="voEuccibiEuDm5fT43PVcg" hash="LJn_DA">After she finished, he stood on the stool, and she stood watching him, and he bore his testimony. She had that sweet expression on her face as she watched him. He was her older brother, but you could see that family love and relationship with those two little children. He stepped down from the stool, took her by the hand, and they walked back down to take their seat.</p>

In the meantime, while the testimony meeting was going on, I asked the bishop, whispering into his ear, “Where is her husband?”</p>

As we were standing at the pulpit, I looked down at this little precious baby, only a few days old, and this mother, the mother of that little daughter who had brought her to receive a blessing at the hands of the priesthood. As I looked at the mother and looked at that precious little child, I wondered of what she might become or what she could be. I spoke to the audience and to this young mother about the proclamation that was issued five years ago by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve, a proclamation on the family, and of our responsibility to our children, and the children’s responsibility to their parents, and the parents’ responsibility to each other. That marvelous document brings together the scriptural direction that we have received that has guided the lives of God’s children from the time of Adam and Eve and will continue to guide us until the final winding-up scene.</p>

Ruby and I were up in Idaho for a short visit, and we met some people from Mountain Home, Idaho, the Goodrich family. Sister Goodrich had come to see us and had brought her daughter Chelsea with her. In part of the conversation that we were having, Sister Goodrich said Chelsea had memorized the proclamation on the family.</p>

As I associate with other people and when I start dating, I can think of those phrases and those sentences in the proclamation on the family. It will give me a yardstick which will help guide me.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p23" pid="wrj80iNeLUefrBGA_xhgoA" hash="4dHToQ">We’ve heard a lot of instruction here this morning in the conference regarding family history and families, the reason for linkage, and the responsibility that we have to do temple work for tens of thousands of people who could be a part of our own families waiting on the other side to receive the ordinances that must be done on this side of the veil so that they can carry on with what needs to be done on the other side. This we all understand so well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p24" pid="HAVqhecIGUS_zaP-l2as2A" hash="OCnwAA">So I would say to all of you here this morning, I hope you could develop a strong feeling in your own families—and with you personally—about not wanting to become a weak link in the chain of your family and of your ancestors. I encourage you also to be a strong link for your posterity. Do not be the weak link. Wouldn’t that be a terrible thing to do? To think of that long chain and of all that work that needs to be done in the saving of souls and of the precious work that needs to be done, wouldn’t it be sad if you were the one who was the weak link that caused your descendants not to be able to be part of that strong linkage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p25" pid="P175WADraku-AtBhOOoyhA" hash="JsJ0cA">When the Saints were preparing to leave Nauvoo, and with the Nauvoo Temple unfinished, it was possible for them to endow only a few people. President Brigham Young, as President of the Quorum of the Twelve, was the senior Apostle at that time. He wrote in his journal about the anxiety that the people felt when they were trying to get their wagons equipped to start the trek west into that new area they knew nothing of. They were following their leaders, getting ready the few possessions they could take with them on the wagons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p26" pid="oSGI-9lZEEiTSbVHpoP9pg" hash="VQULJQ">Amidst all these preparations, there was an opportunity for some of them to be endowed, and the people were anxious to be endowed. Brigham Young stopped doing all of the regular, routine work he was doing. He put that to one side so that he could stay in the temple and conduct the endowment work that was so necessary. In commenting about the experience, he said he was anxious to do what the Saints were anxious to have done. That word, <span class="emphasis">anxiety,</span> is interesting as it appears in his account. He writes of the anxiety that they had, hoping that the important endowment work could be accomplished before the people left on the trek west.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p27" pid="Fa5jw3BJsEmnOCG9FKwLDQ" hash="xgceLg">I leave you my love and my witness and the knowledge that I have that this work is true. I know that God lives. I know that He loves us. He loves us just as we love our children and our posterity. We now have 65 great-grandchildren, and of course we’ll have more on their way. We love them all, and we hope that the chains and the links in our family will be strong, and that our children will be blessed. We’re proud of all of them and pray that they will grow up with the strong knowledge and the feeling that I have regarding God, that He lives, that He’s our Father, and that all of this work is under His direction and that of His Son, who is our Savior, Jesus the Christ. This is the Church of Jesus Christ restored to the earth in these latter days. I know it is true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p28" pid="TBc3hNwjCk-SGh0ICt09Ig" hash="QkO3DQ">I know that we have a living prophet upon the earth today, and you can see the marvelous things that are happening in the Church now with 100 operating temples. Some of you here will live to see the day when there are 200 operating temples and then 300 operating temples, and whatever the number might eventually become. Well, we’re living at this time and this day and age when marvelous things are happening. When we talk about a living prophet who receives revelations from on high in directing this work, I testify to you that those of us who work and associate with him can testify to you that he is God’s prophet here upon the earth, leading us in doing what is right and what is proper.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/be-a-strong-link.p29" pid="kxyn4EDZTUykTu3vXdPEOQ" hash="dmWoxA">May your links be strong.

I want to say a few words about gratitude and thanksgiving to people who have influenced my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p2" pid="eDjMBMdeAEeo5QZHk1yIBQ" hash="WB72ng">Imagine in your mind May the first, 1890. A young man and a young lady in a little country town about 250 miles from the Logan temple decided to be married. Highways—none. Fancy roads—none. Trails through the sagebrush and wagon trails—yes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p3" pid="i3TkNUbuGES2cyT0a1qL3A" hash="3odLaA">It probably would have taken six or seven days at least to make the journey. In May it rains in southern Idaho and in Utah. Imagine riding in a buggy with all of your clothes—taking something along, I guess for the horses, taking some food in little sacks of some kind. Fancy clothes, warm clothes—they had none. Sleeping bags—none. Coleman lanterns or cooking stoves—none. They would have had matches and had to find dry sagebrush to make a fire to cook their food.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p4" pid="cJ7uISS5ukmysKFOz6rguA" hash="jdx2dQ">Just imagine, just run it through your mind for a moment and think of the gratitude that I have and the blessings they brought into my life by traveling to a place to be married a long ways away. Inconvenience? That wouldn’t be a problem; they would do it. And think of what’s happened in the last few years with President Hinckley—the inspiration and direction he has had in the building of temples all over the world. And think of what people went through a few years ago.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p5" pid="mlTTnB8HpUKfZpjnOO4dGA" hash="sr332Q">Those blessings have come into my life from my parents and their parents and others who have affected my life—teachers and good people that I have been associated with.</p>

He played the violin a little, and we hadn’t had anyone there for a long time that had played the violin. My mother was impressed and picked up a little violin, I guess at some little rummage sale somewhere, and decided that I should learn to play the violin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p7" pid="2631gkUxW02sHWsa7vt3wg" hash="0ovaLA">Even though I had never seen anyone play the violin in public, he came to our house and started giving me some little simple lessons on playing the violin. I was coming along fairly well by the time we graduated from the eighth grade in grammar school, and for the graduation exercises held in the high school I was asked to play a violin solo.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p8" pid="sY0qhENsD0W_WHpBAF-isQ" hash="tu-FXg">I’d carefully practiced the little number “Traumerei,” as I remember the name. My sister who was four years older than I and was then one of the popular girls in high school was my pianist. At the graduation exercises, Connie McMurray was the valedictorian. Girls are always smarter in school than boys. As she was giving the valedictory address, there was a little pedestal with a pitcher of water and a glass on it for the school board. The school board was on the stand, plus a little handful of us who were graduating from the eighth grade.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p9" pid="BkWz_rvgJUyQh5f0hUjk8Q" hash="poibKg">As Connie McMurray was giving her famous valedictory address, near the end of it we noticed the little doily under the pitcher of water on the pedestal was moving over a little bit towards the edge, and over it fell with the pitcher and glass of water! Connie McMurray fell in a dead faint.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p10" pid="f-WMOcK9l0GcC0WAJ_A7aw" hash="Bl4efQ">In the scurrying around of cleaning the water off the stage and rearranging the chairs, they announced that we would now have the violin solo from David Haight. I walked over to the little old piano, and my sister came up from the audience. I took that little simple violin out of that wooden case as my sister sat down at the piano and sounded an A. I said, “Go ahead and play.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p11" pid="CFVodPkRZkqD4autXMiGzg" hash="UGrb1Q">She said, “David, you’d better tune it.”</p>

You know, homes in those days—if you had a piano and books, that’s all you needed for the family. I had carefully tuned the strings by twisting those ebony pegs of that violin, but I didn’t know that all pianos weren’t the same. So as my sister said, “You’d better tune it,” I said, “No, no, it’s all tuned. I tuned it at home.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p13" pid="6xuUyxsyXUGwt-NyK1feYA" hash="zIARvg">So she went ahead and played the introduction, and then I came down on the first note. We were off about two notes.</p>

You wouldn’t hold up Carnegie Hall while you tuned your violin! That would be shop work. You would do that in the back room so that when you would start to play, why, you’d be all ready to play.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p15" pid="uvBYMZbGpk-J2W-ouFXI1w" hash="yCtgyg">She slowed down. I said, “Keep playing.” We finished it, and she didn’t speak to me for days following that show.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p18" pid="lT0NAPuWwUeA4vV7q3WEnw" hash="HoIwlg">You remember the account of John the Baptist speaking to John the Beloved and to Andrew on the occasion when the Savior met them. And John the Baptist commented, “Behold the Lamb of God!” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.36" class="scriptureRef">John 1:36</a>). And as the Savior met those young men—John the Baptist, John the Beloved, and Andrew—He said, “What seek ye?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p19" pid="P1UoQMijSUOqCM2kTJ9TUg" hash="tiMjyg">And in that conversation that’s reported, one of them said, “Where dwellest thou?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.38" class="scriptureRef">John 1:38</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p22" pid="dMJOBawjLE238_5uXtNngQ" hash="wJa1Pg">John and Andrew were with the Savior for several hours. Just imagine being in His presence or being able to sit and look into His eyes or to hear Him explain who He was and why He had come to earth and to hear that inflection in His voice in describing what He would have told those young men. They would have shaken His hand. They would have felt of that precious, wonderful personality as they listened to Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p23" pid="jbdUJyoU9E2O23bHpT7DCg" hash="b7Lang">And following that encounter, the account says that Andrew went to find his brother Simon because he had to share it with someone. As we meet in a great conference like this and talk about the gospel and talk about our responsibility and the opportunity we have, just imagine if that had happened to any of us, to have been in that divine precious personality’s presence and to have listened to Him and to have shaken His hand and to have looked into His eyes and to have heard what He would say.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p24" pid="4l1V3dAOgEKRu4w9L15PVQ" hash="_6DTuw">When Andrew found his brother Simon, he said to him, “We have found the [Messiah]” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.41" class="scriptureRef">John 1:41</a>). He probably said: “We’ve been in His presence. We’ve felt of His personality. We know that what He is telling us is true.” Yes, Andrew had to share it with someone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p25" pid="eaEgFZCCiU6BAkUDyj2rFQ" hash="Fiydng">That is what we do in sharing what we know and what we understand. And I’m grateful for that knowledge I have that God lives, that He is our Father, and for the understanding that I have of our Heavenly Father and of His Son, Jesus the Christ, our Savior and the Redeemer of all of mankind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p26" pid="Rjrr15RvjUGp1D7DmGUS7A" hash="CwmVQg">I had a letter only a few days ago from a man in Edinburgh, Scotland. His name is George Stewart. He’ll be surprised at my mentioning this, but he wanted to thank me because when he was 15 years old (some 40 years ago), I was presiding over the mission in Scotland. He wanted to thank me for the missionaries’ coming to their home in Thornliebank, one of the areas of Glasgow. He had joined the Church along with his mother.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p27" pid="18Bf6mudykavYuXnO7W1Nw" hash="dshhKw">He said that as he developed a testimony of the Book of Mormon, as he started reading it and as he kept reading it, he couldn’t put it down because he knew it was true. He kept reading and reading and developing a testimony of the gospel as a young man. He told how he used to come over to the mission home and how we were kind to him and we would spend time with the young people because they were getting into Mutual, which we were starting in the branches.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p28" pid="HamUfSM7TkmRJZ_LHY0JPA" hash="GEoMYA">Then he told of the blessings that had come into his life as a young man, that he had met his sweetheart in that little branch—his wife—and that they were married and that they had four children: a son who had finished a mission in the Washington D.C. Mission; a son who served in the England Leeds Mission; a daughter who was married in the temple; and one who is waiting for the return of a missionary. He voiced gratitude for all of the blessings that had come into his life and the lives of his sons who have been on missions and his daughters.</p>

There was also a little piano keyboard in another room, and she would have a class where the organ was and another one where this little keyboard was. She would teach these children to play the organ after school. They said they started a temple preparation class in the reactivation process, and before they left they were able to put 28 people on the bus to go from Bulawayo all the way to Johannesburg to the temple, 650 miles away—two days and one night. They said, “We’ve talked about how we are in our late 70s now—these two old people wandering around in Africa having the greatest period of our lives, the greatest excitement we could have.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/gratitude-and-service.p35" pid="QFuoUNJK9kOT_C3cd2VBiA" hash="HURxrQ">Think of Dr. Alan Barker, who had retired from the Salt Lake Clinic, a wonderful cardiologist here in Salt Lake, who, together with his wife, accepted a mission call to the Philippines.

What a wonderful and grand opportunity that is for all of us to be able to sustain our living prophet upon the earth today—but not just to sit there and raise your hand in a haphazard way, but to feel it in your heart and soul that you not only sustain him but you endorse what he has been doing and what he has done for us in representing us to the world. We are thankful for the marvelous and inspired way in which he has communicated and spoken to the world, particularly in these last few days and weeks.</p>

And one day he received in his mail a crumpled little note on some brownish paper which read:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p3" pid="aj2KkXjKYk6pdEtEyiL_Ug" hash="Y67i7Q">“Dear Mr. Toscanini, I am a lonely sheepherder in the mountains of Wyoming. I have two prized possessions: an old violin and a battery radio. And the batteries are getting weak and beginning to run down on my radio, and my violin is so out of tune I can’t play it anymore. Would you please sound an A next Saturday on your program?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p4" pid="KAUdtxxOlEu4Ow0-7rn2eQ" hash="TBY97w">The next week on the program, Arturo Toscanini announced: “To a newfound friend in the mountains of Wyoming, the New York Philharmonic Orchestra is now, all together and in unison, going to sound a perfect A.” And they sounded the perfect A. Then that lonely little man was able to tune the A string and then the E string and the D and the G from that perfect A.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p5" pid="hsF09tGbPkqyg3jFvdhKRg" hash="LItRaw">Isn’t it interesting to reflect in our own lives and in the lives of the many people who may hear me at this time—those whose violin or lives may be a little out of tune—that we are able to come to a general conference of the Church and hear the marvelous messages that are spoken? Those of us who have the opportunity to speak here pray mightily that we would have the energy and the strength and the vitality even as I do, as I enter the twilight of my life, to stand and bear witness of the truthfulness of this work—because I am a witness of it.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p7" pid="phmg-EiLMUuvSsCMZ0vx4w" hash="lz6lTw">Often President Hinckley has said to us in some of our meetings, and I think he has said it publicly, that behind his desk he has a picture of Brigham Young. Sometimes when President Hinckley has had a busy day and a hard day of making many, many difficult decisions, he turns in his chair and looks up at Brigham’s picture behind him and either asks out loud or in his own mind says, “Brother Brigham, what would you have done?” or “What advice would you give to me?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p8" pid="D5t0edm7Yk6RbkosEhjHOw" hash="KPYGkA">Think of what has happened in the last few years. You all know so well all of the inspiration and the direction that has come to President Hinckley in the expansion of the Church—the building of temples and the remodeling of the old Hotel Utah into that marvelous building, now the Joseph Smith Memorial Building which bears his name, and for this unusual structure, the Conference Center, that we’re in today—probably nothing like it in the world. And for us who have for now a number of years worked with and by the side of and listened to and been associated with President Hinckley, what a marvelous experience we’ve had and blessing in our lives as we have seen and felt and been part of the inspired expansion that has been moving forward.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p9" pid="kIXqYviOQ0mkteXhzoS-tQ" hash="aahMlA">As we look at Brigham Young and reflect upon the inspiration and direction that came to that most unusual man, we recall how he was able to fill the tragic void caused by the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith, how he stepped in and was able under inspiration and revelation to guide and direct the closing of Nauvoo and the planning of the trip west. We remember the continued work there at that time on the Nauvoo Temple and the way that was organized to move forward, with the wagon trains crossing the West and into the Salt Lake Valley into what would become the Zion where they could worship and teach and preach and build the meetinghouses and all that would be needed for this civilization and for this culture that we have, to expand and grow here.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p10" pid="0iCG-idhh0OV8PaFPOx4aQ" hash="_HB_mA">Think of the inspiration that came to the prophet Brigham Young for those people not to just build up a big city in Salt Lake, but to move out into these other settlements. He had the genius to have people go out and look for the valleys and the areas away from Salt Lake City where the pioneers who would pour into this valley could go and settle and make their homes and build cities and communities and build their personalities and their characters and develop the talents that would be theirs. So rather than having a large city in Salt Lake, under his leadership some 360 communities were developed out in Wyoming and Nevada and Arizona and southern Idaho as well as in Utah.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p11" pid="GX665AsxW0-epvZO3E0LpQ" hash="FgbB_w">As people moved out and set up in these little communities, they developed their talents and abilities by serving on school boards and on town councils or became leading people in a little town. They became citizens of that area, and they started building schools and expanding those communities. We see what has happened in these areas that Brigham Young envisioned and which he helped set in motion. Just think of how that has developed—of the developing of a settlement, for example, in Las Vegas, Nevada, so that people could go down to San Bernardino, California. The people could come by ship into San Pedro, California, go to San Bernardino to be outfitted and helped with the equipment necessary to come into this valley, and then into the outlying communities, down into Sanpete County or up into Idaho or elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p12" pid="bcREibaQNEaroZnedT9IVA" hash="fXLqtg">I have become a product of that, because when my mother’s family arrived here in Salt Lake City, they were sent out to Tooele to settle. Then later they were sent up into Idaho, where a sawmill and a gristmill were needing to be built. My father’s family had settled in Farmington, Utah, part of this colonization that I’m referring to—the colonization that made people stronger and gave them opportunities. Rather than being lost in a big city, they were asked to move to a smaller community where they could develop their ability and where there would be more schools and a need for more schoolteachers and where people with talent would develop their ability. Out of all of this, my family were asked to leave Farmington and Tooele, to sell their green acres, and go out into southern Idaho, where there was nothing at that time but sagebrush.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p13" pid="OfUTwNEQhEGjRf-9P_RkYA" hash="rQTQeg">In a little settlement of that kind, my mother and father fell in love. By the time they were 20 years old and ready to be married, where would they be married? In the Logan Utah Temple. How would they get there? By buggy. How long would it take? Well, five or six or seven days. Highways and good roads? Of course not. They went by roads made by wagons going over the sagebrush and through the bushes and over the rocks. Where would they be married? Where would they be sealed? Only one place—the temple. They went by buggy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p14" pid="vEOWJ2TZ806yamTJqmhUdA" hash="O9nA3Q">That became part of my heritage. And so people grew up in these little towns. Then the Church decided to open some academies, and they opened some 30 of them out in these areas far away. One of those little academies was opened in our town, and it became an area where many from neighboring areas would move into that little town to get a higher education. Of course, the higher education was only a high school, but it was referred to as an academy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p15" pid="H_HVRw1DKEKNj4IcmwwS5w" hash="1mVL8w">I’m referring to the inspiration that came to the prophet Brigham Young years ago in the settlement, in the development of this intermountain area now surrounding Salt Lake City. And think of who we are today and how this has grown and the blessing that has come into our lives to have President Hinckley as our prophet, seer, and revelator and leader and to envision what is happening and what will be happening ahead of us if we just have the faith to be able to continue to do what has been started. Think of what is on the way and being done.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p16" pid="iViy2p4SfkykCqAnmxhjLw" hash="a0HB4A">President Hinckley often speaks to us about developing more faith with our people. That faith is a result of our living the principles of the gospel, living the way we should and raising our children as we should, and seeing them grow and develop their character and personality in a way that they become an example of what we believe in and what we have a hope to do and accomplish.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p17" pid="u5YInG2maEeLiVTSD-MYXw" hash="xOOixA">You’ll all remember the man who had a son that was a lunatic. And he approached the Savior and asked if the Savior would bless the boy to drive that evil spirit from his son. And the man told the Savior, “I’ve asked your disciples to do this, but they haven’t been able to do it.” The Savior blessed that little boy. The evil spirit immediately departed, and the Savior’s disciples came to him and said, “Why couldn’t we do it? Why weren’t we able to?” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/17.14-21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 17:14–21</a>). The Savior also had said, “O ye of little faith” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.8" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:8</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p18" pid="yJTXAdU2FEeEaFAF5tHycw" hash="Sybppg">If ye had but the faith of a tiny—I’m trying to think of the name of that little tree. [President Hinckley says, “Mustard.”] Mustard! Thank you, President. (I keep the President around to help me.) If you had but the faith of a mustard seed. Perhaps not many of you have seen a mustard seed. A few years ago in Jerusalem we were in a car with a driver, and he said, “Oh, there’s a mustard tree.” And I said, “Let’s see it.” We got out to look at that mustard tree, and it had a little pod on it, and I was able to open the pod, which was like those on a locust tree, and see those tiny little seeds, not much larger than a grain of pepper.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p19" pid="AAnEQTPMSkuW3_cU2ETBxw" hash="VJCj9Q">Just imagine the analogy that the Savior was teaching the people. If you only had as much faith as that little tiny mustard seed—and I held it in my hand, and I could hardly see it—if you had that much faith you would say to the mountain, “Move hence,” and it would move, if you had that much faith (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/17.20" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 17:20</a>). “O ye of little faith,” he told us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p20" pid="_OgZ9MRSg0-TaVOBf08fTw" hash="eo5_Rg">So what we need is the faith of Brigham Young and the faith of Gordon B. Hinckley and the faith of people who are our prophets and leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/faith-of-our-prophets.p21" pid="3uzdnfpLdESi1z4kkirW2w" hash="ygGtSw">God lives. I know He’s real, that He is our Father, and I know that He loves us. I know that. And I know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. I have felt of that influence. I’m a witness to it. I know that the Prophet Joseph Smith and all of the historical accounts we have of what he did as the instrument of the Restoration are true and that the prophets down through the years and including President Hinckley are called of God. The work is true. I leave you my love, my witness, and my testimony that burns in my heart. All the days of my life I hope to be able to tell somebody and help somebody understand that this work is true, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Monson asked those new members of the Seventy and the Young Women general presidency to come up and take their places on the stand, I remembered vividly April 1970, when I was called to be an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve—which was a surprise to me. I’d only known about it for just a few hours. As I was invited to sit in one of the red chairs in the old Tabernacle, the choir started to sing “O Divine Redeemer.” As I listened to that pleading song with that wonderful melody, I silently asked the Savior to accept me as I am and remember not my failures, my shortcomings, and my sins (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/25.7" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 25:7</a>). What a wonderful day that was! That flashed through my mind as President Monson made that invitation today.</p>

He had it ready for me, but I said, “No, I can get by without it. I’ll show you I have the faith that it will happen.” As I get older and as the years roll on, I’m honored to have this opportunity and to have the ability and the desire to stand and witness to you of the blessings of the gospel that have come into my life during these past many years. I don’t know if I’m the oldest one in this great hall today, but I am now in my 97th year. When it was announced this morning that this is the 172nd semiannual conference of the Church, I thought some people in their younger years could look upon 172 as a long, long time. I would remind you of the 100th anniversary of the Church. At that time, Ruby and I were married. It was 1930. This is the 172nd anniversary of the Church, and we have been married 72 years. I’m only mentioning that to you so you mathematicians can remember 172; it comes pretty easily.</p>

And as we have moved around the country in all of the activities we have been involved in, I’m grateful to have been associated with good people. Good people influence your life and help in molding your own personality and character and help you to mingle out in society and live the way that you should live. They help you carry on worthwhile enterprises, and they lift you onto a higher plane. And so I’m grateful to my Heavenly Father for the blessings that I have had. I bear witness of Him, that I know that He is our Father and that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Creator, and the Savior of all of mankind. I am grateful for that majestic role He has played in the Creation and the establishing of the gospel on the earth and for the opportunity that brings to mankind, if they will listen, to hear and to understand and to have the blessings of heaven if they merit them and to live in such a way that the gospel becomes a great part of their life.</p>

He gave an outstanding talk this morning—giving us an overview of the recent years but particularly an overview of the events of Nauvoo and of the rebuilding of that majestic temple. All that has taken place there has been a blessing to the world and to mankind.</p>

Kimball and as he has assumed his role in the First Presidency. How he has grown and matured and been inspired and directed in carrying out the activities that we have been a witness to! Many of us have played some small role in the vision that he had of the growth that has happened in the Church recently, including the building of the temples, where we now have 114 operating. All of these things have been the result of the inspired direction of President Hinckley. Bless his heart for what he has done in helping the Church to expand and our image to grow and improve throughout the world. We’re so grateful for what he has done, for the stature that we have today in the Church, and for his leadership.</p>

Now, those of us who have grown up in the last few years know very little about lepers. Leprosy was a terrible, dreaded disease anciently. These 10 lepers came to the Savior and said, “Master, have mercy upon us; have mercy upon us who have that terrible ailment of leprosy.” And He said to the 10 lepers, “Go visit your priest, and he will take care of you”—which they did. They went to see their priests, and they were cleansed, all 10 of them. A short time later, one of them returned to the Savior and fell on his face and his hands and his knees, thanking the Savior for blessing him and making him well from that terrible disease. And the Savior said to that one man: “Weren’t there 10? What has happened to the other nine? Where are they?” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/17.11-19" class="scriptureRef">Luke 17:11–19</a>.)</p>

How would you like to be part of the “nine society”? Wouldn’t that be something—to be numbered among those who failed to return and acknowledge the Savior for the blessings He had given them? Only one returned.</p>

But we sometimes take them for granted. How grateful we should be for the blessings that the gospel of Jesus Christ brings into our hearts and souls. I would remind all of you that if we’re ever going to show gratitude properly to our Heavenly Father, we should do it with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength—because it was He who gave us life and breath. He gave us the opportunity to live as we are, to have the gospel in our lives, to have the example of good people like President Hinckley leading the Church throughout the world today and the opportunity for the young people to look to him with pride and gratitude for a leader who looks and acts the part and demonstrates what the Spirit of Christ can bring into our heart and soul. As that gratitude is magnified and developed and expanded, it can bless our hearts and our minds and our souls to where we’d like to continue to carry on and do those things that we are asked to do.</p>

I have suggested to them that when they have opportunities to sustain the General Authorities—particularly President Hinckley and his counselors—if they have to stand at the radio or wherever it might be, that with enthusiasm they raise their hands and say to themselves, “I’m part of sustaining the leadership of the Church.” I had in my mind’s eye today as we were raising our hands some little youngsters—children whom we love and adore—raising their hands in various parts of the world. We hope that we will implant in them along with the Spirit of the Lord a desire to learn, to know, to live and be part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We hope they fully enjoy their opportunities to develop their characters and to be able to reach out and help change and lift the hearts of other people.</p>

I testify to you that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and the Prophet Joseph Smith was the prophet of the Restoration. President Hinckley is our inspired leader over this Church throughout the world today.

Probably this would be the largest gathering of the priesthood in the history of the Church. I would imagine that would be true because we continue to grow every year.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p2" pid="sgc2OGn0x0uynnBIMu4kxg" hash="5KlKEQ">My first brush with the priesthood was when I was baptized. I was baptized in an irrigation canal in the little town of Oakley, Idaho. I was with my friends on the bank of that irrigation canal. We had on our bib swimming suits, which consisted of bib overalls with the legs cut out so you wouldn’t sink and holes cut in the pockets. We had never seen a swimming suit made out of knit or of other fabric. My father came out from the First Ward meetinghouse with his counselors. He was carrying a chair, and he put the chair on the side of the irrigation ditch. My father said, “David, come on over here; we’re going to baptize you.”</p>

It was in September and a little cold, and young boys get the shivers, you know, when you have only bib overalls on. My father got down into the canal. As I remember, he didn’t take his shoes off or change anything but was just in his regular clothes. He showed me how to hold my hands, and then he baptized me. After I came up out of the water, we both crawled up on the bank of the canal. I sat in the chair, and they put their hands on my head and confirmed me a member of the Church. After that I dove in the canal and went over on the other side and joined my friends.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p4" pid="E_oV9pX90keJhUT1miFSaA" hash="hFX2Aw">This was my first experience, really, with the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p5" pid="L_0wB_CxOkaIoCHlFyt8EA" hash="ATuKRw">I would remind you that the priesthood is the power and authority of God delegated to man. Let me say that again: The priesthood is the power and authority of God delegated to man. Here in these assemblies tonight, we have those who hold the Aaronic Priesthood, the lesser priesthood, and then the Melchizedek Priesthood, the higher priesthood. Isn’t it interesting to visualize how the Lord and His Heavenly Father, in setting up the plan of salvation, organized it so that men could be worthy enough and could be honored to hold the priesthood and join in the large army of men necessary to bring about the eternal purposes of our Heavenly Father, to bring about the immortality and eternal life of man—mankind everywhere? What a mighty group that would entail!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p6" pid="FPhF4LDBOE2ZLiLsxaj18w" hash="rSfp2g">A few years after I had been baptized, becoming better acquainted with some duties in the Church, I was ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood. My father, who had baptized me, had died in the meantime with a heart attack, so the bishop conferred the Aaronic Priesthood upon me and ordained me to the office of a deacon. I remember that I had a wonderful feeling about that as he conferred the priesthood upon me, that I now had responsibilities and would be accountable for my actions and would have things to learn to do as I would progress through life. I did have a special feeling that I now was a little different, that I wouldn’t be exactly the same as friends who did not hold the priesthood or people that you would meet out in the world. I now had some responsibilities, things we would learn on Sundays in church as we would sit around the old coal stove down in the basement of the meetinghouse.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p7" pid="bmSWIhnzyk6EB1VxLoQdfA" hash="_2vTOg">On Saturdays, we would clean out the church, fill the coal buckets with coal, and see that the building was ready for Sunday meetings. We had things to do in the lesser priesthood, in all the temporal affairs of the ward—collecting fast offerings and doing duties for the bishop. He and other leaders would teach us about the Aaronic Priesthood and the office of a deacon, then a teacher, and then, of course, a priest as we would advance in the priesthood. It seemed to me that I was developing an interesting understanding, a vision of the work to be done, and that I personally had some responsibility, even though I was just a young boy in a little country town. There was something very important about it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p8" pid="RwZa00SO6EWa12YcO_xSSw" hash="MCek7w">When I was 11 years old, my father died, and at his funeral I was very touched as I heard the people speaking about what a kind man he had been. At the cemetery as they were lowering the casket down in the grave and starting to throw those shovels full of dirt and rocks down on the casket, I stood watching, thinking he was my hero, and I wondered what would ever happen to me having lost my father. I saw good men exercising the priesthood and doing what was right—the men who had helped in digging the grave and taking care of things—and I saw a good man push a five-dollar bill back into the hands of my mother, who had offered him some money for helping to dig the grave. He pushed that money back towards my mother and said, “No, you keep it because you will need this later on.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p9" pid="Php2PjxCf06Ta1Jo-B1YRw" hash="RHyxuw">And so, I would like to declare to all of you in these assemblies tonight, in the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood, isn’t it interesting in the wisdom of our Heavenly Father and His Son, in putting all of these things together, how in the lesser priesthood we learn to do the temporal chores? We’ll have temporal duties, learning in a humble, simple way those things that need to be done. This will teach us of service and of living the commandments of the Lord, preparing us so that we someday will be advanced to the Melchizedek Priesthood, with all of the majesty and the eternal glory that that entails.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p10" pid="cqz6Mok8GEedC-kx65o1xg" hash="O7tTww">Those Aaronic Priesthood years were interesting years in my life. I was always learning new things and always getting a little broader concept and feeling about the gospel and our responsibility in carrying this message out to all the world. In that process we learned to mingle with other people. Sometimes we have the feeling that people might not accept us because we have higher standards. There are things that we don’t do. We have the Word of Wisdom, which helps us to live a healthier life, a type of life that is conducive to our growing into manhood and having the standards and ideals and a way of living that most of the world would like to have. I found that if you live the way you should live, people notice it and are impressed with your beliefs, and then you have an influence on other people’s lives. When they find out that they don’t have to indulge in the smoking or the drinking or the pot, the drugs that are affecting the world so negatively, the fact that you don’t do that has an influence on those people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p11" pid="wFKj1Dv9IEKKMYbXpdWkTw" hash="pDEdLw">Maintaining your standards qualifies you for marriage in the temple. Incidentally, this is the 173rd Annual General Conference of the Church, and for just a bit of trivia, my wife and I have been married 73 years. So the year we were married, the Church would have been holding the 100th annual conference. I can remember that as I was holding Ruby’s hand across the altar of the temple—listening to the words of the sealing ceremony—I had a special feeling in my heart, not only of the sacredness of it but of the responsibility I had to live as I should live, to take care of her and our children, and then our grandchildren, and then the other generations that would come along. I was determined to set an example of living the way a person can live in honoring the priesthood and our marriage covenant.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p12" pid="KKpAyrC0jUydm7qkMJ6clQ" hash="ogJ7QQ">Tonight while we meet as priesthood holders, just think of the responsibility each one of us has as we consider what has to come about in this world—probably new things that we are not aware of today—after this war is over and things have been put back the way they should be. There’s so much for us to do. For us to do it, we need to be worthy of the priesthood that we have so that we can help in leading out as the Church moves on, perhaps in a broader way than we’ve ever done before. What a day that will be!</p>

My family took me to Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay, where I boarded the plane there, an old sea plane called a Pan-American clipper. On board that plane were some high-ranking medical officers going out to prepare and build up the hospital support because the battle of Tarawa would be taking place within a few weeks. Because of my rank, I was assigned to sleep in a sleeping bag out in the tail of that plane, where I could see the starboard engines as we were flying over San Francisco, which was under military blackout. It was black as we were flying out into the Pacific, and I thought the starboard engine on that old Pan-American plane was on fire. I couldn’t sleep as I watched it throughout the entire flight.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p14" pid="FOjIYtAJJkCIcfbOpt2GjQ" hash="YBrA5g">During that sleepless night I wondered about my own life and whether I had been living up to the opportunities that would be mine and the responsibility that would be mine as a holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood—the responsibility to be an example and to live the way I should so that I would be able to fulfill the calls that might come to me. In that sleepless night I took an inventory of myself, of my attitudes, wondering if I was doing all that I might. Even though I had always accepted my Church assignments, I wondered if I was fulfilling them with all of my heart, might, mind, and soul and living up to the responsibility, the blessing, that I received as a holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood and what would be expected of any of us who received this blessing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p15" pid="iYFCuVXLVkKGAKUKqwxilw" hash="Zl5PIA">Looking back on that sleepless night, I thank the Lord for His blessings today and for all that I have had the opportunity to be involved in. I try always to live the gospel to the fullest, to do everything I am called on to do with all of my heart, might, mind, and strength, to fulfill any call that might come to me so I may be qualified to do whatever I might be asked to do someday.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/growing-into-the-priesthood.p16" pid="8VgvXW6TMEGoALL8MtddMQ" hash="YAGA6A">On this night when we are honoring the priesthood, you young men of the priesthood, resolve to live the way you should. Don’t be caught up in some of the silly things that are going on in the world, but bear in mind what has been given to you. I will repeat again, priesthood is the power and authority delegated to man by our Heavenly Father. The authority and the majesty of it are beyond our comprehension.</p>

I’m glad to be able, in the twilight of my life, to stand and bear witness of the truthfulness of the gospel, as I have witnessed it all the days of my life from my baptism on until the present time. I love the Lord. I love our Heavenly Father and this work. I bear witness to the truthfulness of this work.</p>

We are different, and it is not good for you to be like everybody else because you hold the priesthood of God, with those great promises and blessings and expectations of you.</p>
