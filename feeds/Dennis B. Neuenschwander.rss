      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/to-a-missionary-son.p1" pid="wUGKsU1tekKGmoBWmcc7OA" hash="sqIpaQ">My dear brethren, what a wonderful feeling it is to be in the presence of worthy priesthood holders tonight! Among us are many young men. Though some of you are still waiting for your nineteenth birthday, others have already received your call to serve a full-time mission. It is to you that I would like to direct a few of my thoughts this evening.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/to-a-missionary-son.p2" pid="EB1sF21y-UW0vASBcr9QEQ" hash="9ZOdkg">On May 15 of this year, an event occurred in our home that is repeated literally hundreds of times per week in Latter-day Saint homes throughout the Church. After a period of anxious anticipation, a letter from the prophet containing a mission call for our son Bradley arrived. This was the third such letter that we have received in our family, but each time really is the first time. The letter arrived on a day when mission business had me away from home, so the unopened letter sat on Brad’s desk in the mission home in Vienna, Austria, until late that night. Finally the moment arrived, and we were all gathered together—Mom, Dad, younger brother Stephen, and, of course, Bradley.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/to-a-missionary-son.p3" pid="L4CD9VjVkkyO2KwvxSkZIw" hash="fKiRoA">As in many families, there is also a sort of tradition in our family that accompanies the opening of a mission call. Each of us handled the envelope, turning it in our hands and holding it up to the light as if we could somehow discern its contents. Each of us took a piece of paper and recorded our own predictions for Bradley’s call: Japan, New Zealand, and France. Then there was the inevitable fumbling at opening the envelope, extending the excitement for all of us. The letter was at last in Brad’s hands: “Dear Elder Neuenschwander, you are hereby called to serve as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You are assigned to labor in the Poland Warsaw Mission.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/to-a-missionary-son.p4" pid="sSLozb7YKE-siLSxllrEWQ" hash="m0LFBw">Tears flow easily at such moments, perhaps for different reasons. Mom’s eyes are moist at the thought of another son leaving the nest and facing the world. Dad recalls so vividly a day long ago when he received his call to serve in Finland. Stephen understands that this last departure of older brothers means that he will finally be the oldest at home, but his tears also mean a quiet commitment that his letter will not be far behind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/to-a-missionary-son.p5" pid="453ZnKpJP0uAc4RWn5tA0A" hash="vlkBMA">There were phone calls to returned missionary brothers at home in America, each happy but playfully disappointed that Brad’s call was not to New Mexico or Munich, where they had served. Grandparents were thrilled that yet another grandson was worthy to serve the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/to-a-missionary-son.p6" pid="RWtwRlJEbkqMd1Tv_rFNcg" hash="-NCLDQ">Busy days of preparation began. July 10 came all too soon, and it was time for Brad to leave. Bidding farewell to a missionary son, as many of you know, at the MTC definitely does not get easier with practice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/to-a-missionary-son.p7" pid="YciPkfLDJE2c3r_pxcLEUw" hash="YwdDFw">In our quiet moments, Brad and I spoke of his mission. For four years he had watched missionaries come and go through the mission home. Some had even gone to Poland. Yet there are things I would share with him and with you as this great missionary experience now becomes his.</p>

        <h3 class="title" pid="tnFeWhsbvEiP30Tn9RO54g" hash="b8V8jg">You Make Your Mission Successful</h3>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/to-a-missionary-son.p8" pid="0x5YcwFloE2SascL39Xqwg" hash="fKkKww">Your mission will be exactly what you decide to make it. Your excellent mission president, President Whipple, and good missionary companions will help you along the way, but keep in mind that you are the central and decisive factor in the success of your own mission. Your young but strong shoulders bear the responsibility of the call you willingly and happily accepted. You have seen missionaries in a variety of countries and circumstances. You have also observed that in rather similar situations one missionary is successful, another a little less so. The difference lay in the attitude and desire of the individual missionary. Make the inevitable challenges of missionary work steppingstones for your own spiritual growth. Determine now that nothing will keep you from magnifying with honor your missionary call.</p>

But your success as a missionary will depend, in part, on your ability to simplify your life and focus on the purpose of your call. You now move from a life centered on your own needs to one concerned with the welfare of others. Some missionaries struggle, not wanting to let go of the past and consequently never fully committing themselves to the labor at hand. There is no way a successful missionary can have one foot in the world and one in his missionary labors. Successful missionaries make that transition. They leave behind everything that may distract them from their primary purpose. Resist bringing extra luggage with you into the mission field, both in your suitcase and in your mind.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/to-a-missionary-son.p10" pid="XeSoCBars0ywB2kTxi5uAw" hash="omYc3g">Whatever calling you hold in the Church, someone will always preside over you. That person will teach and encourage you in your responsibilities. Brad, be wise enough and humble enough to learn from them. Elder Boyd K. Packer taught us new mission presidents in 1987 that if we would learn to be silent, the Brethren could teach us a lot. I considered it good advice, and I have learned since that in the mission field, as well as in all Church callings, a person who can be taught is also one who can be trusted.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/to-a-missionary-son.p11" pid="uy5ozCoe3U2RnSXZcFJLzA" hash="nhDVcw">Mission rules are important in the same way commandments are important. We all need to keep them, understanding that they give us strength, direction, and limits. The smart missionary will learn the intent of the rules and make them work for him. Your mission is a time of discipline and single-minded focus. You will be required to go without some things common to your current life-style: music, TV, videos, novels, even girls. There is nothing wrong with any of these things, Brad, but then again, there is nothing wrong with food either, unless you are fasting, in which case even a teaspoon of water is improper.</p>

Believe me, Brad, they are not necessary for your gospel study in the mission field. Make the scriptures the basic doctrinal textbook of your mission. The Lord has told his elders: “Teach the children of men the things which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit;</p>

Share your testimony often. I have seen nothing in a missionary that exerts more power and positive influence than the bearing of pure and simple testimony. Your testimony is the first step in the conversion of those whom you teach. Have courage to invite others to change their lives and come to Christ through obedience to the principles and ordinances of the gospel.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p1" pid="JarkSxLlv0WNdhau1JPafg" hash="mospEQ">Brethren and sisters, every family has keepsakes. Families collect furniture, books, porcelain, and other valuable things, then pass them on to their posterity. Such beautiful keepsakes remind us of loved ones now gone and turn our minds to loved ones unborn. They form a bridge between family past and family future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p2" pid="F_F7HANtRkq5NVoSczqxNg" hash="_aWpng">Every family has other, more valuable, keepsakes. These include genealogies, family stories, historical accounts, and traditions. These eternal keepsakes also form a bridge between past and future and bind generations together in ways that no other keepsake can.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p3" pid="kyy2jeh7OkOLCFzKpgaUNA" hash="fwDkGw">I would like to share a few thoughts about family history, bridges, and eternal keepsakes. Family history builds bridges between the generations of our families, builds bridges to activity in the Church, and builds bridges to the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p4" pid="z6ChHCA_d0CqhpzQl2xDWw" hash="drA3Ig">First, family history builds bridges between the generations of our families. Bridges between generations are not built by accident. Each member of this Church has the personal responsibility to be an eternal architect of this bridge for his or her own family. At one of our family gatherings this past Christmas, I watched my father, who is 89 years old, and our oldest grandchild, Ashlin, who is four and a half. They enjoyed being together. This was a bittersweet moment of realization for me. Though Ashlin will retain pleasant but fleeting memories of my father, he will have no memory of my mother, who passed away before his birth. Not one of my children has any recollection of my grandparents. If I want my children and grandchildren to know those who still live in my memory, then I must build the bridge between them. I alone am the link to the generations that stand on either side of me. It is my responsibility to knit their hearts together through love and respect, even though they may never have known each other personally. My grandchildren will have no knowledge of their family’s history if I do nothing to preserve it for them. That which I do not in some way record will be lost at my death, and that which I do not pass on to my posterity, they will never have. The work of gathering and sharing eternal family keepsakes is a personal responsibility. It cannot be passed off or given to another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p5" pid="X5eJFue3I0u2XrlAHhIhCQ" hash="e_RxEg">A life that is not documented is a life that within a generation or two will largely be lost to memory. What a tragedy this can be in the history of a family. Knowledge of our ancestors shapes us and instills within us values that give direction and meaning to our lives. Some years ago, I met the director of a Russian Orthodox monastery. He showed me volumes of his own extensive family research. He told me that one of the values, perhaps even the main value, of genealogy is the establishment of family tradition and the passing of these traditions on to younger generations. “Knowledge of these traditions and family history,” he said, “welds generations together.” Further, he told me: “If one knows he comes from honest ancestors, he is duty and honor bound to be honest. One cannot be dishonest without letting each member of his family down.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p6" pid="UDcnP4QryUeYehwMPwREsA" hash="6XunVQ">If you are among the first to have embraced the gospel in your family, build bridges to your posterity by recording the events of your life and writing words of encouragement to them. In 1892 sisters of the Kolob Stake in Springville, Utah, wrote letters to their children and sealed them in a time capsule to be opened March 17, 1942, the centennial anniversary of the Relief Society. After recording a brief genealogy of her family reaching back to those who first joined the Church, Mariah Catherine Boyer wrote the following to her two children: “Dear children, when you read this, parents and grandparents will be sleeping in the silent tomb. Those hands that toiled so hard in love for you will toil no more, and those eyes that gazed in love and approbation on your innocent brows will see you no more, until we meet in heaven. Dear children, … may the bands of a sister and a brother’s love entwine your hearts. … Do right by your fellowmen, follow the dictates of your conscience, ask God to give you power to resist all temptations to do evil, and let it be said of you, ‘that the world is better for you having lived in it.’ Keep the commandments of God. May your paths in life be strewn with flowers, and may you at all times do right. May you never taste adversity. May the Spirit and blessings of God attend you at all times is the prayer of your mother. I will enclose the photographs of our family. Goodbye my dear children, until we meet.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> These tender and beautiful words have now bridged six generations of a faithful family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p7" pid="qbum3a1G1U-qcVi-MZQuMw" hash="AxvXkA">Family history and temple work have a great power, which lies in their scriptural and divine promise that the hearts of the fathers will turn to the children and those of the children will turn to their fathers.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Woodrow Wilson stated: “A nation which does not remember what it was yesterday, does not know what it is today, nor what it is trying to do. We are trying to do a futile thing if we do not know where we came from or what we have been about.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Well might this be said of families also: A <span class="emphasis">family</span> “which does not remember what it was yesterday, does not know what it is today, nor what it is trying to do. We are trying to do a futile thing if we do not know where we came from or what we have been about.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p8" pid="L5FnwQs1kEmHqy5Vz-HXxA" hash="O10mqg">Second, family history builds bridges to activity in the Church. Family history work solidifies converts and strengthens all members of the Church. Family history research and the preparation of names for the temple can be most valuable in the retention of new members. Faith and confidence grow as family members are included in the saving ordinances of the gospel. During a recent stake conference, I met John and Carmen Day, who were recently baptized. They told me that they had already prepared family names and were planning to enter the temple as soon as they could. Is retention a question here? A new member of the Church can be introduced to family history and temple work very quickly by missionaries, friends, neighbors, and priesthood and auxiliary leaders. Participation in temple ordinances is, after all, at the center of our gospel experience. No official call is required to participate in family history and the accompanying gospel ordinances.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p9" pid="MPXMVyk0Sk-S54taFl79mw" hash="uasPlA">Recently I read an article in the<span class="emphasis"> Improvement Era</span> of August 1940. I quote: “A year ago last April Conference, Dr. John A. Widtsoe of the Council of the Twelve asked the mission presidents of the Church what single phase of the Gospel was most responsible in their respective missions for making new friends, new interests, new converts. President Frank Evans of the Eastern States Mission looked into the subject and concluded that genealogy, and its attendant Gospel ordinances and beliefs, was the greatest factor in his mission.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p10" pid="0HCyXl8jVECPu86chX9--Q" hash="TnB9Lg">A more recent Church study reveals that early involvement in finding and preparing family names for the temple and, where possible, participating in vicarious baptisms for them are major factors in the retention of new members. The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve have encouraged a much broader use of family history and the Family History Centers™ in the retention of new converts and the activation of those who have fallen out of regular Church activity. Priesthood leaders, missionaries, and Family History Center directors all play important roles in the expanded use of these centers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p11" pid="Tw2-Ne13pECPk5d3S7ELVQ" hash="Wq3Fyg">Third, family history builds bridges to the temple. Family history work leads us to the temple. Family history and temple work are one work. The words <span class="emphasis">family history</span> should probably never be said without attaching the word <span class="emphasis">temple</span> to them. Family history research should be the primary source of names for temple ordinances, and temple ordinances are the primary reason for family history research. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said: “All of our vast family history endeavor is directed to temple work. There is no other purpose for it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p12" pid="_lPqeJTvwk6zNbZjNj6cig" hash="42rhvQ">Family history research provides the emotional bridge between the generations. Temple ordinances provide the priesthood bridge. Temple ordinances are the priesthood ratification of the connection that we have already established in our hearts. Mother Teresa said that “loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> The thought that this poverty of loneliness—this being unwanted and separated from loved ones—could extend beyond this life is truly sad. The promise of family history and temple work is eternal connection born of both love and priesthood ordinances.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/bridges-and-eternal-keepsakes.p13" pid="RTEEMx8AUUCGYCmDQbUf3A" hash="TJmfMA">Brethren and sisters, family history and temple work are the eternal family keepsakes that build bridges. They build bridges between the generations of our families, bridges to activity in the Church, and bridges to the temple. It is my desire that each of us will recognize the great keepsakes we have received from those who preceded us and our own personal responsibility to pass them on to future generations. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

During the Sunday afternoon session of general conference, April 6, 1986, a solemn assembly took place, the purpose of which was to sustain Ezra Taft Benson as prophet, seer, and revelator and 13th President of the Church. All Church members were invited to participate either by being in the Tabernacle or by means of radio or TV. As a family, we accepted the invitation to participate in our home. Except for one son then serving a mission, all were present—one high priest, one priest, one deacon, an 11-year-old son, and my wife, LeAnn. By direction and in turn, each of us who held the priesthood stood; then all of us together as a family stood to sustain President Benson.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/living-prophets-seers-and-revelators.p3" pid="ULks_k7r0UG9wkuEfHAFIg" hash="B69RBQ">The fundamental responsibility of prophets, seers, and revelators, all of whom bear apostolic authority, is to bear certain testimony of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world. This basic call to be a special witness of His name has remained constant whenever Apostles have been on the earth. This testimony, borne of the Holy Ghost through revelation, was the heart of the New Testament Church and is the heart of the Church today. On the day of Pentecost, Peter bore pure testimony that Jesus of Nazareth was “taken, … crucified and slain” and that He was “raised up, having loosed the pains of death,” of which they, the Apostles, were all witnesses.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> So powerful was this testimony of Jesus Christ, spoken by a living Apostle, that hearts were changed and about 3,000 people were baptized for the remission of their sins. We read that these new converts “continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> This account in the book of Acts gives deep spiritual meaning to the words Paul later wrote to the Ephesians, that those who embrace the gospel become the household of God “and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

In the proclamation “The Living Christ,” they declare the restoration of His priesthood and Church, testify of His Second Coming, and “bear testimony, as His duly ordained Apostles—that Jesus is the Living Christ, the immortal Son of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

Of Joseph Fielding Smith, President Hinckley wrote: “He did speak straightforwardly and without equivocation. Such is the mission of a prophet.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> The need for prophetic teachers who know the revealed word of God and who speak it directly and without apology is as important in our day as it has ever been. In a confusing world of conflicting ideas, shifting values, and selfish desire for power, well might we study carefully the conversation between Philip and the man from Ethiopia. As this man was reading the scriptures, Philip ran to him and asked, “Understandest thou what thou readest? And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

The presence of seers among us is not much spoken of, yet the ability to see beyond the present lends power and authority to apostolic testimony and teaching. I refer to two scriptures that speak of this important and unique calling. Ammon teaches King Limhi in the Book of Mormon that “a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed … and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

Enoch did so. “And he beheld … things which were not visible to the natural eye; and from thenceforth came the saying abroad in the land: A seer hath the Lord raised up unto his people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

Listen, ponder, and prayerfully consider what they are teaching and what they are doing. As you do so, a pattern emerges that reveals much, and therein will the answer to this question be found.</p>

At the completion of the voting, President Hinckley, who was conducting, said: “Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your sustaining vote. We feel that you have sustained us not only with your hands but also with your hearts and your faith and prayers, which we so urgently need, and pray that you will continue to do so.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Brethren, our sustaining support of prophets, seers, and revelators is not in the upraised hand alone, but more so in our courage, testimony, and faith to listen to, heed, and follow them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/living-prophets-seers-and-revelators.p17" pid="4PDW4PYPs0edypQrbtKIsw" hash="iN3OIA">But I ask myself, if this is so clear, why is it so difficult? There may be many answers to this, but I think, in reality, there is only one. Most of the difficulty can be traced to our desire to be more acceptable to the world than to God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/living-prophets-seers-and-revelators.p18" pid="hsBGBRt7BkqlKJB3ptr8hw" hash="qxQqWw">The teachings of a living prophet are often contrary to the trends of the world. We, as Latter-day Saints and the holders of the priesthood of God, must understand that there is an expanding gulf between the standards of the world and those of the gospel and kingdom of God, and that living prophets will always teach the standards of God. As much as we may want the gospel to accommodate to the world, it can’t, it won’t, it never has, and it never will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/living-prophets-seers-and-revelators.p19" pid="fU1bM5vT5kSuh_zHf-Y1AA" hash="UIIUZw">So much of our modern world is based on self-indulgence, immediate gain and satisfaction, and social acceptance at all cost. The gospel and kingdom of God are so much more than this. Among the characteristics God prizes are patience, long-suffering, endurance, kindness, and brotherly love, none of which is short term or developed in a moment.</p>

The prophet Jacob hoped that the words written with so much difficulty on the plates by righteous men would be received by their children with thankful hearts and that they might learn from them “with joy and not with sorrow.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> May we be wise enough to do likewise with the words of the living prophets, seers, and revelators of our time.</p>

With these few words, Jesus declares His kingdom independent and distinct from this world. The Savior’s teachings, doctrine, and personal example lift all who truly believe in Him to a divine standard that requires both eye and mind be single to the glory of God (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:5</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.68" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:68</a>). The glory of God encompasses all that is holy and sacred. Our ability to seek, recognize, and reverence the holy above the profane, and the sacred above the secular, defines our spirituality. Indeed, without the holy and sacred, we are left with only the profane and secular.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p2" pid="HMpLRTvjq0KB5zV4VA7qSg" hash="mUZizA">Amidst the bustle of the secular world, with its certain uncertainty, there must be places that offer spiritual refuge, renewal, hope, and peace. There are indeed such places. They are both holy and sacred. They are places where we meet the divine and find the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p3" pid="WNhjpL-pakKWDkSpAx1uwA" hash="zafrMg">Three times in the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord counsels His people to “stand in holy places” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:32</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 87:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:22</a>). The context of His counsel is all the more significant as we look at the current condition of our world. Desolating disease, persecution, and war have an all-too-familiar face and have imposed themselves into our daily experience. In the face of such perplexing problems, the Lord counsels, “Behold, it is my will, that all they who call on my name, and worship me according to mine everlasting gospel, should gather together, and stand in holy places” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:22</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p4" pid="XPTm2ltzMUym6NUa00N2Ag" hash="fxSAlA">Holy places have always been essential to the proper worship of God. For Latter-day Saints, such holy places include venues of historic significance, our homes, sacrament meetings, and temples. Much of what we reverence, and what we teach our children to reverence as holy and sacred, is reflected in these places. The faith and reverence associated with them and the respect we have for what transpires or has transpired in them make them holy. The importance of holy places and sacred space in our worship can hardly be overestimated.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p5" pid="-yu6xg3cs0aCPF7tpSHx3w" hash="rx_nSQ">Great personal preparation is required for us to receive the spiritual benefit of standing in holy places. Holy places and sacred space are also distinguished by the sacrifice they require. Elder M. Russell Ballard has taught that “the word <span class="emphasis">sacrifice</span> means literally ‘to make sacred,’ or ‘to render sacred’” (“The Law of Sacrifice,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Oct. 1998, 8; <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Mar. 2002, 13). The words <span class="emphasis">sacred</span> and <span class="emphasis">sacrifice</span> come from the same root. One may not have the sacred without first sacrificing something for it. There can be no sacredness without personal sacrifice. Sacrifice sanctifies the sacred.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p6" pid="mqMzjRrUI020AwfHCB2nBA" hash="U7J9RQ">To many, the grove near the Smith farm in upstate New York is simply beautiful and peaceful. To Latter-day Saints across the world, however, it is sacred because of the faith and reverence we bring to it and the depth of sacrifice it represents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p7" pid="F56ilDt3UU2nNwQukFfQ_w" hash="sHWvMQ">Some months ago on a beautiful late fall day, my wife and I sat in that grove. It was indeed beautiful, and we did enjoy the solitary peace we found there. However, it was significantly more than that, for we sat in the immediate vicinity where God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the young Prophet Joseph Smith. Our faith in, and our reverence for, their visit and the personal sacrifice that ensued because of it, both in the Prophet’s life as well as in the lives of our own ancestors, transformed this beautiful spot into sacred space and a holy place.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p8" pid="dQlM0ccpY0qxD39cNxt1Qg" hash="uJ-pPg">Similar deep and reverent feelings are aroused by other sacred places across the earth relating to the history and establishment of this Church. These sacred places inspire our faith and give us encouragement to be true to that faith and to move forward, despite the challenges that may cross our path.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p9" pid="VQv0j9uVsk-GjefvOqQm_Q" hash="1Yu3QA">Our homes, likewise, are holy places filled with sacred space. Though not always tranquil, our homes can be filled with the Spirit of the Lord. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles teach in “The Family: A Proclamation to the World”: “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102; <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Oct. 1998, 24).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p10" pid="Ty1CL0I3QUSIvc8zXuZtyw" hash="ri6PwA">Such a home does require personal sacrifice. To the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord said, “Your family must needs repent and forsake some things” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.48" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:48</a>). Each of our families is confronted with a broad menu of activities and entertainment, not all of which is wholesome and good—and much of which is certainly not necessary. Like the Prophet’s family, do our families also need to repent and forsake some things to help us maintain the sacred nature of our homes? The establishment of our homes as holy places reflects the depth of sacrifice we are willing to make for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p11" pid="RtJo06kByUWVYOONTyInpQ" hash="C_jocA">Sacrament meetings are really more than just meetings. They are sacred moments in a holy place. During these weekly moments, we reflect on the most merciful act of sacrifice this world has ever known. We ponder the love of God, who gave His Only Begotten Son that we might obtain eternal life. As we partake of the sacrament, we remember Him and express our willingness to take His name upon us and to keep His commandments. Careful personal preparation, including our own sacrifice of a broken heart and contrite spirit, is prerequisite to the regular spiritual renewal offered through worthy participation. We must be willing and capable of slipping away from the world for just a few moments in order to reflect on holier things. Without this spiritual renewal, our faith is easily overcome by the secular and profane.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p12" pid="p6NzZbBocUCWyt7aspogkA" hash="IpTmHA">Many years ago when our boys were still very young, I made a remark at dinner regarding the excellence of our sacrament meeting and how much I had learned. Their response was a look that told me that they were not sure that we had even been in the same meeting. The difference between my experience and theirs was simply one of a little maturity and personal preparation. The spiritual renewal we receive from our sacrament meetings will not exceed our preparation and our willingness and desire to be taught.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p13" pid="2GQafZaXQEeTw0WpJGbLPg" hash="xArYWQ">The temples, with “Holiness to the Lord” inscribed on them, are among the most sacred of all places on the earth. They stand as evidence of God’s love to all His children, past and present. The blessings of the temple are intertwined and inseparable from significant sacrifice. The ordinances performed therein provide access to the full expression of the Savior’s atoning sacrifice. This alone would qualify the temple as holy and sacred. However, personal sacrifice is also required. We sacrifice time in search for our ancestors and time to attend to our temple responsibilities. We also strive to live the highest standards of personal worthiness, which qualify us to enter the sacred space of this most holy place.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p14" pid="UK9aCJlGNUaRV3uzMZdaMw" hash="Yrb71A">In holy places and in sacred space we find spiritual refuge, renewal, hope, and peace. Are these not worth every necessary personal sacrifice? My brethren and sisters, may each of us revere and respect the holy and sacred in our lives. May we teach our children likewise. Let us all stand in holy and sacred places of spiritual peace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/holy-place-sacred-space.p15" pid="-65SJuoFG0CLtf5PuAZB7g" hash="UbGVlg">I express my testimony of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the very Prince of Peace and Hope, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="101"></span>In the book of Luke we read of a woman who for 12 long years had suffered from a bleeding condition. She had exhausted her means in search of a medical solution but had found none. In a crowd of people, the woman approached the Savior from behind and touched the hem of His garment. Jesus wanted to know who had touched Him because He felt that power had gone out of Him. The Apostles could not understand the question and asked, “Master, the multitude throng[s] thee and press[es] thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> The woman then with great fear and trembling confessed that it was she who had approached Him and had been immediately healed. The Savior sent her away in peace, telling her that her faith had made her whole.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p2" pid="xPamAO2Bz0apNf1HiE8Hog" hash="EzWcNw">There is much to learn and ponder in this interesting little story.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p3" pid="JKa1iJycLkqa-lifKUoQYA" hash="8nJRUg">I picture the crowd itself. It must have been fairly large, as people were pressing in on Jesus. It might even have been a noisy crowd, as people pushed and shoved trying to get a better look at Him. I wonder why they were there. Most, I think, came out of curiosity. Wherever He went, news of His arrival and stories of His miracles preceded Him. Perhaps they expected to see something out of the ordinary, an event not to be missed. Though not mentioned, there were likely Pharisees in the crowd, who always seemed to be close by, watching for opportunity to entrap, embarrass, or find something with which they could condemn Jesus. Could it be possible that some in the crowd even came to mock?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p4" pid="tyeMECbGPEylC2fWswXrRw" hash="zd3Ieg">Among the crowd was a woman. I see a humble woman, perhaps even a timid woman, approaching the Savior from behind and then with embarrassment confessing that she had touched the hem of His garment. She was a woman exhausted and impoverished by her difficulties. She was desperate for help. Outwardly, there was little to <span class="pageBreak" page-number="102"></span>distinguish her from any other person in the crowd. No one tried to stop her from moving toward Jesus. Certainly, the Apostles neither noticed her nor made any attempt to stop her. But there was something that set her apart from all others in the crowd that day. Though buried among the thronging mass, she resolutely and quietly pressed forward with a single purpose in mind: to come to the Savior, having faith that He had the power to heal her, that He cared about her and would respond to her need. In this one thing she set herself apart from the crowd. The crowd came to see, but the woman came to be healed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p5" pid="g_kwJcA2F0yKSYRliUt3Og" hash="S50Pmw">There are other interesting accounts in the scriptures of one faithful person among a crowd. Alma was among the wicked priests of King Noah. These were men described as being lifted up in the pride of their hearts, lazy and idolatrous, who spoke lying and vain words to the people.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> They had perverted the ways of the Lord because they had not applied their hearts to understanding.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> When Abinadi delivered his message of repentance, they mocked him and finally put him to death. This was indeed an evil crowd. Yet as the scriptures point out, “there was one among them”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> who believed. Alma alone took to heart what Abinadi had taught. With courage he stepped away from the crowd to follow the Lord. The influence of this one man among the crowd on the course of Nephite history is immeasurable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p6" pid="7LhthG3t5EaP9iAJNqWnXA" hash="MyfaRw">One of the most well-known crowds in the Book of Mormon is the one that occupies the great and spacious building in Lehi’s vision of the tree of life. The building was filled with people, old and young, male and female, who were mocking and pointing their fingers toward those who were partaking of the fruit of the tree.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Unfortunately, some who had tasted of the fruit listened to the crowd and “fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> There were others, however, who partook of the fruit and paid no heed to the crowd.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> These were the ones who enjoyed the full blessings of the tree of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p7" pid="I0Y9TG3L-k-rE57d19hL8A" hash="xq9tww">In reality these stories are not about crowds but individuals among those crowds. They are really about you and me. All of us are among the crowds of this world. Almost all of us are like the woman who, despite the crowd, comes to the Savior. We all have faith that just a touch will bring healing to our aching souls and relief to our innermost needs.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> New members of the Church in many lands are often like Alma. They hear the words of life when no one else in their family or circle of friends does. Yet they still have the courage to accept the gospel and chart a course through the crowds. I think each one of us understands what it means to partake of the fulfilling fruit of the tree of life within sight and sound of those who mock and what it means to exert every courageous effort to pay them no heed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p8" pid="8O3JJxIRDU2_-n-14IiAbA" hash="-cmywQ">Struggling through the crowds of the world can be lonely and hard. Their pull and tug on the individual who wishes to step away to something better can be very strong and very difficult to overcome.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p9" pid="DBbm_jwQEU2EsE97m5oimg" hash="_Goq7g">Who better than the Savior can reach, support, and ultimately rescue the one among the crowd? He understands what it is to persevere among a disrespectful crowd and still remain true. The worldly crowds do not recognize Him, saying that “he hath no <span class="pageBreak" page-number="103"></span>form nor comeliness” and that “there is no beauty that we should desire him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> King Benjamin says that the world “shall consider him a man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Isaiah further describes Christ’s place among the crowds of the world with these words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p10" pid="Y6OqGrE8dkmcEHNa9u-dPw" hash="zLqPzw">“He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief … ; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p11" pid="F9f1YaFtq0WWKY3KrhUNVw" hash="cUk6YQ">“Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p12" pid="S8fuZT6RyE6qSZebjyYZrQ" hash="WirFsw">Nephi writes that “the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p13" pid="4HbOjsYUOkGip-bHxxEvng" hash="83dk3Q">Yet ultimately this Firstborn Son of God, who is so often misjudged and misunderstood, will emerge from being one among the crowd as the Anointed One, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. This emergence is humbly predicted in the Savior’s own statement to certain chief priests and elders that “the stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/one-among-the-crowd.p14" pid="UZ7UTmubgkCq7LCHLRueWQ" hash="xW7qHA">My dear brothers and sisters, I pray that each one of us can pass safely through the crowds of this world. In all of life’s circumstances let us quietly and resolutely press forward to the Savior, having faith that He cares about us and has the power to heal and save us. Let us heed His words of life and partake fully, continually, and courageously of the fruit that comes therefrom. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
