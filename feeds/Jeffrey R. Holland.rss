      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p1" pid="36jKZL-70kqbaRhS-3v8aw" hash="Zoh-Hg">Brethren, it is impossible to express the overwhelming sense of responsibility I feel tonight. Like the mule who entered the Kentucky Derby, I know I probably shouldn’t be here, but I surely like the company it lets me keep. Tonight I include in that special company my son Matt, whom I love with all my heart. I pray earnestly for the Spirit of the Lord to be with us in our assignment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p2" pid="jru7ZL6eokyRCgt1gjvemw" hash="B3QlKw">Brethren, a recent study conducted by the Church has forcefully confirmed statistically what we have been told again and again. That is, if loving, inspired instruction and example are not provided at home, then our related efforts for success in and around Church programs are severely limited. It is increasingly clear that we must teach the gospel to our families personally, live those teachings in our homes, or run the risk of discovering too late that a Primary teacher or priesthood adviser or seminary instructor <span class="emphasis">could</span> not do for our children what we <span class="emphasis">would</span> not do for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p3" pid="9rGDYNJgxkKi4dt5nYgtFA" hash="TfzOjQ">May I offer just this much encouragement regarding such a great responsibility? What I cherish in my relationship with Matt is that he is, along with his mother and sister and brother, my closest, dearest friend. I would rather be here at this priesthood meeting tonight with my son than with any other male companion in this world. I love to be with him. We talk a lot. We laugh a lot. We play one-on-one basketball; we play tennis and racquetball, though I do refuse to play golf with him (that’s a private joke). We discuss problems. I am the president of a small university, and he is the president of a large high school class. We compare notes and offer suggestions and share each other’s challenges. I pray for him and have cried with him, and I’m immensely proud of him. We’ve talked long into the night lying on his water bed, a twentieth-century aberration which I know, as part of the punishment of the last days, will one day burst and wash the Hollands helplessly into the streets of Provo (that’s another private joke).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p4" pid="9dudtpPcD0KQLTJDYU8y6Q" hash="hMP6TA">I feel I can talk to Matt about how he is enjoying seminary because I try to talk to him about all of his classes at school. We often imagine together what his mission will be like because he knows how much my mission meant to me. And he asks me about temple marriage because he knows I am absolutely crazy about his mother. He wants his future wife to be like her and for them to have what we have.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p5" pid="uEE1WOrVQ0a0nTgKziJ4LA" hash="GqRAeQ">Now, even as I speak, I know that there are fathers and sons in this meeting tonight who feel they do not have any portion of what is here described. I know there are fathers who would give virtually their very lives to be close again to a struggling son. I know there are sons in our meeting who wish their dads were at their side, tonight or any night. I have wondered how to speak on this assigned topic without sounding self-righteous on the one hand or offending already tender hearts on the other. In answer to that, I simply say to us all, young and old, never give up. Keep trying, keep reaching, keep talking, keep praying—but never give up. Above all, never pull away from each other.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p6" pid="WokD9nVN8UOKxI_5DrD7BQ" hash="_U8U9A">May I share a brief but painful moment from my own inadequate efforts as a father?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p7" pid="mesTlLomZUCQ9I0ek3P9Gg" hash="HNZRZA">Early in our married life my young family and I were laboring through graduate school at a university in New England. Pat was the Relief Society president in our ward, and I was serving in our stake presidency. I was going to school full-time and teaching half-time. We had two small children then, with little money and lots of pressures. In fact, our life was about like yours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p8" pid="-xmHgsNBlkKY592aawEOQQ" hash="cG3PiQ">One evening I came home from long hours at school, feeling the proverbial weight of the world on my shoulders. Everything seemed to be especially demanding and discouraging and dark. I wondered if the dawn would ever come. Then, as I walked into our small student apartment, there was an unusual silence in the room.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p9" pid="ow67-0zbuUmbfT-axgrPRA" hash="70lNLA">“What’s the trouble?” I asked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p10" pid="uqnlOdcYRUGyNGBIUYjMVw" hash="gWOu-w">“Matthew has something he wants to tell you,” Pat said.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p11" pid="8MXIlFiVNU-HH56IRmoe6A" hash="hrb_WQ">“Matt, what do you have to tell me?” He was quietly playing with his toys in the corner of the room, trying very hard not to hear me. “Matt,” I said a little louder, “do you have something to tell me?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p12" pid="w8mtscJYJ0OSetcJwOr4hg" hash="stboTg">He stopped playing, but for a moment didn’t look up. Then these two enormous, tear-filled brown eyes turned toward me, and with the pain only a five-year-old can know, he said, “I didn’t mind Mommy tonight, and I spoke back to her.” With that he burst into tears, and his entire little body shook with grief. A childish indiscretion had been noted, a painful confession had been offered, the growth of a five-year-old was continuing, and loving reconciliation could have been wonderfully underway.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p13" pid="abZArzrh8EizpExiafyX-g" hash="8icfQg">Everything might have been just terrific—except for me. If you can imagine such an idiotic thing, I lost my temper. It wasn’t that I lost it with Matt—it was with a hundred and one other things on my mind; but he didn’t know that, and I wasn’t disciplined enough to admit it. He got the whole load of bricks.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p14" pid="ZYnY6DQ6ek-TZB0Uq04OAw" hash="KGWgNg">I told him how disappointed I was and how much more I thought I could have expected from him. I sounded like the parental pygmy I was. Then I did what I had never done before in his life—I told him that he was to go straight to bed and that I would not be in to say his prayers with him or to tell him a bedtime story. Muffling his sobs, he obediently went to his bedside, where he knelt—alone—to say his prayers. Then he stained his little pillow with tears his father should have been wiping away.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p15" pid="4VHoB2JY5UixTC_2AQkbNA" hash="6DCJ7A">If you think the silence upon my arrival was heavy, you should have felt it now. Pat did not say a word. She didn’t have to. I felt terrible!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p16" pid="M4Eff51BNk6iAWqLRylaWA" hash="R0ZRJw">Later, as we knelt by our own bed, my feeble prayer for blessings upon my family fell back on my ears with a horrible, hollow ring. I wanted to get up off my knees right then and go to Matt and ask his forgiveness, but he was long since peacefully asleep.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p17" pid="4qv9j4AUO0eB4q6jIcO0Lg" hash="A1CcBg">
        <span class="emphasis">My</span> relief was not so soon coming; but finally I fell asleep and began to dream, which I seldom do. I dreamed Matt and I were packing two cars for a move. For some reason his mother and baby sister were not present. As we finished I turned to him and said, “Okay, Matt, you drive one car and I’ll drive the other.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p18" pid="I11RH3J3fUa2tbbtm2z55g" hash="HzLWkg">This five-year-old very obediently crawled up on the seat and tried to grasp the massive steering wheel. I walked over to the other car and started the motor. As I began to pull away, I looked to see how my son was doing. He was trying—oh, how he was trying. He tried to reach the pedals, but he couldn’t. He was also turning knobs and pushing buttons, trying to start the motor. He could scarcely be seen over the dashboard, but there staring out at me again were those same immense, tear-filled, beautiful brown eyes. As I pulled away, he cried out, “Daddy, don’t leave me. I don’t know how to do it. I am too little.” And I drove away.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p19" pid="leaRz2CxwUS8P0AfnlUGag" hash="788HRA">A short time later, driving down that desert road in my dream, I suddenly realized in one stark, horrifying moment what I had done. I slammed my car to a stop, threw open the door, and started to run as fast as I could. I left car, keys, belongings, and all—and I ran. The pavement was so hot it burned my feet, and tears blinded my straining effort to see this child somewhere on the horizon. I kept running, praying, pleading to be forgiven and to find my boy safe and secure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p20" pid="cTkb9yi57E60eK80_Ms8Pw" hash="QMfQdg">As I rounded a curve nearly ready to drop from physical and emotional exhaustion, I saw the unfamiliar car I had left Matt to drive. It was pulled carefully off to the side of the road, and he was laughing and playing nearby. An older man was with him, playing and responding to his games. Matt saw me and cried out something like, “Hi, Dad. We’re having fun.” Obviously he had already forgiven and forgotten my terrible transgression against him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p21" pid="0mIqT43c9kapn3C907Iz-A" hash="TPIUTg">But I dreaded the older man’s gaze, which followed my every move. I tried to say “Thank you,” but his eyes were filled with sorrow and disappointment. I muttered an awkward apology and the stranger said simply, “You should not have left him alone to do this difficult thing. It would not have been asked of you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p22" pid="2muH33bNe0aKPkjPE7kW5Q" hash="AF_cyw">With that, the dream ended, and I shot upright in bed. <span class="emphasis">My</span> pillow was now stained, whether with perspiration or tears I do not know. I threw off the covers and ran to the little metal camp cot that was my son’s bed. There on my knees and through my tears I cradled him in my arms and spoke to him while he slept. I told him that every dad makes mistakes but that they don’t mean to. I told him it wasn’t his fault I had had a bad day. I told him that when boys are five or fifteen, dads sometimes forget and think they are fifty. I told him that I wanted him to be a small boy for a long, long time, because all too soon he would grow up and be a man and wouldn’t be playing on the floor with his toys when I came home. I told him that I loved him and his mother and his sister more than anything in the world and that whatever challenges we had in life we would face them together. I told him that never again would I withhold my affection or my forgiveness from him, and never, I prayed, would he withhold them from me. I told him I was honored to be his father and that I would try with all my heart to be worthy of such a great responsibility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p23" pid="q8R_lY_26EidtlxMoGt5ZA" hash="AOs7MA">Well, I have not proven to be the perfect father I vowed to be that night and a thousand nights before and since. But I still want to be, and I believe this wise counsel from President Joseph F. Smith:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p24" pid="9WSWIv2oCESELdbRi78KLQ" hash="S0XsjA">“Brethren, … If you will keep your [children] close to your heart, within the clasp of your arms; if you will make them … feel that you love them … and keep them near to you, they will not go very far from you, and they will not commit any very great sin. But it is when you turn them out of the home, turn them out of your affection … that [is what] drives them from you. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p25" pid="0pujDgW6T0K5EPE0WNKl7g" hash="AEP48Q">“Fathers, if you wish your children to be taught in the principles of the gospel, if you wish them to love the truth and understand it, if you wish them to be obedient to and united with you, love them! and prove … that you do love them by your every word and act to[ward] them.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1966, pp. 282, 316.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p26" pid="68azk6ov-kCtPEuaz2MX4A" hash="WcNMaw">Brethren, we all know fatherhood is not an easy assignment, but it ranks among the most imperative ever given, in time or eternity. We must not pull away from our children. We must keep trying, keep reaching, keep praying, keep listening. We must keep them “within the clasp of our arms.” That is what friends are for. Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

There is no sufficient way to express either the sense of responsibility or feelings of inadequacy one has in being called to such a ministry. In these many weeks of self-examination, I have repeatedly felt, as Paul once wrote, “pressed out of measure, [and stretched] above strength.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/1.8" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 1:8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p2" pid="RI7W0n_SAkSrG9Uenz34kQ" hash="dJV-Ww">I also wish to express appreciation to my family, who have loved me, prayed for me, comforted and sustained me all of my life—as only a family can. They alone know how deeply I love them. I alone know how much they will mean to me forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p3" pid="LIgATKL2gkaqKLEhmFfvHQ" hash="JzA6rA">This afternoon I wish to thank you, the faithful members of the Church, for your sustaining vote last April and again this day. It is no small thing to “sustain” another person. The word literally means to “uphold” or, if you prefer, to “hold up.” When we sustain life, we nourish it, we keep it going. When we sustain a friend or a neighbor or a stranger in the street, we give support, we share strength, we provide help. We hold each other up under the weight of present circumstance. We bear one another’s burdens under the heavy personal pressures of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p4" pid="KMsk3IiMxkW1ZCnNXvEpOA" hash="NMT6HQ">As with all else in our experience, the Lord Jesus Christ is our exemplar and ideal in this very important matter of providing sustenance. His is the ultimate arm of strength and his the endurance which endures all things. At no time did he demonstrate that unfailing devotion more clearly than during the final moments of his earthly life, hours when he might well have wished that others could have been sustaining him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p5" pid="9DV8WCLsBEi7bLBYjXC0AQ" hash="N8gUOw">As the sacred supper of that ultimate Passover was being prepared, Jesus was under the strain of deep and profound emotion. Only he knew what lay immediately ahead, but perhaps even he did not fully anticipate the depth of pain to which he must go before it could be said, “The Son of Man hath descended below them all.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:8</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.3-17" class="scriptureRef">John 13:3–17</a>.) This small circle of believers in this scarcely founded kingdom were about to pass through their severest trial, so he would set aside his own increasing anguish in order that he might yet once more serve and strengthen them. It does not matter that no one washed his feet. In transcendent humility he would continue to teach and to cleanse them. He would to the final hour—and beyond—be their sustaining servant. As John wrote, who was there and watched the wonder of it all, “Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.1" class="scriptureRef">John 13:1</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p7" pid="lIWbRvPq-EufuHMsu3W5MA" hash="PpsNag">So it had been, and so it was to be—through the night, and through the pain, and forever. He would <span class="emphasis">always</span> be their strength, and no anguish in his own soul would ever keep him from that sustaining role.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p8" pid="Mup11YGKCUK_GYtF-LsKoA" hash="wNASZw">In the moonlit silence of that Near Eastern night, every acute pain, every heartfelt grief, every crushing wrong and human hurt experienced by every man, woman, and child in the human family was to be heaped upon his weary shoulders. But in such a moment, when someone might have said it to him, he rather says to us, “Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p9" pid="QN2BzRK_ZUmxvu6SnL2rgA" hash="O5dnGQ">“Ye shall be sorrowful,” he said—sad, lonely, frightened, and sometimes even persecuted, “<span class="emphasis">but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. … </span> Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.20,33" class="scriptureRef">John 16:20, 33</a>; italics added.)</p>

On a night like this? With the pain he knew was just ahead? But those are the blessings he always brought, and that is how he always spoke—to the very end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p11" pid="yBC_diL37Uulq1r_xfZlSg" hash="jkt13Q">We cannot know to what extent his disciples fully understood the approaching events, but we do know that Christ faced his final moments alone. In one of the truly candid comments he would make to his brethren, he said, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.38" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:38</a>.) And he left them to do what only he could do. The Light of the World stepped away from human company and entered the garden grove to wrestle with the prince of darkness alone. Moving forward, kneeling, falling forward on his face, he cried with an anguish you and I will never know, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:39</a>.) But he knew, for our sakes, that it could not pass and that he must drink that bitter cup to the dregs!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/he-loved-them-unto-the-end.p12" pid="9ClwESAedU2eUaJMY33G_g" hash="BFHiKA">His disciples, understandably, were weary and soon fell asleep. What of Christ’s sleep? What of his fatigue? What rest or slumber will sustain him through such an agonizing ordeal? That is simply not his concern here, nor does it ever seem to be. He will endure. He will triumph. He will not falter nor fail us.</p>

Of those who rend his flesh and spill his blood he says, “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.34" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:34</a>.) And to the penitent thief at his side he gently promises paradise. To his beloved mother he is unable to make any caring gesture with his hands. So he simply looks at her and says, “Woman, behold thy son!” Then commending to John her future care, he declares, “Behold thy mother!” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/19.26-27" class="scriptureRef">John 19:26–27</a>.) He would be concerned for others—but especially for her—to the very end.</p>

No wonder the veil of the temple was rent. No wonder the very earth convulsed at the plight of this perfect child.

In awe, he uttered the declaration for all eternity, “Truly this was the Son of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/27.54" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 27:54</a>.)</p>

Sometimes things fall short, don’t quite measure up. Sometimes in both personal and public life, we are seemingly left without strength to go on. Sometimes people fail us, or economies and circumstance fail us, and life with its hardship and heartache can leave us feeling very alone.</p>

Only the pure love of Christ will see us through. It is Christ’s love which suffereth long, and is kind. It is Christ’s love which is not puffed up nor easily provoked. Only his pure love enables him—and us—to bear all things, believe all things, hope all things, and endure all things.

Thank you for joining with us on this beautiful fall morning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/look-to-god-and-live.p2" pid="rOjVmU5Zd0a-JETgUdqunQ" hash="7r5YfQ">Life in every era has had its troubles. Surely the Dark Ages were appropriately named, and not one of us is anxious to be transported back even to those later years of, say, the Hundred Years’ War or the Black Plague. No, we’re quite happy to have been born in a century of unprecedented material blessings and abundant living; yet in community after community, in small nations and large, we see individuals and families facing heightened anxiety and fear. It would seem that discouragement, depression, and despair are our contemporary “Black Plague.” Ours is, as Jesus said it would be, a time of distress with perplexity (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/21.25" class="scriptureRef">Luke 21:25</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/look-to-god-and-live.p3" pid="dkvN2g89oUC1pEgxdIMwXw" hash="3jyLdg">We know that some of the world’s most painful suffering is done in silence, in the sorrow of a lonely life. But some of it has more violent expression. Millions around the world are, as one observer put it, “angry, armed and dangerous.” In too many cities, drive-by shootings are becoming as common as drive-through laundries, and too many youngsters are packing a gun to school the way they used to pack a lunch.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/look-to-god-and-live.p4" pid="cEf2xc23fkCFIYiUUAaxEg" hash="1T4rvQ">There is an increasing feeling that time is out of joint, that no one seems wise enough or strong enough to set it right. In many cases, governments are in office but not in power, community values and neighborhood pride are often superficial or nonexistent, and too frequently the home is an alarming failure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/look-to-god-and-live.p5" pid="dbEJU1KlnkK4E8FT1I33og" hash="JDE0fA">Furthermore, many of the social and political medicines of our day regularly miss the mark, so those would-be physicians stand by the bedside of “feverish and delirious humanity—outwitted, discredited, dumbfounded … not knowing in which direction to seek delivered” (Charles Edward Jefferson, <span class="emphasis">The Character of Jesus,</span> Salt Lake City: Parliament Publishers, 1968, p. 17).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/look-to-god-and-live.p6" pid="NzsdWCuu7E27O1W0fjrO0A" hash="20mgPg">If I may be so bold this morning, may I suggest “direction for deliverance”? In words of one syllable, we need to turn to God. We need to reaffirm our faith, and we need to reassert our hope. Where necessary we need to repent, and certainly we need to pray. It is the absence of spiritual fidelity that has led us to moral disarray in the twilight of the twentieth century. We have sown the wind of religious skepticism, and we are reaping the whirlwind of existential despair.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/look-to-god-and-live.p7" pid="eU2dDMsP5024k1xsmFeDPg" hash="RFtXTw">Without our religious faith, without recognizing the reality and necessity of spiritual life, the world makes no sense, and a nonsense world is a place of horror. Only if the world has meaning at a spiritual level is it possible for human beings to keep going, to keep trying. As Hamlet so wisely implored, so should we: “Angels and ministers of grace defend us!” (act 1, scene 4, line 39).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/look-to-god-and-live.p8" pid="c-x-KFQOJE2zfnXpavVZpA" hash="dW4ttg">My testimony today is of the angels and ministers of grace who will always defend us if, as the prophet Alma commanded us, we “take care of … sacred things,” we “look to God and live” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.47" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:47</a>). More prayer and humility, more faith and forgiveness, more repentance and revelation and reinforcement from heaven—these are where we seek remedy and deliverance for “feverish and delirious humanity” (<span class="emphasis">The Character of Jesus,</span> p. 17).</p>

He <span class="emphasis">is</span> our Father, and Wordsworth wrote more than he knew when he said we came to earth “trailing clouds of glory … from God who is our home” (“Ode: Intimations of Immortality”). But in far too many cases we find no modern belief in a Heavenly Father, and when there is a belief, it is too often an erroneous one. God is not dead, and he is not an absentee landlord. God is not uncaring, or capricious, or cantankerous. Above all, he is not some sort of divine referee trying to tag us off third base.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/look-to-god-and-live.p10" pid="KncFVeaw8UCebhjYsJxOYQ" hash="q4hBmA">The first and great commandment on earth is for us to love God with all our heart, might, mind, and strength (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:5</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.37" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:37</a>) because surely the first and great promise in heaven is that he will always love us that way.</p>

They are all about us, and their holy sovereign, the Father of us all, is divinely anxious to bless us this very moment. Mercy is his mission, and love is his only labor. John Donne said once: “We ask our daily bread, and God never says, ‘You should have come yesterday.’ … [No, he says,] ‘Today if you will hear [my] voice, today I will hear yours.’ … If thou hast been benighted till now, wintered and frozen, clouded and eclipsed, damp and benumbed, smothered and stupefied till now, God yet comes to thee, not as in the dawning of the day, … but as the sun at [full] noon, to banish all shadows” (<span class="emphasis">Collected Sermons</span>).</p>

That was exactly one hundred days ago, and every one of those days I have prayed to be worthy of and equal to this sacred responsibility. Perhaps you can understand the immense personal inadequacy I feel and the deep, often painful examination of my soul I have experienced.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p2" pid="AmgErs2MZ0yYqFRSVRuB-Q" hash="ceVaDA">Obviously my greatest thrill and the most joyful of all realizations is that I have the opportunity, as Nephi phrased it, to “talk of Christ, … rejoice in Christ, … preach of Christ, [and] prophesy of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:26</a>) wherever I may be and with whomever I may find myself until the last breath of my life is gone. Surely there could be no higher purpose or greater privilege than that of “special [witness] of the name of Christ in all the world” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:23</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p3" pid="1p4VtSFi10-GMEzl9b_ycg" hash="uMjJCA">But my greatest anxiety stems from that very same commission. A line of scripture reminds us with searing understatement that “they which preach the gospel should live … the gospel” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/9.14" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 9:14</a>). Beyond my words and teachings and spoken witness, my life must be part of that testimony of Jesus. My very being should reflect the divinity of this work. I could not bear it if anything I might ever say or do would in any way diminish your faith in Christ, your love for this church, or the esteem in which you hold the holy apostleship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p4" pid="V0SVRsVAQUu9TXblBxM_jg" hash="zVhTzw">I do promise you—as I have promised the Lord and these my brethren—that I will strive to live worthy of this trust and serve to the full measure of my ability.</p>

On occasion the beauty of his life and the magnitude of his gift comes to my heart with such force that, as a favorite hymn says, “I scarce can take it in” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 86). The purity of his life, his mercy and compassion for us have led me again and again to “bow in humble adoration and there proclaim ‘My God, how great thou art!’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p6" pid="4g94XlhTLUWrtb3v9WY3Xg" hash="aMGDgA">I wish to thank my beloved wife, Pat, and our heaven-sent children for their prayers and their love, not only through these recent weeks, but always. My wife has the purest faith and deepest spirituality I know. Never in her entire life has she sought her own reward or pursued a selfish motive. Paraphrasing what Mark Twain’s Adam said of his Eve, I say of her, Wherever she was, there was paradise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p7" pid="DQP0KpkBskGMqnkAW1e7hg" hash="mc7NlA">And to each of our children, I say, Thank you for being the kind of person I prayed at your birth you would become. It is high privilege indeed when a father’s best friends and noblest examples are his own children. To my wife, my children, my saintly parents, and scores of others along the path of life who teach and serve and sacrifice to make us what we are, I express my undying appreciation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p8" pid="vEneY-84tEeX88zpZL4jEA" hash="Cf9ABw">If I may, I wish to bear personal witness to two kinds of miracles which I have seen in the process of coming to this new office.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p9" pid="ECZH92CogkytY7Jj4e55XA" hash="3RRmoQ">One divine manifestation I have seen is of the prophetic calling of President Howard W. Hunter, whom we had the privilege of sustaining this morning in solemn assembly. Because of the unexpected call which came to me in the first weeks of his prophetic ministry, I have had something of a unique vantage point from which to observe the miracle of his renewal, the profound evidence of God’s hand upon this chosen leader.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p10" pid="1UTDRuCtRkqdqXFdm2mWXA" hash="ffpBVw">In a rapid sequence of events that Thursday morning, President Hunter interviewed me at length, extended to me my call, formally introduced me to the First Presidency and the Twelve gathered in their temple meeting, gave me my apostolic charge and outline of duties, ordained me an Apostle, set me apart as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, added a magnificent and beautiful personal blessing of considerable length, then went on to conduct the sacred business of that first of my temple meetings, lasting another two or three hours!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p11" pid="NjZ4Jhz9fkiQw0mpfT-gQQ" hash="mcawPw">President Hunter did all of that personally. And through it all he was strong and fixed and powerful. Indeed, it seemed to me he got stronger and more powerful as the day progressed. I count it one of the greatest privileges of my life just to have observed the Lord’s anointed engaged in such a manner. I include in that tribute President Gordon B. Hinckley and President Thomas S. Monson, who that day and always stand so faithfully at President Hunter’s side in the First Presidency, and President Boyd K. Packer, who leads the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p12" pid="nnuY9tNfh0-liCDm6NVr7w" hash="3AWdYw">Yes, I testify that God has worked his will on Howard William Hunter. He has touched his lips and spread the prophetic mantle of ordained leadership upon his shoulders. President Hunter is a miracle—one who has been fashioned, molded, refined, and sustained for the service he now renders. He is a most remarkable blend of velvet and steel. Like every prophet before him—including Joseph Smith, Jr.—and every prophet who will succeed him, President Hunter was called and foreordained in the grand councils of heaven before this world was. I bear solemn witness of that fact and the principle of Church governance it teaches. And age? Age has nothing to do with it. Whether an incomparable fourteen-year-old in 1820 or an invincible eighty-six-year-old in 1994, it is obvious that the number of birthdays doesn’t count, that “time … is measured [only] unto men” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.8" class="scriptureRef">Alma 40:8</a>). President Hunter, we all bask in the glow of those candles on your cake and look forward to lighting yet another one in six weeks’ time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p13" pid="jbp8031gbkqCAP-TEl9rCg" hash="iYHZgg">I have also seen another miracle. That miracle is you, the great faithful but often unheralded body of the Church who play your part in the ongoing saga of the Restoration. In a real sense, the wonder and beauty of this historic day would not, could not be complete without you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p14" pid="__nmI3c-2kO4vJoONgmB4g" hash="K4dTxQ">Certainly I, for one, have taken great strength from you today, you who come from a hundred different nations and ten hundred walks of life. You who have turned away from the glitter and glare and “vain imaginations” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12.18" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 12:18</a>) of the world, to seek a holier life in the splendor of the city of God. You who love your families and your neighbors and, yes, those who hate you and curse you and “despitefully use you, and persecute you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.44" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:44</a>). You who pay tithing with certainty even when you are uncertain about every other aspect of your financial future. You who send your sons and daughters on missions, clothing that child in better apparel than you now wear—or will wear—for the eighteen or twenty-four months of sacrifice that lie ahead. You who plead for blessings to be bestowed on others, especially those in physical or spiritual distress, offering to give them your own health or happiness if that would be something God could allow. You who face life alone, or face it without advantage, or face it with little success. You who carry on in quiet courage, doing the best you can. I pay tribute to every one of you and am deeply honored to stand in your presence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p15" pid="dwYj4erj2kapbHM4Y4-tug" hash="H9ka2g">I especially thank you for sustaining your leaders, whatever their personal sense of limitation may be. This morning, in common consent, you volunteered to uphold—or more literally “hold up”—the presiding officers of the kingdom, those who bear the keys and responsibility for the work, not one man of whom sought the position or feels equal to the task. And even when Jeffrey Holland’s name is proposed as the last and the least of the newly ordained, your arm goes lovingly to the square. And you say to Brother Holland through his tears and his nights of walking the floor: “You lean on us. Lean on us out here in Omaha and Ontario and Osaka where we have never even seen you, and scarcely know who you are. But you are one of the ‘Brethren,’ so you are no stranger or foreigner to us, but a fellow citizen in the household of God. You will be prayed for in our family, and you will hold a place within our hearts. Our strength shall be your strength. Our faith will build your faith. Your work will be our work.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p16" pid="DMULKTXVI0KH6PUajbsxQA" hash="Ffq57g">This church, the great institutional body of Christ, is a marvelous work and a wonder not only because of what it does for the faithful but also because of what the faithful do for it. Your lives are at the very heart of that marvel. You are evidence of the wonder of it all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p17" pid="De85UhwW9UWe0gAfGg-HbQ" hash="XCopXQ">Just twenty-four hours after my call as an Apostle last June, I left for a Church assignment in southern California where, in due course, I found myself standing by the bedsides of Debbie, Tanya, and Liza Avila. These three lovely sisters, aged thirty-three, thirty-two, and twenty-three, respectively, each developed muscular dystrophy at age seven. Since that tender age, each has had her rendezvous with pneumonia and tracheotomies, with neuropathy and leg braces. Then came wheelchairs, respirators, and, finally, total immobility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p18" pid="020t0tvRY0etBTzwNMp0aw" hash="xCjhEg">Enduring the longest period of immobility of the three sisters, Tanya has been on her back for seventeen years, having never moved from her bed during that period of time. Never once in seventeen years has she seen the sun rise or set or felt the rain upon her face. Never once in seventeen years has she picked a flower or chased a rainbow or watched a bird in flight. For a lesser number of years, Debbie and Liza have also now lived with those same physical restrictions. Yet somehow through it all, these sisters have not only endured, they have triumphed—earning Young Women personal achievement awards, graduating from high school (including seminary), completing university correspondence courses, and reading the standard works over and over and over again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p19" pid="_xB8Ef6gqk6v3zQKLjaZPw" hash="Me3OuA">But there has been one other abiding ambition these remarkable women were determined to see fulfilled. They rightly saw themselves as daughters of the covenant, offspring of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Rachel. They vowed that somehow, some way, someday they would go to the house of the Lord to claim those eternal promises. And now even that has been accomplished. “It was the most thrilling and fulfilling day of my life,” Debbie said. “I truly felt I was home. Everyone was so gracious and helpful with the innumerable and seemingly insurmountable arrangements that had to be made. Never in my life have I felt more loved and accepted.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p20" pid="CdGdhnqocECY2OnC3plStw" hash="Kg69hA">Of her experience, Tanya said: “The temple is the only place I have ever been where I felt truly whole. I have always felt I was a daughter of God, but only in the temple did I understand what that truly meant. The fact that I went through the experience lying horizontally with a respirator took absolutely nothing away from this sacred experience.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p21" pid="fDRJd_u1yU67coz-UPb6Jg" hash="wmsMoA">Elder Douglas Callister, who, along with the presidency and workers in the Los Angeles Temple, assisted these sisters in making their dream come true, said to me, “There they were, dressed in white, long black hair falling down nearly to the floor from their horizontal position, eyes filled with tears, unable to move their hands or any other part of the body except their heads, savoring, absorbing, cherishing every word, every moment, every aspect of the temple endowment.” Debbie would later say of the experience, “I now know what it will be like to be resurrected, surrounded by heavenly angels, and in the presence of God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p22" pid="suPN0pkX1UiZc5Gcs66_Cw" hash="pWQdHA">One year after her own endowment, Debbie Avila made her way back to the temple, again with staggering special arrangements and assistance, to do the work for her beloved grandmother, who had literally given her life in the care of these three granddaughters. For twenty-two consecutive years, without reprieve or respite or exception, Sister Esperanza Lamelas cared for these three day and night. Virtually every night for twenty-two years, she awakened each hour on the hour to physically turn each child so that she would be comfortable in her sleep and avoid the problem of bedsores. In 1989, at age seventy-four, her own health now broken, she died, having given new meaning to the Prophet Joseph’s invitation to “waste and wear out our lives … do[ing] all things that lie in our power … [for the benefit of] the rising generation, and … all the pure in heart” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.13,17,11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 123:13, 17, 11</a>).</p>

Quiet, unsung Christian living. The work of the kingdom done with worn hands, weary hands, hands which in some cases cannot be raised to the square, but which are surely sustaining hands in every holy and sacred sense of the word.</p>

The Puritan revolutionaries had executed a king, and political life—including Parliament—was in total chaos. A typhus epidemic turned the whole island into a hospital. The great plague, followed by the great fire, would turn it into a morgue.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/miracles-of-the-restoration.p26" pid="rQr4XDh9HUiAFYetCjORkQ" hash="VG2lsA">In Leicestershire, near where Sister Holland and I lived and labored for three magnificent years, there is a very small church with a plaque on the wall which reads: “In the year of 1653, when all things sacred were … either demolished or profaned, Sir Robert Shirley, [built] this church; whose singular praise it is, To have done the best things in the worst times, and hoped them in the most calamitous.”</p>

Those are lines I would use to praise the prophets <span class="emphasis">and</span> the faithful members of the Church of Jesus Christ down through the years—legions of the quietly heroic in every decade of the dispensation, led by the Lord’s anointed, whose arms can also grow weary and whose legs are sometimes weak.</p>

I pledge to “take hold of that for which Christ once took hold of me” (New English Bible, <a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/3.12" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 3:12</a>).</p>

He is the Only Begotten Son of the living God, who has exalted that son’s name over every other, and has given him principality, power, might, and dominion at his right hand in the heavenly place. We esteem this Messiah to be holy, harmless, undefiled—the bearer of unchangeable priesthood (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/7.24,26" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 7:24, 26</a>). He is the anchor to our souls and our high priest of promise. He is our God of good things to come. In time and in eternity—and surely in striving to fulfill this new responsibility which has come to me—I shall forever be grateful for his promise: “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/13.5" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 13:5</a>). I thank him for that blessing upon us all, in his name, the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

It is impossible for me to express adequately my gratitude for the priesthood we bear, especially in such moments of the Church’s history as this general conference represents. In such days as these are, you and I see history firsthand, and, with arm raised to the square, we do in solemn assembly participate in the making of such history. As Oliver Cowdery once said of such restoration privileges, “These were days never to be forgotten” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.71" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:71</a>, footnote).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p2" pid="JrIB-ASz-EmJWnmMYTvvyw" hash="MJVrrQ">We miss President Howard W. Hunter at this conference, but we do find joy in knowing that he now sits with the noble and great ones of all eternity. And I with others in this conference bear personal witness, as a witness, of the divine calling of President Gordon B. Hinckley to this holy office and sacred assignment for which he has been so long and so well prepared. And by “preparation” we mean not only the many experiences which he has had in the Church from his youth, but also mean that doctrine Alma taught, that such a man is “called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God,” a calling predicated at least in part upon demonstrated “faith and good works” before President Hinckley ever came to this earth (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.1-3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 13:1–3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p3" pid="lNgMeCVSr0yTRtBDBEz8tg" hash="_zluUA">I include in that testimony, and expression of love, my appreciation for the callings that have newly come to President Thomas S. Monson, President James E. Faust, and President Boyd K. Packer as well. I welcome to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Elder Henry B. Eyring. I look forward to being his seatmate and companion for many years to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p4" pid="oKTxUZ12OkG8nCMp2Y9yHA" hash="naoOHQ">In this spirit of memorable moments in the ongoing destiny of the Church, I wish to speak rather directly to the young men gathered tonight, bearers of the Aaronic Priesthood. I wish to impress upon you some sense of history, something of what it has meant, something of what it may yet mean, to belong to the true and living church of God and hold the significant offices in its priesthood that you now hold and will yet hold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p5" pid="voWSk2hdL0mazLRoxBVOlA" hash="TkAAGQ">So much that we do in this Church is directed toward you, those whom the Book of Mormon calls “the rising generation” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26.1" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 26:1</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.49" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:49</a>). We who have already walked that portion of life’s path that you are now on try to call back to you something of what we have learned. We shout encouragement. We try to warn of pitfalls or perils along the way. Where possible we try to walk with you and keep you close to our side.</p>

Equally unfathomable is the fact that your parents were once young also, and so were your bishops and your quorum advisers. But as the years have gone by we have learned many lessons beyond those of youth—that, for example, Noah’s wife was <span class="emphasis">not</span> named Joan of Arc, and, so far as we know, Pontius Pilate flew no commercial aircraft of any kind. Why do you think we now try so hard and worry so much and want the very best for you? It is because we have been your age and you have never been ours, and we have learned some things you do not yet know.</p>

The gospel of Jesus Christ marks the only sure and safe path. So older men, seasoned men—men passing on to you the legacy of history—continue to call out to youth.</p>

It was in a stake priesthood meeting with a format very much like this one that the then twelve-year-old Gordon B. Hinckley stood in the back of the old Salt Lake Tenth Ward building—his first such stake priesthood meeting as a newly ordained deacon—feeling just a bit lonely and a little out of place.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p9" pid="HLhH23GzqU2bSvR5KQmyEA" hash="M0T0XA">But upon hearing the men of that stake sing W. W. Phelps’s stirring memorial tribute “Praise to the Man,” this young boy, who would one day be a prophet himself, had it borne upon his soul that Joseph Smith <span class="emphasis">was indeed</span> a prophet of God, that he had in truth “communed with Jehovah,” that “millions shall know ‘Brother Joseph’ again” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 27). Yes, some part of the preparation for this morning’s solemn assembly began when a twelve-year-old deacon heard faithful, experienced, older men sing the hymns of Zion in a priesthood meeting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p10" pid="INIyk4-h6EuLVi3-YepM7g" hash="D6Kx4w">Now very few twelve-year-olds will live to become the President of the Church, nor do we need to in order to prove our faithfulness. But let us never forget that “in every place a man now stands, a boy once used to be,” and all of you young men have the opportunity—and the responsibility—to be just as faithful in gaining a testimony and standing for the truth as did the men we have sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators down through the dispensations. Indeed, this is one of those things history calls out to us—that the future may be daunting, but you young men are more than equal to the task.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p11" pid="IpavgiYv6kyezcsSXgspnw" hash="eBjVFQ">The name Rudger Clawson will, unfortunately, be unfamiliar to many of you. For forty-five years Brother Clawson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and for twenty-two of those years served as the president of that quorum. But long before any of those responsibilities came to him, he had a chance to prove his faithfulness and demonstrate in his youth just how willing he was to defend his beliefs, even at the peril of his life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p12" pid="SuCbOyNmdEObedCGj_pxEA" hash="euVpzA">As a young man Brother Clawson had been called on a mission to the Southern States. At that time in America’s history, well over one hundred years ago, malicious mobs were still in existence, outlaws who threatened the safety of members of the Church and others. Elder Clawson and his missionary companion, Elder Joseph Standing, were traveling on foot to a missionary conference when, nearing their destination, they were suddenly confronted by twelve armed and angry men on horseback.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p13" pid="YoEXN9xykEaUZxGDNI-WMA" hash="Lhc8hQ">With cocked rifles and revolvers shoved in their faces, the two elders were repeatedly struck, and occasionally knocked to the ground as they were led away from their prescribed path and forced to walk deep into the nearby woods. Elder Joseph Standing, knowing what might lie in store for them, made a bold move and seized a pistol within his reach. Instantly one of the assailants turned his gun on young Standing and fired. Another mobber, pointing to Elder Clawson, said, “Shoot that man.” In response every weapon in the circle was turned on him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p14" pid="89w8wRSI9EeLjDmc0D81JQ" hash="ouubng">It seemed to this young elder that his fate was to be the same as that of his fallen brother. He said: “I … at once realized there was no avenue of escape. My time had come. … My turn to follow Joseph Standing was at hand.” He folded his arms, looked his assailants in the face, and said, “Shoot.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p15" pid="L-pmWiTQeEyS8ghUmFe6Ug" hash="Wdyr8Q">Whether stunned by this young elder’s courage or now fearfully aware of what they had already done to his companion, we cannot know, but someone in that fateful moment shouted, “Don’t shoot,” and one by one the guns were lowered. Terribly shaken but driven by loyalty to his missionary companion, Elder Clawson continued to defy the mob. Never certain that he might not yet be shot, young Rudger, often working and walking with his back to the mob, was able to carry the body of his slain companion to a safe haven where he performed the last act of kindness for his fallen friend. There he gently washed the bloody stains from the missionary’s body and prepared it for the long train ride home (in David S. Hoopes and Roy Hoopes, <span class="emphasis">The Making of a Mormon Apostle: The Story of Rudger Clawson,</span> New York: Madison Books, 1990, pp. 23–31).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p16" pid="I2ZgL6akvUO8FwOQZ9Whtg" hash="zswXUQ">I tell that story with some concern, hoping no one will dwell on the death of a young missionary or think gospel living brought only trials or tragedies in those early years. But I do share it for an ever younger and ever newer generation in the Church who may not know the gifts earlier men and women—including young men and women—have given us in what our new film states simply in another single word—<span class="emphasis">Legacy.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p17" pid="ogr_-PEhkk2GXgxw3tACLA" hash="eOox2Q">Fortunately we do not, for the most part, face any such physical threats now. No, for the most part, our courage will be more quiet, less dramatic, but in every way as crucial and as demanding. May I use one example drawn from contemporary history, an example demonstrating faith and loyalty more like that which you and I will be called upon to exhibit. In doing so I pay tribute to faithful fathers who serve as the standard of strength for their growing and less-experienced sons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p18" pid="JtUlVhXJV0q7jXn__gGD8w" hash="YOC7HA">Some years ago, long after he had returned from his mission, Bishop J. Richard Yates, of the Durham Third Ward in the Durham North Carolina Stake, was out on the family farm in Idaho, helping his father milk the cows and do some of the evening chores. Because of limited family circumstances, Richard’s father, Brother Tom Yates, had not been able to go on a mission in his youth. But that disappointment only strengthened Brother Yates’s vow that what he had not been able to afford, his sons would certainly realize—a full-time mission for the Lord—whatever the sacrifice involved.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p19" pid="BcroX70D5kySmjsDwmWnKQ" hash="lSi1aQ">In those days in rural Idaho it was customary to give a young man a heifer calf as soon as he was old enough to take care of it. The idea was that the young man would raise the animal, keep some of the offspring, and sell others to help pay for the feed. Fathers wisely understood that this was a way to teach their sons responsibility as they earned money for their missions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p20" pid="_mZ2fPKwVkKwRzc_bPxgVQ" hash="J9uHXQ">Young Richard did well with that gift of a first calf and, over time, expanded the herd to eight. Along the way he invested some of the income from the milk he sold to buy a litter of pigs. He had nearly sixty of those when his call finally arrived. It was the family’s plan that they would sell future litters of the pigs to supplement income from the sale of the dairy milk to cover the costs of Richard’s missionary labors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p21" pid="gOZWF3yMzE-UTe4ivjsmzg" hash="1j9Y2A">That evening out in the barn long after a wonderful twenty-four months was safely concluded, this young man heard something of which he had known absolutely nothing while on his mission. His father said that sometime within the first month after Richard had left, the local veterinarian, a close family friend and tireless worker in that farming community, had come to vaccinate the pigs against a local threat of cholera. But in an unfortunate professional error, the vet gave the animals the live vaccine but failed to give adequate antiserum. The results were that the entire herd of pigs came down with the disease; within a few weeks most of the animals were dead, and the remaining few had to be destroyed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p22" pid="bo_8w289O0KFUVUbeFf6iQ" hash="i92E6A">With the pigs dead, obviously milk sales would not be enough to keep Richard on his mission, so his father planned to sell one by one the family’s dairy herd to cover the costs. But beginning with the second month and virtually every month for twenty-three thereafter, as his parents prepared to send him the money for his mission, either one of their cows suddenly died or else one of his did. Thus the herd decreased at twice the rate they expected. It seemed an unbelievable stretch of misfortune.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p23" pid="zjS3Na3tEkqhzjjIpehL_Q" hash="tkBRwg">During that difficult time a large note became due at the local bank. With all else that had happened and the inordinate financial problems they were facing, Brother Yates simply did not have the money to repay it. There was every likelihood they would now lose their entire farm. After much prayer and concern, but with never a word to their missionary son, Brother Yates went to face the president of the bank, a man not of our faith who was perceived in the community to be somewhat stern and quite aloof.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p24" pid="52dhqb2ia0OsJ5uSwgJKaQ" hash="rSbfqg">After he had heard the explanation of this considerable misfortune, the banker sat for a moment, looking into the face of a man who, in his own quiet and humble way, was standing up to trouble and opposition and fear as faithfully as had Rudger Clawson and Joseph Standing. In that situation I suppose Brother Yates could not say much more to his banker than “Shoot.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p25" pid="sHKwXAZm4k6gcIxKhCOmGQ" hash="C_R7lQ">Quietly the bank president leaned forward and asked just one question. “Tom,” he said, “are you paying your tithing?” Not at all certain as to how the answer would be received, Brother Yates answered softly but without hesitation, “Yes, sir, I am.” The banker then said, “You keep paying your tithing, and you keep your son on his mission. I’ll take care of the note. I know you will repay me when you can.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p26" pid="NmAhGZop4Ee7sjAt37ml-g" hash="dMDkRw">No paperwork or signatures were exchanged. No threats or warnings were uttered. Two good and honorable men simply stood and shook hands. An agreement had been made and that agreement was kept.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p27" pid="ICS0eimLZEaXJ16m6hp40w" hash="faNZQQ">Bishop Yates says he remembers hearing this heretofore unknown story with considerable emotion that evening, asking his father—the note to the bank long since repaid—if all that worry and fear and sacrifice had been worth it just to try to live the gospel and keep a son on a mission. “Yes, Son,” he said, “it was worth all of that and a lot more if the Lord ever asks it of me,” and he continued with his evening chores.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p28" pid="6ECyR0G4FkONs6K1RGxXmg" hash="DZE6fw">Physically, Tom Yates was a slight man—under five feet eight inches in height and weighing less than 150 pounds. His body was stunted somewhat from a near-fatal case of polio contracted in his infancy. But Richard says he does not ever remember thinking of his father’s physical stature, one way or the other. To this son he was simply a spiritual giant, always larger than life, leaving his children a legacy of devotion and courage longer than all eternity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/our-priesthood-legacy.p29" pid="jhAEkvVudEqtCaq66Qp5lg" hash="A-ClDA">To such fathers of our families and fathers of our faith, to those who have lived lives of integrity whatever the cost, to generations in this and every dispensation who’ve faced fear and trials and yes, death unflinchingly, I express gratitude from the bottom of my heart. I commend you young men for what must be your determination to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. I shoulder with you the responsibility placed on each one of us who bears the priesthood of God. I plead for each of us to remember that in the work of the Lord we must often turn our cheek but we must never turn our coat. I pledge with you my own determination to be true and faithful to the Lord Jesus Christ whose church this is, even as I praise with you that legacy of loyalty given to us by those who have gone before, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

It would be the crowning moment of eternity, the most miraculous of all the miracles. It would be the supreme contribution to a plan designed from before the foundation of the world for the happiness of every man, woman, and child who would ever live in it. The hour of atoning sacrifice had come. God’s own Son, his Only Begotten Son in the flesh, was about to become the Savior of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/this-do-in-remembrance-of-me.p2" pid="AGFWZoJ18UGFT6_k6CLmMg" hash="jdwrcw">The setting was Jerusalem. The season was that of the Passover, a celebration rich in symbolism for what was about to come. Long ago the troubled and enslaved Israelites had been “passed over,” spared, finally made free by the blood of a lamb sprinkled on the lintel and doorposts of their Egyptian homes (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/12.21-24" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 12:21–24</a>). That, in turn, had been only a symbolic reiteration of what Adam and all succeeding prophets were taught from the beginning—that the pure and unblemished lambs offered from the firstlings of Israel’s flocks were a similitude, a token, a prefiguration of the great and last sacrifice of Christ which was to come (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.5-8" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:5–8</a>).</p>

On this night when Jesus’ mortal ministry was concluding, the declaration made by John the Baptist when that ministry had begun now meant more than ever—“Behold the Lamb of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.29" class="scriptureRef">John 1:29</a>).</p>

In a similar manner he took the cup of wine, traditionally diluted with water, said a blessing of thanks for it, and passed it to those gathered about him, saying: “This cup is the new testament in my blood,” “which is shed … for the remission of sins.” “This do in remembrance of me.” “For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.20" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:20</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.19" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.26" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 11:26</a>).</p>

Of course the time of that resurrection and the degree of exaltation it leads to are based upon our faithfulness.</p>

There he said, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.38" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:38</a>). He was in agony and “prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.44" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:44</a>).</p>

Furthermore, Christ suffered for the sins and sorrows and pains of all the rest of the human family, providing remission for all of our sins as well, upon conditions of obedience to the principles and ordinances of the gospel he taught (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.21-23" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:21–23</a>). As the Apostle Paul wrote, we were “bought with a price” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/6.20" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 6:20</a>). What an expensive price and what a merciful purchase!</p>

It comes in what has been called “the <span class="emphasis">most</span><span class="emphasis">sacred,</span> the <span class="emphasis">most holy,</span> of all the meetings of the Church” (Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class="emphasis">Doctrines of Salvation,</span> comp.

It should be a powerful, reverent, reflective moment. It should encourage spiritual feelings and impressions. As such it should not be rushed. It is not something to “get over” so that the real purpose of a sacrament meeting can be pursued. This <span class="emphasis">is</span> the real purpose of the meeting. And everything that is said or sung or prayed in those services should be consistent with the grandeur of this sacred ordinance.</p>

For sacred ordinances in the Church we often use ceremonial clothing, and a white shirt could be seen as a gentle reminder of the white clothing you wore in the baptismal font and an anticipation of the white shirt you will soon wear into the temple and onto your missions.</p>

We do not want deacons or priests in uniforms or unduly concerned about anything but the purity of their lives. But how our young people dress can teach a holy principle to us all, and it certainly can convey sanctity. As President David O. McKay taught, a white shirt contributes to the sacredness of the holy sacrament (see Conference Report, Oct. 1956, p. 89).</p>

The drought that ensued and the famine that followed affected Elijah himself as well as untold others in the process.</p>

And ere long the brook Cherith, near which he hid and from which he drank, ran dry. And so it went for three years.</p>

Perhaps almost apologetically the thirsty traveler importuned, “Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.” As she turned to meet his request, Elijah added even more strain to the supplication. “Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand [also].”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-handful-of-meal-and-a-little-oil.p6" pid="WQ2ZWs4JOkiwvzHs8dlVgA" hash="YwaZGA">Elijah’s pitiful circumstances were obvious. Furthermore, the widow had been prepared by the Lord for this request. But in her own weakened and dispirited condition, the prophet’s last entreaty was more than this faithful little woman could bear. In her hunger and fatigue and motherly anguish she cried out to the stranger, “As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks [which tells us how small her fire needed to be], that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.”</p>

Israel’s future—including the future of this very widow and her son—was at stake. His prophetic duty made him more bold than he might normally have wanted to be.</p>

The record says simply, “And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah.” Perhaps uncertain what the cost of her faith would be not only to herself but to her son as well, she first took her small loaf to Elijah, obviously trusting that if there were not enough bread left over, at least she and her son would have died in an act of pure charity. The story goes on, of course, to a very happy ending for her and for her son.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

They were cast out, the revelation says, simply because of their poverty. In a penetrating scriptural line that forever speaks to the real plight and true pain of the impoverished, the Book of Mormon says, “They were poor as to things of the world; <span class="emphasis">and also they were poor in heart.</span>” Indeed they were “poor in heart, <span class="emphasis">because of their poverty as to the things of the world.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

Teaching that Christ’s gift would be “infinite and eternal,” an offering to every man, woman, and child who would ever live in this world, he also bore witness of the mercy of such a gift. He listed all the ways and all the places in which people should pray for that atoning mercy, “for your welfare,” he said, “and also for the welfare of those who are around you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-handful-of-meal-and-a-little-oil.p16" pid="pIqniqxv20KtP7fUDDE8XQ" hash="mb3E6A">But this masterful discourse on the Atonement is not finished. With great directness Amulek says of these fervent prayers, “Do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have [it], to those who stand in need—I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> If this is the message to those who had so little, what must it mean for us?</p>

After teaching the people of Zarahemla of the Fall of Adam and the Atonement of Jesus Christ, Benjamin saw his congregation literally fall to the ground, viewing themselves in a state of great need, viewing themselves, he said, as less than the dust of the earth. (The difference between this response and that of the Rameumptom set goes without saying.)</p>

I do not know whether a full implementation of such a society can be realized until Christ comes, but I know that when He did come to the Nephites, His majestic teachings and ennobling spirit led to the happiest of all times, a time in which “there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another. And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> That blessed circumstance was, I suppose, achieved on only one other occasion of which we know—the city of Enoch, where “they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

He knew that the real task was in being more Christlike—caring the way the Savior cared, loving the way he loved, “every man seeking the interest of his neighbor,” the scripture says, “and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

I know that some of you are struggling to make ends meet in your own lives and still you find something to share. As King Benjamin cautioned his people, it is not intended that we run faster than we have strength and all things should be done in order.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> I love you and your Heavenly Father loves you for all you are trying to do.</p>

And I know we can each do something, however small that act may seem to be. We can pay an honest tithe and give our fast and free-will offerings, according to our circumstances. And we can watch for other ways to help. To worthy causes and needy people, we can give time if we don’t have money, and we can give love when our time runs out. We can share the loaves we have and trust God that the cruse of oil will not fail.</p>

Said the Prophet Joseph in that blessed time: “Respecting how much a man … shall give … we have no special instructions … ; he is to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to provide for the widow, to dry up the tear of the orphan, to comfort the afflicted, whether in this church, or in any other, or in no church at all, wherever he finds them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

It is difficult enough to be poor in material goods, but the greater pain is in the heavy heart, the dwindling hope, the damaged dreams, the parental anguish, the childhood disappointment that almost always attend such circumstances.</p>

May I conclude with another. Amidst the terrible hostilities in Missouri that would put the Prophet in Liberty Jail and see thousands of Latter-day Saints driven from their homes, Sister Drusilla Hendricks and her invalid husband, James, who had been shot by enemies of the Church in the Battle of Crooked River, arrived with their children at a hastily shaped dugout in Quincy, Illinois, to live out the spring of that harrowing year.</p>

In the great tradition of LDS women, Drusilla made mush out of it for James and the children, thus stretching its contents as far as she could make it go. When that small offering was consumed by her famished family, she washed everything, cleaned their little dugout as thoroughly as she could, and quietly waited to die.</p>

It was their neighbor Reuben Allred. He said he had a feeling they were out of food, so on his way into town he’d had a sack of grain ground into meal for them.</p>

He told Drusilla that he’d been extremely busy but the Spirit had whispered to him that “Brother Hendricks’ family is suffering, so I dropped everything and came [running].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

May he bless us to hear the often silent cries of the sorrowing and the afflicted, the downtrodden, the disadvantaged, the poor. Indeed may he bless us to hear the whispering of the Holy Spirit when any neighbor anywhere “is suffering,” and to “drop everything and come running.” I pray in the name of the captain of the poor, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We have been blessed with earnest prayers, magnificent music, and truly inspired teachings. In just a few minutes we will hear concluding counsel from our prophet and President of the Church, President Gordon B. Hinckley. A general conference of this Church is a remarkable occasion indeed—it is an institutional declaration that the heavens are open, that divine guidance is as real today as it was for the ancient house of Israel, that God our Heavenly Father loves us and speaks His will through a living prophet.</p>

These are among the ultimate blessings that the gospel of Jesus Christ brings a troubled world and the troubled people who live in it, solutions to personal struggles and human sinfulness, a source of strength for days of weariness and hours of genuine despair. This entire general conference and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which convenes it declare that it is the Only Begotten Son of God Himself who gives us this help and this hope. Such assurance is as “firm as the mountains around us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> As the Book of Mormon prophet Abinadi made clear in a slight variation of Isaiah’s exclamation:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p7" pid="lqjfOCTyO0CxGhbBimz2bw" hash="-L0AUg">“O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that <span class="emphasis">is the founder of peace,</span> yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

And it is His merciful promise of “peace in this world,” His good tidings of “eternal life in the world to come”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> that make us fall at His feet and call His name blessed and give thanks for the restoration of His true and living Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p9" pid="zLbHubNzLESHdaUfimiXNA" hash="x_uIPw">The search for peace is one of the ultimate quests of the human soul. We all have highs and lows, but such times come and they usually always go. Kind neighbors assist. Beautiful sunshine brings encouragement. A good night’s sleep usually works wonders. But there are times in all of our lives when deep sorrow or suffering or fear or loneliness makes us cry out for the peace which only God Himself can bring. These are times of piercing spiritual hunger when even the dearest friends cannot fully come to our aid.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p10" pid="Ecg8PG_kvECmzDtAqsr3-A" hash="ydT3vA">Perhaps you know people in the broad congregation of this conference, or in your local ward or stake—or in your own home—courageous people who are carrying heavy burdens and feeling private pain, who are walking through the dark valleys of this world’s tribulation. Some may be desperately worried about a husband or a wife or a child, worried about their health or their happiness or their faithfulness in keeping the commandments. Some are living with physical pain, or emotional pain, or disabilities that come with age. Some are troubled as to how to make ends meet financially, and some ache with the private loneliness of an empty house or an empty room or simply empty arms.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p11" pid="oSr8x7Vkl06jAAMePwt_pg" hash="Mf027Q">These beloved people seek the Lord and His word with particular urgency, often revealing their true emotions only when the scriptures are opened or when the hymns are sung or when the prayers are offered. Sometimes only then do the rest of us realize they feel near the end of their strength—they are tired in brain and body and heart, they wonder if they can get through another week or another day or sometimes just another hour. They are desperate for the Lord’s help and they know that in such times of extremity nothing else will do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p12" pid="-81YH4WkL0-Fi5DRJ-Brfg" hash="t7fUUg">Well, at least one of the purposes of general conference and the teachings of the prophets down through the ages is to declare to these very people that the Lord is equally fervent in trying to reach them, that when there is trouble His hopes and His striving and His efforts greatly exceed our own and it never ceases.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p13" pid="RM_eDwzvpEy_G18yqFHNgg" hash="iGfg4A">We have been promised, “He that keepeth [us] will not slumber, … nor [will he] sleep.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

They wish all to know that “if God be for us, who can be against us?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> In the world we shall have tribulation, but we are to be of good cheer. Christ has overcome the world.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Through His suffering and His obedience He has earned and rightly bears the crown of “Prince of Peace.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p15" pid="bbru-QSAqEO1jCh8AaJ1Iw" hash="sr-Bhg">In that spirit we declare to all the world that for real and abiding peace to come, we must strive to be more like that exemplary Son of God. Many among us are trying to do that. We salute you for your obedience, your forbearance, your waiting faithfully upon the Lord for the strength you seek which will surely come. Some of us, on the other hand, need to make some changes, need to make greater effort in gospel living. And change we can. The very beauty of the word <span class="emphasis">repentance</span> is the promise of escaping old problems and old habits and old sorrows and old sins. It is among the most hopeful and encouraging—and yes, most peaceful—words in the gospel vocabulary. In seeking true peace some of us need to improve what has to be improved, confess what needs to be confessed, forgive what has to be forgiven, and forget what should be forgotten in order that serenity can come to us. If there is a commandment we are breaking, and as a result it is breaking us and hurting those who love us, let us call down the power of the Lord Jesus Christ to help us, to free us, to lead us through repentance to that peace “which passeth all understanding.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p16" pid="NDfezFQJAE2uR73jqoaeKA" hash="RpI4tw">And when God has forgiven us, which He is so eternally anxious to do, may we have the good sense to walk away from those problems, to leave them alone, to let the past bury the past. If one of you has made a mistake, even a serious mistake, but you have done all you can according to the teachings of the Lord and the governance of the Church to confess it and feel sorrow for it and set it as right as can be, then trust in God, walk into His light, and leave those ashes behind you. Someone once said that repentance is the first pressure we feel when drawn to the bosom of God. For real peace may I recommend an immediate rush to the bosom of God, leaving behind you all that would bring sorrow to your soul or heartache to those who love you. “Depart from evil,” the scripture says, “and do good.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p17" pid="47vd6Hn8702t_6by0_znMQ" hash="ts6qcg">Closely related to our own obligation to repent is the generosity of letting others do the same—we are to forgive even as we are forgiven. In this we participate in the very essence of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Surely the most majestic moment of that fateful Friday, when nature convulsed and the veil of the temple was rent, was that unspeakably merciful moment when Christ said, “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> As our advocate with the Father, He is still making that same plea today—in your behalf and in mine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p18" pid="P7TMpk_XnUKHzeF2ZaFGSQ" hash="pX_f_g">Here, as in all things, Jesus set the standard for us to follow. Life is too short to be spent nursing animosities or keeping a box score of offenses against us—you know, no runs, no hits, all errors. We don’t want God to remember our sins, so there is something fundamentally wrong in our relentlessly trying to remember those of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p19" pid="Nxrouwo8YkG9CnSytybixw" hash="KDZ4fQ">When we have been hurt, undoubtedly God takes into account what wrongs were done to us and what provocations there are for our resentments, but clearly the more provocation there is and the more excuse we can find for our hurt, all the more reason for us to forgive and be delivered from the destructive hell of such poisonous venom and anger.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> It is one of those ironies of godhood that in order to find peace, the offended as well as the offender must engage the principle of forgiveness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p20" pid="oLkhzXSY8kqprpG5y2aR9w" hash="FauaPQ">Yes, peace is a very precious commodity, a truly heartfelt need, and there are many things we can do to achieve it. But—for whatever reason—life has its moments when uninterrupted peace may seem to elude us for a season. We may wonder why there are such times in life, particularly when we may be trying harder than we have ever tried to live worthy of God’s blessings and obtain His help. When problems or sorrows or sadness come and they <span class="emphasis">don’t</span> seem to be our fault, what are we to make of their unwelcome appearance?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p21" pid="x_VnbVM__kGypSx1j7SXwQ" hash="1M6aTg">With time and perspective we recognize that such problems in life do come for a purpose, if only to allow the one who faces such despair to be convinced that he really does need divine strength beyond himself, that she really does need the offer of heaven’s hand. Those who feel no need for mercy usually never seek it and almost never bestow it. Those who have never had a heartache or a weakness or felt lonely or forsaken never have had to cry unto heaven for relief of such personal pain. Surely it is better to find the goodness of God and the grace of Christ, even at the price of despair, than to risk living our lives in a moral or material complacency that has never felt any need for faith or forgiveness, any need for redemption or relief.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-peaceable-things-of-the-kingdom.p22" pid="k9hnii50v0S69WPshvWV6Q" hash="LW6qYA">A life without problems or limitations or challenges—life without “opposition in all things,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> as Lehi phrased it—would paradoxically but in very fact be less rewarding and less ennobling than one which confronts—even frequently confronts—difficulty and disappointment and sorrow. As beloved Eve said, were it not for the difficulties faced in a fallen world, neither she nor Adam nor any of the rest of us ever would have known “the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

In a time of terrible civil warfare, one of the most gifted leaders ever to strive to hold a nation together said what could be said of marriages and families and friendships. Praying for peace, pleading for peace, seeking peace in any way that would not compromise union, Abraham Lincoln said in those dark, dark days of his First Inaugural, “Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory,” he said, “will yet swell … when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>

That is much of what the Church and general conference and the gospel of Jesus Christ are about. The appeal today and tomorrow and forever to be better, to be cleaner, to be kinder, to be holier; to seek peace and always be believing.</p>

To the women within the sound of my voice who dearly want to be mothers and are not, I say through your tears and ours on that subject, God will yet, in days that lie somewhere ahead, bring “hope to [the] desolate heart.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> As prophets have repeatedly taught from this pulpit, ultimately “no blessing shall be withheld” from the faithful, even if those blessings do not come immediately.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> In the meantime we rejoice that the call to nurture is not limited to our own flesh and blood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p6" pid="TR5R1pgO40aWgvhaf1VTzQ" hash="AjVfwg">In speaking of mothers I do not neglect the crucial, urgent role of fathers, particularly as fatherlessness in contemporary homes is considered by some to be “the central social problem of our time.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Indeed, fatherlessness can be a problem even in a home where the father is present—eating and sleeping, so to speak, “by remote.” But that is a priesthood message for another day. Today I wish to praise those motherly hands that have rocked the infant’s cradle and, through the righteousness taught to their children there, are at the very center of the Lord’s purposes for us in mortality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p7" pid="zP_3W9egW0iPfpniIP7WGw" hash="Dhsi2A">In so speaking I echo Paul, who wrote in praise of Timothy’s “unfeigned faith … , which dwelt first,” he said, “in thy grandmother Lois, and [in] thy mother Eunice.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> “From [the days when thou wert] a child,” Paul said, “thou hast known the holy scriptures.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> We give thanks for all the mothers and grandmothers from whom such truths have been learned at such early ages.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p8" pid="3dqpBBDPL0CAC22-va3IKQ" hash="wyWe8g">In speaking of mothers generally, I especially wish to praise and encourage <span class="emphasis">young</span> mothers. The work of a mother is hard, too often unheralded work. The young years are often those when either husband or wife—or both—may still be in school or in those earliest and leanest stages of developing the husband’s breadwinning capacities. Finances fluctuate daily between low and nonexistent. The apartment is usually decorated in one of two smart designs—Deseret Industries provincial or early Mother Hubbard. The car, if there is one, runs on smooth tires and an empty tank. But with night feedings and night teethings, often the greatest challenge of all for a young mother is simply fatigue. Through these years, mothers go longer on less sleep and give more to others with less personal renewal for themselves than any other group I know at any other time in life. It is not surprising when the shadows under their eyes sometimes vaguely resemble the state of Rhode Island.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p9" pid="KZMhGRNQf0W18B85wUoV3Q" hash="n6ZnpQ">Of course the irony is that this is often the sister we want to call—or need to call—to service in the ward and stake auxiliaries. That’s understandable. Who wouldn’t want the exemplary influence of these young Loises- and Eunices-in-the-making? Everyone, be wise. Remember that families are the highest priority of all, especially in those formative years. Even so, young mothers will still find magnificent ways to serve faithfully in the Church, even as others serve and strengthen them and their families in like manner.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p10" pid="XLWpfFiga0et6GFAJfyWKA" hash="6LNnNQ">Do the best you can through these years, but whatever else you do, cherish that role that is so uniquely yours and for which heaven itself sends angels to watch over you and your little ones. Husbands—especially husbands—as well as Church leaders and friends in every direction, be helpful and sensitive and wise. Remember, “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p11" pid="x_PjOn9DaUi5uu-KwtA4fw" hash="pC0NgA">Mothers, we acknowledge and esteem your faith in every footstep. Please know that it is worth it then, now, and forever. And if, for whatever reason, you are making this courageous effort alone, without your husband at your side, then our prayers will be all the greater for you, and our determination to lend a helping hand even more resolute.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p12" pid="BMJz9QYvp0WmunxnUNjzBQ" hash="woGobw">One young mother wrote to me recently that her anxiety tended to come on three fronts. One was that whenever she heard talks on LDS motherhood, she worried because she felt she didn’t measure up or somehow wasn’t going to be equal to the task. Secondly, she felt like the world expected her to teach her children reading, writing, interior design, Latin, calculus, and the Internet—all before the baby said something terribly ordinary, like “goo goo.” Thirdly, she often felt people were sometimes patronizing, almost always without meaning to be, because the advice she got or even the compliments she received seemed to reflect nothing of the mental investment, the spiritual and emotional exertion, the long-night, long-day, stretched-to-the-limit demands that sometimes are required in trying to be and wanting to be the mother God hopes she will be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p13" pid="Xye7MGhXQUWzZtR_Jtl-SQ" hash="a6RtfQ">But one thing, she said, keeps her going: “Through the thick and the thin of this, and through the occasional tears of it all, <span class="emphasis">I know deep down inside I am doing God’s work.</span> I know that in my motherhood I am in an eternal partnership with Him. I am deeply moved that God finds His ultimate purpose and meaning in being a parent, even if some of His children make Him weep.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p14" pid="2M98lez34E6koBfmcdNWAQ" hash="OweIew">“It is this realization,” she says, “that I try to recall on those inevitably difficult days when all of this can be a bit overwhelming. Maybe it is precisely our inability and anxiousness that urge us to reach out to Him and enhance His ability to reach back to us. Maybe He secretly hopes we <span class="emphasis">will</span> be anxious,” she said, “and <span class="emphasis">will</span> plead for His help. Then, I believe, He can teach these children directly, through us, but with no resistance offered. I like that idea,” she concludes. “It gives me hope. If I can be right before my Father in Heaven, perhaps His guidance to our children can be unimpeded. Maybe then it can be <span class="emphasis">His</span> work and <span class="emphasis">His</span> glory in a very literal sense.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p15" pid="BmD7sKxRYUid5LtpnIvC4g" hash="HWwW3w">In light of that kind of expression, it is clear that some of those Rhode Island–sized shadows come not just from diapers and carpooling but from at least a few sleepless nights spent searching the soul, seeking earnestly for the capacity to raise these children to be what God wants them to be. Moved by that kind of devotion and determination, may I say to mothers collectively, in the name of the Lord, you are magnificent. You are doing terrifically well. The very fact that you have been given such a responsibility is everlasting evidence of the trust your Father in Heaven has in you. He knows that your giving birth to a child does not immediately propel you into the circle of the omniscient. If you and your husband will strive to love God and live the gospel yourselves; if you will plead for that guidance and comfort of the Holy Spirit promised to the faithful; if you will go to the temple to both make and claim the promises of the most sacred covenants a woman or man can make in this world; if you will show others, including your children, the same caring, compassionate, forgiving heart you want heaven to show you; if you try your best to be the best parent you can be, you will have done all that a human being can do and all that God expects you to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p16" pid="1TmWFwbprkOpZcw2kAsJ5w" hash="VfhIbg">Sometimes the decision of a child or a grandchild will break your heart. Sometimes expectations won’t immediately be met. Every mother and father worries about that. Even that beloved and wonderfully successful parent President Joseph F. Smith pled, “Oh! God, let me not lose my own.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> That is every parent’s cry, and in it is something of every parent’s fear. But no one has failed who keeps trying and keeps praying. You have every right to receive encouragement and to know in the end your children will call your name blessed, just like those generations of foremothers before you who hoped your same hopes and felt your same fears.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p17" pid="dRGeK7if6UqoQswRwVpRbQ" hash="PuTmPA">Yours is the grand tradition of Eve, the mother of all the human family, the one who understood that she and Adam <span class="emphasis">had</span> to fall in order that “men [and women] might be”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> and that there would be joy. Yours is the grand tradition of Sarah and Rebekah and Rachel, without whom there could not have been those magnificent patriarchal promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob which bless us all. Yours is the grand tradition of Lois and Eunice and the mothers of the 2,000 stripling warriors. Yours is the grand tradition of Mary, chosen and foreordained from before this world was, to conceive, carry, and bear the Son of God Himself. We thank all of you, including our own mothers, and tell you there is nothing more important in this world than participating so directly in the work and glory of God, in bringing to pass the mortality and earthly life of His daughters and sons, so that immortality and eternal life can come in those celestial realms on high.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p18" pid="UjMtboEvsEiosyQx-oUScQ" hash="j7Okpg">When you have come to the Lord in meekness and lowliness of heart and, as one mother said, “pounded on the doors of heaven to ask for, to plead for, to demand guidance and wisdom and help for this wondrous task,” that door is thrown open to provide you the influence and the help of all eternity. Claim the promises of the Savior of the world. Ask for the healing balm of the Atonement for whatever may be troubling you or your children. Know that in faith things will be made right in spite of you, or more correctly, because of you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p19" pid="XrEmxZWIbUW44aO5QiCErQ" hash="2iciWg">You can’t possibly do this alone, but you <span class="emphasis">do</span> have help. The Master of Heaven and Earth is there to bless you—He who resolutely goes after the lost sheep, sweeps thoroughly to find the lost coin, waits everlastingly for the return of the prodigal son. Yours is the work of salvation, and therefore you will be magnified, compensated, made more than you are and better than you have ever been as you try to make honest effort, however feeble you may sometimes feel that to be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/because-she-is-a-mother.p20" pid="FlpVD9-nsEe8h_34Q5y_vw" hash="rUI93A">Remember, remember all the days of your motherhood: “Ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

And “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> You are doing God’s work. You are doing it wonderfully well. He is blessing you and He will bless you, even—no, <span class="emphasis">especially</span>—when your days and your nights may be the most challenging. Like the woman who anonymously, meekly, perhaps even with hesitation and some embarrassment, fought her way through the crowd just to touch the hem of the Master’s garment, so Christ will say to the women who worry and wonder and sometimes weep over their responsibility as mothers, “Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> And it will make your children whole as well.</p>

The author was suggesting that the souls of men and women were dying, so to speak, from lack of spiritual nourishment in our time. That phrase, “metaphysical hunger,” came back to me last month when I read the many richly deserved tributes paid to Mother Teresa of Calcutta. One correspondent recalled her saying that as severe and wrenching as physical hunger was in our day—something she spent virtually her entire life trying to alleviate—nevertheless, she believed that the absence of spiritual strength, the paucity of spiritual nutrition, was an even more terrible hunger in the modern world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/he-hath-filled-the-hungry-with-good-things.p2" pid="2NqOO1odKEq2KaoVlM01Aw" hash="L_jWqw">These observations reminded me of the chilling prophecy from the prophet Amos, who said so long ago, “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/he-hath-filled-the-hungry-with-good-things.p3" pid="IQHwjrApXEG2tLwpFWIQaQ" hash="5B1MTg">As the world slouches toward the 21st century, many long for something, sometimes cry out for something, but too often scarcely know for what. The economic condition in the world, speaking generally and certainly not specifically, is probably better than it has ever been in history, but the human heart is still anxious and often filled with great stress. We live in an “information age” that has a world of data available literally at our fingertips, yet the meaning of that information and the satisfaction of using knowledge in some moral context seems farther away for many than ever before.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/he-hath-filled-the-hungry-with-good-things.p4" pid="B5zNyO3fvUWTZgbk12SkDQ" hash="5sZ1gw">The price for building on such sandy foundations is high. Too many lives are buckling when the storms come and the winds blow.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> In almost every direction, we see those who are dissatisfied with present luxuries because of a gnawing fear that others somewhere have more of them. In a world desperately in need of moral leadership, too often we see what Paul called “spiritual wickedness in high places.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> In an absolutely terrifying way, we see legions who say they are bored with their spouses, their children, and any sense of marital or parental responsibility toward them. Still others, roaring full speed down the dead-end road of hedonism, shout that they will indeed live by bread alone, and the more of it the better. We have it on good word, indeed we have it from the Word Himself, that bread alone—even a lot of it—is not enough.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

That food, important as it was, was incidental to the real nourishment He was trying to give them.</p>

It is that in our contemporary success and sophistication we too may walk away from the vitally crucial bread of eternal life; we may actually <span class="emphasis">choose</span> to be spiritually malnourished, willfully indulging in a kind of spiritual anorexia. Like those childish Galileans of old, we may turn up our noses when divine sustenance is placed before us. Of course the tragedy then as now is that one day, as the Lord Himself has said, “In an hour when ye think not the summer shall be past, and the harvest ended,” and we will find that our “souls [are] not saved.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

I have wondered if any have joined our conference hoping to find the answer to a deeply personal problem or to have some light cast on the most serious questions of their heart. Such problems or questions often deal with our marriages, our families, our friends, our health, our peace—or the conspicuous lack of such cherished possessions.</p>

Wherever you live, and at whatever point in age or experience you find yourself, I declare that God has through His Only Begotten Son lifted the famine of which Amos spoke. I testify that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Bread of Life and a Well of Living Water springing up unto eternal life. I declare to those who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and especially to those who are not, that our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Firstborn Son did appear to the boy prophet Joseph Smith and restored light and life, hope and direction to a wandering world, a world filled with those who wonder, “Where is hope? Where is peace? What path should I follow? Which way should I go?”</p>

One element is the question put to every one of us on this earth: “What seek ye? What do you want?” The second is His response to our answer, <span class="emphasis">whatever that answer is.</span> Whoever we are and whatever we reply, His response is <span class="emphasis">always</span> the same: “Come,” He says lovingly. “Come, follow me.” Wherever you are going, first come and see what I do, see where and how I spend my time. Learn of me, walk with me, talk with me, believe. Listen to me pray. In turn you will find answers to your own prayers. God will bring rest to your souls. Come, follow me.</p>

Only He who was so mortally wounded knows how to heal our modern wounds. Only One who was with God, and was God,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> can answer the deepest and most urgent questions of our soul. Only His almighty arms could have thrown open the prison gates of death that otherwise would have held us in bondage forever. Only on His triumphant shoulders can we ride to celestial glory—if we will but choose through our faithfulness to do so.</p>

Mercy, with its sister virtue forgiveness, is at the very heart of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the eternal plan of salvation. Everything in the gospel teaches us that we can change if we need to, that we can be helped if we truly want it, that we can be made whole, whatever the problems of the past.</p>

No, at least one aspect of the Church is more like a hospital or an aid station, provided for those who are ill and want to get well, where one can get an infusion of spiritual nutrition and a supply of sustaining water in order to keep on climbing.</p>

Christ has overcome the world—our world—and His gift to us is peace now and exaltation in the world to come.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> Our fundamental requirement is to have faith in Him and follow Him—always. When He bids us to walk in His way and by His light, it is because He has walked this way before us, and He has made it safe for our own travel here. He knows where the sharp stones and stumbling blocks lie hidden and where thorns and thistles are the most severe. He knows where the path is perilous, and He knows which way to go when the road forks and nightfall comes. He knows all this, as Alma says in the Book of Mormon, because He has suffered “pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind … , that he may know … how to succor his people according to their infirmities.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> To succor means to “run to.” I testify that in my fears and in my infirmities the Savior has surely run to me. I will never be able to thank Him enough for such personal kindness and such loving care.</p>

In walking His path of righteousness, our souls will be forever restored; and though that path may for us, as it did for Him, lead through the very valley of the shadow of death, yet we will fear no evil. The rod of His priesthood and the staff of His Spirit will always comfort us. And when we hunger and thirst in the effort, He will prepare a veritable feast before us, a table spread even in the presence of our enemies—contemporary enemies—which might include fear or family worries, sickness or personal sorrow of a hundred different kinds. In a crowning act of compassion at such a supper He anoints our head with oil and administers a blessing of strength to our soul. Our cup runneth over with His kindness, and our tears runneth over with joy.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-teacher-come-from-god.p4" pid="TTBrCZHbbESbMRCHnVIXSg" hash="TvDAWw">In recent months President Gordon B. Hinckley has called on us to hold our people close to the Church, especially the newly converted member. In issuing this call President Hinckley has reminded that we all need at least three things to remain firmly in the faith—a friend, a responsibility, and “[nourishing] by the good word of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-teacher-come-from-god.p5" pid="3z_dY5RfK0q0gf8wqpP5kw" hash="0uSabw">Inspired instruction in the home and in the Church helps provide this crucial element of nourishing by the good word of God. We are <span class="emphasis">so</span> grateful to all who teach. We love you and appreciate you more than we can say. We have great confidence in you. To teach effectively and to feel you are succeeding is demanding work indeed. But it is worth it. We can receive “no greater call.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Surely the opportunity to magnify that call exists everywhere. The need for it is everlasting. Fathers, mothers, siblings, friends, missionaries, home and visiting teachers, priesthood and auxiliary leaders, classroom instructors—each is, in his or her own way, “come from God” for our schooling and our salvation. In this Church it is virtually impossible to find anyone who is <span class="emphasis">not</span> a guide of one kind or another to his or her fellow members of the flock. Little wonder that Paul would say in his writings, “God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-teacher-come-from-god.p6" pid="BaEI_7CmZEazMpqpOZq9Hw" hash="hRXiYQ">For each of us to “come unto Christ,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> to keep His commandments and follow His example back to the Father is surely the highest and holiest purpose of human existence. To help others do that as well—to teach, persuade, and prayerfully lead them to walk that path of redemption also—surely that must be the second most significant task in our lives. Perhaps that is why President David O. McKay once said, “No greater responsibility can rest upon any man [or woman] than to be a teacher of God’s children.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> We are, in fact, all somewhat like the man of Ethiopia to whom Philip was sent. Like him, we may know enough to reach out for religion. We may invest ourselves in the scriptures. We may even give up our earthly treasures, but without sufficient instruction we may miss the meaning of all this and the requirements that still lie before us. So we cry with this man of great authority, “How can [we understand,] except some [teacher] should guide [us]?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

Inspired teaching must never become a lost art in the Church, and we must make certain our quest for it does not become a lost tradition.</p>

Kimball once pled: “Stake presidents, bishops, and branch presidents, please take a particular interest in improving the quality of teaching in the Church. … I fear,” he said, “that all too often many of our members come to church, sit through a class or a meeting, and … then return home having been largely [uninspired]. It is especially unfortunate when this happens at a time … of stress, temptation, or crisis [in their life]. We all need to be touched and nurtured by the Spirit,” he said, “and <span class="emphasis">effective teaching</span> is one of the most important ways this can happen. We often do vigorous work,” President Kimball concluded, “to get members to come to Church but then do not adequately watch over what they receive when they do come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> On this subject President Hinckley himself has said, <span class="emphasis">“Effective teaching is the very essence of leadership in the Church.”</span> May I repeat that. “Effective teaching is the very essence of leadership in the Church. Eternal life,” President Hinckley continued, “will come only as men and women are <span class="emphasis">taught with such effectiveness</span> that they change and discipline their lives. They cannot be coerced into righteousness or into heaven. They must be led, and that means teaching.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-teacher-come-from-god.p14" pid="RJzrHIQMo0awa1KvKfVX-Q" hash="jnxNhQ">Do we teach the gospel “by the Spirit of truth?” He has inquired. Or do we teach it “some other way? And if it be by some other way,” He warns, “it is not of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> In language echoing other commandments, He has said, “If ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

So, parents, teachers, and leaders, we must face our tasks the way Moses faced the promised land. Knowing he could not succeed any other way, Moses said to Jehovah, “If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-teacher-come-from-god.p16" pid="HSUB5jaR6UaNKPKpSQyw5Q" hash="EWsgCw">That is what our members really want when they gather in a meeting or come into a classroom anyway. Most people don’t come to church looking merely for a few new gospel facts or to see old friends, though all of that is important. They come seeking a spiritual experience. They want peace. They want their faith fortified and their hope renewed. They want, in short, to be nourished by the good word of God, to be strengthened by the powers of heaven. Those of us who are called upon to speak or teach or lead have an obligation to help provide that, as best we possibly can. We can only do that if we ourselves are striving to know God, if we ourselves are continually seeking the light of His Only Begotten Son. Then, if our hearts are right, if we are as clean as we can be, if we have prayed and wept and prepared and worried until we don’t know what more we can do, God can say to us as He did to Alma and the sons of Mosiah: “Lift up thy head and rejoice. … I will give unto you success.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

I am just simple enough to think that if we continue to <span class="emphasis">teach them</span>—with the same Christlike spirit, conviction, doctrine, and personal interest the missionaries have shown them—new converts will not only stay with us but, quite literally, could not be kept away. The need for continuing such solid teaching is obvious. In times like ours we <span class="emphasis">all</span> need what Mormon called “the virtue of the word of God” because, he said, it “had [a] more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> When crises come in our lives—and they will—the philosophies of men interlaced with a few scriptures and poems just won’t do. Are we really nurturing our youth and our new members in a way that will sustain them when the stresses of life appear? Or are we giving them a kind of theological Twinkie—spiritually empty calories? President John Taylor once called such teaching “fried froth,” the kind of thing you could eat all day and yet finish feeling totally unsatisfied.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> During a severe winter several years ago, President Boyd K. Packer noted that a goodly number of deer had died of starvation while their stomachs were full of hay. In an honest effort to assist, agencies had supplied the superficial when the substantial was what had been needed. Regrettably they had <span class="emphasis">fed</span> the deer but they had not <span class="emphasis">nourished</span> them.</p>

Reuben Clark said of our youth well over a half century ago. The same thing can be said of new members. “[They] are hungry for the things of the spirit,” he said; “they are eager to learn the Gospel, and they want it straight, undiluted. …</p>

Whether we are instructing our children at home or standing before an audience in church, let us <span class="emphasis">never</span> make our faith difficult to detect. Remember—we are to be teachers “come from God.” Never sow seeds of doubt. Avoid self-serving performance and vanity. Prepare lessons well. Give scripturally based sermons. Teach the revealed doctrine. Bear heartfelt testimony. Pray and practice and try to improve. In our administrative meetings let us both “instruct and edify” as the revelations say, that even in these our teaching may ultimately be “from on high.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> The Church will be the better for it, and so will you, for as Paul said to the Romans, “Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span></p>

This great man felt the way most teachers or speakers or Church officers feel when called—inexperienced, inadequate, frightened. “Ah, Lord,” he cried, “behold, I cannot speak: for I am [but] a child.”</p>

Things went from bad to worse until finally he was imprisoned and made a laughingstock among the people. Angry that he had been so mistreated and maligned, Jeremiah vowed, in effect, never to teach another lesson, whether that be to an investigator, Primary child, new convert, or—heaven forbid—the 15-year-olds. “I will not make mention of [the Lord], nor speak any more in his name,” the discouraged prophet said. But then came the turning point of Jeremiah’s life. Something had been happening with every testimony he had borne, every scripture he had read, every truth he had taught. Something had been happening that he hadn’t counted on. Even as he vowed to close his mouth and walk away from the Lord’s work, he found that he could not. Why? Because “his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-teacher-come-from-god.p24" pid="9MoHV0RVfkGAx1TAZz4jXQ" hash="SCuFog">That is what happens in the gospel to both the teacher and the taught. It is what happened to Nephi and Lehi when, the book of Helaman says, “the Holy Spirit of God did come down from heaven, and did enter into their hearts, and they were filled as if with fire, and they could speak forth marvelous words.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span> Surely it must have been that kind of heavenly joy Mary Magdalene experienced when near the Garden Tomb she unexpectedly beheld her beloved resurrected Lord and said to Him simply, “Rabboni,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span> which is to say, literally, “Teacher.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-teacher-come-from-god.p25" pid="puGNZhH2M0qLIF8AQqVz0A" hash="0nW7yw">From all of us who have been taught to all of you who teach—we say thank you, from the bottom of our hearts. May we exalt the teaching experience within the home and within the Church and improve our every effort to edify and instruct. In all of our meetings and all of our messages may we nourish by the good word of God. And may our children and new converts, our neighbors and new friends, say of our honest efforts, “Thou art a teacher come from God.” In the sacred name of the Master Teacher, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p1" pid="zRpK8vZ1206OG2dJSjSnzQ" hash="PLfQNg">As modern winds of immorality swirl luridly around them, I am concerned for any of our youth or young adults who may be confused about principles of personal purity, about obligations of total chastity before marriage and complete fidelity after it. Against what is happening in the world they see and hear, and hoping to fortify parents as they teach their children a higher standard, I wish to speak today about moral cleanliness. Because this subject is as sacred as any I know, I earnestly pray for the Holy Spirit to guide me in remarks that are more candid than I would wish to make. Today I know how Jacob in the Book of Mormon felt when he said on the same topic, “It grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of speech.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p2" pid="AglHhz00PUaPvUuhk0u9tA" hash="6e-Q2w">In approaching this subject I do not document a host of social ills for which the statistics are as grim as the examples are offensive. Nor will I present here a checklist of do’s and don’ts about dating and boy-girl relationships. What I wish to do is more personal—I wish to try to answer questions some of you may have been asking: <span class="emphasis">Why</span> should we be morally clean? <span class="emphasis">Why</span> is it such an important issue to God? Does the Church <span class="emphasis">have</span> to be so strict about it when others don’t seem to be? How could anything society exploits and glamorizes so openly be very sacred or serious?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p3" pid="o8YD0VKHxUGm31rIJtt5Ug" hash="0U69KQ">May I begin with a lesson from civilization’s long, instructive story. Will and Ariel Durant have written: “No man [or woman], however brilliant or well-informed, can … safely … dismiss … the wisdom of [lessons learned] in the laboratory of history. A youth boiling with hormones will wonder why he should not give full freedom to his sexual desires; [but] if he is unchecked by custom, morals, or laws, he may ruin his life before he … understand[s] that sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a hundred restraints if it is not to consume in chaos both the individual and the group.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p4" pid="SLM8jalm-kKsWSAKc0rdbQ" hash="YXYhdA">A more important scriptural observation is offered by the writer of Proverbs: “Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? … Whoso committeth adultery … destroyeth his own soul. A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p5" pid="f-1Fm9KzqUiw5Gmv1QYhYA" hash="hSwddA">Why is this matter of sexual relationships so severe that fire is almost always the metaphor, with passion pictured vividly in flames? What is there in the potentially hurtful heat of this that leaves one’s soul—or the whole world, for that matter—destroyed if that flame is left unchecked and those passions unrestrained? What is there in all of this that prompts Alma to warn his son Corianton that sexual transgression is “an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p6" pid="MBNdQpkWBk-_jOigdNHTFQ" hash="dj191g">By assigning such seriousness to a physical appetite so universally bestowed, what is God trying to tell us about its place in His plan for all men and women? I submit to you He is doing precisely that—commenting about the very plan of life itself. Clearly among His greatest concerns regarding mortality are how one gets into this world and how one gets out of it. He has set very strict limits in these matters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p7" pid="0pc1_NDBH0ynNYpGXS4Veg" hash="x3VGSQ">Fortunately, in the case of how life is terminated, most seem to be quite responsible. But in the significance of <span class="emphasis">giving</span> life, we sometimes find near-criminal irresponsibility. May I offer three reasons why this is an issue of such magnitude and consequence in the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p8" pid="wCfzPcu8Nk6L1bS5pQNTJA" hash="u_clZA">First is the revealed, restored doctrine of the human soul.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p9" pid="_gw-vOUU1Ey-8RODodII2w" hash="RrMaog">One of the “plain and precious” truths restored in this dispensation is that “the spirit and the body are the soul of man”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> and that when the spirit and body are separated, men and women “cannot receive a fulness of joy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> That is the reason why obtaining a body is so fundamentally important in the first place,why sin of any kind is such a serious matter (namely because it is sin that ultimately brings both physical and spiritual death), and why the resurrection of the body is so central to the great triumph of Christ’s Atonement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p10" pid="l6nPB3vBmUKdSmQvlk2lRQ" hash="GN6hcA">
        <span class="emphasis">The body is an essential part of the soul.</span> This distinctive and very important Latter-day Saint doctrine underscores why sexual sin is so serious. We declare that one who uses the God-given body of another without divine sanction abuses the very soul of that individual, abuses the central purpose and processes of life, “the very key”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> to life, as President Boyd K. Packer once called it. In exploiting the body of another—which means exploiting his or her soul—one desecrates the Atonement of Christ, which saved that soul and which makes possible the gift of eternal life. And when one mocks the Son of Righteousness, one steps into a realm of heat hotter and holier than the noonday sun. You cannot do so and not be burned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p11" pid="tAKl9uuWU0GKlVEuwCBKtA" hash="t3QK_g">Please, never say: “Who does it hurt? Why not a little freedom? I can transgress now and repent later.” Please don’t be so foolish and so cruel. You cannot with impunity “crucify Christ afresh.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> “Flee fornication,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Paul cries, and flee <span class="emphasis">“anything like unto it,”</span><span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> the Doctrine and Covenants adds. Why? Well, for one reason because of the incalculable suffering in both body and spirit endured by the Savior of the world so that we <span class="emphasis">could</span> flee.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> We owe Him something for that. Indeed, we owe Him everything for that. “Ye are not your own,” Paul says. “Ye [have been] bought with a price: therefore <span class="emphasis">glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> In sexual transgression the soul is at stake—the body and the spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p12" pid="8iogkHrtckKwcx8GTOdj1w" hash="AOyKcw">Secondly, may I stress that human intimacy is reserved for a married couple because it is the ultimate symbol of total union, a totality and a union ordained and defined by God. From the Garden of Eden onward, marriage was intended to mean the complete merger of a man and a woman—their hearts, hopes, lives, love, family, future, everything. Adam said of Eve that she was bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh, and that they were to be “one flesh” in their life together.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> This is a union of such completeness that we use the word <span class="emphasis">seal</span> to convey its eternal promise. The Prophet Joseph Smith once said we perhaps could render such a sacred bond as being “welded”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> one to another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p13" pid="BseMamtQc0yrnhEKoN8b3A" hash="pkqQVw">But such a total union, such an unyielding commitment between a man and a woman, can only come with the proximity and permanence afforded in a marriage covenant, with solemn promises and the pledge of all they possess—their very hearts and minds, all their days and all their dreams.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p14" pid="fAoTc_PKlE6q0Yce_2VQAA" hash="V9_1kg">Can you see the moral schizophrenia that comes from <span class="emphasis">pretending</span> you are one, pretending you have made solemn promises before God, sharing the physical symbols and the physical intimacy of your counterfeit union but then fleeing, retreating, severing all such other aspects of what was meant to be a total obligation?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p15" pid="9-ac-ajtSU2nMS0VSiiMlw" hash="rLPIZA">
        <span class="emphasis">In matters of human intimacy, you must wait!</span> You must wait until you can give everything, and you cannot give everything until you are legally and lawfully married. To give illicitly that which is not yours to give (remember, “you are not your own”) and to give only part of that which cannot be followed with the gift of your whole self is emotional Russian roulette. If you persist in pursuing physical satisfaction without the sanction of heaven, you run the terrible risk of such spiritual, psychic damage that you may undermine <span class="emphasis">both</span> your longing for physical intimacy <span class="emphasis">and</span> your ability to give wholehearted devotion to a later, truer love. You may come to that truer moment of ordained love, of real union, only to discover to your horror that what you should have saved you have spent, and that only God’s grace can recover the piecemeal dissipation of the virtue you so casually gave away. On your wedding day the very best gift you can give your eternal companion is your very best self—clean and pure and worthy of such purity in return.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p16" pid="AzFfuf6ZK0W5gK5q_8ps9A" hash="i1KnjQ">Thirdly, may I say that physical intimacy is not only a symbolic union between a husband and a wife—the very uniting of their souls—but it is also symbolic of a shared relationship between them and their Father in Heaven. He is immortal and perfect. We are mortal and imperfect. Nevertheless we seek ways even in mortality whereby we can unite with Him spiritually. In so doing we gain some access to both the grace and the majesty of His power. Those special moments include kneeling at a marriage altar in the house of the Lord, blessing a newborn baby, baptizing and confirming a new member of the Church, partaking of the emblems of the Lord’s Supper, and so forth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p17" pid="eHeMYgpDt06JdDr9aNukDg" hash="Xv88cg">These are moments when we quite literally unite our will with God’s will, our spirit with His spirit, where communion through the veil becomes very real. At such moments we not only acknowledge His divinity but we quite literally take something of that divinity to ourselves. One aspect of that divinity given to virtually all men and women is the use of His power to create a human body, that wonder of all wonders, a genetically and spiritually unique being never before seen in the history of the world and never to be duplicated again in all the ages of eternity. A child, your child—with eyes and ears and fingers and toes and a future of unspeakable grandeur.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p18" pid="xaR2Tp0onUGyAcPmVROiTA" hash="Xa5sAA">Probably only a parent who has held that newborn infant in his or her arms understands the wonder of which I speak. Suffice it to say that of all the titles God has chosen for Himself, <span class="emphasis">Father</span> is the one He favors most, and <span class="emphasis">creation</span> is His watchword—especially human creation, creation in His image. You and I have been given something of that godliness, <span class="emphasis">but under the most serious and sacred of restrictions. The only control placed on us is self-control—</span>self-control born of respect for the divine sacramental power this gift represents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p19" pid="8RpfwsDsvE2G3KsCKqi0tQ" hash="4wtfGg">My beloved friends, especially my young friends, can you see why personal purity is such a serious matter? Can you understand why the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles would issue a proclamation declaring that “the means by which mortal life is created [is] divinely appointed” and that “the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife”?<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Don’t be deceived and don’t be destroyed. Unless such powers are controlled and commandments kept, your future may be burned; your world could go up in flames. Penalty may not come on the precise day of transgression, but it comes surely and certainly enough. And unless there is true repentance and obedience to a merciful God, then someday, somewhere, the morally cavalier and unclean will pray like the rich man who wished Lazarus to “dip … his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p20" pid="45crCrO32EibSrsVN-V0lw" hash="wd2vow">I have declared here the solemn word of revelation that the spirit and the body constitute the soul of man, and that through the Atonement of Christ the body shall rise from the grave to unite with the spirit in an eternal existence. That body is therefore something to be kept pure and holy. Do not be afraid of soiling its hands in honest labor. Do not be afraid of scars that may come in defending the truth or fighting for the right, but beware scars that spiritually disfigure, that come to you in activities you should not have undertaken, that befall you in places where you should not have gone. Beware the wounds of any battle in which you have been fighting on the wrong side.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p21" pid="gc3xpd7ACUmIXSy3yWhWHw" hash="AEIKPg">If some few of you are carrying such wounds—and I know that you are—to you is extended the peace and renewal of repentance available through the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. In such serious matters the path of repentance is not easily begun nor painlessly traveled. But the Savior of the world will walk that essential journey with you. He will strengthen you when you waver. He will be your light when it seems most dark. He will take your hand and be your hope when hope seems all you have left. His compassion and mercy, with all their cleansing and healing power, are freely given to all who truly wish complete forgiveness and will take the steps that lead to it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/personal-purity.p22" pid="Dc-zB6_WqUas_UQ-C8AgeQ" hash="q_KwsA">I bear witness of the great plan of life, of the powers of godliness, of mercy and forgiveness and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ—all of which have profound meaning in matters of moral cleanliness. I testify that we are to glorify God in our body and in our spirit. I thank heaven for legions of the young who are doing just that and helping others do the same. I thank heaven for homes where this is taught. That lives of personal purity may be reverenced by all, I pray in the name of purity Himself, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Never more than at Easter time is there so much meaning in that declaration from John the Beloved, which praises the Father as well as the Son: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-hands-of-the-fathers.p2" pid="7M7EhgxIyEWUqbTNo8twcw" hash="7TM8fg">I am a father, inadequate to be sure, but I cannot comprehend the burden it must have been for God in His heaven to witness the deep suffering and Crucifixion of His Beloved Son in such a manner. His every impulse and instinct <span class="emphasis">must</span> have been to stop it, to send angels to intervene—but He did not intervene. He endured what He saw because it was the only way that a saving, vicarious payment could be made for the sins of all His other children from Adam and Eve to the end of the world. I am eternally grateful for a perfect Father and His perfect Son, neither of whom shrank from the bitter cup nor forsook the rest of us who are imperfect, who fall short and stumble, who too often miss the mark.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-hands-of-the-fathers.p3" pid="6R587-De2EeZQDEXF1zCFA" hash="Hf1a_w">In considering such beauty of the “at-one-ment” in that first Easter season, we are reminded that this relationship between Christ and His Father is one of the sweetest and most moving themes running through the Savior’s ministry. Jesus’ entire being, His complete purpose and delight, were centered in pleasing His Father and obeying His will. Of Him He seemed always to be thinking; to Him He seemed always to be praying. Unlike us, He needed no crisis, no discouraging shift in events to direct His hopes heavenward. He was already instinctively, longingly looking that way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-hands-of-the-fathers.p4" pid="ihFcYr7lrEOHOvbjzUbwWA" hash="RiXG7A">In all His mortal ministry Christ seems never to have had a single moment of vanity or self-interest. When one young man tried to call Him “good,” He deflected the compliment, saying only one was deserving of such praise, His Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-hands-of-the-fathers.p5" pid="pMmVz0ftwUKyfl3tFad3jg" hash="D8SDMg">In the early days of His ministry He said humbly, “I can of mine own self do nothing: … I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-hands-of-the-fathers.p7" pid="IPf6Ofp0UEmNoBMzHN5bnQ" hash="Dbe2IQ">To those who wanted to see the Father, to hear from God directly that Jesus was what He said He was, He answered, “If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: … he that hath seen me hath seen the Father.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> When Jesus wanted to preserve unity among His disciples, He prayed using the example of His own relationship with God: “Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are [one].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-hands-of-the-fathers.p8" pid="25z6qVfwFkyIQOmZAeg-xg" hash="1qESyw">Even as He moved toward the Crucifixion, He restrained His Apostles who would have intervened by saying, “The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> When that unspeakable ordeal was finished, He uttered what must have been the most peaceful and deserved words of His mortal ministry. At the end of His agony, He whispered, “It is finished: … Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Finally it was over. Finally He could go home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-hands-of-the-fathers.p9" pid="FQR1rf2E5k2I5S0AfREDUg" hash="O1dprA">I confess that I have reflected at length upon that moment and the resurrection which was shortly to follow it. I have wondered what that reunion must have been like: the Father that loved this Son so much, the Son that honored and revered His Father in every word and deed. For two who were one as these two were one, what must that embrace have been like? What must that divine companionship be yet? We can only wonder and admire. And we can, on an Easter weekend, yearn to live worthily of some portion of that relationship ourselves.</p>

Dads, is it too bold to hope that our children might have some small portion of the feeling for us that the Divine Son felt for His Father? Might we earn more of that love by trying to be more of what God was to His child? In any case, we do know that a young person’s developing concept of God centers on characteristics observed in that child’s earthly parents.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

It is, he is convinced, the engine driving our most urgent social problems, from poverty to crime to adolescent pregnancy to child abuse to domestic violence. Among the principal social issues of our time is the flight of fathers from their children’s lives.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

These are fatherly sins of omission that are probably more destructive than sins of commission.

Speaking of Jesus’”more excellent ministry” and why He is “the mediator of a better covenant” filled with “better promises,” this author—presumably the Apostle Paul—tells us that through His mediation and Atonement, Christ became “an high priest of good things to come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Moroni spoke of it in the Book of Mormon as “hope for a better world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> For emotional health and spiritual stamina, everyone needs to be able to look forward to some respite, to something pleasant and renewing and hopeful, whether that blessing be near at hand or still some distance ahead. It is enough just to know we can get there, that however measured or far away, there is the promise of “good things to come.”</p>

There <span class="emphasis">is</span> help. There <span class="emphasis">is</span> happiness. There really <span class="emphasis">is</span> light at the end of the tunnel. It is the Light of the World, the Bright and Morning Star, the “light that is endless, that can never be darkened.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> It is the very Son of God Himself. In loving praise far beyond Romeo’s reach, we say, “What light through yonder window breaks?” It is the return of hope, and Jesus is the Sun.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> To any who may be struggling to see that light and find that hope, I say: Hold on. Keep trying. God loves you. Things will improve. Christ comes to you in His “more excellent ministry” with a future of “better promises.” He is your “high priest of good things to come.”</p>

At the same time, I think of other parents who would give any earthly possession they own to have a wayward child return.</p>

I think of those who suffer from sin—their own or someone else’s—who need to know there is a way back and that happiness can be restored. I think of the disconsolate and downtrodden who feel life has passed them by, or now wish that it would pass them by. To all of these and so many more, I say: Cling to your faith. Hold on to your hope. “Pray always, and be believing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Indeed, as Paul wrote of Abraham, he “against [all] hope believed in hope” and “staggered not … through unbelief.” He was “strong in faith” and was “fully persuaded that, what [God] had promised, he was able … to perform.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Always remember in that biblical story that He was out there on the water also, that He faced the worst of it right along with the newest and youngest and most fearful. Only one who has fought against those ominous waves is justified in telling <span class="emphasis">us—as well as the sea—</span>to “be still.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Only one who has taken the full brunt of such adversity could ever be justified in telling us in such times to “be of good cheer.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Such counsel is not a jaunty pep talk about the power of positive thinking, though positive thinking is much needed in the world. No, Christ knows better than all others that the trials of life can be very deep and we are not shallow people if we struggle with them. But even as the Lord avoids sugary rhetoric, He rebukes faithlessness and He deplores pessimism. He expects us to believe!</p>

Surely His ears heard every cry of distress, every sound of want and despair. To a degree far more than we will ever understand, He was “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Indeed, to the layman in the streets of Judea, Christ’s career must have seemed a failure, a tragedy, a good man totally overwhelmed by the evils surrounding Him and the misdeeds of others. He was misunderstood or misrepresented, even hated from the beginning. No matter what He said or did, His statements were twisted, His actions suspected, His motives impugned. In the entire history of the world no one has ever loved so purely or served so selflessly—and been treated so diabolically for His effort. Yet nothing could break His faith in His Father’s plan or His Father’s promises. Even in those darkest hours at Gethsemane and Calvary, He pressed on, continuing to trust in the very God whom He momentarily feared had forsaken Him.</p>

How could He believe it?<span class="emphasis"> Because He knows that for the faithful, things will be made right soon enough. He is a King; He speaks for the crown; He knows what can be promised.</span> He knows that “the Lord … <span class="emphasis">will</span> be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. … For the needy shall not alway[s] be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> He knows that “the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.” He knows that “the Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

Thirty years ago last month, a little family set out to cross the United States to attend graduate school—no money, an old car, every earthly possession they owned packed into less than half the space of the smallest U-Haul trailer available. Bidding their apprehensive parents farewell, they drove exactly 34 miles up the highway, at which point their beleaguered car erupted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/an-high-priest-of-good-things-to-come.p14" pid="8M5_fLV7okG-m1I5cGcBRQ" hash="zyZ-Mg">Pulling off the freeway onto a frontage road, the young father surveyed the steam, matched it with his own, then left his trusting wife and two innocent children—the youngest just three months old—to wait in the car while he walked the three miles or so to the southern Utah metropolis of Kanarraville, population then, I suppose, 65. Some water was secured at the edge of town, and a very kind citizen offered a drive back to the stranded family. The car was attended to and slowly—<span class="emphasis">very</span> slowly—driven back to St. George for inspection—U-Haul trailer and all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/an-high-priest-of-good-things-to-come.p15" pid="C9SCxZk78E60Tb4h9GQUdg" hash="i4ZsDw">After more than two hours of checking and rechecking, no immediate problem could be detected, so once again the journey was begun. In exactly the same amount of elapsed time at exactly the same location on that highway with exactly the same pyrotechnics from under the hood, the car exploded again. It could not have been 15 feet from the earlier collapse, probably not 5 feet from it! Obviously the most precise laws of automotive physics were at work.</p>

This time the man providing the water said, “Either you or that fellow who looks just like you ought to get a new radiator for that car.” For the second time a kind neighbor offered a lift back to the same automobile and its anxious little occupants. He didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry at the plight of this young family.</p>

That same beautiful and loyal wife, my dearest friend and greatest supporter for all these years, was curled up asleep in the seat beside me. The two children in the story, and the little brother who later joined them, have long since grown up and served missions, married perfectly, and are now raising children of their own. The automobile we were driving this time was modest but very pleasant and very safe. In fact, except for me and my lovely Pat situated so peacefully at my side, nothing of that moment two weeks ago was even remotely like the distressing circumstances of three decades earlier.</p>

Just ahead of them I imagined that I saw a young fellow walking toward Kanarraville, with plenty of distance still ahead of him. His shoulders seemed to be slumping a little, the weight of a young father’s fear evident in his pace. In the scriptural phrase his hands did seem to “hang down.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> In that imaginary instant, I couldn’t help calling out to him: “Don’t give up, boy. Don’t you quit. You keep walking. You keep trying. There is help and happiness ahead—a lot of it—30 years of it now, and still counting. You keep your chin up. It will be all right in the end. Trust God and believe in good things to come.”</p>

I testify that Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten Son in the flesh and, having triumphed in this world, is an heir of eternity, a joint-heir with God, and now stands on the right hand of His Father. I testify that this is Their true Church and that They sustain us in our hour of need—and always will, even if we cannot recognize that intervention. Some blessings come soon, some come late, and some don’t come until heaven; but for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, <span class="emphasis">they come.</span> Of that I personally attest. I thank my Father in Heaven for His goodness past, present, and future, and I do so in the name of His Beloved Son and most generous high priest, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We are grateful that the declaration of your testimony has continued on into this beautiful new pavilion. We love you, and we pray for you.</p>

I remember explicitly the groundbreaking service for this building you conducted just under three years ago. In his benediction at that service, President Boyd K. Packer asked for safety in construction, beauty in completion, and then one more favor of heaven. He asked, President, that you would be allowed to see this sight now before our eyes, preside at this pulpit, and declare your testimony here. We all thank heaven for you and for that answer to prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p3" pid="O598E23BOEuIkmL0b1uybg" hash="cFWiCQ">These are surely some of the days which our faithful and farsighted ancestors saw in the earliest years of the Restoration. In a general conference of the Church in April 1844, the brethren recalled those first gatherings of 1830. One of them said: “We [talked] about the kingdom of God as if we had the world at our command; we talked with great confidence, and talked big things, although we were not many [in number]; … we looked [and] if we did not see <span class="emphasis">this</span> [congregation], we saw by vision, the church of God, a thousand times larger [than it was then], although [at the time] we were not enough to well man a farm, or meet a woman with a milk pail. … All the members [of the Church] met in conference, in a room 20 feet square. … We talked about … people coming as doves to the windows, that all nations should flock unto [the Church]. … If we had told the people what our eyes behold this day, we should not [have been] believed.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p4" pid="ziE1oVYai0ipyxdBchFpkA" hash="C33g6Q">If this was their feeling in that fateful year of 1844, just prior to Joseph Smith’s martyrdom, what must those same brethren and sisters see from their eternal home on a day like this! So much has happened since then for which they and we need to be grateful. And, of course, this is not the end. We have much work yet to do, in both the quality and quantity of our faithfulness and our service. George A. Smith, counselor in the First Presidency to President Brigham Young, once said by way of caution, “We may build temples, erect stately domes, magnificent spires [and] grand towers, in honor of our religion, but if we fail to live the principles of that religion … , and to acknowledge God in all our thoughts, we shall fall short of the blessings which its practical exercise would ensure.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> We must be humble and conscientious. The honor and the glory of all that is good goes to God, and there is much still ahead of us that will be refining, even difficult, as He leads us from strength to strength.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p5" pid="mR8FtBjMB0Wd60k2Zsla5w" hash="CopXAQ">In all of this my mind has turned to those early Saints who are too often lost to history, those who quietly and faithfully bore the kingdom forward through far more difficult days. So many of them seem almost nameless to us now. Most went unheralded to their graves—often early graves. Some few have made it into a line or two of Church history, but most have come and gone with neither high office nor history’s regard. These folks, our collective ancestors, slipped into eternity as quietly and anonymously as they lived their religion. These are the silent Saints of whom President J. Reuben Clark once spoke when he thanked them all, “especially,” he said, “the meekest and lowliest of them, [largely] unknown [and] unremembered, [except] round the hearthstones of their children and their children’s children who pass down from generation to generation the story of their faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p6" pid="7q9DrupYKk-OQ1DWqPeUxQ" hash="LiqjQQ">Whether longtime member or newest of converts, we are all the beneficiaries of such faithful forebears. In this beautiful new building and in this historic conference convened in it, I have sensed how much I owe to those who had so much less than I but who seem in virtually every case to have done more with it to build the kingdom than I have done.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p7" pid="mHG0lpqrTku2NwUEmDLfEw" hash="-pWtrg">Perhaps it has always been so down through the dispensations. Jesus once reminded His disciples that they were reaping in fields wherein they had bestowed no labor.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Moses had said to his people earlier:</p>

The records indicate that quite literally every woman in Kirtland was engaged in knitting and spinning in order to clothe the men and boys laboring on the temple.</p>

Kimball wrote, “The Lord only knows the scenes of poverty, tribulation, and distress which we passed through in order to accomplish this.” It was recorded that one leader of the day, looking upon the suffering and poverty of the Church, frequently went upon the walls of that building by day and by night, weeping and crying aloud to the Almighty to send means whereby they might finish that building.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p12" pid="wLvjf-nYKkGhDdtTzlph0A" hash="cBxpIg">It was not any easier when the Saints moved west and began to settle in these valleys. As a young man of Primary and Aaronic Priesthood age, I attended church in the grand old St. George Tabernacle, construction for which had begun in 1863. During very lengthy sermons I would amuse myself by gazing about the building, admiring the marvelous pioneer craftsmanship that had built that striking facility. Did you know, by the way, that there are 184 clusters of grapes carved into the ceiling cornice of that building? (Some of those sermons were really long!) But most of all I enjoyed counting the window panes—2,244 of them—because I grew up on the story of Peter Neilson, one of those little-noted and now-forgotten Saints of whom we have been speaking.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p13" pid="sNhMr7YZ3kGFvbR6HhMf7w" hash="7sQ6nw">In the course of constructing that tabernacle, the local brethren ordered the glass for the windows from New York and had it shipped around the cape to California. But a bill of $800 was due and payable before the panes could be picked up and delivered to St. George. Brother David H. Cannon, later to preside over the St. George Temple being built at the same time, was charged with the responsibility of raising the needed funds. After painstaking effort, the entire community, giving virtually everything they had to these two monumental building projects, had been able to come up with only $200 cash. On sheer faith Brother Cannon committed a team of freighters to prepare to leave for California to get the glass. He continued to pray that the enormous balance of $600 would somehow be forthcoming before their departure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p14" pid="ubKkIWxGzEGr71x34YiAcQ" hash="XFUAdg">Living in nearby Washington, Utah, was Peter Neilson, a Danish immigrant who had been saving for years to add on to his modest two-room adobe home. On the eve of the freighters’ departure for California, Peter spent a sleepless night in that tiny little house. He thought of his conversion in far-off Denmark and his subsequent gathering with the Saints in America. After coming west he had settled and struggled to make a living in Sanpete. And then, just as some prosperity seemed imminent there, he answered the call to uproot and go to the Cotton Mission, bolstering the pathetic and sagging efforts of the alkali-soiled, malaria-plagued, flood-bedeviled settlers of Dixie. As he lay in bed that night contemplating his years in the Church, he weighed the sacrifices asked of him against the wonderful blessings he had received. Somewhere in those private hours he made a decision.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p15" pid="PR5Vr9tsy02v11DUrOLS9g" hash="zN0aSQ">Some say it was a dream, others say an impression, still others simply a call to duty. However the direction came, Peter Neilson arose before dawn on the morning the teams were to leave for California. With only a candle and the light of the gospel to aid him, Peter brought out of a secret hiding place $600 in gold coins—half eagles, eagles, and double eagles. His wife, Karen, aroused by the predawn bustling, asked why he was up so early. He said only that he had to walk quickly the seven miles to St. George.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p16" pid="rqwF-TUWa0O5ykr7oDnXIw" hash="XdpsOQ">As the first light of morning fell on the beautiful red cliffs of southern Utah, a knock came at David H. Cannon’s door. There stood Peter Neilson, holding a red bandanna which sagged under the weight it carried. “Good morning, David,” said Peter. “I hope I am not too late. You will know what to do with this money.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p17" pid="OECXxtARL0aYIodF6SvrMQ" hash="CV1eNQ">With that he turned on his heel and retraced his steps back to Washington, back to a faithful and unquestioning wife, and back to a small two-room adobe house that remained just two rooms for the rest of his life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p18" pid="Dq2VrZkNI0mmYIPFPcqi6Q" hash="RIxFBg">One other account from those early, faithful builders of modern Zion. John R. Moyle lived in Alpine, Utah, about 22 miles as the crow flies to the Salt Lake Temple, where he was the chief superintendent of masonry during its construction. To make certain he was always at work by 8 o’clock, Brother Moyle would start walking about 2 <small>A.M.</small> on Monday mornings. He would finish his work week at 5 <small>P.M.</small> on Friday and then start the walk home, arriving there shortly before midnight. Each week he would repeat that schedule for the entire time he served on the construction of the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/as-doves-to-our-windows.p19" pid="7iMx0iodakqjAqTE7JOqvA" hash="MUqVsg">Once when he was home on the weekend, one of his cows bolted during milking and kicked Brother Moyle in the leg, shattering the bone just below the knee. With no better medical help than they had in such rural circumstances, his family and friends took a door off the hinges and strapped him onto that makeshift operating table. They then took the bucksaw they had been using to cut branches from a nearby tree and amputated his leg just a few inches below the knee. When against all medical likelihood the leg finally started to heal, Brother Moyle took a piece of wood and carved an artificial leg. First he walked in the house. Then he walked around the yard. Finally he ventured out about his property. When he felt he could stand the pain, he strapped on his leg, walked the 22 miles to the Salt Lake Temple, climbed the scaffolding, and with a chisel in his hand hammered out the declaration “Holiness to the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

My message tonight is intended for all of us, whatever our age or years of service, but I do wish to speak specifically to the deacons, teachers, and priests in the Aaronic Priesthood, and the young, newly ordained elders in the Melchizedek Priesthood—you of the rising generation, you who must be ready to use your priesthood, often at times and in ways you did not anticipate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p2" pid="pU5H43syLUqydw0aVj-HUg" hash="1vmjUw">In that spirit my call to you tonight is something of the call Joshua gave to an earlier generation of priesthood bearers, young men and those not so young, who needed to perform a miracle in their time. To these who would need to complete ancient Israel’s most formidable task—recapturing and repossessing their promised land of old—Joshua said, “Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p3" pid="uCuJs5lpp02FfGvxoov_RQ" hash="JZ8Rug">Let me share a story with you suggesting how soon and how unexpectedly those tomorrows can come and in some cases how little time you may have to make hasty, belated preparation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p4" pid="sPm0GYNP_0KJqYASJ7BKig" hash="EEpJxg">On the afternoon of Wednesday, September 30, 1998, just two years ago last week, a Little League football team in Inkom, Idaho, was out on the field for its midweek practice. They had completed their warm-ups and were starting to run a few plays from scrimmage. Dark clouds were gathering, as they sometimes do in the fall, and it began to rain lightly, but that was of no concern to a group of boys who loved playing football.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p5" pid="H_Yu7RhsWUGuzHP_donOHg" hash="2daFlg">Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, an absolutely deafening crack of thunder split the air, inseparable from the flash of lightning that illuminated, literally electrified, the entire scene.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p6" pid="SeDQCTVR_Uet5JrLEvV8Qg" hash="ggEqiQ">At that very moment a young friend of mine, A. J. Edwards, then a deacon in the Portneuf Ward of the McCammon Idaho Stake, was ready for the ball on a handoff that was sure to be a touchdown in this little intersquad bit of horseplay. But the lightning that had illuminated earth and sky struck A. J. Edwards from the crown of his football helmet to the soles of his shoes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p7" pid="1RGlKh5ksUCd1cCGNiAVMA" hash="lmJQIQ">The impact of the strike stunned all the players, knocking a few to the ground, leaving one player temporarily without his sight and virtually all the rest of the players dazed and shaken. Instinctively they started running for the concrete pavilion adjacent to the park. Some of the boys began to cry. Many of them fell to their knees and began to pray. Through it all, A. J. Edwards lay motionless on the field.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p8" pid="5jSbY2e5_kW5LxsSBbiW-A" hash="voeTFA">Brother David Johnson of the Rapid Creek Ward, McCammon Idaho Stake, rushed to the player’s side. He shouted to coach and fellow ward member Rex Shaffer, “I can’t get a pulse. He’s in cardiac arrest.” These two men, rather miraculously both trained emergency medical technicians, started a life-against-death effort in CPR.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p9" pid="6LJOr_O5dkaOXPkZToTS1Q" hash="5FUtNw">Cradling A. J.’s head as the men worked was the young defensive coach of the team, 18-year-old Bryce Reynolds, a member of the Mountain View Ward, McCammon Idaho Stake. As he watched Brother Johnson and Brother Shaffer urgently applying CPR, he had an impression. I am confident it was a revelation from heaven in every sense of the word. He remembered vividly a priesthood blessing that the bishop had once given his grandfather following an equally tragic and equally life-threatening accident years earlier. Now, as he held this young deacon in his arms, he realized that for the first time in his life he needed to use his newly conferred Melchizedek Priesthood in a similar way. In anticipation of his 19th birthday and forthcoming call to serve a mission, young Bryce Reynolds had been ordained an elder just 39 days earlier.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p10" pid="iXpZswMwc0uKFf-WJhmm0w" hash="LN-2yQ">Whether he audibly spoke the words or only uttered them under his breath, Elder Reynolds said: “A. J. Edwards, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the power and authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood which I hold, I bless you that you will be OK. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.” As Bryce Reynolds closed that brief but fervent blessing offered in the language of an 18-year-old, A. J. Edwards drew his first renewed breath.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p11" pid="El3_0bxHckSad62aoDf8xg" hash="lB-2GQ">The ongoing prayers, miracles, and additional priesthood blessings of that entire experience—including a high-speed ambulance drive to Pocatello and a near-hopeless LifeFlight to the burn center at the University of Utah—all of that the Edwards family can share with us at a later time. It is sufficient to say that a very healthy and very robust A. J. Edwards is in the audience tonight with his father as my special guests. I also recently talked on the telephone with Elder Bryce Reynolds, who has been serving faithfully in the Texas Dallas Mission for the past 17 months. I love these two wonderful young men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p12" pid="9QLPP6VMbk-BUC8f1h7J7w" hash="MGPRlQ">Now, my young friends of both the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood, not every prayer is answered so immediately, and not every priesthood declaration can command the renewal or the sustaining of life. Sometimes the will of God is otherwise. But young men, you will learn, if you have not already, that in frightening, even perilous moments, your faith and your priesthood will demand the very best of you and the best you can call down from heaven. You Aaronic Priesthood boys will not use your priesthood in exactly the same way an ordained elder uses the Melchizedek, but all priesthood bearers must be instruments in the hand of God, and to be so, you must, as Joshua said, “sanctify yourselves.” You must be ready and worthy to act.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p13" pid="5wg2rTmydUiUcXy6lgoIDw" hash="hzhZ0w">That is why the Lord repeatedly says in the scriptures, “Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Let me tell you what that phrase “bear the vessels of the Lord” means. Anciently it had at least two meanings, both related to the work of the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p14" pid="MLO32Cnev0yuQIsZI-iQtg" hash="jLZVIw">The first refers to the recovery and return to Jerusalem of various temple implements that had been carried into Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. In physically handling the return of these items, the Lord reminded those early brethren of the sanctity of anything related to the temple. Therefore as they carried back to their homeland these various bowls, basins, cups, and other vessels, they themselves were to be as clean as the ceremonial instruments they bore.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p15" pid="wV2wUaDrbkmjsURb84M4kg" hash="w67w2Q">The second meaning is related to the first. Similar bowls and implements were used for ritual purification in the home. The Apostle Paul, writing to his young friend Timothy, said of these, “In a great house there are … vessels of gold and … silver, … of wood and of earth”—these means of washing and cleansing common in the time of the Savior. But Paul goes on to say, “If a man … purge himself [of unworthiness], <span class="emphasis">he</span> shall <span class="emphasis">be</span> a vessel … sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.” Therefore, Paul says, “Flee … youthful lusts: … follow righteousness, … call on the Lord out of a pure heart.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p16" pid="ZYT_2G8ijUG-5qcJ628SZA" hash="KMec7Q">In both of these biblical accounts the message is that as priesthood bearers not only are we to <span class="emphasis">handle</span> sacred vessels and emblems of God’s power—think of preparing, blessing, and passing the sacrament, for example—but we are also to <span class="emphasis">be</span> a sanctified instrument as well. Partly because of what we are to <span class="emphasis">do</span> but more importantly because of what we are to <span class="emphasis">be,</span> the prophets and apostles tell us to “flee … youthful lusts” and “call on the Lord out of a pure heart.” They tell us to be clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p17" pid="8VZdXWmbzU2s433ZIiZtMg" hash="3icC3g">Now, we live in an age when that cleanliness is more and more difficult to preserve. With modern technology even your youngest brothers and sisters can be carried virtually around the world before they are old enough to ride a tricycle safely across the street. What were in my generation carefree moments of moviegoing, TV watching, and magazine reading have now, with the additional availability of VCRs, the Internet, and personal computers, become <span class="emphasis">amusements</span> fraught with genuine moral danger. I put the word <span class="emphasis">amusements</span> in italics. Did you know that the original Latin meaning of the word <span class="emphasis">amusement</span> is “a diversion of the mind intended to deceive”? Unfortunately that is largely what “amusements” in our day have again become in the hands of the arch deceiver.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p18" pid="2nlG9CaR5EGb236bWyNQiQ" hash="2hxezQ">Recently I read an author who said: “Our leisure, even our play, is a matter of serious concern. [That is because] there is no neutral ground in the universe: every square inch, every split second, is claimed by God and counterclaimed by Satan.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> I believe that to be absolutely true, and no such claiming and counterclaiming anywhere is more crucial and conspicuous than that being waged for the minds and morals, the personal purity of the young.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p19" pid="ml19AtTH-EytI47j-tDhIQ" hash="UduonQ">Brethren, part of my warning voice tonight is that this will only get worse. It seems the door to permissiveness, the door to lewdness and vulgarity and obscenity swings only one way. It only opens farther and farther; it never seems to swing back. Individuals can choose to close it, but it is certain, historically speaking, that public appetite and public policy will not close it. No, in the moral realm the only real control you have is self-control.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p20" pid="4jz7yhzHIEiYSj-76iclWg" hash="4qUV8A">Brethren, if you are struggling with self-control in what you look at or listen to, in what you say or what you do, I ask you to pray to your Father in Heaven for help. Pray to Him as Enos did, who wrestled before God and struggled mightily in the spirit.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Wrestle like Jacob did with the angel, refusing to let go until a blessing had come.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Talk to your mom and dad. Talk to your bishop. Get the best help you can from all the good people who surround you. Avoid at all costs others who would tempt you, weaken your will, or perpetuate the problem. If anyone does not feel fully worthy tonight, he can become worthy through repentance and the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Savior wept and bled and died for you. He has given everything for your happiness and salvation. He certainly is not going to withhold help from you now!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p21" pid="AyLPpo2bF0S_aP11jRoxTg" hash="L2cYPQ">Then you can help others to whom you are sent, now and in the future, as one holding the priesthood of God. You can then, as a missionary, be what the Lord described as “a physician [to] the church.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p22" pid="dbnnEjMuSUyIPeaHsUnUdw" hash="3Ek6lw">Young men, we love you. We worry about you and want to help you every way we can. Nearly 200 years ago William Wordsworth wrote that “the world is too much with us.” What on earth would he say about the encroachments pressing in on your souls and sensibilities today? In addressing some of these problems facing you, we are mindful that an absolute multitude of young men is faithfully living the gospel and standing resolutely before the Lord. I am sure that multitude includes the overwhelming majority of all who are listening here tonight. But the cautions we give to the few are important reminders even to the faithful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p23" pid="ZIDKZY-tJk-G03h3B7prSw" hash="64p0Vg">In the most difficult and discouraging days of World War II, Winston Churchill said to the people of England: “To every man there comes … that special moment when he is figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a special thing unique to him and fitted to his talent. What a tragedy if that moment finds him unprepared or unqualified for the work which would be his finest hour.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/sanctify-yourselves.p24" pid="4dhUWRS3bUSotj4xByMf6w" hash="29Ulyg">In an even more serious kind of spiritual warfare, brethren, the day may come—indeed, I am certain <span class="emphasis">will</span> come—when in an unexpected circumstance or a time of critical need, lightning will strike, so to speak, and the future will be in your hands. Be ready when that day comes. Be strong. Always be clean. Respect and revere the priesthood that you hold, tonight and forever. I bear witness of this work, of the power we have been given to direct it, and of the need to be worthy in administering it. Brethren, I testify that the call in every age—and especially our age—is Joshua’s call: “Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p5" pid="wEFaNFKY1kKkUqmwezSRvg" hash="C-fCbQ">Now, you are already wonderful missionaries, better than you think you are, and there is more where that comes from! The 12-hour-a-day, heavy-duty effort we’ll leave to the full-time missionaries, but why should they have all the fun? We are entitled to a seat at the abundant table of testimony as well, and fortunately a place has been reserved there for each member of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p6" pid="KrSSWRb7ZEKmWYERWtTqtQ" hash="C_53ug">Indeed, one of the axioms of our day is that no mission or missionaries can ultimately succeed <span class="emphasis">without</span> the loving participation and spiritual support of the local members working with them in a balanced effort. If today you are taking notes on a stone tablet, chisel that one in deeply. I promise you won’t ever have to erase it. Initial investigators may come from many different sources, but those who are actually baptized and who are firmly retained in activity in the Church come overwhelmingly from friends and acquaintances known to members of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p7" pid="FizvT7BAaEqlVgHvE1SEEA" hash="z_0pbQ">Just over 24 months ago President Gordon B. Hinckley said in a Churchwide broadcast:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p8" pid="upZfHQXJlkOYT4vo0QlcIQ" hash="PAXSIw">“My heart reaches out to you missionaries. You simply cannot do it alone and do it well. You must have the help of others. That power to help lies within each of us. …</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p10" pid="z6gsGS_k2EqsdqaVdqIBhQ" hash="GUnRyA">“Brothers and sisters, all of you out in the wards and stakes and in the districts and branches, I invite you to become a vast army with enthusiasm for this work and a great overarching desire to assist the missionaries in the tremendous responsibility they have to carry the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p11" pid="JLHz57HVC0Cr072_BLOq6g" hash="GuYtNA">I like the ring of those phrases “a vast army with enthusiasm for this work” and “a great overarching desire to assist the missionaries.” Let me note a number of things we can do to respond to that call. You will recognize how many of them you are already doing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p12" pid="1dyXGyN2v0CxBVPu7Xu6yg" hash="9F-lwQ">Above all else we can live the gospel. Surely there is no more powerful missionary message we can send to this world than the example of a loving and happy Latter-day Saint life. The manner and bearing, the smile and kindness of a faithful member of the Church brings a warmth and an outreach which no missionary tract or videotape can convey. People do not join the Church because of what they know. They join because of what they feel, what they see and want spiritually. Our spirit of testimony and happiness in that regard will come through to others if we let it. As the Lord said to Alma and the sons of Mosiah, “Go forth … that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p13" pid="Q96UBwIRgUeFm2qAiShoHg" hash="2T2uSw">A young returned missionary sister from Hong Kong told me recently that when she and her companion asked an investigator if she believed in God, the woman replied, “I didn’t until I met a member of your church and observed how she lived.” What exemplary missionary work! Asking every member to be a missionary is not nearly as crucial as asking every member to be a member! Thank you for living the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p14" pid="hz2olbIOSEuTv_S2z1iaJA" hash="gBa8hQ">Thank you also for praying for the missionaries. <span class="emphasis">Everyone</span> prays for the missionaries. May it ever be so. In that same spirit, we should also pray for those who are (or who need to be) meeting the missionaries. In Zarahemla, members were commanded to “join in fasting and mighty prayer”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> for those who had not yet joined the Church of God. We can do the same.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p15" pid="UFd3Hd7FhUmYlAGG5rWp1A" hash="nRnAvQ">We can also pray daily for our own personal missionary experiences. Pray that under the divine management of such things, the missionary opportunity you want is already being prepared in the heart of someone who longs for and looks for what you have. “There are many yet on the earth … who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Pray that they will find you! And then be alert, because there are multitudes in your world who feel a famine in their lives, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p16" pid="pUDePORLl0GAdDRwCDQskw" hash="EAb5sQ">When the Lord delivers this person to your view, just chat—about anything. You can’t miss. You don’t have to have a prescribed missionary message. Your faith, your happiness, the very look on your face is enough to quicken the honest in heart. Haven’t you ever heard a grandmother talk about her grandchildren? That’s what I mean—minus the photographs! The gospel will just tumble out. You won’t be able to contain yourself!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p17" pid="alTbxbPCZUavokvloCZuLw" hash="epOjfA">But perhaps even more important than speaking is listening. These people are not lifeless objects disguised as a baptismal statistic. They are children of God, our brothers and sisters, and they need what we have. Be genuine. Reach out sincerely. Ask these friends what matters most to <span class="emphasis">them.</span> What do <span class="emphasis">they</span> cherish, and what do <span class="emphasis">they</span> hold dear? And then listen. If the setting is right you might ask what their fears are, what they yearn for, or what they feel is missing in their lives. I promise you that <span class="emphasis">something</span> in what they say will <span class="emphasis">always</span> highlight a truth of the gospel about which you can bear testimony and about which you can then offer more. Elder Russell Nelson told me once that one of the first rules of medical inquiry is “Ask the patient where it hurts. The patient,” he said, “will be your best guide to a correct diagnosis and eventual remedy.” If we listen with love, we won’t need to wonder what to say. It will be given to us—by the Spirit and by our friends.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p18" pid="-g9RkewHrEWn6z5RCykixQ" hash="ShH0Uw">For those who find it difficult to initiate missionary conversations—and many do—the Church’s newly produced pass-along cards are a lovely, effortless way to let others know some of your basic beliefs and how they may learn more. For example, this is the easiest way I personally have yet found to offer people a copy of the Book of Mormon without my needing to carry a knapsack full of books as I travel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p19" pid="auuc3e8u6EucnlofykZ7kw" hash="Ejm-zA">Now let me increase the tempo of this message just a little. Many more of us can prepare for senior missionary service when that time in our life comes. As the senior couples at the MTC in Provo have said on a poster, “Let’s lengthen our shuffle!” I just returned from a long trip which took me to half a dozen missions. Everywhere I went during those weeks, I found senior couples giving the most remarkable and rewarding leadership imaginable, providing stability, maturity, and experience that no 19-year-old or 21-year-old could possibly be expected to provide. I found all kinds of couples, including a few former mission and temple presidents and their wives, who had come to parts of the world totally unknown to them to quietly, selflessly serve a second or a third or a fourth mission. I was deeply moved by every one of those people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p20" pid="7-WbiCI-R06S8eZ1hn2Kqg" hash="tmHyPg">I had lunch recently with Elder and Sister John Hess of Ashton, Idaho. “We’re just old potato farmers,” John told me, but that is precisely what the nation of Belarus in the Russia Moscow Mission needed. For years the very best potato yields on government plots of ground there had been 50 sacks of potatoes a hectare. Considering it takes 22 sacks of seed to plant a hectare, the return was poor indeed. They needed help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p21" pid="KkHwX4Gpf0al2hxY30fceA" hash="tRJmPw">Brother Hess asked for ground just three feet away from the government plots, rolled up his sleeves, and went to work with the same seed, tools, and fertilizer available in Belarus. Come harvest time they began to dig, then called on others to dig, then called on everyone to dig. With the same rainfall and soil, but with an extra measure of Idaho industry, experience, and prayer, the plots planted by the Hesses produced a whopping 550 sacks per hectare—11 times better than any prior yield on that land. At first no one would believe the difference. They wondered if secret teams had come in the night or if some wonder drug had been used. But it was none of that. Brother Hess said, “We needed a miracle, so we asked for one.” Now just little more than a year later, in that community young proselyting missionaries are finding much more success just because an “old potato farmer” from Idaho answered the call of his church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p22" pid="-K2K_eRu00KeJEF9yHK6IA" hash="UFap5Q">Most missionary couples serve much more routinely than that, employing their leadership experience in wards and branches, but the point is that there are all kinds of needs in this work, and there is a resolute missionary tradition of responding to the call to serve at <span class="emphasis">every</span> age and in every circumstance. I learned from a mission president recently that one of his young sister missionaries, nearing the end of her very faithful and successful mission, said through her tears that she must return home immediately. When he inquired as to the problem, she told him money had become so difficult for her family that to continue her support, the family had rented their home and were using the rental proceeds to pay her mission expenses. For living accommodations, they had moved into a storage locker. For water, they used a neighbor’s outdoor tap and hose; and for a bathroom they went to a nearby gasoline station. This family, in which the father had recently passed away, was so proud of their missionary and so independent in spirit that they had managed to keep this recent turn of events from most of their friends and virtually all of their Church leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p23" pid="zXt1pF5C30GCCKox3wV5sg" hash="ZnVtcQ">When this situation was discovered, the family was restored to their home immediately. Long-term solutions to their economic circumstances were put in place, and the complete amount of remaining missionary support for their missionary daughter was secured overnight. With her tears dried and fears allayed, this faithful, hardworking young sister finished her mission triumphantly and was recently married in the temple to a wonderful young man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p24" pid="zDihZoIlh02RxLzj_EjKyA" hash="raMXIQ">In our blessed day we do not ask the kind of severe sacrifice this missionary family offered, but our generation has been the beneficiary of earlier generations who <span class="emphasis">did</span> sacrifice so very much in serving the missionary cause we declare. We can all do just a little more to pass that tradition on to those who follow us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p25" pid="ZZD_0NNOL0-85cC1eF0Y4Q" hash="PW7n2w">The Apostle John asked the Lord if he, John, might remain on the earth beyond the normal span of life for no other purpose than to bring more souls unto God. In granting that wish, the Savior said that this was “a greater work” and a nobler “desire” even than that of desiring to come into the presence of the Lord “speedily.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/witnesses-unto-me.p26" pid="VB376_h05EKo8e6MHPrFYg" hash="0O3cow">Like all prophets and apostles, the Prophet Joseph Smith understood the deep meaning of John’s request when he said, “After all that has been said, [our] greatest and most important duty is to preach the Gospel.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> I bear witness of that gospel and of Jesus Christ, who embodied it. I testify that “the worth of souls is great in the sight of God”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> and that saving those souls through the redeeming Atonement of His Beloved Son is at the very heart of His work and His glory.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> In pursuing that work I testify with Jeremiah that this last great missionary declaration to modern Israel will, in the end, be a greater miracle than ancient Israel’s crossing of the Red Sea.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> That we will courageously and enthusiastically share the miracle of this message, I pray in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In Daniel’s language it is “the stone … cut out of the mountain without hands.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Isaiah described what he foresaw as “a marvellous work and a wonder.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> It <span class="emphasis">is</span> a wonder! The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ is filled with miracles, revelations, manifestations of every kind. Many of those have come in our lifetime.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p2" pid="6_Y3LVJFukyjErtxZaPl8w" hash="1de19g">I was 17 years old before there was any stake of Zion anywhere outside North America. There are now well over 1,000 stakes on those distant continents and isles of the sea. We now have 125 temples operating or announced, more than half of which (64) are outside the United States. Again I was nearly 16 before there was even one temple beyond the states and provinces of the USA and Canada.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p3" pid="J_Gme5LcH0auC2CIDXn_BA" hash="Tl3tjQ">We have lived to see the revelation extending the priesthood to all worthy males of appropriate age, a blessing which has accelerated the work in many parts of the world. We have lived to see the publication of our scriptures, wholly or in part, in nearly 100 languages. We have lived to see the long-awaited creation of the Quorums of the Seventy with great men drawn from many nations and, in turn, deployed to serve in many nations. Most recently President Hinckley has announced a Perpetual Education Fund that has the potential to bless many in even the most distant locations of the earth eventually. And so the internationalizing of the Church goes on.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p4" pid="3YLKptoBhkSu3oJZkZ3oog" hash="mMt7qQ">I give this brief summary to highlight another miracle, another revelation, if you will, that may have been overlooked by the general membership of the Church. In a way it was intended to be transparent to the public eye. I speak of the decision made by the Brethren just over a decade ago to cease placing any special assessments or other fund-raising obligations upon the members of the Church at home or abroad.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p5" pid="-LU-J0fh4EWN3NPKCovn5Q" hash="VkKtbA">Inasmuch as this decision was made amidst the very international growth I have just described, how could this be done financially? How could we go to more and more distant locations at the very moment we were removing all ancillary assessments from our people? Logic in the situation might have suggested exactly the opposite course of action.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p6" pid="kXngblnLSUue-anhiKwEUw" hash="mQ7PDA">How was it done? I will tell you how it was done—with the wholehearted belief on the part of the presiding Brethren that the Lord’s principles of tithing and freewill offerings would be honored by even the newest member of the Church and that loyalty to such divine principles would see us through.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p7" pid="zVQr0lr-F0-Xc63h5o_e2g" hash="5kp3Vg">I was not in the Quorum of the Twelve when that momentous decision was made, but I can imagine the discussions that were held and the act of faith required within the presiding councils of the Church. What if the Brethren were to cease assessments and the Saints did <span class="emphasis">not</span> pay their tithes and offerings, what then? So far as I know, that thought was never seriously entertained. They went forward in faith—faith in God, faith in revealed principle, faith in us. They never looked back. That was a magnificent (if nearly unnoticed) day in the maturing of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p8" pid="dGG7u21Fqk6d1pprIoQo9Q" hash="yivC6g">But to honor that decision, we must be equally mature as individual members of the Church. May I then suggest five reasons why all of us, rich or poor, longtime member or newest convert, should faithfully pay our tithes and offerings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p9" pid="51e18imq-0S2sLEa0XtXbw" hash="bSnYtw">First, do so for the sake of your children and grandchildren, the rising generation, who could now, if we are not careful, grow up in the Church with absolutely no understanding as to how their temples, chapels, seminaries, and socials are provided. Teach your children that many of the blessings of the Church are available to them because you and they give tithes and offerings to the Church. Teach them that those blessings could come virtually no other way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p10" pid="MJWrCerkDECDBqn1Q-xvDg" hash="BY3ZtA">Then take your children to tithing settlement with you, just as President Howard W. Hunter’s grandson was taken with his father several years ago. In that experience the bishop indicated his pleasure in young Brother Hunter’s wanting to pay a full tithing. In the process of receiving the coins, he asked the lad if he thought the gospel were true. As the boy handed over his full tithing of 14 cents, this seven-year-old said he guessed the gospel was true but “it sure costs a lot of money.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Well, the buildings, programs, and materials I have mentioned do have an attached cost. That is not an unimportant lesson for our children to learn in their youth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p11" pid="OrB_5c5qKU6UMTDFsGW41w" hash="FVg2Ig">Second, pay your tithing to rightfully claim the blessings promised those who do so. “Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> After she lost her husband in the martyrdom at Nauvoo and made her way west with five fatherless children, Mary Fielding Smith continued in her poverty to pay tithing. When someone at the tithing office inappropriately suggested one day that she should not contribute a tenth of the only potatoes she had been able to raise that year, she cried out to the man, “William, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Would you deny me a blessing? If I did not pay my tithing, I should expect the Lord to withhold His blessings from me. I pay my tithing, not only because it is a law of God, but because I expect a blessing by doing it. [I <span class="emphasis">need</span> a blessing.] By keeping this and other laws, I expect to … be able to provide for my family.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p12" pid="euNGoJ2hoU2dlJ5edraV2g" hash="M_dDfw">I can’t list <span class="emphasis">all</span> the ways that blessings will come from obedience to this principle, but I testify <span class="emphasis">many</span> will come in spiritual ways that go well beyond economics. In my life, for example, I have seen God’s promise fulfilled that He would “rebuke the devourer for [my sake].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> That blessing of protection against evil has been poured out upon me and on my loved ones beyond any capacity I have to adequately acknowledge. But I believe that divine safety has come, at least in part, because of our determination, individually and as a family, to pay tithing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p13" pid="L1ZG10FyCUGB304A3dChxQ" hash="8HDsCA">Third, pay your tithing as a declaration that possession of material goods and the accumulation of worldly wealth are <span class="emphasis">not</span> the uppermost goals of your existence. As one young husband and father, living on a student budget, recently told me, “Perhaps our most pivotal moments as Latter-day Saints come when we have to swim directly against the current of the culture in which we live. Tithing provides just such a moment. Living in a world that emphasizes material acquisition and cultivates distrust for anyone or anything that has designs on our money, we shed that self-absorption to give freely, trustingly, and generously. By this act, we say—indeed—we are different, that we are God’s peculiar people. In a society that tells us money is our most important asset, we declare emphatically it is not.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p14" pid="MFjFZGIna0KXh53c_P7Njg" hash="Kd54uw">President Spencer W. Kimball once spoke of a man who prided himself on his vast acreage and remarkable holdings—groves and vineyards, herds and fields, ponds and homes and possessions of every kind. He prided himself on these, but to the end of his life was unwilling to tithe on them or even acknowledge that they were gifts from God. President Kimball then spoke at the man’s funeral, noting that this land baron was laid to rest in an oblong piece of soil measuring “the length of a tall man, the width of a heavy one.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> In answer to the age-old question, “How much did he leave?” be reassured the answer will always be, “All of it.” So we would do well to lay up treasures in heaven, where not taxes but doctrines give meaning to words like <span class="emphasis">estate, inheritance, testament,</span> and <span class="emphasis">will.</span><span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p15" pid="DPXxeDdqEk6lVC4nUS86qg" hash="IyvZ8Q">Fourth, pay your tithes and offerings out of honesty and integrity because they are God’s rightful due. Surely one of the most piercing lines in all of scripture is Jehovah’s thundering inquiry, “Will a man rob God?” And we ask, “Wherein have we robbed thee?” He answers, “In tithes and offerings.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p16" pid="5thGtnFsWEWjlu_1vFzmUQ" hash="1j5BLQ">Paying tithing is <span class="emphasis">not</span> a token gift we are somehow charitably bestowing upon God. Paying tithing is discharging a debt. Elder James E. Talmage once described this as a contract between us and the Lord. He imagined the Lord saying: “‘You have need of many things in this world—food, clothing, and shelter for your family … , the common comforts of life. … You shall have the means of acquiring these things; but remember they are mine, and I require of you the payment of a rental upon that which I give into your hands. However, your life will not be one of uniform increase … [so] instead of doing as mortal landlords do—requir[ing] you to … pay in advance, whatever your fortunes or … prospects may be—you shall pay me … [only] when you have received; and you shall pay me in accordance with what you receive. If it so be that in one year your income is abundant, then … [your 10 percent will be a] little more; and if it be so that the next year is one of distress and your income is not what it was, then … [your 10 percent will be] less. … [Whatever your circumstance, the tithe will be fair.]’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p17" pid="0U72x1-a9kOXnHXHLhTulw" hash="2MHX7w">“Have you ever found a landlord on earth who was willing to make that kind of [equitable] contract with you?” Elder Talmage asks. “When I consider the liberality of it all,” he says, “… I feel in my heart that I could scarcely raise my countenance to … Heaven … if I tried to defraud [God] out of that [which is rightfully His].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p18" pid="nqphRk21c0uEewoI0eC27A" hash="fYb4DA">This leads to a fifth reason to pay our tithes and offerings. We should pay them as a personal expression of love to a generous and merciful Father in Heaven. Through His grace God has dealt bread to the hungry and clothing to the poor. At various times in our lives that will include all of us, either temporally or spiritually speaking. For every one of us the gospel has broken forth as the light of the morning, driving back the darkness of ignorance and sorrow, fear and despair. In nation after nation His children have called and the Lord has answered. Through the movement of His gospel across the world, God is relieving the burdens of the weary and setting free those that are oppressed. His loving goodness has made our lives, rich or poor, near or far, “like a watered garden, … [from] a spring of water … [that faileth] not.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p19" pid="vZcFovJmvESEqov0R5EvHw" hash="x0cFhQ">I express my deepest gratitude for every blessing of the gospel of Jesus Christ, especially that greatest of all gifts, the exemplary life and atoning death of God’s Only Begotten Son. I know I can never repay heaven for any of this benevolence, but there are many ways I need to <span class="emphasis">try</span> to show my thankfulness. One of those ways is in the payment of tithes and freewill offerings. I <span class="emphasis">want</span> to give something back, but I never want it to be (in King David’s words) “that which doth cost me nothing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/like-a-watered-garden.p20" pid="1QU5G3KUqUS2DE7ItxtFcw" hash="GPhrmg">I testify that the principle of tithing is of God, taught to us in such scriptural simplicity that we cannot doubt its divinity. May we all claim its blessings forever, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In the downward course of all this he became a keeper of pigs, one so hungry, so stripped of sustenance and dignity that he “would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat.” But even that consolation was not available to him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-other-prodigal.p2" pid="YKPIiiQcE0-8fxMzhkXmYA" hash="0Fy90w">Then the scripture says encouragingly, “He came to himself.” He determined to find his way home, hoping to be accepted at least as a servant in his father’s household. The tender image of this boy’s anxious, faithful father running to meet him and showering him with kisses is one of the most moving and compassionate scenes in all of holy writ. It tells every child of God, wayward or otherwise, how much God wants us back in the protection of His arms.</p>

Surely, for this father, the pain over a wayward child who had run from home and wallowed with swine is now compounded with the realization that this older, wiser brother, the younger boy’s childhood hero as older brothers always are, is angry that his brother has come home.</p>

This son is not so much angry that the other has come home as he is angry that his parents are so happy about it. Feeling unappreciated and perhaps more than a little self-pity, this dutiful son—and he is <span class="emphasis">wonderfully</span> dutiful—forgets for a moment that he has never had to know filth or despair, fear or self-loathing. He forgets for a moment that every calf on the ranch is already his and so are all the robes in the closet and every ring in the drawer. He forgets for a moment that his faithfulness has been and always will be rewarded.</p>

He has yet to come to the compassion and mercy, the charitable breadth of vision to see that <span class="emphasis">this is not a rival returning.</span> It is his brother. As his father pled with him to see, it is one who was dead and now is alive. It is one who was lost and now is found.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-other-prodigal.p12" pid="zYJxZ-8LOU6CIKJ9Gm9Tdw" hash="QbKA9w">Certainly this younger brother had been a prisoner—a prisoner of sin, stupidity, and a pigsty. But the older brother lives in some confinement, too. He has, as yet, been unable to break out of the prison of himself. He is haunted by the green-eyed monster of jealousy.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> He feels taken for granted by his father and disenfranchised by his brother, when neither is the case. He has fallen victim to a fictional affront. As such he is like Tantalus of Greek mythology—he is up to his chin in water, but he remains thirsty nevertheless. One who has heretofore presumably been very happy with his life and content with his good fortune suddenly feels very unhappy simply because another has had some good fortune as well.</p>

So, unfortunately, we occasionally act that way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-other-prodigal.p15" pid="mza7DjQIAEKY93uJL8xXNA" hash="3ePnQA">How does this happen, especially when we wish so much that it would not? I think one of the reasons is that every day we see allurements of one kind or another that tell us what we have is not enough. Someone or something is forever telling us we need to be more handsome or more wealthy, more applauded or more admired than we see ourselves as being. We are told we haven’t collected enough possessions or gone to enough fun places. We are bombarded with the message that on the <span class="emphasis">world’s</span> scale of things we have been weighed in the balance and found wanting.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Some days it is as if we have been locked in a cubicle of a great and spacious building where the only thing on the TV is a never-ending soap opera entitled <span class="emphasis">Vain Imaginations.</span><span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-other-prodigal.p16" pid="Lc8MM_1WvE2tDwS_3sh7YA" hash="S2AyBw">But God does not work this way. The father in this story does not tantalize his children. He does not mercilessly measure them against their neighbors. He doesn’t even compare them with each other. His gestures of compassion toward one do not require a withdrawal or denial of love for the other. He is divinely generous to both of these sons. Toward both of his children he extends charity. I believe God is with us the way my precious wife, Pat, is with my singing. She is a gifted musician, something of a musical genius, but I couldn’t capture a musical note with Velcro. And yet I know she loves me in a very special way when I try to sing. I know that because I can see it in her eyes. They are the eyes of love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-other-prodigal.p17" pid="8KC9SgvG-Em7CH-jU0tQ2g" hash="XQYXpg">One observer has written: “In a world that constantly compares people, ranking them as more or less intelligent, more or less attractive, more or less successful, it is not easy to really believe in a [divine] love that does not do the same. When I hear someone praised,” he says, “it is hard not to think of myself as less praiseworthy; when I read about the goodness and kindness of other people, it is hard not to wonder whether I myself am as good and kind as they; and when I see trophies, rewards, and prizes being handed out to special people, I cannot avoid asking myself why that didn’t happen to me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> If left unresisted, we can see how this inclination so embellished by the world will ultimately bring a resentful, demeaning view of God and a terribly destructive view of ourselves. Most “thou shalt not” commandments are meant to keep us from hurting others, but I am convinced the commandment not to covet is meant to keep us from hurting ourselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/the-other-prodigal.p18" pid="_zZuVRBAYka0ulHm6YkSHA" hash="ntoIng">How can we overcome such a tendency so common in almost everyone? For one thing, we can do as these two sons did and start making our way back to the Father. We should do so with as much haste and humility as we can summon. Along the way we can count our many blessings and we can applaud the accomplishments of others. Best of all, we can serve others, the finest exercise for the heart ever prescribed. But finally these will not be enough. When we are lost, we can “come to ourselves,” but we may not always be able to “find ourselves,” and, worlds without end, we cannot “save ourselves.” Only the Father and His Only Begotten Son can do that. Salvation is in Them only. So we pray that They will help us, that They will “come out” to meet and embrace us and bring us into the feast They have prepared.</p>

        <span class="language">Buenas tardes, hermanos y hermanas.</span> I bring you greetings from the wonderful members and missionaries in Latin America. As many of you know, Elder and Sister Dallin Oaks and Elder and Sister Holland have been called to serve in the Philippines and Chile Areas of the Church, respectively. If the buzz of conversation is any indication, this has proven to be of more interest to the Church than one might have supposed. Whatever your speculation, I think I am authorized to assure you that we are not going to these distant outposts as two of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. For those looking for a “sign” in all this, please take it as a sign of a wonderful, growing, international Church, with members and missionaries spreading steadily across languages and continents. It is a joy to meet and serve with Latter-day Saints anywhere, near or far, at home or abroad, and we thank you for your prayers and your interest in the work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p2" pid="cqEjKu7y90aQQ3__6V-Zbw" hash="RIfVfA">Such service by the Twelve is, of course, not new, and I must say our generation has less challenge in going out than did our predecessors. Best of all, I have Sister Holland at my side, rather than leaving her at home to fend for herself and our children. Furthermore, I did not have to do manual labor along the way in order to earn the fare to Santiago. We flew to our destination for a few hours in a modern jet airliner rather than sailing for weeks, even months, in the steerage of a ship. I did not leave suffering with chills and fever, cholera, or consumption, although I did have a cold and one leg of our flight was delayed an hour. I have hoped these hardships would qualify me to one day face Peter and Paul, Brigham and Wilford.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p3" pid="rFJrO-Znq0q8gNp5U_twww" hash="TWB1pQ">As did many of you, I grew up on the stories of the early brethren going to Canada, England, Scandinavia, continental Europe, the Pacific Islands, Mexico, Asia, and so on. More recently I have read of Parley P. Pratt’s brief mission to Chile, where the Pratts lost and buried their infant son at Valparaíso. I have read of Elder Melvin J. Ballard, who was called to dedicate South America when that marvelous continent was still one new and rather overwhelming mission field. The service which builds a young, growing Church is not casually requested nor whimsically given. On occasion the obstacles have been great and the price sometimes very dear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p4" pid="FSMRvnjU7U-cIbBOztsaZA" hash="IWgX0Q">And we speak not only of those early brethren who went out to serve, but the women who supported them—and in addition supported themselves and their children, staying at home to raise and protect families, that other portion of the Lord’s vineyard about which He is so emphatic.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p5" pid="DU48OqneI0a0ir_lAou_hg" hash="ASP4Ow">On the day of her husband’s second departure to England, Vilate Kimball was so weak, trembling so severely with ague, that she could do nothing more than weakly shake hands with her husband when he came in tears to say good-bye. Their little David was less than four weeks old then, and only one child, four-year-old Heber Parley, was well enough to carry water for the ailing family. In the hours after her husband’s leaving, Vilate lost all strength and had to be assisted back to the confinement of her bed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p6" pid="UDNc-PGr90qOUGATbLCejg" hash="FL-PIA">Mary Ann Young and her children were equally ill when Brigham left on the same mission, and their financial situation was equally precarious. One heartrending description describes her crossing the Mississippi River in the bitter of winter, thinly clad and shivering with cold, clutching her infant daughter as she went, going to the tithing office in Nauvoo to ask for a few potatoes. Then, still suffering with fever, she made her way with the baby back across the forbidding river, never to write a word to her husband about such difficulties.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p7" pid="ggxrOGS3HkeFCEMTrBxn-g" hash="PqASMw">We seldom face anything like those circumstances today, though many missionaries and members still sacrifice greatly to do the work of the Lord. As blessings come and the Church matures, we all hope that service will never be so difficult as these early members found it, but as missionaries are singing this day from Oslo to Osorno and from Seattle to Cebu, we <span class="emphasis">are</span> “called to serve.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> To raise our families and serve faithfully in the Church, all without running faster than we have strength,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> require wisdom, judgment, divine help—and inevitably some sacrifice. From Adam to the present hour, true faith in the Lord Jesus Christ has always been linked to the offering of sacrifice, our small gift to be a symbolic echo of His majestic offering.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> With his eye firmly on the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Prophet Joseph Smith taught that a religion that does not include covenants of sacrifice cannot have the power to bring the promise of eternal life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p8" pid="hEKAS5lvE0C7PjmwKuBCEQ" hash="4Cg2ZA">May I share just one contemporary example of both the challenge and blessings that our “calls to serve” can bring. A wonderful sister recently said to a dear friend: “I want to tell you about the moment I ceased resenting my husband’s time and sacrifice as a bishop. It had seemed uncanny how an ‘emergency’ would arise with a ward member just when he and I were about to go out to do something special together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p9" pid="HqNWE-LECUS2Yly9Em7YYA" hash="mNl95Q">“One day I poured out my frustration, and my husband agreed we should guarantee, in addition to Monday nights, one additional night a week just for us. Well, the first ‘date night’ came, and we were about to get into the car for an evening together when the telephone rang.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p10" pid="IAmbdfgNdE2efOymJtcZdw" hash="-HDduQ">“‘This is a test,’ I smiled at him. The telephone kept ringing. ‘Remember our agreement. Remember our date. Remember me. Let the phone ring.’ In the end I wasn’t smiling.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p11" pid="xAR8jRo2lk-BNIwGdr3sSA" hash="UDTpCQ">“My poor husband looked trapped between me and a ringing telephone. I really did know that his highest loyalty was to me, and I knew he wanted that evening as much as I did. But he seemed paralyzed by the sound of that telephone.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p15" pid="ljmBQvWzp0-urkp7cGi-sg" hash="Wl6Tiw">“Well, when my husband didn’t return to the car immediately, I knew what was happening. I got out of the car, went into the house, and went to bed. The next morning he spoke a quiet apology, I spoke an even quieter acceptance, and that was the end of it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p16" pid="3Tv-ERdAZ0uy5_naUc97XQ" hash="N9M2lQ">“Or so I thought. I found the event still bothering me several weeks later. I wasn’t blaming my husband, but I was disappointed nevertheless. The memory was still fresh when I came upon a woman in the ward I scarcely knew. Very hesitantly, she asked for the opportunity to talk. She then told of becoming infatuated with another man, who seemed to bring excitement into her life of drudgery, she with a husband who worked full-time and carried a full load of classes at the university. Their apartment was confining. She had small children who were often demanding, noisy, and exhausting. She said: ‘I was sorely tempted to leave what I saw as my wretched state and just go with this man. My situation was such that I felt I deserved better than what I had. My rationalization persuaded me to think I could walk away from my husband, my children, my temple covenants, and my Church and find happiness with a stranger.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p17" pid="YNSCpbWaZUaRkIghgJjldg" hash="y7i52A">“She said: ‘The plan was set; the time for my escape was agreed upon. Yet, as if in a last gasp of sanity, my conscience told me to call your husband, my bishop. I say “conscience,” but I know that was a spiritual prompting directly from heaven. Almost against my will, I called. The telephone rang and rang and rang. Such was the state of my mind that I actually thought, “If the bishop doesn’t answer, that will be a sign I should go through with my plan.” The phone kept ringing, and I was about to hang up and walk straight into destruction when suddenly I heard your husband’s voice. It penetrated my soul like lightning. Suddenly I heard myself sobbing, saying, “Bishop, is that you? I am in trouble. I need help.” Your husband came with help, and I am safe today because he answered that telephone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p18" pid="TkoPNxnta0CRDkYSYuB8KQ" hash="6w-E_g">“‘I look back and realize I was tired and foolish and vulnerable. I love my husband and my children with all my heart. I can’t imagine the tragedy my life would be without them. These are still demanding times for our family. I know everyone has them. But we have addressed some of these issues, and things are looking brighter. They always do eventually.’ Then she said: ‘I don’t know you well, but I wish to thank you for supporting your husband in his calling. I don’t know what the cost for such service has been to you or to your children, but if on a difficult day there is a particularly personal cost, please know how eternally grateful I will be for the sacrifice people like you make to help rescue people like me.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p19" pid="x6s23KePo0igYuSnlAi1BA" hash="N4gUTQ">Brothers and sisters, please understand that I am one who preaches emphatically a more manageable, more realistic expectation of what our bishops and other leaders can do. I especially feel that a wide range of civic, professional, and other demands which take parents, including and especially mothers, out of homes where children are being raised is among the most serious problems in contemporary society. And because I am adamant about spouses and children deserving sacred, committed time with a husband and father, nine times out of ten I would have been right alongside that wife telling her husband <span class="emphasis">not</span> to answer that telephone. But I am as grateful in my own way as that young woman was in hers that in this instance this good man followed the prompting of the Spirit and responded to his “call”—in this case, literally—his “call to serve.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p20" pid="6k4AwjGzV0mgJkkeDkGXhg" hash="Bo6dwQ">I testify of home and family and marriage, the most precious human possessions of our lives. I testify of the need to protect and preserve them while we find time and ways to serve faithfully in the Church. In what I hope are rare moments when these seem to be in conflict, when we find an hour or a day or a night of crisis when duty and spiritual prompting require our response, in those situations I pay tribute to every wife who has ever sat alone while dinner got cold, every husband who has made his own dinner, which with him as cook was bound to be cold anyway, and every child who has ever been disappointed in a postponed camping trip or a ball game a parent unexpectedly had to miss (and that better not be very often!). I pay tribute to every mission president and his wife, their children, and every senior couple called to serve with them, and all others who for a season miss births and baptisms, weddings and funerals, family and fun experiences in response to a “call to serve.” I thank all who, in challenging circumstances across the Church, do the best they can to build the kingdom of God on earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/called-to-serve.p21" pid="ihbs9mbjw0KyJoipwe70Uw" hash="1PGJbg">I testify of the sacrifice and service of the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave everything for us and in that spirit of giving said “follow thou me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> “If any man serve me, let him follow me,” He said, “and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Such service inevitably brings challenging decisions about how to balance priorities and how best to be the disciples He wishes us to be. I thank Him for His divine guidance in helping us make those decisions and for assisting us to find the right way for all concerned. I thank Him that “he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> and that He has called us to do some of the same for each other. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p7" pid="RHfvuKA0DkKONNocLJTXMQ" hash="r0QdTg">In such times as we are in, whether the threats be global or local or in individual lives, I too pray for the children. Some days it seems that a sea of temptation and transgression inundates them, simply washes over them before they can successfully withstand it, before they should have to face it. And often at least some of the forces at work seem beyond our personal control.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p8" pid="Zt67arWaQU-HontVqBbQvA" hash="sBcTLg">Well, some of them may be beyond our control, but I testify with faith in the living God that they are not beyond His. He lives, and priesthood power is at work on both sides of the veil. We are not alone, and we do not tremble as if abandoned. In doing our part, we can live the gospel and defend its principles. We can declare to others the sure Way, the saving Truth, the joyful Life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> We can personally repent in any way we need to repent, and when we have done all, we can pray. In all these ways we can bless one another and especially those who need our protection the most—the children. As parents we can hold life together the way it is always held together—with love and faith, passed on to the next generation, one child at a time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p9" pid="ArcOQroCY0mNVB-6r7Uc3Q" hash="MwFO5w">In offering such a prayer for the young, may I address a rather specific aspect of their safety? In this I speak carefully and lovingly to any of the adults of the Church, parents or otherwise, who may be given to cynicism or skepticism, who in matters of whole-souled devotion always seem to hang back a little, who at the Church’s doctrinal campsite always like to pitch their tents out on the periphery of religious faith. To all such—whom we do love and wish were more comfortable camping nearer to us—I say, please be aware that the full price to be paid for such a stance does not always come due in your lifetime. No, sadly, some elements of this can be a kind of profligate national debt, with payments coming out of your children’s and grandchildren’s pockets in far more expensive ways than you ever intended it to be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p10" pid="fzFhIbJHA0-E0rdb2OSQIw" hash="K-WlEw">In this Church there is an enormous amount of room—and scriptural commandment—for studying and learning, for comparing and considering, for discussion and awaiting further revelation. We all learn “line upon line, precept upon precept,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> with the goal being authentic religious faith informing genuine Christlike living. In this there is no place for coercion or manipulation, no place for intimidation or hypocrisy. But no child in this Church should be left with uncertainty about his or her parents’ devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Restoration of His Church, and the reality of living prophets and apostles who, now as in earlier days, lead that Church according to “the will of the Lord, … the mind of the Lord, … the word of the Lord, … and the power of God unto salvation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> In such basic matters of faith, prophets do not apologize for requesting unity, indeed conformity, in the eloquent sense that the Prophet Joseph Smith used that latter word.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> In any case, as Elder Neal Maxwell once said to me in a hallway conversation, “There didn’t seem to be any problem with conformity the day the Red Sea opened.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p11" pid="Sy8GwNqLwUCXXpLWvT73Fw" hash="SaGygw">Parents simply cannot flirt with skepticism or cynicism, then be surprised when their children expand that flirtation into full-blown romance. If in matters of faith and belief children are at risk of being swept downstream by this intellectual current or that cultural rapid, we as their parents must be more certain than ever to hold to anchored, unmistakable moorings clearly recognizable to those of our own household. It won’t help anyone if we go over the edge with them, explaining through the roar of the falls all the way down that we really did know the Church was true and that the keys of the priesthood really were lodged there but we just didn’t want to stifle anyone’s freedom to think otherwise. No, we can hardly expect the children to get to shore safely if the parents don’t seem to know where to anchor their own boat. Isaiah once used a variation on such imagery when he said of unbelievers, “[Their] tacklings are loosed; they could not … strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p12" pid="Plyuvc_0uU6M8b3v-SFyDA" hash="ftJL3g">I think some parents may not understand that even when they feel secure in their own minds regarding matters of personal testimony, they can nevertheless make that faith too difficult for their children to detect. We can be reasonably active, meeting-going Latter-day Saints, but if we do not live lives of gospel integrity and convey to our children powerful heartfelt convictions regarding the truthfulness of the Restoration and the divine guidance of the Church from the First Vision to this very hour, then those children may, to our regret but not surprise, turn out <span class="emphasis">not</span> to be visibly active, meeting-going Latter-day Saints or sometimes anything close to it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p13" pid="otFgMfPIukaB-hP3gmdThg" hash="oQlsAA">Not long ago Sister Holland and I met a fine young man who came in contact with us after he had been roaming around through the occult and sorting through a variety of Eastern religions, all in an attempt to find religious faith. His father, he admitted, believed in nothing whatsoever. But his grandfather, he said, was actually a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “But he didn’t do much with it,” the young man said. “He was always pretty cynical about the Church.” From a grandfather who is cynical to a son who is agnostic to a grandson who is now looking desperately for what God had already once given his family! What a classic example of the warning Elder Richard L. Evans once gave.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p14" pid="vjb8PGWQK021sZJaxmUNZg" hash="tDidVA">Said he: “Sometimes some parents mistakenly feel that they can relax a little as to conduct and conformity or take perhaps a so called liberal view of basic and fundamental things—thinking that a little laxness or indulgence won’t matter—or they may fail to teach or to attend Church, or may voice critical views. Some parents … seem to feel that they can ease up a little on the fundamentals without affecting their family or their family’s future. <span class="emphasis">But,”</span> he observed, <span class="emphasis">“if a parent goes a little off course, the children are likely to exceed the parent’s example.”</span><span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p15" pid="uP73ugZdV0-Bqq_SnyoTNQ" hash="_FamHQ">To lead a child (or anyone else!), even inadvertently, away from faithfulness, away from loyalty and bedrock belief simply because we want to be clever or independent is license no parent nor any other person has ever been given. In matters of religion a skeptical mind is not a higher manifestation of virtue than is a believing heart, and analytical deconstruction in the field of, say, literary fiction can be just plain old-fashioned destruction when transferred to families yearning for faith at home. And such a deviation from the true course can be deceptively slow and subtle in its impact. As one observer said, “[If you raise the temperature of my] bath water … only 1 degree every 10 minutes, how [will I] know when to scream?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p16" pid="vzg7r7NC1EOsY3nQcbG5zA" hash="KbJrfw">When erecting their sacred tabernacle in the wilderness of Sinai, the ancient children of Israel were commanded to make firm their supporting cords and strengthen the stakes which held them.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> The reason? Storms arise in life—regularly. So fix it, fasten it, then fix and fasten it again. Even then we know that some children will make choices that break their parents’ hearts. Moms and dads can do everything right and yet have children who stray. Moral agency still obtains. But even in such painful hours it will be comforting for you to know that your children knew of your abiding faith in Christ, in His true Church, in the keys of the priesthood and in those who hold them. It will be comforting then for you to know that if your children choose to leave the straight and narrow way, they leave it very conscious that their parents were firmly in it. Furthermore, they will be much more likely to return to that path when they come to themselves<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> and recall the loving example and gentle teachings you offered them there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p17" pid="KDrjzTXnBEKw1bxTwVD_LQ" hash="RRQEUw">Live the gospel as conspicuously as you can. Keep the covenants your children know you have made. Give priesthood blessings. And bear your testimony!<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Don’t just assume your children will somehow get the drift of your beliefs on their own. The prophet Nephi said near the end of his life that they had written their record of Christ and preserved their convictions regarding His gospel in order “to <span class="emphasis">persuade</span> our children … that our children may <span class="emphasis">know</span> … [and believe] the right way.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p18" pid="JSJnOxXjs02TZc0QTDkZqg" hash="cUYgZQ">Nephi-like, might we ask ourselves what our children know? From us? Personally? Do our children know that we love the scriptures? Do they see us reading them and marking them and clinging to them in daily life? Have our children ever unexpectedly opened a closed door and found us on our knees in prayer? Have they heard us not only pray <span class="emphasis">with</span> them but also pray <span class="emphasis">for</span> them out of nothing more than sheer parental love? Do our children know we believe in fasting as something more than an obligatory first-Sunday-of-the-month hardship? Do they know that we have fasted for them and for their future on days about which they knew nothing? Do they know we love being in the temple, not least because it provides a bond to them that neither death nor the legions of hell can break? Do they know we love and sustain local and general leaders, imperfect as they are, for their willingness to accept callings they did not seek in order to preserve a standard of righteousness they did not create? Do those children know that we love God with all our heart and that we long to see the face—and fall at the feet—of His Only Begotten Son? I pray that they know this.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p19" pid="eztu4U73Fk-vm1HWcbGU4g" hash="4PX9BQ">Brothers and sisters, our children take their flight into the future with our thrust and with our aim. And even as we anxiously watch that arrow in flight and know all the evils that can deflect its course after it has left our hand, nevertheless we take courage in remembering that the most important mortal factor in determining that arrow’s destination will be the stability, strength, and unwavering certainty of the holder of the bow.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-prayer-for-the-children.p20" pid="7nQykkA3yk2foAWXgkf3mw" hash="dF_N4w">Carl Sandburg once said, “A baby is God’s opinion that life should go on.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> For that baby’s future as well as your own, be strong. Be believing. Keep loving and keep testifying. Keep praying. Those prayers will be heard and answered in the most unexpected hour. God will send aid to no one more readily than He will send it to a child—and to the parent of a child.</p>

His followers did not understand it fully at the time, and many in modern Christianity do not grasp it now, but the Savior Himself spoke of it repeatedly and emphatically. It is the grand truth that in all that Jesus came to say and do, including and especially in His atoning suffering and sacrifice, He was showing us who and what God our Eternal Father is like, how completely devoted He is to His children in every age and nation. In word and in deed Jesus was trying to reveal and make personal to us the true nature of His Father, our Father in Heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-grandeur-of-god.p2" pid="mSSdAakQNEipnYQqgvJ6pg" hash="feoBCg">He did this at least in part because then and now all of us need to know God more fully in order to love Him more deeply and obey Him more completely. As both Old and New Testaments declare, “The first of all the commandments is … thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first [and great] commandment.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-grandeur-of-god.p3" pid="gJbP1H2TB0G1Q1qSLNMpkw" hash="ZboUqw">Little wonder then that the Prophet Joseph Smith taught: “It is the first principle of the gospel to know for a certainty the character of God.” “I want you all to know Him,” he said, “and to be familiar with Him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> We must have “a <span class="emphasis">correct</span> idea of his … perfections, and attributes,” an admiration for “the excellency of [His] character.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Thus the first phrase we utter in the declaration of our faith is, “We believe in God, the Eternal Father.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> So, emphatically, did Jesus. Even as He acknowledged His own singular role in the divine plan, the Savior nevertheless insisted on this prayerful preamble: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-grandeur-of-god.p4" pid="sHh3MMCHP0yEvKS1CxV83w" hash="O9WJYw">After generations of prophets had tried to teach the family of man the will and the way of the Father, usually with little success, God in His ultimate effort to have us know Him, sent to earth His Only Begotten and perfect Son, created in His very likeness and image, to live and serve among mortals in the everyday rigors of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-grandeur-of-god.p5" pid="JMJawbbqgEWNMAJO66-kYA" hash="w2Ad7w">To come to earth with such a responsibility, to stand in place of Elohim—speaking as He would speak, judging and serving, loving and warning, forbearing and forgiving as He would do—this is a duty of such staggering proportions that you and I cannot comprehend such a thing. But in the loyalty and determination that would be characteristic of a divine child, Jesus could comprehend it and He did it. Then, when the praise and honor began to come, He humbly directed all adulation to the Father.</p>

Among these there is a tendency to feel distant from the Father, even estranged from Him, if they believe in Him at all. And if they do believe, many moderns say they might feel comfortable in the arms of Jesus, but they are uneasy contemplating the stern encounter of God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Through a misreading (and surely, in some cases, a mistranslation) of the Bible, these see God the Father and Jesus Christ His Son as operating very differently, this in spite of the fact that in both the Old Testament and the New, the Son of God is one and the same, acting as He always does under the direction of the Father, who is Himself the same “yesterday, today, and forever.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-grandeur-of-god.p8" pid="3sITEPK0_EKe8Nzk1mN53g" hash="lDaeew">In reflecting on these misconceptions we realize that one of the remarkable contributions of the Book of Mormon is its seamless, perfectly consistent view of divinity throughout that majestic book. Here there is no Malachi-to-Matthew gap, no pause while we shift theological gears, no misreading the God who is urgently, lovingly, faithfully at work on every page of that record from its Old Testament beginning to its New Testament end. Yes, in an effort to give the world back its Bible and a correct view of Deity with it, what we have in the Book of Mormon is a uniform view of God in all His glory and goodness, all His richness and complexity—including and especially as again demonstrated through a personal appearance of His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.</p>

He says in wonder and amazement to this most powerful Being in the universe: “How is it that thou canst weep? … Thou art just [and] merciful and kind forever; … Peace … is the habitation of thy throne; and mercy shall go before thy face and have no end; how is it thou canst weep?”</p>

It also helps us understand much more emphatically that vivid moment in the Book of Mormon allegory of the olive tree, when after digging and dunging, watering and weeding, trimming, pruning, transplanting, and grafting, the great Lord of the vineyard throws down his spade and his pruning shears and weeps, crying out to any who would listen, “What could I have done more for my vineyard?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-grandeur-of-god.p14" pid="JVyAQ6EtMkqxT2WOvLxjjA" hash="HGBHwg">Of course the centuries-long drift away from belief in such a perfect and caring Father hasn’t been helped any by the man-made creeds of erring generations which describe God variously as unknown and unknowable—formless, passionless, elusive, ethereal, simultaneously everywhere and nowhere at all. Certainly that does not describe the Being we behold through the eyes of these prophets. Nor does it match the living, breathing, embodied Jesus of Nazareth who was and is in “the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his [Father].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

The plan of God, the power of God, the holiness of God, yes, even the anger and the judgment of God they had occasion to understand. But the love of God, the profound depth of His devotion to His children, they still did not fully know—until Christ came.</p>

In addition to the witness of the ancients we also have the modern miracle of Palmyra, the appearance of God the Father and His Beloved Son, the Savior of the world, to the boy prophet Joseph Smith. I testify of that appearance, and in the words of that prophet I, too, declare: “Our heavenly Father is more liberal in His views, and boundless in His mercies and blessings, than we are ready to believe or receive. … God does not look on sin with [the least degree of] allowance, but … the nearer we get to our heavenly Father, the more we are disposed to look with compassion on perishing souls; we feel that we want to take them upon our shoulders, and cast their sins behind our backs.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p1" pid="bj5GMeYSdUuCWVuMQwqKqg" hash="XSxNkQ">In earlier years the Brethren often reported their missions in general conference. I realize this is 2004, not 1904, but I wish to invoke the spirit of that earlier practice and reflect on some of the wonderful things Sister Holland and I are experiencing in Latin America. In doing so I hope to make general application to all of you, wherever you may live or serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p2" pid="QrQwYnLQ-EuJacV1v-inLg" hash="Jvm51w">First of all I would like to thank every missionary who has ever labored in this transcendent latter-day undertaking we have been given. The rolling forth of the restored gospel is a miracle in every sense of the word, and not the least of the miracle is that a significant portion of it rolls forward on the shoulders of 19-year-olds! As we have seen your sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, (and in some cases your parents and grandparents!) faithfully laboring in Chile, I have pictured the tens of thousands of others like them we have met all over the world. Clean, clear, bright-eyed missionaries, laboring two-by-two, have become a living symbol of this Church everywhere. They themselves are the first gospel message their investigators encounter—and what a message that is. Everyone knows who they are, and those of us who know them the best, love them the most.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p3" pid="QbUGSv_RakStKDwTSQluNQ" hash="hVOivQ">I wish you could meet the sister called to serve with us from her native Argentina. Wanting to do everything possible to finance her own mission, she sold her violin, her most prized and nearly sole earthly possession. She said simply, “God will bless me with another violin after I have blessed His children with the gospel of Jesus Christ.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p4" pid="DGO7dh6fD0ixZ3rZvL2yYA" hash="BYrZfA">I wish you could meet the Chilean elder who, living without family in a boarding school, happened upon a Book of Mormon and started reading it that very evening. Reminiscent of Parley P. Pratt’s experience, he read insatiably—nonstop through the night. With the breaking of day, he was overwhelmed with a profound sense of peace and a new spirit of hope. He determined to find out where this book had come from and who had written its marvelous pages. Thirteen months later he was on a mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p5" pid="KdMdbm3jp020zmJvfB8M8Q" hash="3R1D1g">I wish you could meet the marvelous young man who came to us from Bolivia, arriving with no matching clothing and shoes three sizes too large for him. He was a little older because he was the sole breadwinner in his home and it had taken some time to earn money for his mission. He raised chickens and sold the eggs door-to-door. Then, just as his call finally came, his widowed mother faced an emergency appendectomy. Our young friend gave every cent of the money he had earned for his mission to pay for his mother’s surgery and postoperative care, then quietly rounded up what used clothing he could from friends and arrived at the MTC in Santiago on schedule. I can assure you that his clothes now match, his shoes now fit, and both he and his mother are safe and sound, temporally as well as spiritually.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p6" pid="3_VPA36whE-4xSCDoA5aPg" hash="F-I4nA">And so they come, from your homes all over the world. Included in such a long list of dedicated servants of the Lord is an increasing number of senior couples who make an indispensable contribution to the work. How we love and need couples in virtually every mission of this Church! Those of you who can, put away your golf clubs, don’t worry about the stock market, realize that your grandchildren will still be your grandchildren when you return—and go! We promise you the experience of a lifetime.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p7" pid="YngG6v1KrEG-z0Gyad5L0Q" hash="P8lDiA">Let me say something of the marvelous members of the Church themselves. In the reorganization of a rather far-flung stake recently, I felt the Lord’s prompting to call a man to the stake presidency who, I had been told, owned a bicycle but no automobile. Many leaders across the Church don’t have cars, but I was nevertheless worried about what that might mean for this man in this particular stake. In my terminally-ill Spanish I pursued the interview, then said, <span class="language">
	  <span class="emphasis">“Hermano, ¿no tiene un auto?”</span>
	</span> With a smile and not a second’s hesitation he replied, <span class="language">
	  <span class="emphasis">“No tengo un auto; pero yo tengo pies, yo tengo fe.”</span>
	</span> (“I do not have a car, but I do have feet and I do have faith.”) He then said he could ride the bus, ride his bicycle, or walk, <span class="language">
	  <span class="emphasis">“como los misioneros,”</span>
	</span> he smiled—“like the missionaries.” And so he does.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p8" pid="THF5dAHRr0uCd5Vm6Y7cbw" hash="ae5DEg">Just eight weeks ago I was holding a mission district conference on the island of Chiloe, an interior location in the south of Chile that gets few visitors. Imagine the responsibility I felt in addressing these beautiful people when it was pointed out to me that a very elderly man seated near the front of the chapel had set out on foot at five o’clock that morning, walking for four hours to be in his seat by nine o’clock, for a meeting that was not scheduled to begin until eleven o’clock. He said he wanted to get a good seat. I looked into his eyes, thought of times in my life when I had been either too casual or too late, and thought of Jesus’ phrase, “I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p9" pid="Btf-BqOB60G9jsMWXOXbxA" hash="5jPSCg">The Punta Arenas Chile Stake is the Church’s southernmost stake anywhere on this planet, its outermost borders stretching toward Antarctica. Any stake farther south would have to be staffed by penguins. For the Punta Arenas Saints it is a 4,200-mile round-trip bus ride to the Santiago temple. For a husband and wife it can take up to 20 percent of an annual local income just for the transportation alone. Only 50 people can be accommodated on the bus, but for every excursion 250 others come out to hold a brief service with them the morning of their departure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p10" pid="2XJFNGkEgUSapa2ovO-MgQ" hash="Yx_vGA">Pause for a minute and ask yourself when was the last time you stood on a cold, windswept parking lot adjacent to the Strait of Magellan just to sing with, pray for, and cheer on their way those who were going to the temple, hoping your savings would allow you to go next time? One hundred ten hours, 70 of those on dusty, bumpy, unfinished roads looping out through Argentina’s wild Patagonia. What does 110 hours on a bus feel like? I honestly don’t know, but I do know that some of us get nervous if we live more than 110 miles from a temple or if the services there take more than 110 minutes. While we are teaching the principle of tithing to, praying with, and building ever more temples for just such distant Latter-day Saints, perhaps the rest of us can do more to enjoy the blessings and wonder of the temple regularly when so many temples are increasingly within our reach.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p11" pid="Z5xi7bLl_E6JeebdSxuMXw" hash="wle-RQ">And that leads me to my final point. For the Church at large, we have so many things to associate in our minds with the visionary ministry of President Gordon B. Hinckley, including (perhaps especially) the vast expansion of temples and temple building. But I dare say for those of us on this rostrum, it is likely that we will remember him at least as emphatically for his determination to retain in permanent activity the converts who join this Church. No modern prophet has addressed this issue more directly nor expected more from us in seeing that it happen. With a twinkle in his eye and a hand smacking the table in front of him, he said to the Twelve recently, “Brethren, when my life is finished and the final services are concluding, I am going to rise up as I go by, look each of you in the eye, and say, ‘How are we doing on retention?’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p12" pid="dizc4RAIyE-A34ypq4qXlg" hash="7H4XEg">This subject brings us full circle, linking the kind of true, deep conversion the missionaries are striving to bring with the greater commitment and devotion being seen in wonderful members all over the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p13" pid="FNbYlURp5Uq3vU666hGshA" hash="FeeMUw">Christ said, “I am the true vine, and … ye are the branches.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p14" pid="DFaCwvqmWUOki-FjMyc5tw" hash="p5EczQ">“Abide in me” is an understandable and beautiful enough concept in the elegant English of the King James Bible, but “abide” is not a word we use much anymore. So I gained even more appreciation for this admonition from the Lord when I was introduced to the translation of this passage in another language. In Spanish that familiar phrase is rendered <span class="emphasis">“permaneced en mi.”</span> Like the English verb “abide,” <span class="emphasis">permanecer </span>means “to remain, to stay,” but even gringos like me can hear the root cognate there of “permanence.” The sense of this then is “stay—but stay <span class="emphasis">forever.</span>” That is the call of the gospel message to Chileans and everyone else in the world. Come, but come to remain. Come with conviction and endurance. Come permanently, for your sake and the sake of all the generations who must follow you, and we will help each other be strong to the very end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p15" pid="G9St4AXxLEizhURRCCTDkg" hash="xQeOjQ">“He who picks up one end of the stick, picks up the other,” my marvelous mission president taught in his very first message to us.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> And that is the way it is supposed to be when we join this, the true and living Church of the true and living God. When we join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we board the Good Ship Zion and sail with her wherever she goes until she comes into that millennial port. <span class="emphasis">We stay in the boat,</span> through squalls and stills, through storms and sunburn, because that is the only way to the promised land. This Church is the Lord’s vehicle for crucial doctrines, ordinances, covenants, and keys that are essential to exaltation, and one cannot be fully faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ without striving to be faithful in the Church, which is its earthly institutional manifestation. To new convert and longtime member alike, we declare in the spirit of Nephi’s powerful valedictory exhortation: “Ye have entered in by the gate; … [but] now, … after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; … press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, … and endure to the end, behold, thus … ye shall have eternal life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/abide-in-me.p16" pid="eIf-olmdVUK9YVCOWDOyHg" hash="lt23WQ">Jesus said, “Without me ye can do nothing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> I testify that that is God’s truth. Christ is everything to us and we are to “abide” in Him permanently, unyieldingly, steadfastly, forever. For the fruit of the gospel to blossom and bless our lives, we must be firmly attached to Him, the Savior of us all, and to this His Church, which bears His holy name. He is the vine that is our true source of strength and the only source of eternal life. In Him we not only will endure but also will prevail and triumph in this holy cause that will never fail us. May we never fail it nor fail Him I pray in the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In New Testament times, in Book of Mormon times, and in modern times these officers form the foundation stones of the true Church, positioned around and gaining their strength from the chief cornerstone, “the rock of our Redeemer, who is [Jesus] Christ, the Son of God,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> He who is the great “Apostle and High Priest of our profession,” to use Paul’s phrase.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Such a foundation in Christ was and is always to be a protection in days “when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you.” In such days as we are now in—and will more or less always be in—the storms of life “shall have no power over you … because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

Following the delightful events of that weekend a sister silently slipped me a note as she and others came by to shake hands and say good-bye. With some hesitation I share a portion of it with you this morning. Please focus on the doctrine this sister teaches, not the participants in the exchange.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/prophets-seers-and-revelators.p10" pid="piVJAxewiUqhmwuwkcOflg" hash="nNmmEQ">“Dear Elder Holland, thank you for the testimony you bore in this conference of the Savior and His love. Forty-one years ago I prayed earnestly to the Lord and told Him I wished I had lived on earth when the Apostles walked upon it, when there had been a true Church, and when Christ’s voice was still heard. Within a year of that prayer Heavenly Father sent two LDS missionaries to me, and I found that all those hopes could be realized. Perhaps some hour when you are tired or troubled, this note will help you remember why hearing your voice and shaking your hand is so important to me and to millions just like me. Your sister in love and gratitude, Gloria Clements.”</p>

In the tumultuous years of the first settlements in this nation, Roger Williams, my volatile and determined 10th great-grandfather, fled—not entirely of his own volition—from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and settled in what is now the state of Rhode Island. He called his headquarters Providence, the very name itself revealing his lifelong quest for divine interventions and heavenly manifestations. But he never found what he felt was the true New Testament church of earlier times. Of this disappointed seeker the legendary Cotton Mather said, “Mr. Williams [finally] told [his followers] ‘that being himself misled, he had [misled them,’ and] he was now satisfied that there was none upon earth that could administer baptism [or any of the ordinances of the gospel], … [so] he advised them therefore to <span class="emphasis">forego</span> all … and wait for the coming of <span class="emphasis">new</span> apostles.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Roger Williams did not live to see those longed-for new Apostles raised up, but in a future time I hope to be able to tell him personally that his posterity did live to see such.</p>

One of the most famous of the New England preachers, Jonathan Edwards, said, “It seems to me a[n] … unreasonable thing, to suppose that there should be a God … that has so much concern [for us], … and yet that he should never speak, … that there should be no word [from him].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/prophets-seers-and-revelators.p13" pid="PXnEsWRKBkexYcYJTVWxnA" hash="QgDgow">Later, the incomparable Ralph Waldo Emerson rocked the very foundations of New England ecclesiastical orthodoxy when he said to the Divinity School at Harvard: “It is my duty to say to you that the need was never greater [for] new revelation than now.” “The doctrine of inspiration is lost. … Miracles, prophecy, … the holy life, exist as ancient history [only]. … Men have come to speak of … revelation as somewhat long ago given and done, as if God were dead. … It is the office of a true teacher,” he warned, “to show us that God is, not was; that He speaketh, not spake.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> In essence, Mr. Emerson was saying, “If you persist in handing out stones when people ask for bread, they will eventually stop coming to the bakery.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

Prophets? Seers? Revelators? The events of 1820 and 1830, and the events of nearly two centuries that have followed, declare that revelations and those who receive them are not “long ago given and done.”</p>

In that calling Elder Taylor once said in sympathy with honest seekers of truth: “Whoever heard of true religion without communication with God? To me the thing is the most absurd that the human mind could conceive of. I do not wonder,” said Brother Taylor, “[that] when the people generally reject the principle of present revelation, skepticism and infidelity prevail to such an alarming extent. I do not wonder,” he continued, “that so many men treat religion with contempt, and regard it as something not worth the attention of intelligent beings, for without revelation religion is a mockery and a farce. … <span class="emphasis">The principle of present revelation … is the very foundation of our religion.”</span><span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

The very foundation of our religion? Let me return from those foundations to the present, the here and now, the 21st century. For one and all—ecclesiastics, historians, and laymen alike—the issue is still the same. Are the heavens open? Does God reveal His will to prophets and apostles as in days of old? That they are and that He does is the unflinching declaration of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to all the world. And in that declaration lies the significance of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, for nearly 200 years now.</p>

As a good friend and faithful LDS scholar has succinctly put it, “At a time when the origins of Christianity were under assault by the forces of Enlightenment rationality, Joseph Smith [unequivocally and singlehandedly] returned modern Christianity to its origins in revelation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

We give thanks for that morning in the spring of 1820 when the Father and the Son appeared in glory to a 14-year-old boy. We give thanks for that morning when Peter, James, and John came to restore the keys of the holy priesthood and all the offices in it. And in our generation we give thanks for the morning of September 30, 1961, 43 years ago this weekend, when (then) Elder Gordon B. Hinckley was called to the apostleship, the 75th man in this dispensation to be so named. And so it goes down to a day such as this, and so it will go continually until the Savior comes.</p>

Hinckley has added his testimony when he said: “[The priesthood] is a delegation of divine authority, different from all other powers and authorities on the face of the earth. … It is the only power on the earth that reaches beyond the veil of death. … Without it there could be a church in name only, [a church] lacking authority to administer in the things of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

To His senior Apostle Peter He said, “I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Six days later He took Peter, James, and John to a mountaintop where He was transfigured in glory before them. Then prophets from earlier dispensations, including at least Moses and Elijah,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> appeared in glory also and conferred the various keys and powers that each held.</p>

But part of the modern miracle and marvelous history we celebrate tonight is the return of those same heavenly messengers in our day and the restoration of those same powers they held for the blessing of all mankind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/our-most-distinguishing-feature.p10" pid="-SYiHbV2CkWERJlh2JY0-w" hash="ybkYow">In May of 1829 while translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith came across a reference to baptism. He discussed the matter with his scribe, Oliver Cowdery, and the two earnestly supplicated the Lord regarding the matter. Oliver wrote: “Our souls were drawn out in mighty prayer, to know how we might obtain the blessings of baptism and of the Holy Spirit. … <span class="emphasis">We diligently sought for … the authority </span><span class="emphasis">of the holy priesthood, and the power to administer in the same.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/our-most-distinguishing-feature.p11" pid="BNkW80uAtU2wWiDSiZRhrA" hash="dL4Z0g">In response to that “mighty prayer,” John the Baptist came, restoring the keys and powers of the Aaronic Priesthood, which our young men in this audience tonight have been given. A few weeks later Peter, James, and John returned to restore the keys and powers of the Melchizedek Priesthood, including the keys of the apostleship. Then when a temple had been built to which other heavenly messengers might come, there unfolded on April 3, 1836, a modern-day equivalent of that earlier Mount of Transfiguration, part of something President Hinckley once called the “Kirtland cascade” of revelation in which the Savior Himself, plus Moses, Elijah, and Elias, appeared in glory to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and conferred keys and powers from their respective dispensations upon these men. That visit was then concluded with this thunderous declaration, “Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

It cannot be generated by theological training or a commission from the congregation. No, in the authorized work of God there has to be power greater than that already possessed by the people in the pews or in the streets or in the seminaries—a fact that many honest religious seekers had known and openly acknowledged for generations leading up to the Restoration.</p>

Breaking ecclesiastically with his more famous brother John over the latter’s decision to ordain without authority to do so, Charles wrote with a smile:</p>

The years of 1836 and 1837 were as difficult as that young Church had ever faced—financially, politically, and internally. In the midst of that stress, Joseph Smith had the remarkable prophetic prompting to send some of his ablest men (ultimately the entire Quorum of the Twelve Apostles) abroad on missions. It was a bold, inspired move, one that would in the end save the Church from the perils of the day, but in the near term it imposed great burdens on the Saints—painful for those who went away and perhaps even more painful for those who stayed at home.</p>

I would have retired, thinking that I was intruding, but I felt riveted to the spot. The father was pouring out his soul to … [God, pleading] that He who ‘careth for sparrows, and feedeth the young ravens when they cry’ would supply the wants of his wife and little ones in his absence. He then, like the patriarchs, and by virtue of his office, laid his hands upon their heads individually, leaving a father’s blessing upon them, … commending them to the care and protection of God, while he should be engaged preaching the Gospel in a foreign land. While thus engaged [in giving those blessings] his voice was almost lost in the sobs of those around [him], who [were trying in their youthful way to be strong but having a very hard time doing so.] … He proceeded, but his heart was too much affected to do so regularly. … He was obliged to stop at intervals, while … big tears rolled down his cheeks, an index to the feelings which reigned in his bosom. My heart was not stout enough to refrain,” said Brother Thompson. “In spite of myself I wept, and mingled my tears with theirs. At the same time I felt thankful that I had the privilege of contemplating such a scene.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/our-most-distinguishing-feature.p20" pid="GLXLGY-9bkuUlxH8aLprsg" hash="5DKsSw">That scene has been reenacted one way or another a thousand times, a hundred thousand times, in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—a fear, a need, a call, a danger, a sickness, an accident, a death. I have been a participant in such moments. I have beheld the power of God manifest in my home and in my ministry. I have seen evil rebuked and the elements controlled. I know what it means to have mountains of difficulty move and ominous Red Seas part. I know what it means to have the destroying angel “pass by them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> To have received the authority and to have exercised the power of “the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> is as great a blessing for me and for my family as I could ever hope for in this world. And that, in the end, is the meaning of the priesthood in everyday terms—its unequaled, unending, constant capacity to bless.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p1" pid="KmHKH0_6rEKn2D3qRKRoWA" hash="U3UTLA">Father Time played a rude trick on me just a few months ago. I arose one morning all bright eyed and bushy tailed, greeted the dawn with a smile—only to realize suddenly that with the birthday to be celebrated that day I now had a teenage grandchild. I thought about it for a minute and then did what any responsible, dignified adult would do. I got back in bed and pulled the covers over my head.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p2" pid="y3KB9iMAkUq_nt7zLv6SWw" hash="eFojQw">Traditional joking aside about the harrowing experience of raising teenagers, I want to say to my own granddaughter and the vast majority of the youth of the Church whom I meet around the world how extraordinarily proud we are of you. Moral and physical danger exists almost everywhere around you and temptations of a dozen kinds present themselves daily, yet most of you strive to do what is right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p3" pid="FwDKpDD1ykClRM7wz3dwTg" hash="rZzcuQ">This afternoon I wish to raise my voice in praise of you, to express my love, my encouragement, and my admiration for you. Because this precious eldest grandchild of whom I spoke is a young woman, I am going to address my remarks to the young women of the Church, but I hope the spirit of what I say can apply to women and men of all ages. However today, as Maurice Chevalier used to sing, I want to “thank heaven for little girls.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p4" pid="U0R53GPBxUa7xI0OLbZwOg" hash="LVFkkA">First of all, I want you to be proud you are a woman. I want you to feel the reality of what that means, to know who you truly are. You are literally a spirit daughter of heavenly parents with a divine nature and an eternal destiny.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> That surpassing truth should be fixed deep in your soul and be fundamental to every decision you make as you grow into mature womanhood. There could never be a greater authentication of your dignity, your worth, your privileges, and your promise. Your Father in Heaven knows your name and knows your circumstance. He hears your prayers. He knows your hopes and dreams, including your fears and frustrations. And He knows what you can become through faith in Him. Because of this divine heritage you, along with all of your spiritual sisters and brothers, have full equality in His sight and are empowered through obedience to become a rightful heir in His eternal kingdom, an “[heir] of God, and joint-[heir] with Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Seek to comprehend the significance of these doctrines. Everything Christ taught He taught to women as well as men. Indeed, in the restored light of the gospel of Jesus Christ, a woman, including a young woman, occupies a majesty all her own in the divine design of the Creator. You are, as Elder James E. Talmage once phrased it, “a sanctified investiture which none shall dare profane.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p5" pid="t56v4BOBBkefQ5kNBCaBJw" hash="wOjeBQ">Be a woman of Christ. Cherish your esteemed place in the sight of God. He needs you. This Church needs you. The world needs you. A woman’s abiding trust in God and unfailing devotion to things of the Spirit have always been an anchor when the wind and the waves of life were fiercest.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> I say to you what the Prophet Joseph said more than 150 years ago: “If you live up to your privileges, the angels cannot be restrained from being your associates.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p6" pid="ujE5oWeN90OA1Ru2Pex3yw" hash="2TNYIg">All of this is to try to tell you how your Father in Heaven feels about you and what He has designed for you to become. And if for a time any of you are less visionary than this or seem bent on living beneath your privilege, then we express even greater love for you and plead with you to make your teenage years a triumph, not a tragedy. Fathers and mothers, prophets and apostles have no motive except to bless your life and to spare you every possible heartache we can spare you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p7" pid="DleITdrnwEC-iAfEsqsudQ" hash="noqEMg">For you to fully claim Heavenly Father’s blessings and protection, we ask you to stay true to the standards of the gospel of Jesus Christ and <span class="emphasis">not</span> slavishly follow the whims of fads and fashions. The Church will never deny your moral agency regarding what you should wear and exactly how you should look. But the Church will always declare standards and will always teach principles. As Sister Susan Tanner taught this morning, one of those principles is modesty. In the gospel of Jesus Christ, modesty in appearance is <span class="emphasis">always</span> in fashion. Our standards are not socially negotiable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p8" pid="Iiyt3P0UqUGwpGmTG0y3Pw" hash="7r9aiQ">The <span class="emphasis">For the Strength of Youth</span> pamphlet is very clear in its call for young women to avoid clothing that is too tight, too short, or improperly revealing in any manner, including bare midriffs.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Parents, please review this booklet with your children. Second only to your love, they need your limits. Young women, choose your clothing the way you would choose your friends—in both cases choose that which improves you and would give you confidence standing in the presence of God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Good friends would never embarrass you, demean you, or exploit you. Neither should your clothing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p9" pid="YyeJlVrk-k6lcSoNKPBcpQ" hash="iWL6Yg">I make a special appeal regarding how young women might dress for Church services and Sabbath worship. We used to speak of “best dress” or “Sunday dress,” and maybe we should do so again. In any case, from ancient times to modern we have always been invited to present our best selves inside and out when entering the house of the Lord—and a dedicated LDS chapel is a “house of the Lord.” Our clothing or footwear need never be expensive, indeed should <span class="emphasis">not</span> be expensive, but neither should it appear that we are on our way to the beach. When we come to worship the God and Father of us all and to partake of the sacrament symbolizing the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we should be as comely and respectful, as dignified and appropriate as we can be. We should be recognizable in appearance as well as in behavior that we truly are disciples of Christ, that in a spirit of worship we are meek and lowly of heart, that we truly desire the Savior’s Spirit to be with us always.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p10" pid="lCW3jrLjcEGmZjsg1yQ6Vw" hash="UL3gRw">In this same vein may I address an even more sensitive subject. I plead with you young women to please be more accepting of yourselves, including your body shape and style, with a little less longing to look like someone else. We are all different. Some are tall, and some are short. Some are round, and some are thin. And almost everyone at some time or other wants to be something they are not! But as one adviser to teenage girls said: “You can’t live your life worrying that the world is staring at you. When you let people’s opinions make you self-conscious you give away your power. … The key to feeling [confident] is to always listen to your inner self—[the <span class="emphasis">real</span> you.]”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> And in the kingdom of God, the real you is “more precious than rubies.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Every young woman is a child of destiny and every adult woman a powerful force for good. I mention adult women because, sisters, you are our greatest examples and resource for these young women. And if you are obsessing over being a size 2, you won’t be very surprised when your daughter or the Mia Maid in your class does the same and makes herself physically ill trying to accomplish it. We should all be as fit as we can be—that’s good Word of Wisdom doctrine. That means eating right and exercising and helping our bodies function at their optimum strength. We could probably all do better in that regard. But I speak here of optimum health; there is no universal optimum size.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p11" pid="_A8SBTuNSka5_9YYeBavAA" hash="Tu374A">Frankly, the world has been brutal with you in this regard. You are bombarded in movies, television, fashion magazines, and advertisements with the message that looks are everything! The pitch is, “If your looks are good enough, your life will be glamorous and you will be happy and popular.” That kind of pressure is immense in the teenage years, to say nothing of later womanhood. In too many cases too much is being done to the human body to meet just such a fictional (to say nothing of superficial) standard. As one Hollywood actress is reported to have said recently: “We’ve become obsessed with beauty and the fountain of youth. … I’m really saddened by the way women mutilate [themselves] in search of that. I see women [including young women] … pulling this up and tucking that back. It’s like a slippery slope. [You can’t get off of it.] … It’s really insane … what society is doing to women.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p12" pid="TAnDa-Q3KE-iJ_a_cEPGcg" hash="yR6iWw">In terms of preoccupation with self and a fixation on the physical, this is more than social insanity; it is spiritually destructive, and it accounts for much of the unhappiness women, including young women, face in the modern world. And if adults are preoccupied with appearance—tucking and nipping and implanting and remodeling everything that can be remodeled—those pressures and anxieties will certainly seep through to children. At some point the problem becomes what the Book of Mormon called “vain imaginations.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> And in secular society both vanity <span class="emphasis">and</span> imagination run wild. One would truly need a great and spacious makeup kit to compete with beauty as portrayed in media all around us. Yet at the end of the day there would still be those “in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers” as Lehi saw,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> because however much one tries in the world of glamour and fashion, it will never be glamorous enough.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p13" pid="qfwrxFIHBEyjo8PqbIJGbw" hash="Y4cavw">A woman not of our faith once wrote something to the effect that in her years of working with beautiful women she had seen several things they all had in common, and not one of them had anything to do with sizes and shapes. She said the loveliest women she had known had a glow of health, a warm personality, a love of learning, stability of character, and integrity. If we may add the sweet and gentle Spirit of the Lord carried by such a woman, then this describes the loveliness of women in any age or time, <span class="emphasis">every</span> element of which is emphasized in and attainable through the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p14" pid="T7X7RX_ot0u3JdiPnzew-w" hash="mtxvSg">May I conclude. Much has been said lately in entertainment media about the current craze for “reality shows.” I am not sure what those are, but from the bottom of my heart I share this gospel reality with the beautiful generation of young women growing up in this Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p15" pid="_Mtkygky_0y4UTovd5_DBA" hash="a3sSVA">My solemn declaration to you is that the Father and the Son did <span class="emphasis">in very fact</span> appear to the Prophet Joseph Smith, himself a young man called by God from your very age group. I testify that these divine beings spoke to him, that he heard Their eternal voices, and he saw Their glorified bodies.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> That experience was as real in its own setting as the Apostle Thomas’s was when the Savior said to him, “Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: … be not faithless, but [be] believing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/to-young-women.p16" pid="5JIMKttD8UqmUGt7t-J-5A" hash="4eY-dQ">To my granddaughter and to every other young person in this Church I bear my personal witness that God is <span class="emphasis">in reality</span> our Father and Jesus Christ is <span class="emphasis">in reality</span> His Only Begotten Son in the flesh, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. I testify that this <span class="emphasis">really</span> is the Church and kingdom of God on earth, that true prophets have led this people in the past and a true prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, leads it now. May you know the unending love the leaders of the Church have for you and may you let the eternal realities of the gospel of Jesus Christ lift you above temporal concerns and teenage anxieties I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I wish to speak particularly to you who feel your lives are broken, seemingly beyond repair.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend.p2" uuid="6b629b52-4ba0-46e3-a043-bbcd0d9a2605" pid="jjpaCCrwg0uaC7SR1lN30A" hash="8eEALw">To all such I offer the surest and sweetest remedy that I know. It is found in the clarion call the Savior of the world Himself gave. He said it in the beginning of His ministry, and He said it in the end. He said it to believers, and He said it to those who were not so sure. He said to everyone, whatever their personal problems might be:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend.p3" uuid="8f5268e1-2b91-475d-a14a-5e5de4695e02" pid="ncJGLaUboEq7scg1kWtDAQ" hash="MLNUqA">“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend.p5" uuid="1fdcccb6-f36d-4687-a054-4f5dd1e9c4d9" pid="Xt6S1nqsb067JdagqE_VAw" hash="wgvcAQ">In this promise, that introductory phrase, “come unto me,” is crucial. It is the key to the peace and rest we seek. Indeed, when the resurrected Savior gave His sermon at the temple to the Nephites in the New World, He began, “Blessed are the poor in spirit who <span class="emphasis">come unto me,</span> for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend.p6" uuid="2d095f9c-4d61-4f19-9a85-25f28b267cb9" pid="FO0rx5vBe0KY_vKe55kGvg" hash="g9A6Qg">When Andrew and John first heard Christ speak, they were so moved they followed Him as He walked away from the crowd. Sensing He was being pursued, Jesus turned and asked the two men, “What seek ye?” They answered, “Where dwellest thou?” And Christ said, “Come and see.” The next day He found another disciple, Philip, and said to him, “Follow me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Just a short time later He formally called Peter and others of the new Apostles with the same spirit of invitation. Come, “follow me,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> He said.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend.p7" uuid="3f8bd058-8850-47d8-9839-ede4675624e2" pid="wm0WDpZV-EmCM0_Qd1M42g" hash="n_kAzg">It seems clear that the essence of our duty and the fundamental requirement of our mortal life is captured in these brief phrases from any number of scenes in the Savior’s mortal ministry. He is saying to us, “Trust me, learn of me, do what I do. Then, when you walk where <span class="emphasis">I</span> am going,” He says, “we can talk about where <span class="emphasis">you</span> are going, and the problems you face and the troubles you have. If you will follow me, I will lead you out of darkness,” He promises. “I will give you answers to your prayers. I will give you rest to your souls.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend.p8" uuid="ef4fa5d5-8f46-4e2d-900b-14170aa09fda" pid="t7z2A370zEC-oMeijXHiEA" hash="80Gw4A">My beloved friends, I know of no other way for us to succeed or to be safe amid life’s many pitfalls and problems. I know of no other way for us to carry our burdens or find what Jacob in the Book of Mormon called “that happiness which is prepared for the saints.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend.p9" uuid="f79e7350-dbf0-4a0a-8959-b311eb5cf39f" pid="2ykiIIoFUECvHRNlAs2M0w" hash="8Tl4Cg">So how does one “come unto Christ” in response to this constant invitation? The scriptures give scores of examples and avenues. You are well acquainted with the most basic ones. The easiest and the earliest comes simply with the desire of our heart, the most basic form of faith that we know. “If ye can no more than <span class="emphasis">desire</span> to believe,” Alma says, exercising just “a <span class="emphasis">particle</span> of faith,” giving even a <span class="emphasis">small place</span> for the promises of God to find a home—that is enough to begin.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Just believing, just having a “molecule” of faith—simply hoping for things which are not yet seen in our lives, but which are nevertheless truly there to be bestowed<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span>—that simple step, when focused on the Lord Jesus Christ, has ever been and always will be the first principle of His eternal gospel, the first step out of despair.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend.p10" uuid="1d898cd8-262a-4738-9fb0-116cc34f9f2f" pid="vtz07QXTz0WFjed29_upLg" hash="MlC9cA">Second, we must change anything we can change that may be part of the problem. In short we must repent, perhaps the most hopeful and encouraging word in the Christian vocabulary. We thank our Father in Heaven we are <span class="emphasis">allowed</span> to change, we thank Jesus we <span class="emphasis">can</span> change, and ultimately we do so only with Their divine assistance. Certainly not everything we struggle with is a result of our actions. Often it is the result of the actions of others or just the mortal events of life. But anything <span class="emphasis">we</span> can change we <span class="emphasis">should</span> change, and we must forgive the rest. In this way our access to the Savior’s Atonement becomes as unimpeded as we, with our imperfections, can make it. He will take it from there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend.p11" uuid="08bad6e7-001d-4cb8-abdc-15e5e2aa2887" pid="DjOwaNhJj0WhYzLN4cqjuA" hash="7nb9eQ">Third, in as many ways as possible we try to take upon us His identity, and we begin by taking upon us His name. That name is formally bestowed by covenant in the saving ordinances of the gospel. These start with baptism and conclude with temple covenants, with many others, such as partaking of the sacrament, laced throughout our lives as additional blessings and reminders. Teaching the people of his day the message we give this morning, Nephi said: “Follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, … with real intent, … take upon you the name of Christ. … Do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer [will] do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

So we step, we strive, we seek, and we never yield.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

Sometimes we seek heaven too obliquely, focusing on programs or history or the experience of others. Those are important but not as important as personal experience, true discipleship, and the strength that comes from experiencing firsthand the majesty of His touch.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend.p14" uuid="e9cc700a-6321-43c8-950f-9006dc2fe02d" pid="QXow0wGYiEa_bpIHgwAfaQ" hash="vgr_FA">Are you battling a demon of addiction—tobacco or drugs or gambling, or the pernicious contemporary plague of pornography? Is your marriage in trouble or your child in danger? Are you confused with gender identity or searching for self-esteem? Do you—or someone you love—face disease or depression or death? Whatever other steps you may need to take to resolve these concerns, come <span class="emphasis">first</span> to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Trust in heaven’s promises. In that regard Alma’s testimony is my testimony: “I do know,” he says, “that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

I testify that the Savior’s Atonement lifts from us not only the burden of our sins but also the burden of our disappointments and sorrows, our heartaches and our despair.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> From the beginning, trust in such help was to give us both a reason and a way to improve, an incentive to lay down our burdens and take up our salvation. There can and will be plenty of difficulties in life. Nevertheless, the soul that comes unto Christ, who knows His voice and strives to do as He did, finds a strength, as the hymn says, “beyond [his] own.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> The Savior reminds us that He has “graven [us] upon the palms of [His] hands.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> Considering the incomprehensible cost of the Crucifixion and Atonement, I promise you He is not going to turn His back on us now. When He says to the poor in spirit, “Come unto me,” He means He knows the way out and He knows the way up. He knows it because He has walked it. He knows the way because He <span class="emphasis">is</span> the way.</p>

I have always been touched that as his son was departing for his mission to England, Brother Bryant S. Hinckley gave young Gordon a farewell embrace and then slipped him a handwritten note with just five words taken from the fifth chapter of Mark: “Be not afraid, only believe.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> I think also of that night when Christ rushed to the aid of His frightened disciples, walking as He did on the water to get to them, calling out, “It is I; be not afraid.” Peter exclaimed, “Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.” Christ’s answer to him was as it <span class="emphasis">always</span> is <span class="emphasis">every</span> time: “<span class="emphasis">Come,</span>” He said. Instantly, as was his nature, Peter sprang over the vessel’s side and into the troubled waters. While his eyes were fixed upon the Lord, the wind could toss his hair and the spray could drench his robes, but all was well—he was coming to Christ. It was only when his faith wavered and fear took control, only when he removed his glance from the Master to look at the furious waves and the ominous black gulf beneath, only then did he begin to sink into the sea. In newer terror he cried out, “Lord, save me.”</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="104"></span>Not long after our friend Carolyn Rasmus joined the faculty of Brigham Young University, a group of her new teaching colleagues invited her to join them on a Saturday hike in the mountains above Provo. Carolyn was not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but she had felt particularly welcome in her new circle of associates. She eagerly joined them for the climb.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/prophets-in-the-land-again.p2" pid="PjE70p8Cl0uctUuEorKTeg" hash="PwxOCQ">As the sun steadily rose, so did the hikers on the mountainside. Then, as the ten o’clock hour approached, the group began to find places to sit down. Carolyn thought, “This is wonderful. How did they know I needed the rest?” and she, too, looked for a comfortable spot to stretch out. But the participants seemed unusually earnest about this particular break, some pulling out pencils and notebooks while one intently dialed a transistor radio.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/prophets-in-the-land-again.p3" pid="KqA2dYFF00C8Q54mWWdTBA" hash="mqLUaQ">What then happened would be a turning point in her life forever. One of her friends said, “Carolyn, we need to explain something. This is the first Saturday in October, and for us that means not only lovely weather and bright fall foliage, but it also means a general conference of the Church. As Latter-day Saints, wherever we are or whatever we are doing, we stop and listen. So we are going to sit here among the oak and the pines, look out over the valley below, and listen to the prophets of God for a couple of hours.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/prophets-in-the-land-again.p5" pid="MN0jcxmOoUyf7nfq1ytudg" hash="SdJLbA">Well, the rest is history. With the gift of a leather-bound copy of the scriptures from her students, <span class="pageBreak" page-number="105"></span>the love of friends and families in the LDS ward she began to attend, and spiritual experiences we want all who make their way into the light of the gospel to have, Carolyn was baptized and confirmed a member of the Church. The rest is, as they say, history. With her introduction to general conference that day sitting high atop Y Mountain, Sister Rasmus had seen her own personal fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophetic invitation: “Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

We have been blessed to hear messages from our leaders, including and especially President Gordon B. Hinckley, the man we sustain as God’s oracle on earth, our living prophet, seer, and revelator. As prophets have done in dispensations from Adam down to the present day, President Hinckley has figuratively gathered us in a kind of global equivalent of the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, has loved us and taught us and bestowed upon us his blessing.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

And how we need such guidance! Our times are turbulent and difficult. We see wars inter-nationally and distress domestically. Neighbors all around us face personal heartaches and family sorrows. Legions know fear and troubles of a hundred kinds. This reminds us that when those mists of darkness enveloped the travelers in Lehi’s vision of the tree of life, it enveloped <span class="emphasis">all</span> of the participants—the righteous as well as the unrighteous, the young along with the elderly, the new convert and seasoned member alike. In that allegory all face opposition and travail, and only the rod of iron—the declared word of God—can bring them safely through. We <span class="emphasis">all</span> need that rod. We all need that word. No one is safe without it, for in its absence any can “[fall] away into forbidden paths and [be] lost,” as the record says.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> How grateful we are to have heard God’s voice and felt the strength of that iron rod in this conference these past two days.</p>

I testify that the grasp this body of men and women have of moral and societal issues exceeds that of any think tank or brain trust of comparable endeavor of which I know anywhere on the earth. I bear personal witness of how thoroughly good they are, of how hard they work, and how humbly they live. It is no trivial matter for this Church to declare to the world prophecy, seership, and revelation, but we do declare it. It is true light shining in a dark world, and it shines from these proceedings.</p>

This morning President Hinckley movingly reminded us that this is the 150th anniversary of those handcart companies that, as general conference was convening in October of 1856 here in the Salt Lake Valley, were staggering through the last freezing miles of Nebraska and were soon to be stranded in the impassable snows of the high country of Wyoming. He quoted to us President Brigham Young’s inspiring general conference message to the Saints, simply “go and bring in those people now on the plains.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

It may not be blizzards and frozen-earth burials that we face this conference, but the needy are still out there—the poor and the weary, the discouraged and downhearted, those “[falling] away into [the] forbidden paths” we mentioned earlier, and multitudes who are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> They are all out there with feeble knees, hands that hang down,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> and bad weather setting in. They can be rescued only by those who have more and know more and can help more. And don’t worry about asking, “Where are they?” They are everywhere, on our right hand and on our left, in our neighborhoods and in the workplace, in every community and county and nation of this world. Take your team and wagon; load it with your love, your testimony, and a spiritual sack of flour; then drive in any direction. The Lord will lead you to those in need if you will but embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ that has been taught in this conference. Open your heart and your hand to those trapped in the twenty-first century’s equivalent of Martin’s Cove and Devil’s Gate. In doing so we honor the Master’s repeated plea on behalf of lost sheep and lost coins and lost souls.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Hinckley is in every way, from head to toe, such a prophet, one whose life and voice we cherish and for whom we have prayed so much. He will now conclude this semiannual gathering. For such a blessing—and <span class="emphasis">all</span> these blessings and so many more— I give personal thanks at general conference time, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="16"></span>The Prophet Joseph Smith deepened our understanding of the power of speech when he taught, “<span class="emphasis">It is by words … [that] every being works when he works by faith.</span> God said, ‘Let there be light: and there was light.’ Joshua spake, and the great lights which God had created stood still. Elijah commanded, and the heavens were stayed for the space of three years and six months, so that it did not rain. … All this was done by faith. … <span class="emphasis">Faith, then, works by words; and with [words] its mightiest works have been, and will be, performed.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Like all gifts “which cometh from above,” words are “sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by constraint of the Spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p3" pid="UDhpznuiTESC9ZMS3omuKg" hash="ovyrvg">There is a line from the Apocrypha which puts the seriousness of this issue better than I can. It reads, “The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> With that stinging image in mind, I was particularly impressed to read in the book of James that there was a way I could be “a perfect man.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p4" pid="p8xfX_CqKUSMMoOnMqVLVg" hash="3UJsmA">Said James: “For in many things we offend all. <span class="emphasis">[But] if any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, </span>and able also to bridle the whole body.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p5" pid="VQxJ1Z2FU0i38_Re8rPUiw" hash="-nPUrw">Continuing the imagery of the bridle, he writes: “Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p6" pid="JukKQO8S60CdLni7rzkoUA" hash="j3-pdw">“Behold also … ships, which though they be … great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p7" pid="cyRhTvyb-0akpsxdLmlUBg" hash="XFlAbQ">Then James makes his point: “The tongue is [also] a little member. … [But] behold, how great a [forest (Greek)] a little fire [can burn].</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p13" pid="d14fOr2_0kamAIRR2yeVyg" hash="4sti0Q">Well, <span class="emphasis">that</span> is pretty straightforward! Obviously James doesn’t mean our tongues are <span class="emphasis">always</span> iniquitous, nor that <span class="emphasis">everything</span> we say is “full of deadly poison.” But he clearly means that at least some things we say can be destructive, even venomous—and that is a chilling indictment for a Latter-day Saint! The voice that bears profound testimony, utters fervent prayer, and sings the hymns of Zion <span class="emphasis">can be</span> the same voice that berates and criticizes, embarrasses and demeans, inflicts pain and destroys the spirit of oneself and of others in the process. “Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing,” James grieves. “My brethren [and sisters], these things ought not so to be.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p14" pid="CVLNGGPLMkOxez_0SrC9mw" hash="zgBCPA">Is this something we could all work on just a little? Is this an area in which we could each try to be a little more like a “perfect” man or woman?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p15" pid="xtxRp8_dN0Ol3DvZEQzcmw" hash="AnUbsQ">Husbands, you have been entrusted with the most sacred gift God can give you—a wife, a daughter of God, the mother of your children who has voluntarily given herself to you for love and joyful companionship. Think of the kind things you said when you were courting, think of the blessings you have given with hands placed lovingly upon her head, think of yourself and of her as the god and goddess you <span class="pageBreak" page-number="17"></span>both inherently are, and then reflect on other moments characterized by cold, caustic, unbridled words. Given the damage that can be done with our tongues, little wonder the Savior said, “Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> A husband who would never dream of striking his wife physically can break, if not her bones, then certainly her heart by the brutality of thoughtless or unkind speech. Physical abuse is uniformly and unequivocally condemned in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If it is possible to be more condemning than that, we speak even more vigorously against all forms of sexual abuse. Today, I speak against verbal and emotional abuse of anyone against anyone, but especially of husbands against wives. Brethren, these things ought not to be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p16" pid="jngk5OGnGUSmrkiqZR_3eQ" hash="HQid8A">In that same spirit we speak to the sisters as well, for the sin of verbal abuse knows no gender. Wives, what of the unbridled tongue in <span class="emphasis">your</span> mouth, of the power for good or ill in <span class="emphasis">your</span> words? How is it that such a lovely voice which by divine nature is so angelic, so close to the veil, so instinctively gentle and inherently kind could ever in a turn be so shrill, so biting, so acrid and untamed? A woman’s words can be more piercing than any dagger ever forged, and they can drive the people they love to retreat beyond a barrier more distant than anyone in the beginning of that exchange could ever have imagined. Sisters, there is no place in that magnificent spirit of yours for acerbic or abrasive expression of any kind, including gossip or backbiting or catty remarks. Let it never be said of our home or our ward or our neighborhood that “the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity … [burning] among our members.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p17" pid="PVXZKtRYo0KtOAHHFgNUhg" hash="rzOoRA">May I expand this counsel to make it a full family matter. We must be so careful in speaking to a child. What we say or don’t say, how we say it and when is so very, very important in shaping a child’s view of himself or herself. But it is even more important in shaping that child’s faith in us and their faith in God. Be constructive in your comments to a child—always. Never tell them, even in whimsy, that they are fat or dumb or lazy or homely. You would never do that maliciously, but they remember and may struggle for years trying to forget—and to forgive. And try not to compare your children, even if you think you are skillful at it. You may say most positively that “Susan is pretty and Sandra is bright,” but all Susan will remember is that she isn’t bright and Sandra that she isn’t pretty. Praise each child individually for what that child is, and help him or her escape our culture’s obsession with comparing, competing, and never feeling we are “enough.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p18" pid="7HCFSEryNE-m3aCr7lL4AQ" hash="QonjOw">In all of this, I suppose it goes without saying that negative speaking so often flows from negative thinking, including negative thinking about ourselves. We see our own faults, we speak—or at least think—critically of ourselves, and before long that is how we see everyone and everything. No sunshine, no roses, no promise of hope or happiness. Before long <span class="pageBreak" page-number="18"></span>we and everybody around us are miserable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p19" pid="jYABgjmg0Eyuit1j7hGUJA" hash="HHDhQw">I love what Elder Orson F. Whitney once said: “The spirit of the gospel is optimistic; it trusts in God and looks on the bright side of things. The opposite or pessimistic spirit drags men down and away from God, looks on the dark side, murmurs, complains, and is slow to yield obedience.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> We should honor the Savior’s declaration to “be of good cheer.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> (Indeed, it seems to me we may be more guilty of breaking that commandment than almost any other!) Speak hopefully. Speak encouragingly, including about yourself. Try not to complain and moan incessantly. As someone once said, “Even in the golden age of civilization someone undoubtedly grumbled that everything looked too yellow.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p20" pid="Qd7LKksWrUyfHApGXwPA6A" hash="j8MheA">I have often thought that Nephi’s being bound with cords and beaten by rods must have been more tolerable to him than listening to Laman and Lemuel’s constant murmuring.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Surely he must have said at least once, “Hit me one more time. I can still hear you.” Yes, life has its problems, and yes, there are negative things to face, but please accept one of Elder Holland’s maxims for living—no misfortune is so bad that whining about it won’t make it worse.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p21" pid="COUR8-Rlq0SEdYUg306QTQ" hash="oTycLw">Paul put it candidly, but very hopefully. He said to all of us: “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but [only] that which is good … [and] edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p25" pid="1CSPrleMtU6nxMZsC3kWLg" hash="U_DYHQ">In his deeply moving final testimony, Nephi calls us to “follow the Son [of God], with full purpose of heart,” promising that “after ye have … received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, [ye] can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels. … And … how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost? Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Indeed, Christ was and is “the Word,” according to John the Beloved,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> full of grace and truth, full of mercy and compassion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-tongue-of-angels.p26" pid="eYpI5r7-VUuc86mqwoBwFw" hash="LlZ2Mw">So, brothers and sisters, in this long eternal quest to be more like our Savior, may we try to be “perfect” men and women in at least this one way now—by offending not in word, or more positively put, by speaking with a new tongue, the tongue of angels. Our words, like our deeds, should be filled with faith and hope and charity, the three great Christian imperatives so desperately needed in the world today. With such words, spoken under the influence of the Spirit, tears can be dried, hearts can be healed, lives can be elevated, hope can return, confidence can prevail. I pray that my words, even on this challenging subject, will be encouraging to you, not discouraging, that you can hear in my voice that I love you, because I do. More importantly, please know that your Father in Heaven loves you and so does His Only Begotten Son. When They speak to you—and They will—it will not be in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, but it will be with a voice still and small, a voice tender and kind.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> It will be with the tongue of angels. May we all rejoice in the thought that when we say edifying, encouraging things unto the least of these, our brethren and sisters and little ones, we say it unto God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="40"></span>As Elder Ballard noted earlier in this session, various cross-currents of our times have brought increasing public attention to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In addressing this we do not need to be apologists for our faith, but we would like not to be misunderstood. So with a desire to increase understanding and unequivocally declare our Christianity, I speak today on the first of those two doctrinal issues just mentioned.</p>

These various evolutions and iterations of creeds—and others to come over the centuries—declared the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be abstract, absolute, transcendent, immanent, consubstantial, coeternal, and unknowable, without body, parts, or passions and dwelling outside space and time. In such creeds all three members are separate persons, but they are a single being, the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="41"></span>oft-noted “mystery of the trinity.” They are three distinct persons, yet not three Gods but one. All three persons are incomprehensible, yet it is one God who is incomprehensible.</p>

I testify that Jesus Christ is the literal, living Son of our literal, living God. This Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer who, under the guidance of the Father, was the Creator of heaven and earth and all things that in them are. I bear witness that He was born of a virgin mother, that in His lifetime He performed mighty miracles observed by legions of His disciples and by His enemies as well. I testify that He had power over death because He was divine but that He willingly subjected Himself to death for our sake because for a period of time He was also mortal. I declare that in His willing submission to death He took upon Himself the sins of the world, paying an infinite price for every sorrow and sickness, every heartache and unhappiness from Adam to the end of the world. In doing so He conquered both the grave physically and hell spiritually and set the human family free. I bear witness that He was literally resurrected from the tomb and, after ascending to His Father to complete the process of that Resurrection, He appeared, repeatedly, to hundreds of disciples in the Old World and in the New. I know He is the Holy One of Israel, the Messiah who will one day come again in final glory, to reign on earth as Lord of lords and King of kings. I know that there is no other name given under heaven whereby a man can be saved and that only by relying wholly upon His merits, mercy, and everlasting grace<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> can we gain eternal life.</p>

In the spring of 1820, a 14-year-old boy, confused by many of these very doctrines that still confuse much of Christendom, went into a grove of trees to pray. In answer to that earnest prayer offered at such a tender age, the Father and the Son appeared as embodied, glorified beings to the boy prophet Joseph Smith. That day marked the beginning of the return of the true, New Testament gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and the restoration of other prophetic truths offered from Adam down to the present day.</p>

Through the Holy Spirit of Truth, may we <span class="emphasis">all</span> know “the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom [He has] sent.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> Then may we live Their teachings and be true Christians in deed, as well as in word, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="91"></span>President Monson, may I claim a moment of personal privilege? As the first of the Brethren invited to speak following your singular message to the Church this morning, may I say something on behalf of all your Brethren of the General Authorities and indeed on behalf of all the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p2" pid="nmphS41UT0ysyDZRzFtofw" hash="ncpxoA">Of the many privileges we have had in this historic conference, including participation in a solemn assembly in which we were able to stand and sustain you as prophet, seer, and revelator, I cannot help but feel that the most important privilege we have all had has been to witness personally the settling of the sacred, prophetic mantle upon your shoulders, almost as it were by the very hands of angels themselves. Those in attendance at last night’s general priesthood meeting and all who were present in the worldwide broadcast of this morning’s session have been eyewitness to this event. For all the participants, I express our gratitude for such a moment. I say that with love to President Monson and especially love to our Father in Heaven for the wonderful opportunity it has been to be “eyewitnesses of his majesty” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.16" class="scriptureRef">2 Peter 1:16</a>), as the Apostle Peter once said.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p3" pid="BHsxk4bpJkiA2RTSPI60lw" hash="Dz3Ebw">In general conference last October, I said there were two principal reasons The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is accused, erroneously, of not being Christian. At that time I addressed one of those doctrinal issues—our scripturally based view of the Godhead. Today I would like to address the other major doctrine which characterizes our faith but which causes concern to some, namely the bold assertion that God continues to speak His word and reveal His truth, revelations which mandate an open canon of scripture.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p4" pid="L6JSzw0EoEK5KaekiJqJ_A" hash="rT_KQw">Some Christians, in large measure because of their genuine love for the Bible, have declared that there can be no more authorized scripture beyond the Bible. In thus pronouncing the canon of revelation closed, our friends in some other faiths shut the door on divine expression that we in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hold dear: the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the ongoing guidance received by God’s anointed prophets and apostles. Imputing no ill will to those who take such a position, nevertheless we respectfully but resolutely reject such an unscriptural characterization of true Christianity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p5" pid="tgJi8ItV6kW5V4TOlhOQ3w" hash="iTSMrA">One of the arguments often used in any defense of a closed canon is the New Testament passage recorded in <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/22.18" class="scriptureRef">Revelation 22:18</a>: “For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of … this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.” However, there is now overwhelming consensus among virtually all biblical scholars that this verse applies only to the book of Revelation, <span class="emphasis">not</span> the whole Bible. Those scholars of our day acknowledge a number of New Testament “books” that were almost certainly written <span class="emphasis">after</span> John’s revelation on the Isle of Patmos was received. Included in this category are at least the books of Jude, the three Epistles of John, and probably the entire Gospel of John itself.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Perhaps there are even more than these.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p6" pid="5W5BONt7s0KPPCz3RhME9Q" hash="R3w6uA">But there is a simpler answer as to why that passage in the final book of the current New Testament cannot apply to the whole Bible. That is because the whole Bible as we know it—one collection of texts bound in a single volume—did not exist when that verse was written. For centuries after John produced his writing, the individual books of the New Testament were in circulation singly or perhaps in combinations with a few other texts but almost <span class="emphasis">never </span>as a complete collection. Of the entire corpus of 5,366 known Greek New Testament manuscripts, only 35 <span class="pageBreak" page-number="92"></span>contain the whole New Testament as we now know it, and 34 of those were compiled after <small>A.D.</small> 1000.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p7" pid="OZOWI9f5gU-ggd8dkozQww" hash="IMj-bw">The fact of the matter is that virtually every prophet of the Old <span class="emphasis">and</span> New Testament has added scripture to that received by his predecessors. If the Old Testament words of Moses were sufficient, as some could have mistakenly thought them to be,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> then why, for example, the subsequent prophecies of Isaiah or of Jeremiah, who follows him? To say nothing of Ezekiel and Daniel, of Joel, Amos, and all the rest. If one revelation to one prophet in one moment of time is sufficient for <span class="emphasis">all</span> time, what justifies these many others? What justifies them was made clear by Jehovah Himself when He said to Moses, “My works are without end, and … my words … never cease.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p8" pid="y4w5kFrs_ES56LZrncfPgw" hash="unZ7Xw">One Protestant scholar has inquired tellingly into the erroneous doctrine of a closed canon. He writes: “On what biblical or historical grounds has the inspiration of God been limited to the written documents that the church now calls its Bible? … If the Spirit inspired only the written documents of the first century, does that mean that the same Spirit does not speak today in the church about matters that are of significant concern?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> We humbly ask those same questions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p9" pid="L2mWm-Gj_EiaQLDgzxvTow" hash="S0jlqQ">Continuing revelation does not demean or discredit existing revelation. The Old Testament does not lose its value in our eyes when we are introduced to the New Testament, and the New Testament is only enhanced when we read the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. In considering the additional scripture accepted by Latter-day Saints, we might ask: Were those early Christians who for decades had access only to the primitive Gospel of Mark (generally considered the first of the New Testament Gospels to be written)—were they offended to receive the more detailed accounts set forth later by Matthew and Luke, to say nothing of the unprecedented passages and revelatory emphasis offered later yet by John? Surely they must have rejoiced that ever more convincing evidence of the divinity of Christ kept coming. And so do we rejoice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p10" pid="dIsQywRkEkesZOSqrx7FhQ" hash="boWQAg">Please do not misunderstand. We love and revere the Bible, as Elder M. Russell Ballard taught so clearly from this pulpit just one year ago.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> The Bible is the word of God. It is always identified first in our canon, our “standard works.” Indeed, it was a divinely ordained encounter with the<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef"> fifth verse of the first chapter of the book of James</a> that led Joseph Smith to his vision of the Father and the Son, which gave birth to the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in our time. But even then, Joseph knew the Bible alone could not be the answer to <span class="emphasis">all</span> the religious questions he and others like him had. As he said in his own words, the ministers of his community were contending—sometimes angrily—over their doctrines. “Priest [was] contending against priest, and convert [was contending] against convert … in a strife of words and a contest about opinions,” he said. About the only thing these contending religions had in common was, ironically, a belief in the Bible, but, as Joseph wrote, “the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question [regarding which church was true] by an appeal to the Bible.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Clearly the Bible, so frequently described at that time as “common ground,” was nothing of the kind—unfortunately it was a battleground.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p11" pid="iOgr5CofJkyXhfKb41wDmQ" hash="92gNAA">Thus one of the great purposes of continuing revelation through living prophets is to declare to the world through additional witnesses that the Bible is true. <span class="emphasis">“This </span>is written,” an ancient prophet said, speaking of the Book of Mormon, “for the intent that ye may believe <span class="emphasis">that,”</span> speaking of the Bible.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> In one of the earliest revelations received by Joseph Smith, the Lord said, “Behold, I do not bring [the Book of Mormon forth] to destroy [the Bible] but to build it up.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p12" pid="h8x2Ctg0C0KZr8gG7KdS5A" hash="VOjfLg">One other point needs to be <span class="pageBreak" page-number="93"></span>made. Since it is clear that there were Christians long before there was a New Testament or even an accumulation of the sayings of Jesus, it cannot therefore be maintained that the Bible is what makes one a Christian. In the words of esteemed New Testament scholar N. T. Wright, “The risen Jesus, at the end of Matthew’s Gospel, does not say, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth is given to the books you are all going to write,’ but [rather] ‘All authority in heaven and on earth is given to me.’ ”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> In other words, “Scripture itself points … away from itself and to the fact that final and true authority belongs to God himself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> So the scriptures are <span class="emphasis">not</span> the ultimate source of knowledge for Latter-day Saints. They are manifestations of the ultimate source. The ultimate source of knowledge and authority for a Latter-day Saint is the living God. The communication of those gifts comes from God as living, vibrant, divine revelation.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p13" pid="a4x5D8Kel0O_1VIOz6mtGw" hash="OiCZBw">This doctrine lies at the very heart of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and of our message to the world. It dramatizes the significance of a solemn assembly yesterday, in which we sustained Thomas S. Monson as a prophet, a seer, and a revelator. We believe in a God who is engaged in our lives, who is not silent, not absent, nor, as Elijah said of the god of the priests of Baal, is He “[on] a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be [awakened].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> In this Church, even our young Primary children recite, “We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p14" pid="UyyL8CZZh0OqV_NogoN62w" hash="pE7OpQ">In declaring new scripture and continuing revelation, we pray we will never be arrogant or insensitive. But after a sacred vision in a now sacred grove answered in the affirmative the question “Does God exist?” what Joseph Smith and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints force us to face is the next interrogative, which necessarily follows: “Does He speak?” We bring the good news that He does and that He has. With a love and affection born of our Christianity, we invite all to inquire into the wonder of what God has said since biblical times and is saying even now.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p15" pid="hLQCjlek_0GCU3FHhW1OPA" hash="5iLQNg">In a sense Joseph Smith and his prophetic successors in this Church answer the challenge Ralph Waldo Emerson put to the students of the Harvard Divinity School 170 years ago this coming summer. To that group of the Protestant best and brightest, the great sage of Concord pled that they teach “that God is, not was; that He speaketh, not spake.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p16" pid="cD1CY26cnUyxzsNbwcl-Iw" hash="cnwItA">I testify that the heavens are open. I testify that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, that the Book of Mormon is truly another testament of Jesus Christ. I testify that Thomas S. Monson is God’s prophet, a modern <span class="pageBreak" page-number="94"></span>apostle with the keys of the kingdom in his hands, a man upon whom I personally have seen the mantle fall. I testify that the presence of such authorized, prophetic voices and ongoing canonized revelations have been at the heart of the Christian message whenever the authorized ministry of Christ has been on the earth. I testify that such a ministry <span class="emphasis">is</span> on the earth again, and it is found in this, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-words-never-cease.p17" pid="rFY994VcpEm2YASNpPw_XQ" hash="186_iw">In our heartfelt devotion to Jesus of Nazareth as the very Son of God, the Savior of the world, we invite all to examine what we have received of Him, to join with us, drinking deeply at the “well of water springing up into everlasting life,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> these constantly flowing reminders that God lives, that He loves us, and that He speaks. I express the deepest <span class="emphasis">personal</span> thanks that His works never end and His “words … never cease.” I bear witness of such divine loving attention and the recording of it, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="29"></span>When Adam and Eve willingly stepped into mortality, they knew this telestial world would contain thorns and thistles and troubles of every kind. Perhaps their most challenging realization, however, was not the hardship and danger they would endure but the fact that they would now be distanced from God, separated from Him with whom they had walked and talked, who had given them face-to-face counsel. After this conscious choice, as the record of creation says, “they saw him not; for they were shut out from his presence.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Amidst all else that must have troubled them, surely this must have troubled them the most.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/the-ministry-of-angels.p2" pid="n8GpcNw5SU613pgqQJLi5A" hash="DSKQYA">But God knew the challenges they would face, and He certainly knew how lonely and troubled they would sometimes feel. So He watched over His mortal family constantly, heard their prayers always, and sent prophets (and later apostles) to teach, counsel, and guide them. But in times of special need, He sent angels, divine messengers, to bless His children, reassure them that heaven was always very close and that His help was always very near. Indeed, shortly after Adam and Eve found themselves in the lone and dreary world, an angel appeared unto them,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> who taught them the meaning of their sacrifice and the atoning role of the promised Redeemer who was to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/the-ministry-of-angels.p3" pid="i5t9d3a2Qku53IZr-asRbg" hash="wNbZjw">When the time for this Savior’s advent was at hand, an angel was sent to announce to Mary that she was to be the mother of the Son of God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Then a host of angels was commissioned to sing on the night the baby Jesus was born.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Shortly thereafter an angel would announce to Joseph that the newborn baby was in danger and that this little family must flee to Egypt for safety.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> When it was safe to return, an angel conveyed that information to the family and the three returned to the land of their heritage.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Time in this setting does not allow even a cursory examination of the scriptures or our own latter-day history, which are so filled with accounts of angels ministering to those on earth, but it is rich doctrine and rich history indeed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/the-ministry-of-angels.p5" pid="ys2NV3mmskiJqz4UwUhPjQ" hash="v2YzfQ">Usually such beings are <span class="emphasis">not</span> seen. Sometimes they are. But seen or unseen they are <span class="emphasis">always</span> near. Sometimes their assignments are very grand and have significance for the whole world. Sometimes the messages are more private. Occasionally the angelic purpose is to warn. But most often it is to comfort, to provide some form of merciful attention, guidance in difficult times. When in Lehi’s dream he found himself in a frightening place, “a dark and dreary waste,” as he described it, he was met by an angel, “a man … dressed in a white robe; … he spake unto me,” Lehi said, “and bade me follow him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Lehi did follow him to safety and ultimately to the path of salvation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/the-ministry-of-angels.p6" pid="vHxApVEJokCkPjvURIEe6g" hash="UJBDow">In the course of life all of us spend time in “dark and dreary” places, wildernesses, circumstances of sorrow or fear or discouragement. Our present day is filled with global distress over financial crises, energy problems, terrorist attacks, and natural calamities. These translate into individual and family concerns not only about homes in which to live and food available to eat but also about the ultimate safety and well-being of our children and the latter-day prophecies about our planet. More serious than these—and sometimes related to them—are matters of ethical, moral, and spiritual decay seen in populations large and small, at home and abroad. But I testify that angels are <span class="emphasis">still</span> sent to help <span class="emphasis">us,</span> even as they were sent to help Adam and Eve, to help the prophets, and indeed to help the Savior of the world Himself. Matthew records in his gospel that after Satan had tempted <span class="pageBreak" page-number="30"></span>Christ in the wilderness “angels came and ministered unto him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Even the Son of God, a God Himself, had need for heavenly comfort during His sojourn in mortality. And so such ministrations will be to the righteous until the end of time. As Mormon said to his son Moroni, who would one day <span class="emphasis">be</span> an angel:</p>

But when we speak of those who are instruments in the hand of God, we are reminded that not all angels are from the other side of the veil. Some of them we walk with and talk with—here, now, every day. Some of them reside in our own neighborhoods. Some of them gave birth to us, and in my case, one of them consented to marry me. Indeed heaven never seems closer than when we see the love of God manifested in the kindness and devotion of people so good and so pure that <span class="emphasis">angelic</span> is the only word that comes to mind. Elder James Dunn, from this pulpit just moments ago, used that word in his invocation to describe this Primary choir—and why not? With the spirit, faces, and voices of those children in our mind and before our eyes, may I share with you an account by my friend and BYU colleague, the late Clyn D. Barrus. I do so with the permission of his wife, Marilyn, and their family.</p>

Because the cows pastured in a field bordered by the occasionally treacherous Teton River, the strict rule in the Barrus household was that during the spring flood season the children were <span class="emphasis">never</span> to go after any cows who ventured across the river. They were always to return home and seek mature help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/the-ministry-of-angels.p14" pid="fnMvBfLpBEWZxabVP3NJBA" hash="B1XHaQ">One Saturday just after his seventh birthday, Brother Barrus’s parents promised the family a night at the movies if the chores were done on time. But when young Clyn arrived at the pasture, the cows he sought had crossed the river, even though it was running at high flood stage. Knowing his rare night at the movies was in jeopardy, he decided to go after the cows himself, even though he had been warned many times never to do so.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/the-ministry-of-angels.p15" pid="elVyW4BvJ0yyip0j55mHIg" hash="JM7ENg">As the seven-year-old urged his old horse, Banner, down into the cold, swift stream, the horse’s head barely cleared the water. An adult sitting on the horse would have been safe, but at Brother Barrus’s tender age, the current completely covered him except when the horse lunged forward several times, bringing Clyn’s head above water just enough to gasp for air.</p>

I felt that I could redeem myself only by bringing the cows home safely. Maybe then my father would forgive me. But it was already dusk, and I didn’t know for sure where I was. Despair overwhelmed me. I was wet and cold, lost and afraid.</p>

When neither I nor the cows were to be found, he knew I had crossed the river and was in danger. Because it was dark and time was of the essence, he removed his clothes down to his long white thermal underwear, tied his shoes around his neck, and swam a treacherous river to rescue a wayward son.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="86"></span>Thank you, Sister Thompson, and thanks to the remarkable women of this Church. Brothers and sisters, my Easter-season message today is intended for everyone, but it is directed in a special way to those who are alone or feel alone or, worse yet, feel abandoned. These might include those longing to be married, those who have lost a spouse, and those who have lost—or have never been blessed with—children. Our empathy embraces wives forsaken by their husbands, husbands whose wives have walked away, and children bereft of one or the other of their parents—or both. This group can find within its broad circumference a soldier far from home, a missionary in those first weeks of homesickness, or a father out of work, afraid the fear in his eyes will be visible to his family. In short it can include all of us at various times in our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p2" pid="CpruhLwbNU26u1p70j4mBg" hash="UXjQ0w">To all such, I speak of the loneliest journey ever made and the unending blessings it brought to all in the human family. I speak of the Savior’s solitary task of shouldering alone the burden of our salvation. Rightly He would say: “I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me. … I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold [me].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p3" pid="xauxEPhzoUq8YU530BRoLQ" hash="z7xBkg">As President Uchtdorf so beautifully noted earlier, we know from scripture that Jesus’s messianic arrival in Jerusalem on the Sunday preceding Passover, a day directly analogous to this very morning, was a great public moment. But eagerness to continue walking with Him would quickly begin to wane.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p4" pid="OeGK4Lp0JEiR-EjVXkHcMg" hash="1FltRg">Soon enough He was arraigned before the Israelite leaders of the day—first Annas, the former high priest, then Caiaphas, the current high priest. In their rush to judgment these men and their councils declared their verdict quickly and angrily. “What further need have we of witnesses?” they cried. “He is [worthy] of death.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p5" pid="yyKra2L4SkCUm6i5RkfDJA" hash="ftV5_w">With that He was brought before the gentile rulers in the land. Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee, interrogated Him once, and Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor in Judea, did so twice, the second time declaring to the crowd, “I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Then, in an act as unconscionable as it was illogical, Pilate “scourged Jesus, [and] delivered him to be crucified.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Pilate’s freshly washed hands could not have been more stained or more unclean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p6" pid="I9D9Y4AcWkCX4ElBHrUhGA" hash="FnaeyQ">Such ecclesiastical and political rejection became more personal when the citizenry in the street turned against Jesus as well. It is one of the ironies of history that sitting with Jesus in prison was a <span class="emphasis">real </span>blasphemer, a murderer and revolutionary known as Barabbas, a name or title in Aramaic meaning “son of the father.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Free to release one prisoner in the spirit of the Passover tradition, Pilate asked the people, “Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you?” They said, “Barabbas.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> So one godless “son of the father” was set free while a truly divine Son of His Heavenly Father moved on to crucifixion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p7" pid="vFvxWrzbnUy3ct_FBCk7uA" hash="YDqBYA">This was also a telling time among those who knew Jesus more personally. The most difficult to understand in this group is Judas Iscariot. We know the divine plan required Jesus to be crucified, but it is wrenching to think that one of His special witnesses who sat at His feet, heard Him pray, watched Him heal, and felt His touch could betray Him and all that He was for 30 pieces of silver. Never in the history of this world has so little money purchased so much infamy. We are not the ones to judge Judas’s fate, but Jesus said of His betrayer, “Good [were it] for that man if he had not been born.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p8" pid="KGmojef54E2AA9_U_XL9IA" hash="dzRwoQ">Of course others among the believers had their difficult moments as well. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="87"></span>Following the Last Supper, Jesus left Peter, James, and John to wait while He ventured into the Garden of Gethsemane alone. Falling on His face in prayer, “sorrowful … unto death,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> the record says, His sweat came as great drops of blood<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> as He pled with the Father to let this crushing, brutal cup pass from Him. But, of course, it could not pass. Returning from such anguished prayer, He found His three chief disciples asleep, prompting Him to ask, “Could ye not watch with me one hour?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> So it happens two more times until on His third return He says compassionately, “Sleep on now, and take your rest,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> though there would be no rest for Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p9" pid="b-JKp9yhsE-d36aHCC9eWA" hash="whFspw">Later, after Jesus’s arrest and appearance at trial, Peter, accused of knowing Jesus and being one of His confidants, denies that accusation not once but three times. We don’t know all that was going on here, nor do we know of protective counsel which the Savior may have given to His Apostles privately,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> but we do know Jesus was aware that even these precious ones would not stand with Him in the end, and He had warned Peter accordingly.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Then, with the crowing of the cock, “the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord. … And [he] went out, and wept bitterly.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p10" pid="WO854YYEoUGBUTu5e0JwXA" hash="ATWCyA">Thus, of divine necessity, the supporting circle around Jesus gets smaller and smaller and smaller, giving significance to Matthew’s words: “All the disciples [left] him, and fled.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Peter stayed near enough to be recognized and confronted. John stood at the foot of the cross with Jesus’s mother. Especially and always the blessed women in the Savior’s life stayed as close to Him as they could. But essentially His lonely journey back to His Father continued without comfort or companionship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p11" pid="jD8czLVkEEunFcTHH8Padg" hash="7M8BUA">Now I speak very carefully, even reverently, of what may have been the most difficult moment in all of this solitary journey to Atonement. I speak of those final moments for which Jesus must have been prepared intellectually and physically but which He may not have fully anticipated emotionally and spiritually—that concluding descent into the paralyzing despair of divine withdrawal when He cries in <span class="emphasis">ultimate</span> loneliness, “My God, my God, why hast <span class="emphasis">thou</span> forsaken me?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p12" pid="gE9j6_D4XEetbm7S4xINLg" hash="4BWqbg">The loss of mortal support He had anticipated, but apparently He had not comprehended this. Had He not said to His disciples, “Behold, the hour … is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me” and “The Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him”?<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p13" pid="8odlMtkudUiWhpxm8-sSoQ" hash="nYlHdg">With all the conviction of my soul I testify that He <span class="emphasis">did</span> please His Father perfectly and that a perfect Father did <span class="emphasis">not</span> forsake His Son in that hour. Indeed, it is my personal belief that in all of Christ’s mortal ministry the Father may never have been closer to His Son than in these agonizing final moments of suffering. Nevertheless, that the supreme sacrifice of His Son might be as complete as it was <span class="pageBreak" page-number="88"></span>voluntary and solitary, the Father briefly withdrew from Jesus the comfort of His Spirit, the support of His personal presence. It was required, indeed it was central to the significance of the Atonement, that this perfect Son who had never spoken ill nor done wrong nor touched an unclean thing had to know how the rest of humankind—us, all of us—would feel when we did commit such sins. For His Atonement to be infinite and eternal, He had to feel what it was like to die not only physically but spiritually, to sense what it was like to have the divine Spirit withdraw, leaving one feeling totally, abjectly, hopelessly alone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p14" pid="Jlt1wwwi10SXcSBIPqrpRg" hash="drFyzA">But Jesus held on. He pressed on. The goodness in Him allowed faith to triumph even in a state of complete anguish. The trust He lived by told Him in spite of His feelings that divine compassion is never absent, that God is always faithful, that He never flees nor fails us. When the uttermost farthing had then been paid, when Christ’s determination to be faithful was as obvious as it was utterly invincible, finally and mercifully, it was “finished.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> Against all odds and with none to help or uphold Him, Jesus of Nazareth, the living Son of the living God, restored physical life where death had held sway and brought joyful, spiritual redemption out of sin, hellish darkness, and despair. With faith in the God He <span class="emphasis">knew</span> was there, He could say in triumph, “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p15" pid="93XGnomCL0ObGRhpQ-Kw-Q" hash="X_Chww">Brothers and sisters, one of the great consolations of this Easter season is that because Jesus walked such a long, lonely path utterly alone, <span class="emphasis">we</span> do not have to do so. His solitary journey brought great company for our little version of that path—the merciful care of our Father in Heaven, the unfailing companionship of this Beloved Son, the consummate gift of the Holy Ghost, angels in heaven, family members on both sides of the veil, prophets and apostles, teachers, leaders, friends. All of these and more have been given as companions for our mortal journey because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the Restoration of His gospel. Trumpeted from the summit of Calvary is the truth that we will never be left alone nor unaided, even if sometimes we may feel that we are. Truly the Redeemer of us all said: “I will not leave you comfortless: [My Father and] I will come to you [and abide with you].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him.p16" pid="pQYL_fKvAEqcEQvWIn2qyA" hash="d6gvqg">My other plea at Easter time is that these scenes of Christ’s lonely sacrifice, laced with moments of denial and abandonment and, at least once, outright betrayal, must <span class="emphasis">never</span> be reenacted by us. He has walked alone once. Now, may I ask that never again will He have to confront sin without our aid and assistance, that never again will He find only unresponsive onlookers when He sees you and me along His <span class="emphasis">Via Dolorosa</span> in our present day. As we approach this holy week—Passover Thursday with its Paschal Lamb, atoning Friday with its cross, Resurrection Sunday with its empty tomb—may we declare ourselves to be more fully disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, not in word only and not only in the flush of comfortable times but in deed and in courage and in faith, including when the path is lonely and when our cross is difficult to bear. This Easter week and always, may we stand by Jesus Christ “at all times and in all things, and in all places that [we] may be in, even until death,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> for surely that is how He stood by us when it <span class="emphasis">was</span> unto death and when He had to stand entirely and utterly alone. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

It is imperative to note that this mist of darkness descends on <span class="emphasis">all</span> the travelers—the faithful and the determined ones (the elect, we might even say) as well as the weaker and ungrounded ones. The principal point of the story is that the successful travelers resist all distractions, including the lure of forbidden paths and jeering taunts from the vain and proud who have taken those paths. The record says that the protected “did press their way forward, continually [and, I might add, tenaciously] holding fast” to a rod of iron that runs unfailingly along the course of the true path.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> However dark the night <span class="emphasis">or</span> the day, the rod marks the way of that solitary, redeeming trail.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="44"></span>As Sister Holland and I recently disembarked at a distant airport, three beautiful young women getting off the same flight hurried up to greet us. They identified themselves as members of the Church, which wasn’t too surprising because those not of our faith usually don’t rush up to us in airports. In a conversation we hadn’t expected, we soon learned through their tears that all three of these women were recently divorced, that in each case their husbands had been unfaithful to them, and in each case the seeds of alienation and transgression had begun with an attraction to pornography.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p2" pid="sB4LxHMlaE6YXHdqRej8jQ" hash="e4ZkLQ">With that stark introduction to my message today—one it is challenging for me to give—I feel much like Jacob of old, who said, “It grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of speech … before … many … whose feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> But bold we need to be. Perhaps it was the father in me or maybe the grandfather, but the tears in those young women’s eyes brought tears to mine and Sister Holland’s, and the questions they asked left me asking, “Why is there so much moral decay around us, and why are so many individuals and families, including some in the Church, falling victim to it, being tragically scarred by it?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p3" pid="UFkBda65uUKWaE3UuQadHg" hash="B0Bkvw">But, of course, I knew at least part of the answer to my own question. Most days we all find ourselves assaulted by immoral messages of some kind flooding in on us from every angle. The darker sides of the movie, television, and music industry step further and further into offensive language and sexual misconduct. Tragically, the same computer and Internet service that allows me to do my family history and prepare those names for temple work could, without filters and controls, allow my children or grandchildren access to a global cesspool of perceptions that could blast a crater in their brains forever.</p>

The compromise available at the click of a mouse—including what can happen in a chat room’s virtual encounter—is no respecter of persons, male or female, young or old, married or single. And just to make sure that temptation is ever more accessible, the adversary is busy extending his coverage, as they say in the industry, to cell phones, video games, and MP3 players.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p5" pid="huGdouGU9Eyab0vo6n-H_Q" hash="NjiMqA">If we stop chopping at the branches of this problem and strike more directly at the root of the tree, not surprisingly we find lust lurking furtively there. <span class="emphasis">Lust</span> is an unsavory word, and it is certainly an unsavory topic for me to address, but there is good reason why in some traditions it is known as the most deadly of the seven deadly sins.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p6" pid="OUnTGY2YoE6NkYt6R1tg6Q" hash="bBzzVA">Why is lust such a deadly sin? Well, in addition to the completely Spirit-destroying impact it has upon our souls, I think it is a sin because it defiles the highest and holiest relationship God gives us in mortality—the love that a man and a woman have for each other and the desire that couple has to bring children into a family intended to be forever. Someone said once that true love must include the idea of permanence. True love endures. But lust changes as quickly as it can turn a pornographic page or glance at yet another potential object for gratification walking by, male or female. True love we are absolutely giddy about—as I am about Sister Holland; we shout it from the housetops. But lust is characterized by shame and stealth and is almost <span class="pageBreak" page-number="45"></span>pathologically clandestine—the later and darker the hour the better, with a double-bolted door just in case. Love makes us instinctively reach out to God and other people. Lust, on the other hand, is anything but godly and celebrates self-indulgence. Love comes with open hands and open heart; lust comes with only an open appetite.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/place-no-more-for-the-enemy-of-my-soul.p7" pid="NswLIx-UCUSjYrD1hax4kQ" hash="cgHLEQ">These are just some of the reasons that prostituting the true meaning of love—either with imagination or another person—is so destructive. It destroys that which is second only to our faith in God—namely, faith in those we love. It shakes the pillars of trust upon which present—or future—love is built, and it takes a long time to rebuild that trust when it is lost. Push that idea far enough—whether it be as personal as a family member or as public as elected officials, business leaders, media stars, and athletic heroes—and soon enough on the building once constructed to house morally responsible societies, we can hang a sign saying, “This property is vacant.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

As those battling something like alcoholism know, the pull of proximity can be fatal. So too in moral matters. Like Joseph in the presence of Potiphar’s wife,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> just run—run as far away as you can get from whatever or whoever it is that beguiles you. And please, when fleeing the scene of temptation, do <span class="emphasis">not</span> leave a forwarding address.</p>

Seek that help and welcome it. Talk to your bishop. Follow his counsel. Ask for a priesthood blessing. Use the Church’s Family Services offerings or seek other suitable professional help. Pray without ceasing. Ask for angels to help you.</p>

          <p pid="f1wlkZ-oVE2lhjNiQERdhQ" hash="s-YYwA">Along with filters on computers and a lock on affections, remember that the only real control in life is self-control. Exercise more control over even the marginal moments that confront you. If a TV show is indecent, turn it off. If a movie is crude, walk out. If an improper relationship is developing, sever it. Many of these influences, at least initially, may not technically be evil, but they can blunt our judgment, dull our spirituality, and lead to something that could be evil. An old proverb says that a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> so watch your step.</p>

But we don’t have to throw open the door, serve them tea and crumpets, and then tell them where the silverware is kept! (You shouldn’t be serving tea anyway.) Throw the rascals out! Replace lewd thoughts with hopeful images and joyful memories; picture the faces of those who love you and would be shattered if you let them down. More than one man has been saved from sin or stupidity by remembering the face of his mother, his wife, or his child waiting somewhere for him at home. Whatever thoughts you have, make sure they are welcome in your heart by invitation only. As an ancient poet once said, let will be your reason.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

We love you, we admire you, and we sustain you. Indeed, in this afternoon’s session we will have a more formal opportunity to raise our hands in a sustaining vote, not only for President Monson but also for all the other general officers of the Church as well. Because my name will be included on that list, may I be so bold as to speak for all in thanking you in advance for those uplifted hands. Not one of us could serve without your prayers and without your support. Your loyalty and your love mean more to us than we can ever possibly say.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/because-of-your-faith.p2" pid="XTcJRBRji0S4cZf-tETKSg" hash="409iPQ">In that spirit my message today is to say that <span class="emphasis">we</span> sustain <span class="emphasis">you,</span> that we return to <span class="emphasis">you</span> those same heartfelt prayers and that same expression of love. We all know there are special keys, covenants, and responsibilities given to the presiding officers of the Church, but we also know that the Church draws incomparable strength, a truly unique vitality, from the faith and devotion of <span class="emphasis">every</span> member of this Church, whoever you may be. In whatever country you live, however young or inadequate you feel, or however aged or limited you see yourself as being, I testify you are individually loved of God, you are central to the meaning of His work, and you are cherished and prayed for by the presiding officers of His Church. The personal value, the sacred splendor of every <span class="emphasis">one</span> of you, is the very reason there is a plan for salvation and exaltation. Contrary to the parlance of the day, this <span class="emphasis">is</span> about <span class="emphasis">you.</span> No, don’t turn and look at your neighbor. I am talking to you!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/because-of-your-faith.p3" pid="yOsVzUvrR0O0f0gpFpqZGw" hash="lDV4lQ">I have struggled to find an adequate way to tell you how loved of God you are and how grateful we on this stand are for you. I am trying to be voice for the very angels of heaven in thanking you for every good thing you have ever done, for every kind word you have ever said, for every sacrifice you have ever made in extending to someone—to anyone—the beauty and blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/because-of-your-faith.p4" pid="GchaOAsPPU6Fja-LGTsOTg" hash="Mh_vSQ">I am grateful for Young Women leaders who go to girls camp and, without shampoo, showers, or mascara, turn smoky, campfire testimony meetings into some of the most riveting spiritual experiences those girls—or those leaders—will experience in their lifetime. I am grateful for <span class="emphasis">all</span> the women of the Church who in my life have been as strong as Mount Sinai and as compassionate as the Mount of Beatitudes. We smile sometimes about our sisters’ stories—you know, green Jell-O, quilts, and funeral potatoes. But my family has been the grateful recipient of each of those items at one time or another—and in one case, the quilt and the funeral potatoes on the same day. It was just a small quilt—tiny, really—to make my deceased baby brother’s journey back to his heavenly home as warm and comfortable as our Relief Society sisters wanted him to be. The food provided for our family after the service, voluntarily given without a single word from us, was gratefully received. Smile, if you will, about our traditions, but somehow the too-often unheralded women in this church are <span class="emphasis">always</span> there when hands hang down and knees are feeble.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> They seem to grasp instinctively the divinity in Christ’s declaration: “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these … , ye have done it unto me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

I think, for example, of the leaders of our young men who, depending on the climate and continent, either take bone-rattling 50-mile (80 km) hikes or dig—and actually try to sleep in—ice caves for what have to be the longest nights of human experience. I am grateful for memories of my own high priests group, which a few years ago took turns for weeks sleeping on a small recliner in the bedroom of a dying quorum member so that his aged and equally fragile wife could get some sleep through those final weeks of her sweetheart’s life. I am grateful for the Church’s army of teachers, officers, advisers, and clerks, to say nothing of people who are forever setting up tables and taking down chairs. I am grateful for ordained patriarchs, musicians, family historians, and osteoporotic couples who trundle off to the temple at 5:00 in the morning with little suitcases now almost bigger than they are. I am grateful for selfless parents who—perhaps for a lifetime—care for a challenged child, sometimes with more than one challenge and sometimes with more than one child. I am grateful for children who close ranks later in life to give back to ill or aging parents.</p>

I guess I’ve only been a helper,” I say, “Dear sister, God bless you and all the ‘helpers’ in the kingdom.” Some of us who <span class="emphasis">are</span> leaders hope someday to have the standing before God that you have already attained.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/because-of-your-faith.p7" pid="uKwBHjSV_EWLMoxKLh2ARQ" hash="V-cT9w">Too often I have failed to express gratitude for the faith and goodness of such people in my life. President James E. Faust stood at this pulpit 13 years ago and said, “As a small boy … , I remember my grandmother … cooking our delicious meals on a hot woodstove. When the wood box next to the stove became empty, Grandmother would silently … go out to refill it from the pile of cedar wood outside, and bring the heavily laden box back into the house. I was so insensitive … [that] I sat there and let my beloved grandmother refill [that] box.” Then, his voice choking with emotion, he said, “I feel ashamed of myself and have regretted my omission for all of my life. I hope someday to ask for her forgiveness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/because-of-your-faith.p8" pid="3WkQxJMEKkm6RUZZlQiI3g" hash="8XbBbw">If a man as perfect as I felt President Faust was can acknowledge his youthful oversight, I can do no less than make a similar admission and pay a long-overdue tribute of my own today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/because-of-your-faith.p9" pid="v6EUs1o3REaVI6HwC4wfwA" hash="pXMsPQ">When I was called to serve a mission back before the dawn of time, there was no equalization of missionary costs. Each had to bear the full expense of the mission to which he or she was sent. Some missions were very expensive, and as it turned out, mine was one of those.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/because-of-your-faith.p10" pid="NM6B2WNYHkWtFUGwlwYfgw" hash="6p99Zg">As we encourage missionaries to do, I had saved money and sold personal belongings to pay my own way as best I could. I <span class="emphasis">thought</span> I had enough money, but I wasn’t sure how it would be in the final months of my mission. With that question on my mind, I nevertheless blissfully left my family for the greatest experience anyone could hope to have. I loved my mission as I am sure no young man has ever loved one before or since.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/because-of-your-faith.p11" pid="7jvYNyzgjUe7sWSTnxGCuA" hash="fXIDgw">Then I returned home just as my parents were called to serve a mission of their own. What would I do now? How in the world could I pay for a college education? How could I possibly pay for board and room? And how could I realize the great dream of my heart, to marry the breathtakingly perfect Patricia Terry? I don’t mind admitting that I was discouraged and frightened.</p>

He looked surprised and said, “Why, Jeff, it’s <span class="emphasis">all</span> in your account. Didn’t they tell you? Your parents wanted to do what little they could to help you get started when you got home. They didn’t withdraw a cent during your mission. I supposed that you knew.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/because-of-your-faith.p13" pid="S_4bM5lHU0GkllnuvnnxqQ" hash="mZ8uPw">Well, I didn’t know. What I do know is that my dad, a self-educated accountant, a “bookkeeper” as they were called in our little town, with very few clients, probably never wore a new suit or a new shirt or a new pair of shoes for two years so his son could have all of those for his mission. Furthermore, what I did not know but then came to know was that my mother, who had never worked out of the home in her married life, took a job at a local department store so that my mission expenses could be met. And not one word of that was ever conveyed to me on my mission. Not a single word was said regarding any of it. How many fathers in this Church have done exactly what my father did? And how many mothers, in these difficult economic times, are still doing what my mother did?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/because-of-your-faith.p14" pid="ML0OcsAfG06RpqqQomP8bA" hash="_H8B7A">My father has been gone for 34 years, so like President Faust, I will have to wait to fully thank him on the other side. But my sweet mother, who turns 95 next week, is happily watching this broadcast today at her home in St. George, so it’s not too late to thank her. To you, Mom and Dad, and to all the moms and dads and families and faithful people everywhere, I thank you for sacrificing for your children (and for other people’s children!), for wanting so much to give them advantages you never had, for wanting so much to give them the happiest life you could provide.</p>

We are honored beyond expression to be counted one with you in such a sacred cause.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p1" pid="c7TOBLmGZkyx2N1BoZoOyA" hash="kyl9kA">I have been so moved by every note of music sung and every word spoken that I pray I can be able to speak at all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p2" pid="AqDFoBl-WEOXnma8nO9ggw" hash="7WHtLQ">Before leaving Nauvoo in the winter of 1846, President Brigham Young had a dream in which he saw an angel standing on a cone-shaped hill somewhere in the West pointing to a valley below. When he entered the Salt Lake Valley some 18 months later, he saw just above the location where we are now gathered the same hillside prominence he had seen in vision.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p3" pid="IbAmiXnTXEm0m6vf7dZnQg" hash="ZodoOQ">As has often been told from this pulpit, Brother Brigham led a handful of leaders to the summit of that hill and proclaimed it Ensign Peak, a name filled with religious meaning for these modern Israelites. Twenty-five hundred years earlier the prophet Isaiah had declared that in the last days “the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains,” and there “he shall set up an ensign for the nations.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p4" pid="azhea6qzSEGF0SkALrfYGw" hash="I2o8QA">Seeing their moment in history as partial fulfillment of that prophecy, the Brethren wished to fly a banner of some kind to make the idea of “an ensign for the nations” literal. Elder Heber C. Kimball produced a yellow bandana. Brother Brigham tied it to a walking stick carried by Elder Willard Richards and then planted the makeshift flag, declaring the valley of the Great Salt Lake and the mountains surrounding it as that prophesied place from which the word of the Lord would go forth in the latter days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p5" pid="gji4d91Z1UOfs-q5erAcnw" hash="9N2PVw">Brothers and sisters, this general conference and the other annual and semiannual versions of it are the continuation of that early declaration to the world. I testify that the proceedings of the past two days are yet one more evidence that, as our hymn says, “Lo, Zion’s standard is unfurled”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span>—and surely the dual meaning of the word <span class="emphasis">standard </span>is intentional. It is not happenstance that one English publication of our general conference messages is in a magazine simply titled the<span class="emphasis"> Ensign.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p6" pid="SPHQ0BGASU-SIzdbrHIhqg" hash="T0rGwA">As our conference comes to a close, I ask you to reflect in the days ahead not only on the messages you have heard but also on the unique phenomenon that general conference itself is—what we as Latter-day Saints believe such conferences to be and what we invite the world to hear and observe about them. We testify to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people that God not only lives but also that He speaks, that for our time and in our day the counsel you have heard is, under the direction of the Holy Spirit, “the will of the Lord, … the word of the Lord, … the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p7" pid="lUIpvpehGEqwh3x1Vf-l8g" hash="Y1JkEA">Perhaps you already know (but if you don’t you should) that with rare exception, no man or woman who speaks here is assigned a topic. Each is to fast and pray, study and seek, start and stop and start again until he or she is confident that for this conference, at this time, his or hers is the topic the Lord wishes that speaker to present regardless of personal wishes or private preferences. Every man and woman you have heard during the past 10 hours of general conference has tried to be true to that prompting. Each has wept, worried, and earnestly sought the Lord’s direction to guide his or her thoughts and expression. And just as Brigham Young saw an angel standing over this place, so do I see angels standing in it. My brethren and sisters among the general officers of the Church will be uneasy with that description, but that is how I see them—mortal messengers with angelic messages, men and women who have all the physical and financial and family difficulties you and I have but who with faith have consecrated their lives to the callings that have come to them and the duty to preach God’s word, not their own.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p8" pid="E1JIrKasQEurrUNEgAbABw" hash="fNM41Q">Consider the variety of the messages that you hear—all the more miraculous with no coordination except the direction of heaven. But why wouldn’t they be varied? Most of our congregation, seen or unseen, is made up of members of the Church. However, with marvelous new methods of communication, ever larger proportions of the audience for our conferences are not members of the Church—yet. So we must speak to those who know us very well and those who know us not at all. Within the Church alone we must speak to the children, the youth and young adults, the middle-aged, and the elderly. We must speak to families and parents and children at home even as we speak to those who are not married, without children, and perhaps very far from home. In the course of a general conference, we always stress the eternal verities of faith, hope, charity,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> and Christ crucified<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> even as we speak forthrightly on very specific moral issues of the day. We are commanded in the scriptures to “say nothing but repentance unto this generation,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> while at the same time we are to preach “good tidings [to] the meek … [and] bind up the brokenhearted.” Whatever form they take, these conference messages “proclaim liberty to the captives”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> and declare “the unsearchable riches of Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> In the wide variety of sermons given is the assumption that there will be something for everyone. In this regard, I guess President Harold B. Lee put it best years ago when he said that the gospel is “to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the [comfortable].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p9" pid="Eyxj44AR30aZQQu6qEfImw" hash="87bjmQ">We always want our teaching in general conference to be as generous and open-armed as Christ taught originally, remembering as we do the discipline that was always inherent in His messages. In the most famous sermon ever given, Jesus began by pronouncing wonderfully gentle blessings which every one of us want to claim—blessings promised to the poor in spirit, the pure in heart, the peacemakers, and the meek.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> How edifying those Beatitudes are and how soothing they are to the soul. They are true. But in that same sermon the Savior went on, showing how increasingly strait the way of the peacemaker and the pure in heart would need to be. “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill,” He observed. “But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother … shall be in danger of the judgment.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

Clearly anyone who thinks Jesus taught no-fault theology did not read the fine print in the contract! No, in matters of discipleship the Church is not a fast-food outlet; we can’t always have it “our way.” Some day <span class="emphasis">every</span> knee shall bow and <span class="emphasis">every</span> tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ and that salvation can only come <span class="emphasis">His</span> way. <span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/an-ensign-to-the-nations.p14" pid="Nvq9RWaKTk2jxjVo4EpQGw" hash="HGgbNw">In wanting to measure up to the stern as well as embrace the soothing in our general conference messages, please be reassured that when we speak on difficult subjects, we understand not everyone is viewing pornography or shirking marriage or having illicit sexual relationships. We know not everyone is violating the Sabbath or bearing false witness or abusing a spouse. We know that most in our audience are <span class="emphasis">not</span> guilty of such things, but we are under a solemn charge to issue warning calls to those who are—wherever they may be in the world. So if you are trying to do the best you can—if, for example, you keep trying to hold family home evening in spite of the bedlam that sometimes reigns in a houseful of little bedlamites—then give yourself high marks and, when we come to that subject, listen for another which addresses a topic where you may be lacking.

Monson will come to the pulpit to close this conference. May I say something personal about this beloved man, the senior Apostle and the prophet for the day in which we now live. Given the responsibilities I have referred to and all that you have heard in this conference, it is obvious that the lives of prophets are not easy, and President Monson’s life is not easy. He referred specifically to that last night in priesthood meeting. Called to the apostleship at age 36, his children were ages 12, 9, and 4, respectively. Sister Monson and those children have given their husband and father to the Church and its duties for more than 50 years. They have endured the illnesses and demands, the bumps and bruises of mortality which everyone faces, some of which undoubtedly yet lie ahead of them. But President Monson stays irrepressibly cheerful through it all. Nothing gets him down. He has remarkable faith and unusual stamina.</p>

Your devotion is an example to us all. We thank you for your leadership. Fourteen others holding the apostolic office, plus others on this stand, those seated in the congregation, and legions gathered around the world love you, sustain you, and stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this work. We will lighten your load any way we can. You are one of those angelic messengers called from before the foundation of the world to wave the ensign of the gospel of Jesus Christ to all the world. You are doing so magnificently. Of that gospel being declared, the salvation it provides, and He who provides it, I so testify in the grand and glorious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p1" guid="4404e3ff-e9f0-4f4b-9cf5-db8d670f48ba" pid="IXRHy9F0WkKo-sMU_wetqA" hash="1wELFg">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="44"></span>In the spirit of that remarkably stirring hymn and with Elder Richard G. Hinckley’s eloquent invocation in my heart, I wish to speak rather candidly tonight, brethren, and I include in that candor the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p2" guid="3cdddde5-2bb6-4b0e-a138-2f7ee447cfb4" pid="aBQ3AJ6S30m3r3ePo0au2A" hash="9krSrA">When we rehearse the grandeur of Joseph Smith’s First Vision, we sometimes gloss over the menacing confrontation that came just prior to it, a confrontation intended to destroy the boy if possible but in any case to block the revelation that was to come. We don’t talk about the adversary any more than we have to, and I don’t like talking about him at all, but the experience of young Joseph reminds us of what every man, including every young man, in this audience needs to remember.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p3" guid="cc617073-390b-4262-938c-dbb8dca9cd1f" pid="JVGnL6LDk0G2XuQ4YIOQYA" hash="Bfi6nA">Number one, Satan, or Lucifer, or the father of lies—call him what you will—is real, the very personification of evil. His motives are in every case malicious, and he convulses at the appearance of redeeming light, at the very thought of truth. Number two, he is eternally opposed to the love of God, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and the work of peace and salvation. He will fight against these whenever and wherever he can. He knows he will be defeated and cast out in the end, but he is determined to take down with him as many others as he possibly can.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p4" guid="36b28994-34f0-4022-9451-c675c2620aa7" pid="5owLLkqhmUC7djjIrMOijg" hash="cYvHjQ">So what are some of the devil’s tactics in this contest when eternal life is at stake? Here again the experience in the Sacred Grove is instructive. Joseph recorded that in an effort to oppose all that lay ahead, Lucifer exerted “such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p5" guid="ac0b30e3-f3b6-4513-9f33-85bfa37d8522" pid="RNKZnDYEsUmPJ3XtH6PM-g" hash="T19NOA">As President Boyd K. Packer taught this morning, Satan cannot directly take a life. That is one of many things he cannot do. But apparently his effort to stop the work will be reasonably well served if he can just bind the tongue of the faithful. Brethren, if that is the case, I am looking tonight for men young and old who care enough about this battle between good and evil to sign on and speak up. We are at war, and for these next few minutes, I want to be a one-man recruiting station.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p6" guid="6f9e9a65-a345-4ace-9367-99bbf8936b1e" pid="KHVJZFI1U0GQIzedcOceQQ" hash="FEdPWA">Do I need to hum a few bars of “We Are All Enlisted”? You know, the line about “We are waiting now for soldiers; who’ll volunteer?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Of course, the great thing about this call to arms is <span class="pageBreak" page-number="45"></span>that we ask <span class="emphasis">not</span> for volunteers to fire a rifle or throw a hand grenade. No, we want battalions who will take as their weapons “every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> So I am looking tonight for missionaries who will not voluntarily bind their tongues but will, with the Spirit of the Lord and the power of their priesthood, open their mouths and speak miracles. Such speech, the early brethren taught, would be the means by which faith’s “mightiest works have been, and will be, performed.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p7" guid="b5803fe5-123c-48af-adb7-afe346568279" pid="02zSO9NcVUSr1C7XrxNMsw" hash="Rr339A">I especially ask the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood to sit up and take notice. For you, let me mix in an athletic analogy. This is a life-and-death contest we are in, young men, so I am going to get in your face a little, nose to nose, with just enough fire in my voice to singe your eyebrows a little—the way coaches do when the game is close and victory means everything. And with the game on the line, what this coach is telling you is that to play in this match, some of you have to be more morally clean than you now are. In this battle between good and evil, you cannot play for the adversary whenever temptation comes along and then expect to suit up for the Savior at temple and mission time as if nothing has happened. That, my young friends, you cannot do. God will not be mocked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p8" guid="8771eff3-9676-4aeb-80aa-0908a8961cd3" pid="htOqmN0xMU2Vj4zCEcCFcw" hash="VyVU3A">So we have a dilemma tonight, you and I. It is that there are thousands of Aaronic Priesthood–age young men already on the records of this Church who constitute our pool of candidates for future missionary service. But the challenge is to have those deacons, teachers, and priests stay active enough and worthy enough to be ordained elders and serve as missionaries. So we need young men already on the team to <span class="emphasis">stay</span> on it and stop dribbling out of bounds just when we need you to get in the game and play your hearts out! In almost all athletic contests of which I know, there are lines drawn on the floor or the field within which every participant must stay in order to compete. Well, the Lord has drawn lines of worthiness for those called to labor with Him in this work. No missionary can be unrepentant of sexual transgression or profane language or pornographic indulgence and then expect to challenge others to repent of those very things! You can’t do that. The Spirit will not be with you, and the words will choke in your throat as you speak them. You cannot travel down what Lehi called “forbidden paths”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> and expect to guide others to the “strait and narrow”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> one—it can’t be done.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p9" guid="e58d3041-ee2a-405e-b402-8e78ca7364b6" pid="dTBuDgqyuEqBALB1jtH1Qg" hash="4tFOdQ">But there is an answer to this challenge for you every bit as much as there is for that investigator to whom you will go. Whoever you are and whatever you have done, you can be forgiven. Every one of you young men can leave behind any transgression with which you may struggle. It is the miracle of forgiveness; it is the miracle of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. But you cannot do it without an active commitment to the gospel, and you cannot do it without repentance where it is needed. I am asking you young men to be active and be clean. If required, I am asking you to <span class="emphasis">get</span> active and <span class="emphasis">get</span> clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p10" guid="8222b983-8bc4-4e0e-ba4b-6a68384c09f7" pid="AVHRAhIbLU2gQxWgXgkSDg" hash="49b47Q">Now, brethren, we speak boldly to you because anything more subtle doesn’t seem to work. We speak boldly because Satan is a real being set on destroying you, and you face his influence at a younger and younger age. So we grab you by the lapels and shout as forcefully as we know how:</p>

Bless you! We also recognize that there are some who have hoped all their lives to serve missions, but for health reasons or other impediments beyond their control, they cannot do so. We publicly and proudly salute this group. We know of your desires, and we applaud your devotion. You have our love and our admiration. You are “on the team” and you always will be, even as you are honorably excused from full-time service. But we need the rest of you!</p>

I am not through here. We need thousands of more couples serving in the missions of the Church. Every mission president pleads for them. Everywhere they serve, our couples bring a maturity to the work that no number of 19-year-olds, however good they are, can provide.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/we-are-all-enlisted.p14" guid="7d2edf19-ffc6-4017-9c35-9edaf39b0a2a" pid="ZpGxIVCIP0mMerlBmNHfgA" hash="hlSwaw">To encourage more couples to serve, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve have made one of the boldest and most generous moves seen in missionary work in the last 50 years. In May of this year, priesthood leaders in the field received a notice that housing costs for couples (and we speak <span class="emphasis">only</span> of housing costs) would be supplemented by Church missionary funds if the cost exceeds a predetermined amount per month. What a blessing! This is heaven-sent assistance toward the single largest expense our couples face on their missions. The Brethren have also determined that couple missions can be for 6 or 12 months as well as the traditional 18 or 23. In another wonderful gesture, permission is given for couples, at their own expense, to return home briefly for critical family events. And stop worrying that you are going to have to knock on doors or keep the same schedule as the 19-year-olds! We don’t ask you to do that, but we have a host of other things you can do, with a great deal of latitude in how you do them.</p>

But with a little planning many of you can go.</p>

Sit on the stand in your meetings and prayerfully look into the congregation for impressions about those who should receive a call. Then counsel with them and help them set a date for service. Brethren, when that happens, tell your wives that if you can leave your recliner and the remote control for a few short months, they can leave the grandchildren. Those little darlings will be just fine, and I promise you will do things for them in the service of the Lord that, worlds without end, you could never do if you stayed home to hover over them. What greater gift could grandparents give their posterity than to say by deed as well as word, “In this family we serve missions!”</p>

But almost everything else we need to do depends on people <span class="pageBreak" page-number="47"></span>first hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ and coming into the faith. Surely that is why Jesus’s final charge to the Twelve was just that basic—to “go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Then, and only then, can the rest of the blessings of the gospel fully come—family solidarity, youth programs, priesthood promises, and ordinances flowing right up to the temple. But as Nephi testified, none of that can come until one has “enter[ed] into the … gate.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> With all that there is to do along the path to eternal life, we need a lot more missionaries opening that gate and helping people through it.</p>

The scripture says he came back a final time, “about the eleventh hour” (approximately 5:00 p.m.), and hired a concluding number. Then just an hour later, all the workers gathered to receive their day’s wage. Surprisingly, all received the <span class="emphasis">same</span> wage in spite of the different hours of labor. Immediately, those hired first were angry, saying, “These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> When reading this parable, perhaps you, as well as those workers, have felt there was an injustice being done here. Let me speak briefly to that concern.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p7" pid="tBi7EKAtb0KQoSbIeoZqtg" hash="tiyhVA">First of all it is important to note that <span class="emphasis">no one</span> has been treated unfairly here. The first workers agreed to the full wage of the day, and they received it. Furthermore, they were, I can only imagine, very grateful to get the work. In the time of the Savior, an average man and his family could not do much more than live on what they made that day. If you didn’t work or farm or fish or sell, you likely didn’t eat. With more prospective workers than jobs, these first men chosen were the most fortunate in the entire labor pool that morning.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p8" pid="XkVXDm9TiEGYhGncttP-Ww" hash="je8zXA">Indeed, if there is any sympathy to be generated, it should at least initially be for the men <span class="emphasis">not</span> chosen who also had mouths to feed and backs to clothe. Luck never seemed to be with some of them. With each visit of the steward throughout the day, they always saw someone else chosen.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p9" pid="n-ksfgsz2UuFzKPhJzvbiA" hash="oQ53XQ">But just at day’s close, the householder returns a surprising fifth time with a remarkable eleventh-hour offer! These last and most discouraged of laborers, hearing only that they will be treated fairly, accept work without even knowing the wage, knowing that <span class="emphasis">anything</span> will be better than nothing, which is what they have had so far. Then as they gather for their payment, they are stunned to receive the same as all the others! How awestruck they must have been and how very, very grateful! Surely never had such compassion been seen in all their working days.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p10" pid="XChv1VQlpUe7vsJR7d8GEA" hash="mC1Oww">It is with that reading of the story that I feel the grumbling of the first laborers must be seen. As the householder in the parable tells them (and I paraphrase only slightly): “My friends, I am not being unfair to you. You agreed on the wage for the day, a good wage. You were very happy to get the work, and I am very happy with the way you served. You are paid in full. Take your pay and enjoy the blessing. As for the others, <span class="emphasis">surely I am free to do what I like with my own money.</span>” Then this piercing question to anyone then or now who needs to hear it: “<span class="emphasis">Why should</span> you <span class="emphasis">be jealous because</span> I <span class="emphasis">choose to be kind?</span>”</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p11" pid="7Z2qPR8KeEWMe1wbSWIKgA" hash="Hynu0g">Brothers and sisters, there are going to be times in our lives when someone else gets an unexpected blessing or receives some special recognition. May I plead with us not to be hurt—and certainly not to feel envious—when good fortune comes to another person? We are not diminished when someone else is added upon. We are not in a race against each other to see who is the wealthiest or the most talented or the most beautiful or even the most blessed. The race we are <span class="emphasis">really</span> in is the race against sin, and surely envy is one of the most universal of those.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p12" pid="q4iS8hZ82USwI2iBYA2Upw" hash="Fq9bwg">Furthermore, envy is a mistake that just keeps on giving. Obviously <span class="pageBreak" page-number="32"></span>we suffer a little when some <span class="emphasis">misfortune</span> befalls <span class="emphasis">us,</span> but envy requires us to suffer all <span class="emphasis">good fortune</span> that befalls <span class="emphasis">everyone</span> we know! What a bright prospect that is—downing another quart of pickle juice every time anyone around you has a happy moment! To say nothing of the chagrin in the end, when we find that God really is both just and merciful, giving to all who stand with Him “all that he hath,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> as the scripture says. So lesson number one from the Lord’s vineyard: coveting, pouting, or tearing others down does <span class="emphasis">not</span> elevate <span class="emphasis">your</span> standing, nor does demeaning someone else improve your self-image. So be kind, and be grateful that God is kind. It is a happy way to live.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p13" pid="w52gmK_dVkaMYao8JJhmyQ" hash="oY1M4A">A second point I wish to take from this parable is the sorrowful mistake some could make if they were to forgo the receipt of their wages at the <span class="emphasis">end</span> of the day because they were preoccupied with perceived problems <span class="emphasis">earlier</span> in the day. It doesn’t say here that anyone threw his coin in the householder’s face and stormed off penniless, but I suppose one might have.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p14" pid="3hAwQMPLu0KqmXVKhC7niQ" hash="xc9Htg">My beloved brothers and sisters, what happened in this story at 9:00 or noon or 3:00 is swept up in the grandeur of the universally generous payment at the end of the day. The formula of faith is to hold on, work on, see it through, and let the distress of earlier hours—real or imagined—fall away in the abundance of the final reward. Don’t dwell on old issues or grievances—not toward yourself nor your neighbor nor even, I might add, toward this true and living Church. The majesty of your life, of your neighbor’s life, and of the gospel of Jesus Christ will be made manifest at the last day, even if such majesty is not always recognized by everyone in the early going. So don’t hyperventilate about something that happened at 9:00 in the morning when the grace of God is trying to reward you at 6:00 in the evening—whatever your labor arrangements have been through the day.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p15" pid="1VSQ3BSCk0us28J1znsHsA" hash="d34cbQ">We consume such precious emotional and spiritual capital clinging tenaciously to the memory of a discordant note we struck in a childhood piano recital, or something a spouse said or did 20 years ago that we are determined to hold over his or her head for another 20, or an incident in Church history that proved no more or less than that mortals will always struggle to measure up to the immortal hopes placed before them. Even if one of those grievances did not originate with you, it can end with you. And what a reward there will be for that contribution when the Lord of the vineyard looks you in the eye and accounts are settled at the end of our earthly day.</p>

This parable—like all parables—is not really about laborers or wages any more than the others are about sheep and goats. This is a story about God’s goodness, His patience and forgiveness, and the Atonement <span class="pageBreak" page-number="33"></span>of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a story about generosity and compassion. It is a story about grace. It underscores the thought I heard many years ago that surely the thing God enjoys most about being God is the thrill of being merciful, especially to those who don’t expect it and often feel they don’t deserve it.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-laborers-in-the-vineyard.p17" pid="04Q010IQwU6qePUhWbdKhQ" hash="fPH8Pw">I do not know who in this vast audience today may need to hear the message of forgiveness inherent in this parable, but however late you think you are, however many chances you think you have missed, however many mistakes you feel you have made or talents you think you don’t have, or however far from home and family and God you feel you have traveled, I testify that you have <span class="emphasis">not</span> traveled beyond the reach of divine love. It is not possible for you to sink lower than the infinite light of Christ’s Atonement shines.</p>

There is no problem which you cannot overcome. There is no dream that in the unfolding of time and eternity cannot yet be realized. Even if you feel you are the lost and last laborer of the eleventh hour, the Lord of the vineyard still stands beckoning. “Come boldly [to] the throne of grace,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> and fall at the feet of the Holy One of Israel. Come and feast “without money and without price”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> at the table of the Lord.</p>

Brethren, step up. Do it for your sake. Do it for the sake of those who love you and are praying that you will respond.

Please listen to the prompting of the Holy Spirit telling you right now, this very moment, that you should accept the atoning gift of the Lord Jesus Christ and enjoy the fellowship of His labor.

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="83"></span>There is almost no group in history for whom I have more sympathy than I have for the eleven remaining Apostles immediately following the death of the Savior of the world. I think we sometimes forget just how inexperienced they still were and how totally dependent upon Jesus they had of necessity been. To them He had said, “Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me … ?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p6" pid="vE8aO_BF4Uevcn2GNrjDtw" hash="6S2_8g">But, of course, to them He hadn’t been with them nearly long enough. Three years isn’t long to call an entire Quorum of Twelve Apostles from a handful of new converts, purge from them the error of old ways, teach them the wonders of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and then leave them to carry on the work until they too were killed. Quite a staggering prospect for a group of newly ordained elders.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p7" pid="dsf251DKCkOuK3Cee1ok1g" hash="0PVuyw">Especially the part about being left alone. Repeatedly Jesus had tried to tell them He was <span class="emphasis">not</span> going to remain physically present with them, but they either could not or would not comprehend such a wrenching thought. Mark writes:</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p8" pid="LGPowi4jBEiyYEbtOEfM2A" hash="-lb02g">“He taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p9" pid="RVkM8RVRKE-1OiDAjAuVCQ" hash="c-6ICw">“But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p10" pid="YJ6ffT8aVkmGGIJ8FyXgRg" hash="_JYOKw">Then, after such a short time to learn and even less time to prepare, the unthinkable happened, the unbelievable was true. Their Lord and Master, their Counselor and King, was crucified. His mortal ministry was over, and the struggling little Church He had established seemed doomed to scorn and destined for extinction. His Apostles did witness Him in His resurrected state, but that only added to their bewilderment. As they surely must have wondered, “What do we do now?” they turned for an answer to Peter, the senior Apostle.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p11" pid="sPDlxYxjAUq58psVlR_Vxg" hash="iqrnpg">Here I ask your indulgence as I take some nonscriptural liberty in my portrayal of this exchange. In effect, Peter said to his associates: “Brethren, it has been a glorious three years. None of us could have imagined such a few short months ago the miracles we have seen and the divinity we have enjoyed. We have talked with, prayed with, and labored with the very Son of God Himself. We have walked with Him and wept with Him, and on the night of that horrible ending, no one wept more bitterly than I. But that is over. He has finished His work, and He has risen from the tomb. He has worked out His salvation and ours. So you ask, ‘What do we do now?’ I don’t know more to tell you than to return to your former life, rejoicing. I intend to ‘go a fishing.’” And at least six of the ten other remaining Apostles said in agreement, “We also go with thee.” John, who was one of them, writes, “They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p12" pid="BeQgzrlbjkKO9DODbpMHkw" hash="opVUag">But, alas, the fishing wasn’t very good. Their first night back on the lake, they caught nothing—not a single fish. With the first rays of dawn, they disappointedly turned toward the shore, where they saw in the distance a figure who called out to them, “Children, have you caught anything?” Glumly these Apostles-turned-again-fishermen gave the answer no fisherman wants to give. “We have caught nothing,” they muttered, and to add insult to injury, they were being called “children.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p13" pid="gDj92kl9Gk6BivTEsp6ydw" hash="BcYJBw">“Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> the stranger calls out—and with those simple words, recognition begins to flood over them. Just three years earlier these very men had been fishing on this very sea. On that occasion too they had “toiled all the night, and [had] taken nothing,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> the scripture says. But a fellow Galilean on the shore had called out to them to let down their nets, and they drew “a great multitude of fishes,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> enough that their nets broke, the catch filling two boats so heavily they had begun to sink.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p14" pid="yZjPQayTmU-wTm8TZtb8rw" hash="KpBkAg">Now it was happening again. These “children,” as they were rightly called, eagerly lowered their net, and “they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> John said the obvious: “It is the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> And over <span class="pageBreak" page-number="84"></span>the edge of the boat, the irrepressible Peter leaped.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p15" pid="0OXAQl4ce0qpr3z9lPGFGw" hash="1-izOA">After a joyful reunion with the resurrected Jesus, Peter had an exchange with the Savior that I consider the crucial turning point of the apostolic ministry generally and certainly for Peter personally, moving this great rock of a man to a majestic life of devoted service and leadership. Looking at their battered little boats, their frayed nets, and a stunning pile of 153 fish, Jesus said to His senior Apostle, “Peter, do you love me more than you love all this?” Peter said, “Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p16" pid="fXtt1nNXYEGVHe8gH9k4zA" hash="5O33Vg">The Savior responds to that reply but continues to look into the eyes of His disciple and says again, “Peter, do you love me?” Undoubtedly confused a bit by the repetition of the question, the great fisherman answers a second time, “Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p17" pid="poOW-Qg7RE61nEEe_wOJOQ" hash="njEN7A">The Savior again gives a brief response, but with relentless scrutiny He asks for the third time, “Peter, do you love me?” By now surely Peter is feeling truly uncomfortable. Perhaps there is in his heart the memory of only a few days earlier when he had been asked another question three times and he had answered equally emphatically—but in the negative. Or perhaps he began to wonder if he misunderstood the Master Teacher’s question. Or perhaps he was searching his heart, seeking honest confirmation of the answer he had given so readily, almost automatically. Whatever his feelings, Peter said for the third time, “Lord, … thou knowest that I love thee.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p18" pid="6zM9rETN6Uq1cjFjYR42pA" hash="p2Vpqw">To which Jesus responded (and here again I acknowledge my nonscriptural elaboration), perhaps saying something like: “Then Peter, why are you here? Why are we back on this same shore, by these same nets, having this same conversation? Wasn’t it obvious then and isn’t it obvious now that if I want fish, I can get fish? What I need, Peter, are disciples—and I need them forever. I need someone to feed my sheep and save my lambs. I need someone to preach my gospel and defend my faith. I need someone who loves me, truly, truly loves me, and loves what our Father in Heaven has commissioned me to do. Ours is not a feeble message. It is not a fleeting task. It is not hapless; it is not hopeless; it is not to be consigned to the ash heap of history. It is the work of Almighty God, and it is to change the world. So, Peter, for the second and presumably the last time, I am asking you to leave all this and to go teach and testify, labor and serve loyally until the day in which they will do to you exactly what they did to me.”</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p19" pid="u-2TGNeFKE2s_u-gLbNLgA" hash="mwau-g">Then, turning to all the Apostles, He might well have said something like: “Were you as foolhardy as the scribes and Pharisees? As Herod and Pilate? Did you, like they, think that this work could be killed simply by killing me? Did you, like they, think the cross and the nails and the tomb were the end of it all and each could blissfully go back to being whatever you were before? Children, did not my life and my love touch your hearts more deeply than this?”</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p20" pid="mAM-zY461k6pqDKld4-2sg" hash="WMTsqQ">My beloved brothers and sisters, I am not certain just what our experience will be on Judgment Day, but I will be very surprised if at some point in that conversation, God does not ask us exactly what Christ asked Peter: “Did you love me?” I think He will want to know if in our very mortal, very inadequate, and sometimes childish grasp of things, did we at least understand <span class="emphasis">one</span> commandment, the first and greatest commandment of them all—“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> And if at such a moment we can stammer out, “Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee,” then He may remind us that the crowning characteristic of love is always loyalty.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p21" pid="MoqhcXld00eIfEZ7Ay-Spw" hash="uOS4Sw">“If ye love me, keep my commandments,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> Jesus said. So we have neighbors to bless, children to protect, the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="85"></span>poor to lift up, and the truth to defend. We have wrongs to make right, truths to share, and good to do. In short, we have a life of devoted discipleship to give in demonstrating our love of the Lord. We can’t quit and we can’t go back. After an encounter with the living Son of the living God, nothing is ever again to be as it was before. The Crucifixion, Atonement, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ mark the beginning of a Christian life, not the end of it. It was this truth, this reality, that allowed a handful of Galilean fishermen-turned-again-Apostles without “a single synagogue or sword”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> to leave those nets a second time and go on to shape the history of the world in which we now live.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p22" pid="PCN2jGZ890GS4Qmu9qVVqw" hash="Gg6Oew">I testify from the bottom of my heart, with the intensity of my soul, to all who can hear my voice that those apostolic keys have been restored to the earth, and they are found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. To those who have not yet joined with us in this great final cause of Christ, we say, “Please come.” To those who were once with us but have retreated, preferring to pick and choose a few cultural hors d’oeuvres from the smorgasbord of the Restoration and leave the rest of the feast, I say that I fear you face a lot of long nights and empty nets. The call is to come back, to stay true, to love God, and to lend a hand. I include in that call to fixed faithfulness every returned missionary who ever stood in a baptismal font and with arm to the square said, “Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> That commission was to have changed your convert forever, but it was surely supposed to have changed you forever as well. To the youth of the Church rising up to missions and temples and marriage, we say: “Love God and remain clean from the blood and sins of this generation. You have a monumental work to do, underscored by that marvelous announcement President Thomas S. Monson made yesterday morning. Your Father in Heaven expects your loyalty and your love at every stage of your life.”</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-first-great-commandment.p23" pid="UvPX1w47j0uy8MBg4ofFrA" hash="iPrR5A">To all within the sound of my voice, the voice of Christ comes ringing down through the halls of time, asking each one of us while there is time, “Do you love me?” And for every one of us, I answer with my honor and my soul, “Yea, Lord, we do love thee.” And having set our “hand to the plough,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> we will never look back until this work is finished and love of God and neighbor rules the world. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Holland</p><p class="kicker" pid="nhkrReeNCE-aRiGT62Tblg" hash="A4rGkA">Honestly acknowledge your questions and your concerns, but first and forever fan the flame of your faith, because all things are possible to them that believe.</p></div><div class="bodyBlock" pid="jo9pJt6bCEKFsL8rHHxk0Q" hash="XcRUDQ">
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p5" pid="sngHW8OQsE-XXTzA2VTWbQ" hash="qprnkg"><span class="pageBreak" page-number="93"></span>On one occasion Jesus came upon a group arguing vehemently with His disciples. When the Savior inquired as to the cause of this contention, the father of an afflicted child stepped forward, saying he had approached Jesus’s disciples for a blessing for his son, but they were not able to provide it. With the boy still gnashing his teeth, foaming from the mouth, and thrashing on the ground in front of them, the father appealed to Jesus with what must have been last-resort desperation in his voice:</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p6" pid="2CBBR_YQW0uRjm3kL7OlQw" hash="7RdYdA">“If thou canst do any thing,” he said, “have compassion on us, and help us.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p7" pid="1YWws4wUvk6i3T4AtY0YEw" hash="lttwyw">“Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p8" pid="4fTUaxjopEOto6UKf1kdWg" hash="T1mC4w">“And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p9" pid="CySveBd46keI4-3I3ftD7w" hash="FaCGtA">This man’s initial conviction, by his own admission, is limited. But he has an urgent, emphatic desire in behalf of his only child. We are told that is good enough for a beginning. “Even if ye can no more than <span class="emphasis">desire to believe,</span>” Alma declares, “let this desire work in you, even until ye believe.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> With no other hope remaining, this father asserts what faith he has and pleads with the Savior of the world, “If <span class="emphasis">thou</span> canst do <span class="emphasis">any thing,</span> have compassion on <span class="emphasis">us,</span> and help <span class="emphasis">us.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> I can hardly read those words without weeping. The plural pronoun <span class="emphasis">us</span> is obviously used intentionally. This man is saying, in effect, “Our whole family is pleading. Our struggle never ceases. We are exhausted. Our son falls into the water. He falls into the fire. He is continually in danger, and we are continually afraid. We don’t know where else to turn. Can <span class="emphasis">you</span> help us? We will be grateful for <span class="emphasis">anything—</span>a partial blessing, a glimmer of hope, some small lifting of the burden carried by this boy’s mother every day of her life.”</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p10" pid="Pup1fbptDESugRgIuVZErg" hash="HM9_UQ">“If <span class="emphasis">thou</span> canst do <span class="emphasis">any thing,</span>” spoken by the father, comes back to him “If <span class="emphasis">thou</span> canst <span class="emphasis">believe,</span>” spoken by the Master.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p11" pid="61og9bD7j0C8zlFVijP9lA" hash="al76tQ">“Straightway,” the scripture says—not slowly nor skeptically nor cynically but “straightway”—the father cries out in his unvarnished parental pain, “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.” In response to new and still partial faith, Jesus heals the boy, almost literally raising him from the dead, as Mark describes the incident.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p12" pid="zWC0jQDOf0acQ5SVgiuQ2A" hash="y-ts1Q">With this tender scriptural record as a backdrop, I wish to speak directly to the young people of the Church—young in years of age or young in years of membership or young in years of faith. One way or another, that should include just about all of us.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p13" pid="HuMCvLumcEWkqEkMqhmkyw" hash="7skD-w">Observation number one regarding this account is that when facing the challenge of faith, the father asserts his strength first and only then acknowledges his limitation. His initial declaration is affirmative and without hesitation: “Lord, I believe.” I would say to all who wish for more faith, remember this man! In moments of fear <span class="pageBreak" page-number="94"></span>or doubt or troubling times, hold the ground you have already won, even if that ground is limited. In the growth we all have to experience in mortality, the spiritual equivalent of this boy’s affliction or this parent’s desperation is going to come to all of us. When those moments come and issues surface, the resolution of which is not immediately forthcoming, <span class="emphasis">hold fast to what you already know and stand strong until additional knowledge comes.</span> It was of this very incident, this specific miracle, that Jesus said, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> The size of your faith or the degree of your knowledge is not the issue—it is the integrity you demonstrate toward the faith you do have and the truth you already know.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p14" pid="1_njLyLJHEKIoDKNwm7Y-g" hash="Q3GC7Q">The second observation is a variation of the first. When problems come and questions arise, do not start your quest for faith by saying how much you do <span class="emphasis">not</span> have, leading as it were with your “unbelief.” That is like trying to stuff a turkey through the beak! Let me be clear on this point: I am not asking you to pretend to faith you do not have. I <span class="emphasis">am</span> asking you to be true to the faith you <span class="emphasis">do</span> have. Sometimes we act as if an honest declaration of doubt is a higher manifestation of moral courage than is an honest declaration of faith. It is not! So let us all remember the clear message of this scriptural account: Be as candid about your questions as you need to be; life is full of them on one subject or another. But if you and your family want to be healed, don’t let those questions stand in the way of faith working its miracle.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p15" pid="B5CPAzB_80S0Wox_FPAM3Q" hash="lf1SBw">Furthermore, you have more faith than you think you do because of what the Book of Mormon calls “the greatness of the evidences.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> “Ye shall know them by their fruits,” Jesus said,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> and the fruit of living the gospel is evident in the lives of Latter-day Saints everywhere. As Peter and John said once to an ancient audience, I say today, “We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard,” and what we have seen and heard is that “a notable miracle hath been done” in the lives of millions of members of this Church. That cannot be denied.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p16" pid="jUaE0SLQ30uGKDL5GtzbOg" hash="XmZYVg">Brothers and sisters, this is a divine work in process, with the manifestations and blessings of it abounding in every direction, so please don’t hyperventilate if from time to time issues arise that need to be examined, understood, and resolved. They do and they will. <span class="emphasis">In this Church, what we know will always trump what we do not know. And remember, in this world, everyone is to walk by faith.</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p17" pid="AI0Yueld7U-iaExxW6qadw" hash="aZWf7Q">So be kind regarding human frailty—your own as well as that of those who serve with you in a Church led by volunteer, mortal men and women. Except in the case of His only perfect Begotten Son, imperfect people are all God has ever had to work with. That must be terribly frustrating to Him, but He deals with it. So should we. And when you see imperfection, remember that the limitation is <span class="emphasis">not</span> in the divinity of the work. As one gifted writer has suggested, when the infinite fulness is poured forth, it is not the oil’s fault if there is some loss because finite vessels can’t quite contain it all.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Those finite vessels include you and me, so be patient and kind and forgiving.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p18" pid="MntSc7yDm0GCWYM93j2sZg" hash="Yhp9Wg">Last observation: When doubt or difficulty come, do not be afraid to ask for help. If we want it as humbly and honestly as this father did, we can get it. The scriptures phrase such earnest desire as being of “real intent,” pursued “with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> I testify that in response to <span class="emphasis">that</span> kind of importuning, God will send help from both sides of the veil to strengthen our belief.</p>
				<span class="story">
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p19" pid="FzOB-MXt_kiavs62XVOcmg" hash="NszwzA">I said I was speaking to the young. I still am. A 14-year-old boy recently said to me a little hesitantly, “Brother Holland, I can’t say yet that I know the Church is true, but I believe it is.” I hugged that boy until his eyes bulged out. I told him with all the fervor of my soul that <span class="emphasis">belief</span> is a precious word, an even more precious act, and he need never apologize for “only believing.” I told him that Christ Himself said, “Be not afraid, only believe,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> a phrase which, by the way, carried young Gordon B. Hinckley into the mission field.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> I told this boy that belief was always the first step toward conviction and that the definitive articles of our collective faith forcefully reiterate the phrase “We believe.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> <span class="pageBreak" page-number="95"></span>And I told him how very proud I was of him for the honesty of his quest.</p>
				</span>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p20" pid="ZkUXXj4fXke48EITzZmMtw" hash="y-H6xg">Now, with the advantage that nearly 60 years give me since I was a newly believing 14-year-old, I declare some things I now know. I know that God is at all times and in all ways and in all circumstances our loving, forgiving Father in Heaven. I know Jesus was His only perfect child, whose life was given lovingly by the will of both the Father and the Son for the redemption of all the rest of us who are not perfect. I know He rose from that death to live again, and because He did, you and I will also. I know that Joseph Smith, who acknowledged that he wasn’t perfect,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> was nevertheless the chosen instrument in God’s hand to restore the everlasting gospel to the earth. I also know that in doing so—particularly through translating the Book of Mormon—he has taught me more of God’s love, of Christ’s divinity, and of priesthood power than any other prophet of whom I have ever read, known, or heard in a lifetime of seeking. I know that President Thomas S. Monson, who moves devotedly and buoyantly toward the 50th anniversary of his ordination as an Apostle, is the rightful successor to that prophetic mantle today. We have seen that mantle upon him again in this conference. I know that 14 other men whom you sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators sustain him with their hands, their hearts, and their own apostolic keys.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe.p21" pid="eX3dFFijEE-SZpS8C-mp1A" hash="iJ5uOA">These things I declare to you with the conviction Peter called the “more sure word of prophecy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> What was once a tiny seed of belief for me has grown into the tree of life, so if your faith is a little tested in this or any season, I invite you to lean on mine. I know this work is God’s very truth, and I know that only at our peril would we allow doubt or devils to sway us from its path. Hope on. Journey on. Honestly acknowledge your questions and your concerns, but first and forever fan the flame of your faith, because all things are possible to them that believe. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p5" pid="wOkeZBoeh0yL2oJK7v_LNQ" hash="p58q-w"><span class="pageBreak" page-number="40"></span>The Apostle Peter wrote that disciples of Jesus Christ are to have “compassion one of another.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> In that spirit I wish to speak to those who suffer from some form of mental illness or emotional disorder, whether those afflictions be slight or severe, of brief duration or persistent over a lifetime. We sense the complexity of such matters when we hear professionals speak of neuroses and psychoses, of genetic predispositions and chromosome defects, of bipolarity, paranoia, and schizophrenia. However bewildering this all may be, these afflictions are some of the realities of mortal life, and there should be no more shame in acknowledging them than in acknowledging a battle with high blood pressure or the sudden appearance of a malignant tumor.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p6" pid="3DR4fFmXp0iILMbaenE9TQ" hash="gQWFsA">In striving for some peace and understanding in these difficult matters, it is crucial to remember that we are living—and chose to live—in a fallen world where for divine purposes our pursuit of godliness will be tested and tried again and again. Of greatest assurance in God’s plan is that a Savior was promised, a Redeemer, who through our faith in Him would lift us triumphantly over those tests and trials, even though the cost to do so would be unfathomable for both the Father who sent Him and the Son who came. It is only an appreciation of this divine love that will make our own lesser suffering first bearable, then understandable, and finally redemptive.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p7" pid="rmY1VR4soEiihCvqoZNZHA" hash="wQxJUQ">Let me leave the extraordinary illnesses I have mentioned to concentrate on MDD—“major depressive disorder”—or, more commonly, “depression.” When I speak of this, I am not speaking of bad hair days, tax deadlines, or other discouraging moments we all have. Everyone is going to be anxious or downhearted on occasion. The Book of Mormon says Ammon and his brethren were depressed at a very difficult time,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> and so can the rest of us be. But today I am speaking of something more serious, of an affliction so severe that it significantly restricts a person’s ability to function fully, a crater in the mind so deep that no one can responsibly suggest it would surely go away if those victims would just square their shoulders and think more positively—though I am a vigorous advocate of square shoulders and positive thinking!</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p8" pid="AT6CtPrSHEKwTHJxhjFSpQ" hash="RDf9uw">No, this dark night of the mind and spirit is more than mere discouragement. I have seen it come to an absolutely angelic man when his beloved spouse of 50 years passed away. I have seen it in new mothers with what is euphemistically labeled “after-baby blues.” I have seen it strike anxious students, military veterans, and grandmothers worried about the well-being of their grown children.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p9" pid="A0Oh3rer60KNJ2DnKBofHQ" hash="AhGnpg">And I have seen it in young fathers trying to provide for their families. In that regard I once terrifyingly saw it in myself. At one point in our married life when financial fears collided with staggering fatigue, I took a psychic blow that was as unanticipated as it was real. With the grace of God and the love of my family, I kept functioning and kept working, but even after all these years I continue to feel a deep sympathy for others more chronically or more deeply afflicted with such gloom than I was. In any case we have all taken courage from those who, in the words of the Prophet Joseph, “search[ed] … and contemplate[d] the darkest abyss”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> and persevered through it—not the least of whom were Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, and Elder George Albert Smith, the latter being one of the most gentle and Christlike men of our dispensation, who battled recurring depression for some years before later becoming the universally beloved eighth prophet and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p10" pid="blmbKbKshEuAZHgU_5uAwQ" hash="SnaMHA">So how do you best respond when mental or emotional challenges confront you or those you love? Above all, never lose faith in your Father in Heaven, who loves you more than you can comprehend. As President Monson said to the Relief Society sisters so movingly last Saturday evening: “That love never changes. … It is there for you when you are sad or happy, discouraged or hopeful. God’s love is there for you whether or not you feel you deserve [it]. It is simply always there.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Never, ever <span class="pageBreak" page-number="41"></span>doubt that, and never harden your heart. Faithfully pursue the time-tested devotional practices that bring the Spirit of the Lord into your life. Seek the counsel of those who hold keys for your spiritual well-being. Ask for and cherish priesthood blessings. Take the sacrament every week, and hold fast to the perfecting promises of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Believe in miracles. I have seen so many of them come when every other indication would say that hope was lost. Hope is <span class="emphasis">never</span> lost. If those miracles do not come soon or fully or seemingly at all, remember the Savior’s own anguished example: if the bitter cup does not pass, drink it and be strong, trusting in happier days ahead.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p11" pid="xAdTMpaMuEaFWdPYyTL-7A" hash="ODsMAg">In preventing illness whenever possible, watch for the stress indicators in yourself and in others you may be able to help. As with your automobile, be alert to rising temperatures, excessive speed, or a tank low on fuel. When you face “depletion depression,” make the requisite adjustments. Fatigue is the common enemy of us all—so slow down, rest up, replenish, and refill. Physicians promise us that if we do not take time to be well, we most assuredly will take time later on to be ill.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p12" pid="L044MPNJb0GV_5X1tUY3Sw" hash="ZReb6Q">If things continue to be debilitating, seek the advice of reputable people with certified training, professional skills, and good values. Be honest with them about your history and your struggles. Prayerfully and responsibly consider the counsel they give and the solutions they prescribe. If you had appendicitis, God would expect you to seek a priesthood blessing <span class="emphasis">and</span> get the best medical care available. So too with emotional disorders. Our Father in Heaven expects us to use <span class="emphasis">all</span> of the marvelous gifts He has provided in this glorious dispensation.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p13" pid="OoNvY7VcRU2BA8sECctVDQ" hash="XLWmig">If you are the one afflicted or a caregiver to such, try not to be overwhelmed with the size of your task. Don’t assume you can fix everything, but fix what you can. If those are only small victories, be grateful for them and be patient. Dozens of times in the scriptures, the Lord commands someone to “stand still” or “be still”—and wait.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Patiently enduring some things is part of our mortal education.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p14" pid="iXuzJVdc-U6dCtS5Y7I2mA" hash="QLtVVA">For caregivers, in your devoted effort to assist with another’s health, do not destroy your own. In all these things be wise. Do not run faster than you have strength.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Whatever else you may or may not be able to provide, you can offer your prayers and you can give “love unfeigned.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> “Charity suffereth long, and is kind; … [it] beareth all things, … hopeth all <span class="pageBreak" page-number="42"></span>things, endureth all things. Charity <span class="emphasis">never</span> faileth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p15" pid="GG5MLN38zk-ml7L1iA6hKQ" hash="DnAXIg">Also let us remember that through any illness or difficult challenge, there is still much in life to be hopeful about and grateful for. We are infinitely more than our limitations or our afflictions! Stephanie Clark Nielson and her family have been our friends for more than 30 years. On August 16, 2008, Stephanie and her husband, Christian, were in a plane crash and subsequent fire that scarred her so horrifically that only her painted toenails were recognizable when family members came to identify the victims. There was almost no chance Stephanie could live. After three months in a sleep-induced coma, she awoke to see herself. With that, the psyche-scarring and horrendous depression came. Having four children under the age of seven, Stephanie did not want them to see her ever again. She felt it would be better not to live. “I thought it would be easier,” Stephanie once told me in my office, “if they just forgot about me and I quietly slipped out of their life.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p16" pid="7O58LQm_UE-jmusSTyKSlg" hash="yIvKmw">But to her eternal credit, and with the prayers of her husband, family, friends, four beautiful children, and a fifth born to the Nielsons just 18 months ago, Stephanie fought her way back from the abyss of self-destruction to be one of the most popular “mommy bloggers” in the nation, openly declaring to the four million who follow her blog that her “divine purpose” in life is to be a mom and to cherish <span class="emphasis">every day</span> she has been given on this beautiful earth.</p>
		</span>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p17" pid="ObBBtY7ci0SCIvNdeKx3tg" hash="5e8gXw">Whatever your struggle, my brothers and sisters—mental or emotional or physical or otherwise—do not vote against the preciousness of life by ending it! Trust in God. Hold on in His love. Know that one day the dawn will break brightly and all shadows of mortality will flee. Though we may feel we are “like a broken vessel,” as the Psalmist says,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> we must remember, that vessel is in the hands of the divine potter. Broken minds can be healed just the way broken bones and broken hearts are healed. While God is at work making those repairs, the rest of us can help by being merciful, nonjudgmental, and kind.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/like-a-broken-vessel.p18" pid="E-qCqcdk-kqlGfb8SGqgsA" hash="Fw3trQ">I testify of the holy Resurrection, that unspeakable cornerstone gift in the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ! With the Apostle Paul, I testify that that which was sown in corruption will one day be raised in incorruption and that which was sown in weakness will ultimately be raised in power.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> I bear witness of that day when loved ones whom we knew to have disabilities in mortality will stand before us glorified and grand, breathtakingly perfect in body and mind. What a thrilling moment that will be! I do not know whether we will be happier for ourselves that we have witnessed such a miracle or happier for them that they are fully perfect and finally “free at last.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Until that hour when Christ’s consummate gift is evident to us all, may we live by faith, hold fast to hope, and show “compassion one of another,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

			<span class="pageBreak" page-number="6"></span>President Monson, we love you. You have given your heart and your health to every calling the Lord has ever given you, especially the sacred office you now hold. This entire Church thanks you for your steadfast service and for your unfailing devotion to duty.</p>

Such moments will require both courage and courtesy on your part.</p>

As we drew near, he looked up and saw our missionary name tags. With a terrible look in his eye, he jumped up and raised his hand to hit me. I ducked just in time, only to have him spit his food all over me and start swearing the most horrible things at us. We walked away saying nothing. I tried to wipe the food off of my face, only to feel a clump of mashed potato hit me in the back of the head. Sometimes it is hard being a missionary because right then I wanted to go back, grab that little man, and say, ‘EXCUSE ME!’ But I didn’t.”</p>

You may wonder if it is worth it to take a courageous moral stand in high school or to go on a mission only to have your most cherished beliefs reviled or to strive against much in society that sometimes ridicules a life of religious devotion. Yes, it is worth it, because the alternative is to have our “houses” left unto us “desolate”—desolate individuals, desolate families, desolate neighborhoods, and desolate nations.</p>

In addition to teaching, encouraging, and cheering people on (that is the pleasant part of discipleship), from time to time these same messengers are called upon to worry, to warn, and sometimes just to weep (that is the painful part of discipleship). They know full well that the road leading to the promised land “flowing with milk and honey”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> of necessity runs by way of Mount Sinai, flowing with “thou shalts” and “thou shalt nots.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span>

Sometimes—and this seems the greatest irony of all—these folks invoke the name of Jesus as one who was this kind of “comfortable” God. Really? He who said not only should we not break commandments, but we should not even <span class="emphasis">think</span> about breaking them. And if we do think about breaking them, we have already broken them in our heart. Does that sound like “comfortable” doctrine, easy on the ear and popular down at the village love-in?</p>

So if love is to be our watchword, as it <span class="emphasis">must</span> be, then by the word of Him who is love personified, we must forsake transgression and any hint of advocacy for it in others. Jesus clearly understood what many in our modern culture seem to forget: that there is a crucial difference between the commandment to forgive sin (which He had an infinite capacity to do) and the warning against condoning it (which He never ever did even once).</p>

Pure Christlike love flowing from true righteousness can change the world. I testify that the true and living gospel of Jesus Christ is on the earth and you are members of His true and living Church, trying to share it. I bear witness of that gospel and that Church, with a particular witness of restored priesthood keys which unlock the power and efficacy of saving ordinances. I am more certain that those keys have been restored and that those ordinances are once again available through The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints than I am certain I stand before you at this pulpit and <span class="pageBreak" page-number="9"></span>you sit before me in this conference.</p>

A long history of inspired voices, including those you will hear in this conference and the voice you just heard in the person of President Thomas S. Monson, point you toward the path of Christian discipleship. It is a strait path, and it is a narrow path without a great deal of latitude at some points, but it can be thrillingly and successfully traveled, “with … steadfastness in Christ, … a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> In courageously pursuing such a course, you will forge unshakable faith, you will find safety against ill winds that blow, even shafts in the whirlwind, and you will feel the rock-like strength of our Redeemer, upon whom if you build your unflagging discipleship, you <span class="emphasis">cannot</span> fall.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Near the top of their laborious climb, they discovered that a protruding ledge denied them their final few feet of ascent. They could not get over it, but neither could they now retreat from it. They were stranded. After careful maneuvering, John found enough footing to boost his younger brother to safety on top of the ledge. But there was no way to lift himself. The more he strained to find finger or foot leverage, the more his muscles began to cramp. Panic started to sweep over him, and he began to fear for his life.</p>

But as I slapped my hands down on the surface, I felt nothing but loose sand on flat stone. I can still remember the gritty sensation of hanging there with nothing to hold on to—no lip, no ridge, nothing to grab or grasp. I felt my fingers begin to recede slowly over the sandy surface.

Is this the grand finale of the human experience? Are we all just hanging in a cold canyon somewhere in an indifferent universe, each of us searching for a toehold, each of us seeking for something to grip—with nothing but the feeling of sand sliding under our fingers, nothing to save us, nothing to hold on to, much less anything to hold on to us?

It was part of His divine plan, which provided for a Savior, the very Son of God Himself—another “Adam,” the Apostle Paul would call Him<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span>—who would come in the meridian of time to atone for the first Adam’s transgression. That Atonement would achieve complete victory over physical death, unconditionally granting resurrection to every person who has been born or ever will be born into this world. Mercifully it would also provide forgiveness for the personal sins of all, from Adam to the end of the world, conditioned upon repentance and obedience to divine commandments.</p>

Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, suffered, died, and rose from death in order that He could, like lightning in a summer storm, grasp us as we fall, hold us with His might, and through our obedience to His commandments, lift us to eternal life.</p>

This Easter I thank Him and the Father, who gave Him to us, that we can sing before a sweat-stained garden, a nail-driven cross, and a gloriously empty tomb:</p>

They convey help and hope for safe movement from where we are to where we need to be—but cannot get without assistance. These words also connote burden, struggle, and fatigue—words most appropriate in describing the mission of Him who, at unspeakable cost, lifts us up when we have fallen, carries us forward when strength is gone, delivers us safely home when safety seems far beyond our reach. “My Father sent me,” He said, “that I might be lifted up upon the cross; … that as I have been lifted up … even so should men be lifted up … to … me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p8" pid="04dtC_L93Ui7MdD7Xwc1OQ" hash="U7C6EQ">But can you hear in this language another arena of human endeavor in which we use words like <span class="emphasis">bear</span> and <span class="emphasis">borne,</span> <span class="emphasis">carry</span> and <span class="emphasis">lift,</span> <span class="emphasis">labor</span> and <span class="emphasis">deliver</span>? As Jesus said to John while in the very act of Atonement, so He says to us all, “Behold thy mother!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p9" pid="eIvRxRey8U2AZppvrnGLWw" hash="H4gwIQ">Today I declare from this pulpit what has been said here before: that no love in mortality comes closer to approximating the pure love of Jesus Christ than the selfless love a devoted mother has for her child. When Isaiah, speaking messianically, wanted to convey Jehovah’s love, he invoked the image of a mother’s devotion. “Can a woman forget her sucking child?” he asks. How absurd, he implies, though not as absurd as thinking Christ will ever forget us.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p10" pid="7dVq9YGhlkavM0kXRpdl3A" hash="y-yiFg">This kind of resolute love “suffereth long, and is kind, … seeketh not her own, … but … beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Most encouraging of all, such fidelity “never faileth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> “For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed,” Jehovah said, “but my kindness shall not depart from thee.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> So too say our mothers.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p11" pid="kI2yH-ulCUebMyRAfzmdoA" hash="K8WcAg">You see, it is not only that they bear us, but they continue bearing <span class="emphasis">with us.</span> It is not only the prenatal carrying but the lifelong carrying that makes mothering such a staggering feat. Of course, there are heartbreaking exceptions, but most mothers know intuitively, instinctively that this is a sacred trust of the highest order. The weight of that realization, especially on young maternal shoulders, can be very daunting.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p12" pid="_VuXT5hz9Eajel6G37wKTg" hash="nestOg">A wonderful young mother recently wrote to me: “How is it that a human being can love a child so deeply that you willingly give up a major portion of your freedom for it? How can mortal love be so strong that you voluntarily subject yourself to responsibility, vulnerability, anxiety, and heartache and just keep coming back for more of the same? What kind of mortal love can make you feel, once you have a child, that your life is never, ever your own again? Maternal love <span class="emphasis">has</span> to be divine. There is no other explanation for it. What mothers do is an essential element of Christ’s work. Knowing that should be enough to tell us the impact of such love will range between unbearable and transcendent, over and over again, until with the safety and salvation of the very last child on earth, we can [then] say with Jesus, ‘[Father!] I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.’<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> ”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p13" pid="Z3zS2JZL20G6KvTnsjDh_w" hash="k3qQZQ">With the elegance of that letter echoing in our minds, let me share three experiences reflecting the majestic influence of mothers, witnessed in my ministry in just the past few weeks:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p14" pid="mYwWiBq5C0uH_KbBCr-pSQ" hash="ZvlQyQ">My first account is a cautionary one, reminding us that not every maternal effort has a storybook ending, at least not immediately. That reminder stems from my conversation with a beloved friend of more than 50 years who was dying away from this Church he knew in his heart to be true. No matter how much I tried to comfort him, I could not seem to bring him peace. Finally he leveled with me. “Jeff,” he said, “however painful it is going to be for me to stand before God, I cannot bear the thought of standing before my mother. The gospel and her children meant everything to her. I know I have broken her heart, and that is breaking mine.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p15" pid="WuI6BG_CdUKx1U-sB2xmGA" hash="xplFbw">Now, I am absolutely certain that upon his passing, his mother received my friend with open, loving arms; that is what parents do. But the cautionary portion of this story is that children <span class="emphasis">can</span> break their mothers’ heart. Here too we see another comparison with the divine. I need not remind us that Jesus died of a broken heart, one weary and worn out from bearing the sins of the world. So in any moment of temptation, may we “behold [our] mother” as well as our Savior and spare them both the sorrow of our sinning.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p16" pid="mf8beGD4kkyIzwHPF6WzlQ" hash="UvywyQ">Secondly, I speak of a young man who entered the mission field worthily but by his own choice returned home early due to same-sex attraction and some trauma he experienced in that regard. He was still worthy, but his faith was at crisis level, his emotional burden grew ever heavier, and his spiritual pain was more and more profound. He was by turns hurt, confused, angry, and desolate.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p17" pid="VfbkA4kDaUGzxnBhIbYJzw" hash="6Bf6eA">His mission president, his stake president, his bishop spent countless hours searching and weeping and blessing him as they held on to him, but much of his wound was so personal that he kept at least parts of it beyond their reach. The beloved father in this story poured his entire soul into helping this child, but his very demanding employment circumstance meant that often the long, dark nights of the soul were faced by just this boy and his mother. Day and night, first for weeks, then for months that turned into years, they sought healing together. Through periods of bitterness (mostly his but sometimes hers) and unending fear (mostly hers but sometimes his), she bore—there’s that beautiful, burdensome word again—she bore to her son her testimony of God’s power, of His Church, but especially of His love for this child. In the same breath she testified of her own uncompromised, undying love for him as well. To bring together those two absolutely crucial, essential pillars of her very existence—the gospel of Jesus Christ and her family—she poured out her soul in prayer endlessly. She fasted and wept, she wept and fasted, and then she listened and listened as this son repeatedly told her of how his heart was breaking. Thus she carried him—again—only this time it was not for nine months. This time she thought that laboring through the battered landscape of his despair would take forever.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p18" pid="NkLiIyzwoEKYlvrebPWg5Q" hash="0icd-Q">But with the grace of God, her own tenacity, and the help of scores of Church leaders, friends, family members, and professionals, this importuning mother has seen her son come home to the promised land. Sadly we acknowledge that such a blessing does not, or at least has not yet, come to all parents who anguish over a wide variety of their children’s circumstances, but here there was hope. And, I must say, this son’s sexual orientation did not somehow miraculously change—no one assumed it would. But little by little, his heart changed.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p19" pid="N8Q7HYiBbkOrJKwYUdDGUQ" hash="soRCRg">He started back to church. He chose to partake of the sacrament willingly and worthily. He again obtained a temple recommend and accepted a call to serve as an early-morning seminary teacher, where he was wonderfully successful. And now, after <span class="emphasis">five years,</span> he has, at his own request and with the Church’s considerable assistance, reentered the mission field to complete his service to the Lord. I have wept over the courage, integrity, and determination of this young man and his family to work things out and to help him keep his faith. He knows he owes much to many, but he knows he owes the most to two messianic figures in his life, two who bore him and carried him, labored with him and delivered him—his Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, and his determined, redemptive, absolutely saintly mother.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p20" pid="8bkJM9W_hU6u2wjWCUePqA" hash="MP3Qsw">Lastly, this from the rededication of the Mexico City Mexico Temple just three weeks ago. It was there with President Henry B. Eyring that we saw our beloved friend Lisa Tuttle Pieper stand in that moving dedicatory service. But she stood with some difficulty because with one arm she was holding up her beloved but severely challenged daughter, Dora, while with the other she was trying to manipulate Dora’s dysfunctional right hand so this limited but eternally precious daughter of God could wave a white handkerchief and, with groans intelligible only to herself and the angels of heaven, cry out, “Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/behold-thy-mother.p21" pid="UxYtt1L4DUiaalOJ15S3kQ" hash="IZIjnw">To all of our mothers everywhere, past, present, or future, I say, “Thank you. Thank you for giving birth, for shaping souls, for forming character, and for demonstrating the pure love of Christ.” To Mother Eve, to Sarah, Rebekah, and Rachel, to Mary of Nazareth, and to a Mother in Heaven, I say, “Thank you for your crucial role in fulfilling the purposes of eternity.” To all mothers in every circumstance, including those who struggle—and all will—I say, “Be peaceful. Believe in God and yourself. You are doing better than you think you are. In fact, you are saviors on Mount Zion,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> and like the Master you follow, your love ‘never faileth.’<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> ” I can pay no higher tribute to anyone. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

For 10 hours you watch, fixed on one face at this pulpit sequentially, but for those same 10 hours, we seated behind this pulpit watch, fixed on you. You thrill us to the center of our soul, whether that be the 21,000 here in the Conference Center, or multitudes in meetinghouses and chapels, or finally millions in homes around the globe, perhaps huddled around a family computer screen. Here you are, there you are, hour after hour, in your Sunday best, being your best. You sing and you pray. You listen and you believe. You are the miracle of this Church. And we love you.&lt;/p&gt;

We want to hold fast to the spiritual impressions we have had and the inspired teachings we have heard. But it is inevitable that after heavenly moments in our lives, we, of necessity, return to earth, so to speak, where sometimes less-than-ideal circumstances again face us.&lt;/p&gt;

Surely every missionary who has ever served soon realized that life in the field wasn’t going to be quite like the rarefied atmosphere of the missionary training center. So too for all of us upon leaving a sweet session in the temple or concluding a particularly spiritual sacrament meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, first He found an argument between His disciples and their antagonists over a failed blessing administered to a young boy. Then He tried to convince the Twelve—unsuccessfully, it turns out—that He would soon be delivered up to local rulers who would kill Him. Then someone mentioned that a tax was due, which was forthrightly paid. Then He had to rebuke some of the brethren because they were arguing about who would be the greatest in His kingdom. All of this led Him at one point to say, “O faithless generation, … how long shall I suffer you?”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; He had occasion to ask that question more than once during His ministry. No wonder He longed for the prayerful solitude of mountaintops!&lt;/p&gt;

The gospel, the Church, and these wonderful semiannual gatherings are intended to give hope and inspiration. They are not intended to discourage you. Only the adversary, the enemy of us all, would try to convince us that the ideals outlined in general conference are depressing and unrealistic, that people don’t really improve, that no one really progresses. And why does Lucifer give that speech? Because he knows &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;he&lt;/span&gt; can’t improve, &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;he&lt;/span&gt; can’t progress, that worlds without end &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;he&lt;/span&gt; will never have a bright tomorrow. He is a miserable man bound by eternal limitations, and he wants you to be miserable too. Well, don’t fall for that. With the gift of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the strength of heaven to help us, we &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; improve, and the great thing about the gospel is we get credit for &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;trying,&lt;/span&gt; even if we don’t always succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

That has been a lifesaver because sometimes that is all we can offer! We take some solace in the fact that if God were to reward only the perfectly faithful, He wouldn’t have much of a distribution list.&lt;/p&gt;

If you stumble in that pursuit, so does everyone; the Savior is there to help you keep going. If you fall, summon His strength. Call out like Alma, “O Jesus, … have mercy on me.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; He will help you get back up. He will help you repent, repair, fix whatever you have to fix, and keep going. Soon enough you will have the success you seek.&lt;/p&gt;

It says again and again that we are going to be blessed for our &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;desire&lt;/span&gt; to do good, even as we actually strive to be so. And it reminds us that to qualify for those blessings, we must make certain we do not deny them to others: we are to deal justly, never unjustly, never unfairly; we are to walk humbly, never arrogantly, never pridefully; we are to judge righteously, never self-righteously, never unrighteously.&lt;/p&gt;

But the first great &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;truth&lt;/span&gt; of all eternity is that God loves &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;us&lt;/span&gt; with all of &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;His&lt;/span&gt; heart, might, mind, and strength. That love is the foundation stone of eternity, and it should be the foundation stone of our daily life. Indeed it is only with that reassurance burning in our soul that we can have the confidence to keep trying to improve, keep seeking forgiveness for our sins, and keep extending that grace to our neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

Cannon once taught: “No matter how serious the trial, how deep the distress, how great the affliction, [God] will never desert us. He never has, and He never will. He cannot do it. It is not His character [to do so]. … He will [always] stand by us. We may pass through the fiery furnace; we may pass through deep waters; but we shall not be consumed nor overwhelmed. We shall emerge from all these trials and difficulties the better and purer for them.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If we give our heart to God, if we love the Lord Jesus Christ, if we do the best we can to live the gospel, then tomorrow—and every other day—is ultimately going to be magnificent, even if we don’t always recognize it as such. Why? Because our Heavenly Father wants it to be! He wants to bless us. A rewarding, abundant, and eternal life is the very object of His merciful plan for His children! It is a plan predicated on the truth “that all things work together for good to them that love God.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; So keep loving. Keep trying. Keep trusting. Keep believing. Keep growing. Heaven is cheering you on today, tomorrow, and forever.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the promise of this conference. It is the promise of this Church. It is the promise of Him who performs those wonders, who is Himself “Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, … The Prince of Peace.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; Of Him I bear witness. Of Him I am a witness. And to Him this conference stands as a testament of His ongoing work in this great latter day. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;

A thousand pep talks have been given trying to encourage it. Certainly no Freudian travel agency anywhere could possibly arrange the number of guilt trips this subject has provoked.

We know that with our membership now spread across more than 30,000 wards and branches, located in some 188 nations and territories, it is much more challenging to visit the homes of our brothers and sisters than it was in the early days of the Church when neighbor taught neighbor in something called “block teaching.”</p>

There can also be issues of long distances to travel, the high cost and low availability of transportation, and the extended length of the local workday and workweek. Add to these some cultural taboos against uninvited home visits and the safety issues that exist in many of the world’s neighborhoods—well, we begin to see the complexity of the problem.</p>

But realizing that in many locations around the world achieving such an ideal is not possible and that we cause those brethren to feel like failures when we ask them to do what cannot realistically be done, the First Presidency wrote to the priesthood leaders of the Church in December 2001, giving this inspired, very helpful counsel: “There are some locations in the Church,” they wrote, “where … home teaching to every home each month may not be possible because of insufficient numbers of active priesthood brethren and various other local challenges.” We’ve mentioned some of them. “When such circumstances prevail,” they go on, “leaders should do their best to use the resources they have available to watch over and strengthen each member.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Built into that schedule would be the prioritization of our available time and frequency of contacts to those who need us the most—investigators the missionaries are teaching, newly baptized converts, those who are ill, the lonely, the less active, single-parent families with children still at home, and so forth.</p>

Certainly we would watch for our families at church and, as the scripture says, would “speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> In addition, we would make phone calls, send emails and text messages, even tap out a greeting through one of the many forms of social media available to us. To help address special needs, we might send a scriptural quote or a line from a general conference talk or a Mormon Message drawn from the wealth of material on LDS.org. In the language of the First Presidency, we would do the best we could in the circumstances we faced with the resources available to us.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/emissaries-to-the-church.p18" pid="ymI1lT-RkkO9iNMQxEuHCw" hash="IwKdmg">Brethren, the appeal I am making tonight is for you to lift your vision of home teaching. Please, in newer, better ways see yourselves as emissaries of the Lord to His children. That means leaving behind the tradition of a frantic, law of Moses–like, end-of-the-month calendar in which you rush to give a scripted message from the Church magazines that the family has already read. We would hope, rather, that you will establish an era of genuine, gospel-oriented concern for the members, watching over and caring for each other, addressing spiritual and temporal needs in any way that helps.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/emissaries-to-the-church.p19" pid="5v_UtRNnSkqpOfmUhZp3Ow" hash="A2GStg">Now, as for what “counts” as home teaching, every good thing you do “counts,” so report it all! Indeed, the report that matters most is how you have blessed and cared for those within your stewardship, which has virtually nothing to do with a specific calendar or a particular location. What matters is that you love your people and are fulfilling the commandment “to watch over the church always.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/emissaries-to-the-church.p20" pid="XVySmTEmJk-BrGEA1Xj-Rg" hash="jSn8Fg">On May 30 of last year, my friend Troy Russell pulled his pickup truck slowly out of his garage on his way to donate goods to the local Deseret Industries. He felt his back tire roll over a bump. Thinking some item had fallen off the truck, he got out only to find his precious nine-year-old son, Austen, lying face down on the pavement. The screams, the priesthood blessing, the paramedic crew, the hospital staff—they were, in this case, to no avail. Austen was gone.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/emissaries-to-the-church.p21" pid="tHld98HlMkO33LK7NZCZkQ" hash="0_wv4Q">Unable to sleep, unable to find peace, Troy was inconsolable. He said it was more than he could bear and that he simply could not go on. But into that agonizing breach came three redeeming forces.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/emissaries-to-the-church.p22" pid="cvu0adwJDk-ODLWclUWh4w" hash="1wLmnw">First was the love and reassuring spirit of our Father in Heaven, a presence communicated through the Holy Ghost that comforted Troy, taught him, loved him, and whispered that God knows everything about losing a beautiful and perfect Son. Second was his wife, Deedra, who held Troy in her arms and loved him and reminded him that she too had lost that son and was determined not to lose a husband also. Third in this story is John Manning, home teacher <span class="emphasis">extraordinaire.</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/emissaries-to-the-church.p23" pid="jCc6s1yxTEOm9VMePTpWeA" hash="4uyDIA">I frankly don’t know on what schedule John and his junior companion made visits to the Russell home, or what message was given when they got there, or how they reported the experience. What I do know is that last spring Brother Manning reached down and picked Troy Russell up off the tragedy of that driveway just as if he were picking up little Austen himself. Like the home teacher or watchman or brother in the gospel he was supposed to be, John simply took over the priesthood care and keeping of Troy Russell. He started by saying, “Troy, Austen wants you back on your feet—including on the basketball court—so I will be here every morning at 5:15 a.m. Be ready because I don’t want to have to come in to get you up—and I <span class="emphasis">know </span>Deedra doesn’t want me to do that either.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/emissaries-to-the-church.p24" pid="BNWmQdEluUqLU9F53coM5w" hash="pfpdYw">“I didn’t want to go,” Troy told me later, “because I had always taken Austen with me on those mornings and I knew the memories would be too painful. But John insisted, so I went. From that first day back, we talked—or rather I talked and John listened. I talked the entire drive to the church and then the entire drive home. Sometimes I talked while we parked in the driveway and watched the sun rising over Las Vegas. At first it was difficult, but over time I realized I had found my strength in the form of a very slow 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) Church ball player, with an absolutely pathetic jump shot, who loved me and listened to me until the sun finally rose again on my life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/emissaries-to-the-church.p25" pid="Bi0rVQrKGk65kVHlIrGMzw" hash="ge1mYQ">My brethren of the holy priesthood, when we speak of home teaching or watchcare or personal priesthood ministry—call it what you will—this is what we are talking about. We are asking you as home teachers to be God’s emissaries to His children, to love and care and pray for the people you are assigned, as we love and care and pray for you. May you be vigilant in tending the flock of God in ways consistent with your circumstances, I pray, in the name of the Good Shepherd of us all, whose witness I am, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <description>Using imagery from the hymn “There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today,” Elder Holland gives encouragement to those who feel they cannot sing the “melody of joy.”</description>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p5" pid="G7KGwVkxSUWaymE4A8z4nQ" hash="RNHXnA">“There is sunshine in my soul today,” Eliza Hewitt wrote, “more glorious and bright than glows in any earthly sky, for Jesus is my light.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> With radiance in every note, that marvelous old Christian hymn is virtually impossible to sing without smiling. But today I wish to lift out of context just one line from it that may help on days when we find it hard to sing <span class="emphasis">or</span> smile and “peaceful happy moments” do <span class="emphasis">not</span> seem to “roll.” If for a time you are unable to echo the joyous melodies you hear coming from others, I ask you to hold tenaciously to the line in this hymn that reassures, “Jesus listening can hear the songs [you] cannot sing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p6" pid="RiXDySzV3UOq_x93xOsm7A" hash="3LzV0g">Among the realities we face as children of God living in a fallen world is that some days are difficult, days when our faith and our fortitude are tested. These challenges may come from a lack in us, a lack in others, or just a lack in life, but whatever the reasons, we find they can rob us of songs we so much want to sing and darken the promise of “springtime in [the] soul”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> that Eliza Hewitt celebrates in one of her verses.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p7" pid="_6nqF3MdsESwiQfNmKx65A" hash="QmhQsQ">So what do we do in such times? For one thing, we embrace the Apostle Paul’s counsel and “hope for that [which] we see not … [and] with patience wait for it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> In those moments when the melody of joy falters below our power of expression, we may have to stand silent for a time and simply listen to others, drawing strength from the splendor of the music around us. Many of us who are “musically challenged” have had our confidence bolstered and our singing markedly improved by positioning ourselves next to someone with a stronger, more certain voice. Surely it follows that in singing the anthems of eternity, we should stand as close as humanly possible to the Savior and Redeemer of the world—who has absolutely perfect pitch. We then take courage from His ability to hear our silence and take hope from His melodious messianic intercession in our behalf. Truly it is “when the Lord is near” that “the dove of peace sings in my heart [and] the flow’rs of grace appear.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p8" pid="gBKL9cx2_UKri-5CYl3r-A" hash="dn5WjA">On those days when we feel a little out of tune, a little less than what we think we see or hear in others, I would ask us, especially the youth of the Church, to remember it is by divine design that not all the voices in God’s choir are the same. It takes variety—sopranos and altos, baritones and basses—to make rich music. To borrow a line quoted in the cheery correspondence of two remarkable Latter-day Saint women, “All God’s critters got a place in the choir.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> When we disparage our uniqueness or try to conform to fictitious stereotypes—stereotypes driven by an insatiable consumer culture and idealized beyond any possible realization by social media—we lose the richness of tone and timbre that God intended when He created a world of diversity.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p9" pid="xlyB-RP2SkWFITuww7lKqg" hash="T8r1zA">Now, this is not to say that everyone in this divine chorus can simply start shouting his or her own personal oratorio! Diversity is not cacophony, and choirs do require discipline—for our purpose today, Elder Hales, I would say discipleship—but once we have accepted divinely revealed lyrics and harmonious orchestration composed before the world was, then our Heavenly Father delights to have us sing in our own voice, not someone else’s. Believe in yourself, and believe in Him. Don’t demean your worth or denigrate your contribution. Above all, don’t abandon your role in the chorus. Why? Because you are unique; you are irreplaceable. The loss of even one voice diminishes every other singer in this great mortal choir of ours, including the loss of those who feel they are on the margins of society or the margins of the Church.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p10" pid="4wih7cg6CEqcKTXX8nGDog" hash="r85Qrg">But even as I encourage all of<span class="emphasis"> you</span> to have faith regarding songs that may be difficult to sing, I readily acknowledge that for different reasons <span class="emphasis">I</span> struggle with other kinds of songs that should be—but are not yet—sung.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p11" pid="lArJPUqaLUChrsx_IGNIsg" hash="1xM1bw">When I see the staggering economic inequality in the world, I feel guilty singing with Mrs. Hewitt of “blessings which [God] gives me now [and] joys ‘laid up’ above.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> That chorus cannot be fully, faithfully sung until we have honorably cared for the poor. Economic deprivation is a curse that keeps on cursing, year after year and generation after generation. It damages bodies, maims spirits, harms families, and destroys dreams. If we could do more to alleviate poverty, as Jesus repeatedly commands us to do, maybe some of the less fortunate in the world could hum a few notes of “There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today,” perhaps for the first time in their lives.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p12" pid="w-Mv5u6fiEmvuNwsEf_Wnw" hash="Mfudyg">I also find it hard to sing sunny, bouncy lyrics when so many around us suffer from mental and emotional illness or other debilitating health limitations. Unfortunately, these burdens sometimes persist despite the valiant efforts of many kinds of caregivers, including family members. I pray we will not let these children of God suffer in silence and that we will be endowed with His capacity to hear the songs they cannot now sing.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p13" pid="QATYM9UQyEOrS86LdeYnRw" hash="OrrRyw">And someday I hope a great global chorus will harmonize across all racial and ethnic lines, declaring that guns, slurs, and vitriol are <span class="emphasis">not</span> the way to deal with human conflict. The declarations of heaven cry out to us that the only way complex societal issues can ever be satisfactorily resolved is by loving God and keeping His commandments, thus opening the door to the one lasting, salvific way to love each other as neighbors. The prophet Ether taught that we should “hope for a better world.” Reading that thought a thousand years later, war- and violence-weary Moroni declared that the “more excellent way” to that world will always be the gospel of Jesus Christ.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p14" pid="bWWjnM55bEa7pw2PZqvkjw" hash="k3o7mg">How grateful we are that in the midst of these kinds of challenges, there comes, from time to time, another kind of song that we find ourselves unable to sing, but for a different reason. This is when feelings are so deep and personal, even so sacred, that they either cannot be or should not be expressed—like Cordelia’s love for her father, of which she said: “My love’s … richer than my tongue. … I cannot heave my heart into my mouth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Coming to us as something holy, these sentiments are simply unutterable—spiritually ineffable—like the prayer Jesus offered for the Nephite children. Those who were witnesses to that event recorded:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p15" pid="c7HqyxIZVUmNFpP-u1inxA" hash="ufltog">“Eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard … so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father; </p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p16" pid="vEDBqsRIUkqV64BuKQO9aw" hash="V_WVlQ">“… <span class="emphasis">No tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p17" pid="Dm-KY-McS0SKnWzLoQ_z7Q" hash="V69UBQ">These kinds of sanctified moments remain unuttered because expression, even if it were possible, might seem like desecration.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p18" pid="fDh7vqdB90SFGZVBUVdFMw" hash="zc5SyA">Brothers and sisters, we live in a mortal world with many songs we cannot or do not yet sing. But I plead with each one of us to stay permanently and faithfully in the choir, where we will be able to savor forever that most precious anthem of all—“the song of redeeming love.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Fortunately, the seats for this particular number are limitless. There is room for those who speak different languages, celebrate diverse cultures, and live in a host of locations. There is room for the single, for the married, for large families, and for the childless. There is room for those who once had questions regarding their faith and room for those who still do. There is room for those with differing sexual attractions. In short, there is a place for everyone who loves God and honors His commandments as the inviolable measuring rod for personal behavior, for if love of God is the melody of our shared song, surely our common quest to obey Him is the indispensable harmony in it. With divine imperatives of love and faith, repentance and compassion, honesty and forgiveness, there is room in this choir for all who wish to be there.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> “Come as you are,” a loving Father says to each of us, but He adds, “Don’t plan to stay as you are.” We smile and remember that God is determined to make of us more than we thought we could be.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p19" pid="ISWsO6DSTUa5WGDCsEfNYg" hash="No2v9Q">In this great oratorio that is His plan for our exaltation, may we humbly follow His baton and keep working on the songs we cannot sing, until we can offer those “carol[s] to [our] King.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Then one day, as our much-loved hymn says:</p>
			<div class="poetry">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p class="line" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p20" pid="gs8UjYexB0aCvHodUXLWdQ" hash="N4Q5dA">We’ll sing and we’ll shout with the armies of heaven,</p>
					<p class="line" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p21" pid="fnTpnUKMkUSbvIUjHOEJ3w" hash="n7rO6A">Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb! …</p>
					<p class="line" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p22" pid="4y0PExFkUkajoOSMGfug1w" hash="XVZGww">… As Jesus descends with his chariot of fire!<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung.p23" pid="cuWoVaXyPUOdIGYHXAKd3A" hash="OS9L8Q">I testify that hour will come, that God our Eternal Father will again send to earth His Only Begotten Son, this time to rule and reign as King of kings forever. I testify that this is His restored Church and is the vehicle for bringing the teachings and saving ordinances of His gospel to all humankind. When His message “has penetrated every continent [and] visited every clime,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Jesus will indeed “[show] his smiling face.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> There will be plenty of eternal sunshine for the soul that day. For this promised hour to come, I longingly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
