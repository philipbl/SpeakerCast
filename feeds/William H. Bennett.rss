      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p1" guid="7574a2a4-d74c-45f9-8157-b89263373d78" pid="xVWgCODOSkClVn9QLeGTSg" hash="IgNY2A">While serving in the army during World War II, I was required to take the Ishihara eye test, which makes use of different colors, designs, and numbers to diagnose color blindness in its various forms. Under this test, those affected by certain forms of color blindness are able to distinguish the solid colors without difficulty, but the shaded areas in between the solid colors present problems. Those who are color blind do not discern correctly; and, no matter how hard they try, they are not able to distinguish the differences in hue that are obvious to the normal eye.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p2" guid="e5f4a1ea-2a67-4bfe-944f-005136f9fea3" pid="4EwEYCfdWEWtC_5-p9nTJg" hash="it6tHA">In this Ishihara eye test I found an important message, one that has broad application in our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p3" guid="0680c9e8-7faa-44f1-8acb-794bbed30b42" pid="IE1lBP5rmE6HDhnW61QlkA" hash="k-Xt5w">Is there not similarity between the color-blind condition just described and the condition of a member of the Church who claims that he is seeking the truth, is anxious to develop a strong testimony pertaining to the truth, and yet is not willing or able to humble himself before the Lord, to exercise faith, and to live the gospel? By failing to do these things, he is letting his sins of omission close the door to the great source of all truth—our Father in heaven. As a result, his vision is faulty.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p4" guid="0ae83bae-c1bb-4dc8-87b8-e81c4be46ade" pid="L1n-O4GYJEWTzQkCPKzRAw" hash="9JVvUg">As we journey along through life we, as individuals, come in contact with many shaded areas, twilight zones, and even dark alleys, where we, unless aided by a higher power, are not able to see clearly, to interpret correctly, and to come to sound conclusions. Some of these shaded areas are found in the physical world, some in the intellectual world, and some in the realm of the spiritual. Let us remember, however, that the Lord has said that all things unto him are spiritual.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p5" guid="d8a3e55e-8ca2-41e3-8bc2-462b884c2eb6" pid="sqzyKfL9yE2zc_MCOZAksw" hash="iXl49w">“Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p6" guid="5fbde6d1-c660-4a3d-a858-67090b2a5d40" pid="FjENXoXpDki9uiGY_SdhbQ" hash="atAkRw">“Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.34-35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 29:34–35</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p7" guid="e4c8da24-7df5-4e2f-a9f5-7cd3e9f5d1da" pid="wVTne_P9rkSr-xIzAxPjKA" hash="hwVvkQ">As individuals, we have some limitations when it comes to our understanding of things as they really are. We can see so far, and then the earth and the sky come together, so to speak, and we cannot see beyond. But there is something beyond. In the physical world, all we have to do to realize this is to improve our vantage point by getting on top of a building, on a mountain, or in an airplane.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p8" guid="9cc0c7e4-fc2b-4175-9645-516da7f8f799" pid="eSLCXQRLlkiVOfsLPil5EQ" hash="-c1I1w">We need to improve our vantage points in all aspects of our living—in the intellectual and the spiritual realms as well as in the physical. As we attempt to do this, we should remember that, in every situation, there are facts and there are opinions. There are also causes of difficulties and there are symptoms that express themselves. To the extent that we are willing and able to get at the facts and at the causes and to see relationships among them clearly, we are in a good position to interpret correctly and to arrive at sound conclusions. But to the extent that we just fool around with opinions and symptoms, we may prolong our difficulties and postpone the time for arriving at lasting, satisfying solutions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p9" guid="8befb16b-6349-40a0-88d3-9c8eb5cc7fa6" pid="TwDoRbfJlU6K1O9N6sK3BQ" hash="FblwRA">It is important that we remember also that no matter how intelligent we may be, no matter how hard we work, no matter how good our teachers are or how favorable the other conditions for learning, in our allotted span of years on earth we can master only a very small fraction of the total field of knowledge; and what we do master usually is in a narrowed-down, specialized area. Consequently, we, in and of ourselves, have limitations. Our thinking is often highly selective and segmented and our judgment is often faulty. Should we not, then, be willing to heed the counsel given by Solomon:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p10" guid="ac059d37-7ee4-469c-a043-c99e9a4b1895" pid="aTGZNt4CbU-1Y0BfUYuxWw" hash="FVxn3Q">“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p11" guid="96051440-1cd4-44ca-b8b7-f902bf4f0085" pid="-HFa_ftDgEqljtzlKQrPXg" hash="Whk-PA">“In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 3:5–6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p12" guid="796d7e95-99b4-4a6b-b34a-aa9f6c6071ee" pid="-RtVspCDL0GxPQWbIqvSfQ" hash="GpIXEw">Without divine guidance, we will have difficulty in the shaded areas of life. But we need not walk alone. Our Father in heaven and his Son Jesus Christ and the prophets—both ancient and modern—have given us a well-charted course for our journey through life. We can find joy and happiness and we can arrive at our destination in safety if we will but heed the road signs and follow the directions that have been given to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p13" guid="6e3360b8-5a26-4433-ab23-4f78c6beb821" pid="ZUpdnzkzk0eFoeTcxBDmDA" hash="avx6ew">What are these road signs and directions? They are recorded in detail in holy writ and in the inspired utterings of our present-day prophets. Let me mention just a few of them. I should like to begin with a statement made by the Lord himself as recorded in John, chapter 7, verses 16 and 17:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p20" guid="9cc657e7-f2d3-4758-8d6b-b6e1f4403e98" pid="vb2rlwwTc0eHLrkB1yyZLw" hash="HBmEuQ">From the Book of Mormon, in Alma, chapter 26, verse 22, these words spoken by Ammon: “Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing—unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed. …” [<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.22" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:22</a>]</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p25" guid="9787c572-b775-4352-ac3d-91449b364c26" pid="zmXlna1NDECjjssXH5zyXA" hash="9uDZGg">“The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.” [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45-46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45–46</a>]</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p26" guid="1249616e-87b7-4f64-8f74-7b5043b944dd" pid="VCyYR3xuoU6qXrBbdxKs4A" hash="YNLPJQ">The Lord has told us in the Book of Mormon, in Moroni, the tenth chapter and the fifth verse, that by the power of the Holy Ghost we may know the truth of all things. [<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.5" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:5</a>] What a wonderful promise that is; and it can be realized by all of us who are members of the Church, because during our confirmation, following baptism, hands were laid on our heads, and one having authority gave us the gift of the Holy Ghost. If we will just live the way we should and do our part, we can experience what a great strength and blessing the Holy Ghost can be in our lives. It can broaden and extend our horizons and can turn the lights on for us so that we can see more clearly in the shaded areas of life and, in fact, in all areas of our living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p27" guid="93149fb9-8042-4d06-8a1c-9b84d37993ab" pid="RHiIRyHCOU6fEaXI9YNu1g" hash="8XH7jg">Some people seem to be more inclined to disbelieve the scriptures and the teachings of our present-day prophets than they are to believe them. I have said in my heart that if they would put forth the same effort to believe that they do to disbelieve, and would humble themselves, exercise faith, and study diligently, the Holy Ghost would help them, and they would find that they believe many of the things they now think they disbelieve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p28" guid="170a6f06-340d-44e3-b358-3429eaf2e259" pid="o3uO-93ib0y1BZWWW27jOQ" hash="px8GTQ">The Holy Ghost can give us a sure conviction that man is a child of God. Altogether too frequently, when men, unaided, try to understand the relationship of man to God, they look at things through mortal eyes only and consider only mortal conditions. But this life is not the beginning, neither is it the end. To understand man’s relationship with God, we must broaden our perspective with the help of the Holy Ghost and consider the preexistent state and also the life after death.</p>

But in order for it to be the power that it can be and should be in our lives, things must be right within us. We must be truly humble, exercise strong faith associated with good works, pray regularly and sincerely, couple prayer with fasting, study the gospel diligently, live the gospel, keep active in the Church, and give of ourselves in unselfish service to others and to building the kingdom of God here upon the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p30" guid="6148193c-3712-465e-bf59-89229f0a19de" pid="sC49s2Kdp06SkHvaz4rXDw" hash="5yMeXQ">I have felt the power of the Holy Ghost in my life—in the classroom—in military combat—in my church assignments—and in my daily living. The influence has been most pronounced when I have humbled myself before the Lord and have prepared myself by exercising faith, studying hard, living the gospel, and through fasting and prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/help-needed-in-the-shaded-areas.p31" guid="e8eb41da-966c-4bda-b0bc-31d4e0bfe088" pid="mtjbDxWJe0CgQqL3n7ATHA" hash="EpO0tA">I testify to you that God lives, that the gospel is true, that this is the true church of Jesus Christ, and that we have a true prophet of God leading us today. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

These years have brought new challenges and many choice and wonderful experiences. Today I should like to begin my message by expressing gratitude to my Father in heaven, to the leaders of the Church, and to my loved ones, for their confidence in me and for their support and sustaining hand.</p>

Along with my call, a call was issued to Sister Bennett to serve at my side as my companion and to be the supervisor of the activities of the women and children in the mission. We are deeply grateful for this call and accept it without reservations. It is our desire to direct the affairs of the mission in accordance with the instructions of the First Presidency. We ask for an interest in your faith and prayers.</p>

In these words I find an expression of hope and confidence as well as a challenge from our Savior.</p>

The words of President David O. McKay came to mind: “The purpose of the gospel is to make bad men good and good men better—to change men’s lives.”</p>

I became concerned about this. Later on, however, its alertness caused us to be suspicious to the point where we took extra precautions as we proceeded on to lower ground after coming to a fork in the trail. Therefore, when the enemy opened fire shortly thereafter, we were not caught completely by surprise. Four men were wounded in the initial burst of fire, but not a single man lost his life. We were able to evacuate the wounded and withdraw to the rear under heavy machine gun and rifle fire without losing a single man.</p>

He indicated that he knew that our lives had been miraculously saved in this patrol, and he requested permission to meet with us in our next religious discussion. He did meet with us, and he was just as sincere as we were in expressing gratitude to our Father in heaven for his protection and watchful care.</p>

When we get into combat, sooner or later some of us will be required to take the life of one or more of the enemy.

He began by telling about a man who accidentally fell into the waters of the Niagara River some distance above the falls. As he was carried downstream by the current, he called out repeatedly, “Which way to shore? Which way to shore?” There were people along the banks on both sides of the river who saw and heard this man but they were slow to act. They noticed that he could swim and was keeping himself afloat, so they concluded that he was engaged in some kind of a publicity stunt and gave him no further attention. However, when he reached the point where he was precariously close to the falls some of the people along the banks went into action and tried to get ropes to him to pull him from the water. But they had waited too long and he went over the brink of the falls and was killed. When his body was recovered and identification made, the horizons of those along the banks of the river were pushed back and their understandings improved and increased. Yes, the man could swim, but he could not swim with purpose or direction because he was blind.</p>

There are many people in the world today who are in distress, and who, in their hearts, are calling out, “Which way to shore?” All too often those of us who are around them do not even hear them, or if we do, we do not respond because we allow ourselves to become so busy doing this, that, or the other, that we are not tuned in properly, or perhaps it is because we just don’t want to get involved.</p>

They fit into the category referred to in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 123, verse 12, which reads as follows:</p>

Furthermore, this Church has received a charge from the Lord to proclaim the restored gospel message to all the world. Obedient to that charge the Church is carrying out a vigorous missionary program in many countries of the world. In addition, the members of the Church everywhere have been challenged to do missionary work with their nonmember friends and neighbors, and to do a better job of living the gospel, so that their lives are shining examples of the gospel of Jesus Christ in action. This will open the doors of the honest in heart and the teaching of the precepts can then be done most effectively.</p>

There is just too much at stake to do otherwise. We make some strong claims in our Church; we do not apologize for that. We have that responsibility. We have the truth. We are proclaiming the truth. Give it careful, prayerful consideration.</p>

Let us remember that. Many of these people are yearning for the inner peace and joy that really can come only through love of God and love of fellowmen and from keeping God’s commandments. We have been promised in Deuteronomy, in chapter 4, verse 29, that if we seek the Lord diligently we shall surely find him, and these are the words:</p>

Many of them are crying out in their hearts for assistance. Some of them haven’t yet reached the stage where they have truly repented, and they need assistance in that, too. Others are having difficulty reconciling science and religion, perhaps because they have pulled the horizons in too close, and haven’t brought into the picture all they should bring into the picture in order to see relationships clearly, to interpret correctly, and draw sound conclusions; and perhaps because they have used man’s measuring sticks instead of God’s measuring sticks.</p>

But it isn’t enough for us to just look and listen. We must listen and apply. We must act. This has been stated very effectively by the poet, Longfellow, in his poem, “Psalm of Life,” which is one of my favorites. I should like to repeat part of that at this time:</p>

We call this property of matter <span class="emphasis">inertia.</span> Inertia is evidenced in various ways: in the things we work with and through; in our personal lives and in our homes; in our relations with our fellowmen, and with our Father in heaven and his Son Jesus Christ; and in the way we do or do not honor or magnify the priesthood and the offices and callings we hold in the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/inertia.p2" pid="27ZRWBv3kkKi4yEjbjv9AQ" hash="A-84Hw">Inertia can work against us or for us depending on our starting point and our attitude. It works against us if we are at rest and are content to remain that way rather than getting into action. Procrastination, which is the practice of putting off, intentionally and habitually, those things that should be done in a timely manner, not only wastes time; but it leaves our lives empty, unfulfilled, and unhappy. Inertia works for us if we are in action and are moving forward and upward in meaningful ways toward all-important goals based on a clear understanding of who we are, where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/inertia.p3" pid="IO034TvICkuEvwT2OlmdYQ" hash="VGcsOg">As we think about these things, perhaps it would be well to remind ourselves that, no matter who we are, we pass through life but once, and whatever record we make is made forever. Time keeps marching on. We live our lives, of course, in the present—one moment at a time. But with each tick of the clock the present becomes the past, and the past cannot be changed. It is also true, however, that with each tick of the clock a part of the future becomes the present. Thus, the key to a successful and happy life is to strive diligently always to make the most of the present—to make the most of each moment as it arrives. If we can just practice the self-discipline necessary to do this, our past can become glorious to behold and our future will be assured.</p>

There are many reasons for this. But if we reduce them to a few common denominators, we can say that some of the more important ones are failure to do adequate realistic planning; lack of desire, commitment, and dedication; failure to use time effectively; and failure to correct one’s mistakes. Let us think for a moment about the 26 letters in our English alphabet. We can repeat them frontwards or backwards, but when we do, they have little meaning because they have not been put together with purpose and direction. But when they are given purposeful direction, the end product is great poetry, prose, heartwarming songs, sacred hymns, scripture, scientific writings, etc. Such results do not come without effort. Ernest Hemingway, a best-seller author, is reported to have said that he found it necessary to rewrite the opening chapters to his books 45 to 50 times before he felt they were ready for public consumption. When he put forth that kind of effort, he was able to produce what many people consider to be easy reading.</p>

We need the right kind of action, purposeful action—the things we do should add up in meaningful ways and contribute to rich, purposeful living here and bring eternal joy hereafter. The wrong kind of action can destroy.</p>

We must recognize that we are spiritual children of our Father in heaven, that we are here on earth to be tested and to prove ourselves. We must heed the counsel given in the New Testament in James, chapter one, verses 22 through 24 as follows:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/inertia.p15" pid="cKgiHJ47Z0uipH3ty4uLGA" hash="tsLDhQ">“But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/inertia.p18" pid="7sK0zjELyU-6cKfijJV0oA" hash="Ppkv9A">One of the great challenges we face in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today is that we have too many priesthood holders who are at rest. Because they are, oftentimes their wives and children are not as active in the Church as they could be and should be. I challenge all of you who are in this category to <span class="emphasis">awaken, arise,</span> and <span class="emphasis">advance,</span> so that the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ can be experienced in your personal lives and in the lives of your loved ones. Do not be content to just go through life and put in your time. Resolve that you will make the most of your life, live the gospel, keep the commandments, and set the proper example before your loved ones and before all with whom you come in contact. Do not shortchange yourselves and others by being too easy with yourselves. There is just too much at stake to take this matter lightly. Those of us who have leadership responsibilities for building the kingdom and for saving the souls of our Father’s children—which is the main objective of all that we do in the Church—should be imaginative and ingenious in seeking ways and means for getting through to the minds and the hearts of those for whom we have responsibility, and for getting them involved in meaningful ways. The key to activity is meaningful involvement. Truly we do learn to do by doing. Seamann A. Knapp, who is considered to be the father of the demonstration method of teaching, once said that a man may doubt what he hears, and possibly what he sees, but he cannot doubt what he does himself. How true that is.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/inertia.p19" pid="o_uuaWdbTUmTD5dopJoVjg" hash="HJmz4Q">In conclusion let me suggest that each of us conduct a personal interview with ourselves periodically to see how well we are doing. To make this most meaningful we need to have challenging goals for ourselves that require us to stretch ourselves in order to attain them. Let us be truly objective with ourselves as we conduct these personal interviews. Some of the best planning and supervision that any of us can take part in is the planning and supervision that we do for ourselves as we take definite steps to chart a meaningful course in life by establishing goals and methods for reaching them and then checking up on ourselves. In doing so we should let the gospel of Jesus Christ be our guide, and use the measuring sticks that the Lord himself, and his prophets—including our living prophets today—have given for our guidance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/inertia.p20" pid="sqojvCq1ZEyvYDZiDQ3KFA" hash="Yxor2w">My brothers and sisters, I pay tribute today to President Kimball as a great man and prophet of God, and I pledge my loyalty and full support to him, his counselors, the members of the Quorum of the Twelve, and all the other General Authorities. I know that God lives, and that his Son lives, and I am so grateful to be associated with the other Brethren in helping to build the kingdom here on earth. There is much important work to be done, and every one of us is needed. May we be diligent in keeping the commandments and being faithful Latter-day Saints, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Finally that time did arrive, and I came under the influence of some very dedicated leaders. They taught me what it meant to say, “On my honor I will do my best.” And I learned that the Scout motto, “Be Prepared,” meant that I should strive diligently on a continuous basis to try to so develop myself physically, mentally, socially, morally, and spiritually that I would be prepared for whatever came my way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p2" pid="7Lj7RIw29U6YfLLO7oOoMw" hash="-cS2Cg">Those were choice days, those Scouting days, and I had the opportunity to participate in many exciting activities. They were teamed up with some very choice spiritual experiences in my home and in Church, particularly in the Aaronic Priesthood, the Sunday School, and the MIA. As a result, the horizons of my understanding were pushed back and I gained a more complete understanding than I had had up to that point on the purpose and meaning of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p3" pid="fcAXG6313k2grw15XAimWw" hash="3ek0OA">I learned that this life is not the beginning, neither is it the end of our existence, for we lived before we came to this earth in a preexistent world as spiritual children of our Father in heaven. And we came to this earth to obtain mortal bodies and to prove ourselves by demonstrating that we would keep the commandments and be obedient, no matter how difficult the tests in life might be. Now with this broadening, my brothers and sisters, of the base of my understanding, I came to realize that the most important business of this life is to prepare for eternal life, which, as the Lord has said, is the greatest of all of God’s gifts to his children. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p7" pid="4U7tSAonNES974GYbBYvSg" hash="iraxBw">“And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.24" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:24</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p8" pid="7r3sZJpdLUqwGK7GcnKO3w" hash="Gb38xw">Now, the Book of Mormon contains some comments and some very significant predictions of the prophet Nephi relative to conditions that will exist in these the latter days. Let me share some of his statements with respect thereto. Nephi said: “There shall be many which shall teach … false and vain and foolish doctrines … and their works shall be in the dark.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p9" pid="4cg5bbxc502PsOfU42woNQ" hash="SgmQZg">He also said that in these latter days Satan would “rage in the hearts of … men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p12" pid="L8OOZr3bPEW3JXt4fWXJAw" hash="A0Piqw">I should like to emphasize, my brothers and sisters, that those words of Nephi apply to some members of our Church today and not just to some individuals who are not members of our Church. May I suggest that all of us do some soul-searching on that matter and make whatever corrections are necessary to get back on course.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p13" pid="JJJ-NTWxDkmoQLiVxSehMg" hash="aXRp_A">It has been said that when the time to perform arrives, the time to prepare has passed. Now, while that is true in many situations, it is not universally the case. Those of you who have taken part in athletic competition, particularly in track-and-field events, know that while an individual goes to great pains and puts in many hours of hard work trying to build a strong base from which he might be able to perform at his best, preparation actually continues during the competition and right during the performance time. So we need to keep that in mind, too. This is not just a once-over deal; it is something that can be added upon from time to time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p14" pid="x7aYul2fjkyYRNn1vr_Nvw" hash="w1sQPg">Those of you who have participated in jumping or throwing events in track and field know that a competitor is not eliminated after one attempt. He gets three tries at a certain height, or three broad jumps and so on, before his competition has ended. And those who take part in distance racing go around the track a number of times before the race is ended. May I suggest that the foregoing also applies to our opportunities to prepare for eternity, provided we do not procrastinate our repentance until the end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p15" pid="mdn56blgdUSD652DScP3bQ" hash="l9aQIQ">In life we can alter our course through repentance, get back on course, and proceed vigorously toward that great goal of eternal life. Let me emphasize that if we are to qualify for eternal life we must perform righteously in this life. We must strive diligently to make the most of our mortal lives and to be valiant in the service of the Master. Let me emphasize that the sooner we get started on making the most of our mortal life, the better it will be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p16" pid="eZRt45WQlUyzL8_f8hRzOQ" hash="6UgokA">This, of course, brings into focus the important roles and responsibilities that parents, teachers, and leaders have with respect to getting young people started out right, because it certainly is true that “just as the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined.” (Pope, “Moral Essays.”) But this also points out the responsibility that each individual has to chart a course in life that is in keeping with the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

Alma, in counseling his son Helaman, said this: “O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.35" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:35</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p20" pid="reipBCxelE--Sa0MbrTr6A" hash="XhBg8A">Preparation is not just a personal matter. Every individual, of course, has the responsibility to put his or her own life in order, but we have responsibilities to others also: teachers do, leaders do, and certainly parents do. Parents have the responsibility to put their households in order and to prepare those family members so that every member can qualify for eternal life. Family preparedness in all of its aspects, spiritual and temporal, is of the utmost importance because the family is eternal, and exaltation in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom will actually be family exaltation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-time-to-prepare.p21" pid="CeQKo-iUXEuYzrURkvJisg" hash="drWNcw">Some individuals seem to feel that there is no need for haste in the observance of gospel principles and in keeping the commandments. However, those who refuse to serve the Lord early are forsaken in their hour of trouble. In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 101, verse 7, [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:7</a>] we read the following: “They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble.”</p>

And that starting point is <span class="emphasis">now.</span> I have always appreciated the words that are contained in our Latter-day Saint song “Improve the Shining Moments.”</p>

All were not of equal intelligence; some were more obedient and faithful than others, and as a result they merited special blessings and were chosen for very special missions here on earth. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.11-12,14,16-19,22-23" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:11–12, 14, 16–19, 22–23</a>.)</p>

He was chosen to be Adam, the first man, to stand forever under the Father and the Son at the head of the human family. Others of the chosen were Seth, the most faithful of Adam’s sons after the death of the righteous Abel, and Enoch, through whose lineage the Lord promised would come Noah and the Messiah, and that his posterity should remain while the earth should stand. Another one was Noah, who was chosen to be the second father of the human race here on earth, after the flood. Another was Shem, the chosen son of Noah; and also Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/1.3" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 1:3</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.34" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:34</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.8,22,45-46" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:8, 22, 45–46</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/3.8" class="scriptureRef">Luke 3:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 29:26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.112-115" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:112–115</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.53-56" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:53–56</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 116</a>; <span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> p. 157.)</p>

The temple endowment provides information concerning the story of man on earth and the means and methods whereby joy on earth and exaltation in heaven may be obtained. The temple endowment also gives special information relative to the required conduct of man if he is to enjoy the fruits of progression and reach his possible destiny. Men and women are taught that they must keep themselves free from sin, that they must be chaste, virtuous, truthful, and unselfish. Moreover, they are taught that they must devote themselves and all that they have to the great cause of truth, to the teaching of the everlasting gospel to their fellowmen.</p>

According to the gospel, the marriage relation does not necessarily cease with death. On the contrary, it may continue beyond the grave. Such a union or sealing for time and eternity may be performed only by the special authority possessed alone by the President of the Church. He may and does delegate this authority to others so that appointed temple workers or others receiving that power from the President may perform ordinances in the temples of God.</p>

Unfortunately, some individuals have not been fully truthful when they were interviewed for their temple recommends.

It has to do with a brother who fell in love with a beautiful young lady, took her to the temple, was sealed to her for time and all eternity. And then he became careless, fell into serious transgression, and was excommunicated from the Church. A divorce followed. Later on, his former spouse applied for a cancellation of her temple sealing to him so that she could be sealed to another, and he was contacted to see if he consented to or objected to the cancellation. In reply, he wrote a longhand letter, of several pages, that began by saying:</p>

Because I want to see my former wife obtain the happiness that she’s entitled to.” For quite a few paragraphs he lauded the virtues of his former spouse. He then said, “Why did I do what I did to her and to our son? Only because I became careless, and listened to the voice of the tempter, and he took over.” He then said, “I do not feel I can ever be forgiven of what I have done to my wife and son.” He ended with the statement, “A brokenhearted man” and signed his name to it.</p>

Many people, however, give little attention to it. Perhaps they feel that it is not possible for anyone to reach perfection in this life, and so they let the immediate pressures dominate their actions. While it is true that we cannot attain perfection in a total sense in this life, it is also true that we can attain perfection in many specific areas of activity. Furthermore, if we fail to do what we can and should do in this life, we may deprive ourselves forever of the opportunity to do those things later on and thus lose great eternal blessings.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-goal-is-perfection.p5" pid="N25W6F80AUaV1dGCtlyOYw" hash="GmhvuQ">Just a few weeks ago the summer Olympics were held in Montreal, Canada. Were you watching on TV when that fourteen-year-old Rumanian girl, Nadia Comaneci, obtained a perfect score of ten in four of her performances, and one other girl did it once? Or perhaps you viewed the track-and-field competition and saw sprinters, jumpers, or weightmen in action. Or perhaps you saw the swimmers and divers perform. If you did, you saw some great performances. Competitors, assisted by coaches and trainers, had spent many hours trying to achieve perfect coordination between mind and body and to get everything working together so that each competitor might reach his or her potential. In the case of the team competition, a correlation of effort among team members was of great importance. For example, in the relay races there were four runners to a team. The intent was to exchange the baton from runner to runner without losing any forward speed. The foursome that most nearly achieved this was usually the winner.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-goal-is-perfection.p6" pid="43l6dT-Fzk-clvsd9unoPw" hash="2lyeuA">Success in athletic competition is pretty much a matter of attitude, knowledge, and skill. Inherent ability is important, but that alone is not enough. Do you remember the “Be Honest with Yourself” program sponsored by the MIA some years ago, in which inspirational recordings from outstanding athletes and others were made available for use throughout the Church? One of those records featured Robert Richards, an outstanding U.S. pole vaulter. He emphasized that the one thing that characterizes all great athletes is <span class="emphasis">desire,</span> and he told about a young lady from Holland whom he had met at the 1932 Olympic Games. As a girl she wanted to become an outstanding swimmer, but she got polio. She didn’t give up but continued her program. Improvement came slowly, but it came, and the day arrived when she was able to swim across the pool. She said that made her the happiest girl alive. Then the time came when she could swim the length of the pool, and then several lengths. She stayed with it day after day until finally she defeated the world’s greatest swimmers in her events at the 1932 Olympics.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-goal-is-perfection.p7" pid="8Qb3Kx3ToU2gXkSCOPC4Bw" hash="7TTDuA">Richards also told about Harold Connolly. He was born with a withered left arm—only one good arm. But what an arm it was! He became one of the world’s best in the sixteen-pound hammer throw.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-goal-is-perfection.p8" pid="Q-J2DHQr5EyMoQsNlQgn7w" hash="EXfjLw">Outstanding athletes think positively. They dream the impossible dreams; they reach for the unreachable stars; they say, “I can, I must, and I will”; and their achievements at times are unbelievable. This indomitable spirit also characterizes many of our handicapped people who because of war injuries, unfortunate accidents, or for other reasons have to face life against what seem to be impossible odds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-goal-is-perfection.p9" pid="xJPO62yRs0GNBYSZF6IEmQ" hash="C51oEg">An article pertaining to the courage of a young lady from Nephi, Utah, who was seriously injured in a car accident appeared in the <span class="emphasis">New Era</span> recently. (See Carol Clark, “Making Tracks While the Sun Shines,” <span class="emphasis">New Era,</span> Sept. 1975, pp. 44–47.) Read it. It will inspire you to new heights in your lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-goal-is-perfection.p10" pid="-riEbjz3r0uZrUIV7-JoNw" hash="Ha34pA">As it is in athletics, so it is in other aspects of our living. There are artists, poets, and other writers, musicians, craftsmen, and technicians in many fields of activity who strive diligently to do their best in all they do and then try to make their best better. One of the best examples of this is our great Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the organists, and the “Spoken Word” presentations of Richard L. Evans and now more recently Spencer Kinard. The Choir members and others who have participated in these outstanding presentations over the years and the millions of people who have listened to them know that the unreachable star of perfection has been reached perhaps as well as it can be here in mortality. God bless them all for their dedicated, committed service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-goal-is-perfection.p11" pid="hx-Cqg8WDk-zVyjc3p7XlQ" hash="xyP5CA">With respect to spiritual matters, we can be perfect in this life in paying tithing; being honest in our dealings with others; having personal and family prayers; abstaining from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs; holding family home evenings; and in reading the scriptures daily. We can if we really want to.</p>

If we should stumble or fall as we travel life’s highway, let us apply the counsel given to us by Cliff Cushman, a member of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team. He won the silver medal in the 400-meter hurdles and was a top candidate for the gold medal in the 1964 Olympics; but in the American trials, he hit and tripped over a hurdle and was eliminated. Messages of sympathy poured in to him, and he replied with an open letter to the youth of his hometown, Grand Forks, North Dakota. He wrote:</p>

It is important that each member know his or her duties and be dedicated and committed in carrying them out in a manner that is pleasing to the Lord. It is important that all concerned have vision of the total job to be done and his or her role with respect thereto. It is important that we marshall all the resources and get them working together in a correlated way so the Church can reach its full potential in helping the Lord bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. Our goal is perfection for all of God’s children who will listen, accept, and live the gospel.</p>
