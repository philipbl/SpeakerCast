			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p5" pid="vyP0j9zDFEqbuSEPakTU8A" hash="Hzi9EQ">Early in my training as a physician, I had the privilege of helping a young mother deliver her first child. She was calm, focused, and happy. When the baby was delivered, I handed the precious newborn to her. With tears of happiness streaming down her face, she took that brand-new baby into her arms and examined him from head to toe. She held him close and loved him as only a mother can. It was a privilege to be in that room with her.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p6" pid="cgww7gpG60Gq_EeaCLoXQw" hash="UmGsxw">Such was the beginning of life for each of us. Yet was our birth truly the beginning? The world sees birth and death as the beginning and the end. But because of God’s holy plan, we know that birth and death are actually just milestones on our journey to eternal life with our Heavenly Father.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> They are essential parts of our Father’s plan—sacred moments when mortality and heaven intersect. Today, reflecting on what I have learned from observing birth and death through my years of medical practice and Church service, I want to testify of our Father’s glorious plan.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p7" pid="J05VqE7whka5lSGda_zzwg" hash="eWjw3Q">“Before we were born, we lived with God, the Father of our spirits. All [of us] on earth are literally brothers and sisters” in His family,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> and each of us is precious to Him. We lived with Him for eons of time before our mortal birth—learning, choosing, and preparing.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p8" pid="rhoAyVcBmUWwslJiKLEL_A" hash="qvuRBA">Because Heavenly Father loves us, He wants us to have the greatest gift He can give, the gift of eternal life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> He could not simply give us this gift; we had to receive it by choosing Him and His ways. This required that we leave His presence and begin a wonderful and challenging journey of faith, growth, and becoming. The journey our Father prepared for us is called the plan of salvation or the plan of happiness.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p9" pid="KPp-l0kz2U6zYM1rivtfpg" hash="jUEPTA">In a grand premortal council, our Father told us about His plan.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> When we understood it, we were so happy that we shouted for joy, and “the morning stars sang together.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p10" pid="yMS7sRkK0UmLtPbwjyiRvg" hash="MVtEsw">That plan is built upon three grand pillars: the pillars of eternity.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p11" pid="TruvCGoL6k2tuMATxNCYHg" hash="yG9LMA">The first pillar is the Creation of the earth, the setting for our mortal journey.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p12" pid="Ebx68aBERkyMoaDpanbpYA" hash="SdtVlQ">The second pillar is the Fall of our first earthly parents, Adam and Eve. Because of the Fall, some marvelous things were given to us. We were able to be born and receive a physical body.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> I will be forever grateful to my mother for bringing my brothers and me into the world and teaching us about God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p13" pid="PNHi3cgUzUCVuiGswM2z8w" hash="KHHUrA">God also gave us moral agency—the ability and privilege of choosing and acting for ourselves.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> To help us choose well, Heavenly Father gave us commandments. Each day, as we keep His commandments, we show God that we love Him, and He blesses our lives.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p14" pid="MnzVgdaDekC0wgxXiOXfsA" hash="69ntgw">Knowing that we would not always choose well—or in other words, sin—Father gave us the third pillar: the Savior Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Through His suffering, Christ paid the price for both physical death and sin.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> He taught, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p15" pid="_tz8HTAYE0Gvh_7mUXk6gw" hash="XUmjcQ">Jesus Christ lived a perfect life, always keeping His Father’s commandments. “He walked the roads of Palestine,” teaching the truths of eternity, “healing the sick, causing the blind to see, and raising the dead.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> He “went about doing good”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> and “entreated all to follow His example.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p23" pid="wuHSuGPAvE2Gqj1V5u61hg" hash="z9BeKw">There in the Garden of Gethsemane, He began to pay the price for our sins and our sicknesses, our pains and our infirmities.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> Because He did, we will never be alone in those infirmities if we choose to walk with Him. “He was arrested and condemned on spurious charges, convicted to satisfy a mob, and sentenced to die on Calvary’s cross.” On the cross “He gave [up] His life to atone for the sins of all mankind [in] a great vicarious gift in behalf of all who would ever live upon the earth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p29" pid="wQRi9yuPcUmV1AXGALWGVA" hash="6GNqVQ">Another of the great blessings of my life has been to feel the closeness of heaven during those moments when I sit at the bedside of people as they pass away. Early one morning some years ago, I entered the hospital room of a faithful Latter-day Saint widow who had cancer. Two of her daughters were sitting with her. As I went to her bedside, I quickly discovered that she was no longer suffering, because she had just died.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan.p30" pid="VbTwud6w-0WHt0oWLpTpOw" hash="Hc5eRw">In that moment of death, the room was filled with peace. Her daughters had a sweet sadness, but their hearts were filled with faith. They knew that their mother was not gone but had returned home.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span> Even in our moments of deepest grief, in the moments when time stands still and life seems so unfair, we can find comfort in our Savior because He suffered as well.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span> It was a privilege for me to be in that room.</p>

It is a place of learning, repentance, forgiveness, and becoming<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span> where we await the Resurrection.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span></p>
