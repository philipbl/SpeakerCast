During his mortal ministry, the Savior stated, “Search the scriptures; … they are they which testify of me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.39" class="scriptureRef">John 5:39</a>.) During his appearance on the Western Hemisphere following his resurrection, Christ quoted from the scriptures and then said to the Nephites: “Ye ought to search these things. Yea, a commandment I give unto you that ye search these things diligently.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/23.1" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 23:1</a>.) In our day, the Lord enjoins his followers to “search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and … shall all be fulfilled.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:37</a>.)</p>

Some individuals falter because they fail to open the books, others because they read casually. As one would expect, there is a difference between diligent searching or “pondering over the scriptures” and casual reading. A Church history story illustrates the difference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p7" pid="5UZgc355m0uK1T-nEguVRw" hash="DyILrg">A small six-year-old boy wandered away from his handcart company during a storm and was lost. When the storm subsided, Robert and Ann Parker realized their boy was missing and began searching. For two days an organized search was unsuccessful. The decision was made that the company must move on because of the approaching winter.</p>

If he found him dead he was to wrap him in the shawl; if alive, the shawl would be a flag to signal her. Ann and her children took up their load and struggled on with the company, while Robert retraced the miles of … trail, calling, and searching and praying for his helpless little son.”</p>

A casual, infrequent exposure to the scriptures will generally not open the door to the whisperings of the Spirit or provide insights into the Savior’s life and character. We need to search the scriptures with the same vigor that Robert hunted for his son and with the consistency of the mother searching the horizon if we expect to hear his voice and know his words. President Howard W. Hunter of the Council of the Twelve in a general conference address stated the following:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p14" pid="lyhArGCaJUuk6msA5vblng" hash="NYXUkA">“Those who delve into the scriptural library … find that to understand requires more than casual reading or perusal—there must be concentrated study. … One who studies the scriptures every day accomplishes far more than one who devotes considerable time one day and then lets days go by before continuing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p15" pid="hgU6hmHtMkmRw1oA09XdVA" hash="L2cI6Q">The importance of possessing and searching the Lord’s words is illustrated in the Book of Mormon. The prophet Lehi and his family had traveled from Jerusalem to the borders of the Red Sea and then a further three days’ journey into the wilderness when the Lord reminded Lehi that he was spiritually unarmed. The family, in their haste to leave Jerusalem, had not taken the scriptures with them. They did not have the words of the Lord to earlier prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p16" pid="AXEkKsjrD0ettpspK-BSWA" hash="sVMPMA">Lehi was commanded in a dream to send his sons back to Jerusalem for a set of brass plates which contained the writings of the prophets and the genealogy of his forefathers. After considerable difficulty and time, the sons returned to the father’s tent with the plates. After giving thanks to the Lord for the safe return of the sons, the Book of Mormon states that they “searched [the plates] and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.21" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 5:21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p17" pid="ZGvh6pdkN0SQZue_dbfp7Q" hash="aQLt8A">The plates of brass coupled with their own records allowed the family to pass the words of the Lord from one generation to the next. Scriptures and prayer became the primary means by which each succeeding generation developed faith in Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p18" pid="XDFiUsenpUaKEW6TUw866A" hash="n-BCVg">There are certain blessings obtained when one searches the scriptures. As a person studies the words of the Lord and obeys them, he or she draws closer to the Savior and obtains a greater desire to live a righteous life. The power to resist temptation increases, and spiritual weaknesses are overcome. Spiritual wounds are healed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p19" pid="MLHK23tB_EK1KEKL1C00mA" hash="efnl1w">Lehi’s great visionary dream came soon after he had searched the brass plates. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.title" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8</a>.) In the dream Lehi saw a tree which produced a fruit which was exceedingly white, very sweet to the taste, and desirable above all other fruit. He saw a path leading to the tree and a rod of iron along the path. He saw mists of darkness on the path, which caused some to lose their way and wander off. Others reached the tree by holding to the rod, but then became ashamed, let go of the rod of iron, and fell away. According to the vision, the only way to reach the tree and become a permanent partaker of the fruit was to “continually [hold] fast” to the iron rod. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.30" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:30</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p20" pid="H1ZY1nG67UytM__M1g0nYg" hash="dykcjQ">What was the rod of iron? Nephi defined it as the “word of God”—the words of the living prophets and the scriptures, which point people to Christ. Nephi further stated that those who hearkened and held fast to the word of God would never perish. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.24" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 15:24</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p21" pid="HPkd_xFHjEOzqxgDPkCMcg" hash="6ryqyg">The tree in the dream is the tree of life, which represents God’s love for us as expressed in the condescension of the Father and the Son. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.title" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11</a>.) Holding fast to the iron rod builds faith in Christ and his work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p22" pid="wT6rqBf4ikWnPzTmZiwSkQ" hash="YdCDtg">The prophet Alma, living five hundred years after Lehi, was strongly impacted by Lehi’s vision of the tree of life. Alma, however, changes the imagery in an interesting way. He likens the word of God to a seed which is planted in the heart and then nourished. He states that if people will no more than desire to believe in Christ, the seed will sprout and grow, and they will feel a swelling inside as the seed enlarges the soul. The desire to believe, coupled with obedience, eventually turns to faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p23" pid="aPE2aUz3lkOegCbw5twtig" hash="c_lQ6Q">Alma states that continued nourishment will cause the seed to grow into the tree of life with fruit that is exceedingly white, sweet, and pure—“a tree springing up unto everlasting life.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.26-42" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:26–42</a>.) In Alma’s example, the tree of life grows within each person to change his or her heart and soul. Holding fast to the iron rod in Lehi’s dream is the equivalent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/coming-unto-christ-by-searching-the-scriptures.p24" pid="NrH5_vRHv0mqs5a0EEHDRg" hash="3s5lLA">Alma’s explanation of the tree growing within and changing people’s hearts gives light to an earlier set of questions that he asked Church members. The questions were: “Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>.) Changes in the heart and soul occur as a result of planting and nourishing the seed. Scripture study, prayer, obedience, and service are key elements in building faith in Christ.</p>

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

For two days, two passages of scripture have dominated my thoughts. One is Daniel, chapter 2, and the other is the fifty-fourth chapter of Isaiah, both of them related. Daniel 2 describes the vision of Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel’s interpretation of the stone cut out of the mountain in the last days, representing the kingdom established by God that will roll across the earth, crushing peacefully all nations and inviting all to come to Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/2.44-45" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 2:44–45</a>).</p>

He states that in the last days the cords of the tent would be stretched across the earth and stakes would be planted in every land (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/54.1-2" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 54:1–2</a>). We literally are seeing that fulfilled today. As I have thought about these passages, I have thought of the awesome task of supporting the Brethren in carrying the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. The responsibility of the Presiding Bishopric and all those who work with them is to aid the Brethren in their worldwide ministry. Because of those visions of Isaiah and Daniel, I plead with you, brothers and sisters, for help through your faith and prayers. I desire with all my heart to be a servant to these men and to the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>

She has stood beside me for thirty-five years. We moved nineteen times in the first twenty years of our marriage. She thought she had married an unstable man. But I pay tribute to her. I have marveled in the last eight months as she has worked by my side in the Asia North Area. Weekend after weekend we have gone to conferences, and I have watched as this little blonde-haired woman, among all these beautiful black-haired Saints, has won their hearts over and over again. There have been crowds of women around her giving her hugs as we have left. She is a mother of seven children and grandmother to fifteen. More importantly, she is my eternal companion. I’m grateful for her.</p>

A few months ago, Sister Bateman and I were touring the Japan Fukuoka Mission. The missionaries in Kumamoto introduced us to a young Japanese brother who had just joined the Church and then told us of his conversion. He was from a non-Christian background. When he met the missionaries, he was interested in the message. He liked the young men who were teaching him, but during the course of the lessons he could not understand or feel the need for a Savior. The missionaries took him through the lessons and taught him about our Heavenly Father, Christ, and the plan of salvation, but he didn’t have a witness. The missionaries wondered what they should do and decided one day to show him a film, a Church film that deals with the Atonement. It is called <span class="emphasis">The Bridge.</span> The young man saw the film and was disturbed by it, went home, and couldn’t sleep all that night, but still he didn’t have a witness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/stretching-the-cords-of-the-tent.p6" pid="ZU5eUnLppU29BG5CyiGg0g" hash="1-LLYw">The next morning he went to work. He worked in an optician’s shop making eyeglasses. During the course of the day, an elderly woman came in. He remembered her coming in a few weeks before. She had broken her glasses. She needed a new pair. When she had come in earlier, she didn’t have enough money and had gone away to save more in order to purchase the new glasses. As she came in that day, she again showed him her spectacles and showed him the money that she now had. He realized that she didn’t have enough yet. Then a thought came to him: <span class="emphasis">I have some money. I don’t need to tell her. I can make up the difference.</span> So he told her the money she had was adequate, took her glasses, made an appointment for her to return when he had finished making the spectacles, and sent her on her way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/stretching-the-cords-of-the-tent.p7" pid="ZPNvdESS0ECLr11AMJAzaw" hash="uRijQw">She returned later. He had the glasses ready for her. He handed them to her, and she put them on. <span class="emphasis">“Miemasu! Miemasu!</span> I see. I see.” Then she began to cry. At that point, a burning sensation began to grow within his bosom and swelled within him. He said, <span class="emphasis">“Wakari masu! Wakari masu!</span> I understand. I understand.” He began to cry. Out the door he ran, looking for the missionaries. When he found them, he said, “I see! My eyes have been opened! I know that Jesus is the Son of God. I know the stone was rolled away from the tomb and on that glorious Easter morning He arose from the dead. He can make up the difference in my life when I fall short.”</p>

Hunter had on Church members in his short period as prophet. From Hawaii to West Africa, I have seen members responding to his challenge for us to be more Christlike and a temple-worshipping people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p2" pid="wINslvbD8kar1GHc1AM6aA" hash="D11hEg">Today I sustain President Gordon B. Hinckley as prophet, seer, and revelator, and President of the Church. As I watched the press conference which announced the new First Presidency, the Holy Spirit bore witness to me of his prophetic calling and the preparation that had preceded it. I also felt then and feel today the same confirmation regarding President Thomas S. Monson and President James E. Faust as his counselors, and President Boyd K. Packer as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve. And today I felt the Spirit with regard to Elder Henry B. Eyring. The Lord’s way of preparing prophets is a marvelous work and a wonder.</p>

Earlier in the week, the young man was traveling home late at night with friends when the driver of another car fell asleep. The second car crossed the median and smashed head-on into the first. The accident occurred with such swiftness that few, if any, brake marks showed on the highway and both cars were demolished. The accident took three lives, including my friend’s seventeen-year-old son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p4" pid="c4nLWcMvfUC1uYWwNAiDiw" hash="wdCs_Q">In reflecting on the accident, I have thought about the lessons taught by death—particularly the death of a loved one. The first lesson is that life is short whether one dies at seventeen or at eighty. To a seventeen-year-old, eighty years seems like an eternity. But to a seventy-year-old, eighty years is not a long probationary period.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p5" pid="C7ar9sGHPUisq4filmJksw" hash="NfUgGQ">Second, death reminds us that there is a spirit in man. As we viewed the remains of our young friend, it was obvious that more than blood had left his body. The light of his spirit no longer animated his facial expression or twinkled in his eyes. He, too, had given up the ghost, but at a tender, young age.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p6" pid="rA0hZ6ClPUW0efJrwFYbnw" hash="QAwwfA">Another lesson taught by death concerns the importance of eternal families. Just as there are parents to greet a newborn on earth, the scriptures teach that caring family members greet the spirits in paradise and assist them in the adjustments to a new life (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/25.8" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 25:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/35.29" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 35:29</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/49.33" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 49:33</a>). While I was standing before the casket, the thought came that separation was not only a shock for the parents, but also for the young man as he suddenly found himself on the other side of the veil. I suspect that he would like to tell his parents once more how much he loves them. Brothers and sisters, heaven only exists if families are eternal.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p7" pid="c1f2l91zw0GDc9X9XSmOsQ" hash="qA5atA">A fourth lesson, and perhaps the most important, concerns the purpose of life. To be meaningful, life must be more than the ephemeral pleasures of youth. There must be a plan. Death, even if accidental, must be part of the plan. Developing faith in and coming to know one’s Maker is at the core of the plan. Having hope with regard to one’s eternal destiny and experiencing joy must also be part of life’s purpose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p8" pid="7UA_H-rBYE6Ubc9hbCIeGA" hash="D-nUcg">Death teaches that we do not experience a fulness of joy in mortality and that everlasting joy can be achieved only with the assistance of the Master (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.33-34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:33–34</a>). Just as the lame man at the pool of Bethesda needed someone stronger than himself to be healed (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.1-9" class="scriptureRef">John 5:1–9</a>), so we are dependent on the miracles of Christ’s atonement if our souls are to be made whole from grief, sorrow, and sin. If grieving parents and loved ones have faith in the Savior and his plan, death’s sting is softened as Jesus bears the believers’ grief and comforts them through the Holy Spirit. Through Christ, broken hearts are mended and peace replaces anxiety and sorrow. Last week I received a letter from the boy’s parents telling me the peace they have found through their faith in Christ. They know that they will see their son again and be with him in the eternities. As Isaiah stated concerning the Savior, “Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: … And with his stripes we are healed” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/53.4-5" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 53:4–5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p9" pid="-GEiT5UHOkyezClBp1pDDQ" hash="IBchKw">The prophet Alma also spoke of Christ’s healing power as he taught the Gideonites. Referring to Christ, Alma stated that he would go forth “suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people. … And he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, … that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–12</a>). Whatever the source of pain, Jesus understands and can heal the spirit as well as the body.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p10" pid="afi6rk5xNkKJOjrmgHmbKA" hash="TyDCKw">The Savior, as a member of the Godhead, knows each of us personally. Isaiah and the prophet Abinadi said that when Christ would “make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/53.10" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 53:10</a>; compare <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.10" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 15:10</a>). Abinadi explains that “his seed” are the righteous, those who follow the prophets (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.11" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 15:11</a>). In the garden and on the cross, Jesus saw each of us and not only bore our sins, but also experienced our deepest feelings so that he would know how to comfort and strengthen us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p11" pid="grGw4YxbgE6MYlpLGxq0wg" hash="E8p6pA">As part of his redeeming power, Jesus can remove the sting of death or restore the spiritual health of a struggling soul. The scriptures are filled with examples, but a young Korean sister indelibly taught me this lesson. In early 1994, while attending a stake conference in Seoul, Korea, I met Kim Young Hee, a young woman in her twenties. I noticed her beautiful countenance as she sat in a wheelchair on the stand waiting to speak. When her turn came, a brother pushed her chair to the front of the stand but off to the side of the pulpit so she could see and be seen. He gave her a microphone, and she told us her story.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p12" pid="yPlPylO9gU-R2EW01ejDzA" hash="a88ILw">As a young woman, she was healthy, had an excellent job, and was content with life. She was not a Christian. In 1987 she was in a terrible car accident that left her paralyzed from the waist down. Following her recovery in a hospital, she returned to her parents’ home wondering what life held for her. She was despondent and empty. One day a knock came at the door. Her mother answered, and two American women asked to share a message about Jesus Christ. The mother was hesitant, but the daughter heard the voices and invited them in. They were missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Kim Young Hee accepted the invitation to receive the missionary lessons. She read the Book of Mormon, prayed about its truthfulness, attended church, and received a witness of the divinity of the Restoration. She was baptized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p13" pid="8WeO7HOXMUi2328u0b6o6A" hash="bGWajA">As she bore her testimony in stake conference, she said: “I know that Heavenly Father does not look on the outward appearance, but on the heart. I also know that the true miracle is the healing within, the change of heart, the loss of pride. Although my physical body may not be healed in mortality, my spirit has felt the healing power of the Holy Ghost. And in the Resurrection, a fully restored, perfect physical body will again house my spirit and I will receive a fulness of joy.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p14" pid="KJM8BRD0XE-G9A0LDVdt-A" hash="NPPA9A">As I listened, the Spirit bore witness of the great miracles of the Atonement and the Savior’s power to mend broken hearts, to heal from within. The Savior’s parable of the ten lepers took on new meaning. Luke describes Jesus meeting ten lepers. Upon seeing the Savior, they cried, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” Jesus responded: “Go shew yourselves unto the priests.” As they went their way, they were cleansed. One returned, fell on his face at the Master’s feet, and gave thanks. Jesus said, “Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?” And then the Lord said to the one who returned, “Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/17.12-19" class="scriptureRef">Luke 17:12–19</a>). In becoming a whole person, the grateful leper was healed inside as well as on the outside. That day nine lepers were healed skin deep, but only one had the faith to be made whole. The tenth leper and Sister Hee were changed eternally by their faith in the Savior and the healing power of his atonement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/the-power-to-heal-from-within.p15" pid="Gp7qx066NkCOishbEAEx5Q" hash="1b9Sjw">The Savior’s atonement in the garden and on the cross is intimate as well as infinite. Infinite in that it spans the eternities. Intimate in that the Savior felt each person’s pains, sufferings, and sicknesses. Consequently, he knows how to carry our sorrows and relieve our burdens that we might be healed from within, made whole persons, and receive everlasting joy in his kingdom. May our faith in the Father and the Son help each of us to become whole. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In each case, priesthood and priesthood keys were restored by divine messengers who had held them in earlier times. John the Baptist brought back the Aaronic Priesthood with the keys of repentance and baptism.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Peter, James, and John restored not only the Melchizedek Priesthood but also “the keys of [the] kingdom.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Moses and Elijah returned with the “gathering” and “sealing” keys.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> The events describing the return of the priesthood are remarkable in that they conform precisely with the biblical pattern of priesthood restoration in earlier dispensations. For example, consider the restoration and transfer of priesthood powers during the Savior’s time.</p>

In order for them to receive the keys, Matthew records that Jesus took “Peter, James, and John … up into an high mountain” where He “was transfigured before them” and Moses and Elias “appeared unto them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Shortly after this event, the Savior declared that the Apostles now had the keys to direct the ministry.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> The Prophet Joseph Smith states that “the Savior, Moses, and Elias, gave the keys to Peter, James and John, on the mount, when they were transfigured before him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

Apostles and prophets designated by the Lord to hold keys in earlier dispensations returned them to earth as this dispensation began.</p>

They believed that the power to preach came through an inner calling to a priesthood of believers. They did not understand the necessity of receiving the priesthood from a person in authority by the laying on of hands.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Also, they did not understand the purpose or necessity of priesthood keys.</p>

Priesthood keys are the right to direct the use of that power. The President of the Church holds the keys necessary for governing the entire Church. His counselors in the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles also hold the keys of the kingdom and operate under the President’s direction. Stake presidents, bishops, and temple, mission, and quorum presidents are given keys to guide the Church in their jurisdictions. Their counselors do not hold keys but “receive delegated authority by calling and assignment.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

Through the power of the priesthood, people are baptized for the remission of sins, made possible by the Savior’s great act of mercy. A holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood may confer the Holy Ghost. Through the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, members are cleansed with fire, guided into truth, comforted, sanctified, and blessed in many ways as partakers of the fruits of the Atonement. The sealing authority may bind a man, a woman, and their children together forever, making possible exaltations in the world to come—again, a blessing from the Savior.</p>

One of the great inheritances of the Restoration is that a father ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood has the right to bless his wife and children when prompted and when a blessing is desired by them.</p>

The lessons learned may be of interest to you.</p>

The family home evening preceding the start of school would be the occasion. The year our oldest son, Michael, entered the third grade holds special memories for us. During the preceding summer he had participated in Little League baseball. He loved the sport. When we gathered for family home evening just before the start of school, Michael announced that he did not need a blessing. He had completed his first season in Little League, and blessings were for younger children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/priesthood-keys-and-the-power-to-bless.p10" pid="RyFN0opKHECVnSYlEUeRUw" hash="WshJ8Q">Sister Bateman and I were stunned. We encouraged him, suggesting that a blessing would help him with his schoolwork. It would be a protection to him. It would help him in his relations with his brothers, sisters, and friends. Our encouragement, along with some coaxing, failed. He was too old. Believing in the principle of agency, we were not about to force a blessing on an eight-year-old. All of the children except Michael received a blessing that year.</p>

Michael and the other children did well in school, and the family enjoyed their associations together. Then the following May arrived, and it was time for Little League baseball to begin. Following the last day of school, Michael’s coach called a team practice. Michael’s anticipation could not have been greater. His dream was about to be realized. He was to be the starting catcher. The baseball diamond was only a few blocks from our home. The boys and the coach walked to the baseball field, crossing a busy highway. Following the practice, the boys and coach started for home. Michael and a friend ran on ahead of the coach and the other boys. As the two boys approached the busy highway, Michael failed to look and darted in front of a car driven by a 16-year-old young man out for his first drive. Can you imagine the fear that must have struck the young man’s heart? He slammed on the brakes and swerved in an attempt to miss the boy. Unfortunately, the side of the front fender and bumper hit Michael and threw him down the highway.</p>

Michael, in critical condition, was in an ambulance on his way to the hospital. It was important that we hurry. Before leaving, I called a friend and asked him to meet us at the hospital and assist in giving a blessing. The 20-minute drive was the longest of our lives. We prayed fervently for the life of our son and to know the will of the Lord.</p>

The policeman recognized us and introduced the young man as the driver of the car. We knew enough of the story to put our arms around him and tell him that we knew it was not his fault. We then entered the hospital to find Michael. As we entered his room, the doctors and nurses were working feverishly, attending to his needs. My friend had arrived, and we asked if it would be possible to have two or three minutes alone with him. My priesthood brother anointed, and I sealed. As I laid my hands upon Michael’s head, a feeling of comfort and peace came over me, words flowed, and promises were made. He was then rushed to the operating room.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/priesthood-keys-and-the-power-to-bless.p14" pid="RjQyPLqWh0GBHyLAaibChg" hash="EoI2iw">For the next four weeks, Michael lay in a hospital bed with his head bandaged and his leg in traction. Each Wednesday, his Little League teammates would visit him after the game and give him a report. Each Wednesday, tears would well up in Michael’s eyes and run down his cheeks as the boys relived the game. After four weeks in traction, Michael was put in a body cast from his chest to his toes. On two or three occasions we took him to a game to watch his friends play. Another four weeks passed, and the body cast was replaced with a cast from his hip to his toes. Two days before school was to begin, the final cast was removed. As the family gathered the next night for school blessings, is there any wonder as to who wanted the first blessing? A nine-year-old boy, a little older and a lot wiser, was first in line.</p>

Today, our grandchildren are the recipients of priesthood blessings. The tradition is in the second and third generations. We believe that this practice, like the family, will prevail through the eternities.</p>

I will be eternally grateful for the answer he received and the subsequent restoration of the priesthood and its keys through John the Baptist; Peter, James, and John; and other holy messengers. May we use this great power to bless all of God’s children, beginning with our own families, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

As I thought of friends in Asia, Africa, Europe, and other parts of the world, it was apparent that the discussant did not understand the universal nature of the restored gospel or the all-encompassing applicability of its ordinances, covenants, and blessings. The worldwide significance of the Prophet Joseph Smith’s First Vision and the Book of Mormon are not measured by location, but by their message regarding man’s relationship to God, the Father’s love for His children, and the divine potential within each human being.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p2" pid="56VfzclZFk2GWXQ6v6KORQ" hash="qp6KcA">The prophetic call through all ages has been, “Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:32</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:48</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.10" class="scriptureRef">John 10:10</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.6" class="scriptureRef">John 14:6</a>), that salvation is through the Only Begotten Son of the Father (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.14,18" class="scriptureRef">John 1:14, 18</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 29:42</a>). The call is universal and applies to all of God’s children, whether African, Asian, European, or any other nationality. As the Apostle Paul declared to the Athenians, all of us “are the offspring of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/17.29" class="scriptureRef">Acts 17:29</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p3" pid="26IMNFDBREaO9tlat0P9kg" hash="nGqCtA">The Father’s plan of life, with its central focus on Christ’s Atonement, was prepared before the foundation of the world (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.22-28" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:22–28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 13:3</a>). It was given to Adam and Eve, and they were commanded to teach it to their children (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.6-12" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:6–12</a>). Over time, the posterity of Adam rejected the gospel, but it was renewed through Noah and then again through Abraham (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/6.2-4" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 6:2–4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/3.6-9" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 3:6–9</a>). The gospel was offered to the Israelites in Moses’s day. But a sterner taskmaster was required to bring them to Christ, given centuries in apostasy (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/19.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 19:5–6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.19-24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:19–24</a>). The fulness of the gospel was finally restored to Israel by the Savior Himself in the meridian of time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p4" pid="y0A-APdGOUe9MbApd5bM7Q" hash="QSDyKw">One of the most illuminating passages of scripture regarding this sequence of apostasy and restoration is found in Jesus’s parable of the wicked husbandmen (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/12.1-10" class="scriptureRef">Mark 12:1–10</a>). In the parable, Jesus reminds the people of the many prophets who have been sent through the ages to raise up righteous nations. He then states how the messengers were rejected again and again. Some were beaten and sent away empty. Others were killed. And then, prophesying about His own ministry, Jesus tells His listeners that the Father decided to send His “one son, his well beloved” (Joseph Smith Translation, Mark 12:7), saying, “They will reverence my son” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/21.37" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 21:37</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p5" pid="LTwzWsYKPU27c62UXQKKyA" hash="-ds0pQ">Jesus, however, knowing His own fate, then declared:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p6" pid="Rcl8tKo2p0ubGFBmjtTuNQ" hash="J6KAbA">“But those husbandmen said … , This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p7" pid="I6JLdIQj80GKzh1_IlbIBA" hash="zuMILg">“And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/12.7-8" class="scriptureRef">Mark 12:7–8</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p8" pid="9tIU8sAfuEKGLvzrOaAZrw" hash="qg3i5A">Following the Savior’s death and those of His Apostles, doctrines and ordinances were changed, and apostasy set in again. This time spiritual darkness lasted for hundreds of years before rays of light would once more penetrate the earth. The Apostle Peter knew of this Apostasy and prophesied following the Savior’s Ascension that the Lord would not return for His Second Coming until there was a “restitution of all things” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.19-21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:19–21</a>). The Apostle Paul also prophesied of a time when the members would “not endure sound doctrine” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.3-4" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 4:3–4</a>) and that a “falling away” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.2-3" class="scriptureRef">2 Thes. 2:2–3</a>) would precede the Second Coming of Christ. He, too, referred to the “restitution of all things,” saying that the Savior “in the dispensation of the fulness of times … might gather together in one all things in Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 1:10</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p9" pid="MmI2xetiqUqjxNDFnSDeaQ" hash="OPczBQ">The Lord directed the Restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The “restitution of all things” began in the Sacred Grove with the Father and the Son appearing to Joseph Smith. In vision, Joseph learned of God’s personal nature—that the Father and the Son are separate, exalted beings with bodies of flesh and bone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p10" pid="wc6PECsBrkayxNmMIzOtyg" hash="OT0cWQ">At the beginning of most dispensations, a book is given to the newly called prophet. Moses received tablets (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/31.18" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 31:18</a>). Lehi was given a book to read concerning the destruction of Jerusalem (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.11-14" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 1:11–14</a>). Ezekiel was given “a roll of a book” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ezek/2.9-10" class="scriptureRef">Ezek. 2:9–10</a>) containing the Lord’s message for the house of Judah in his day. John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos was shown a book with seven seals (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/5.title" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 5</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 77:6</a>). Is it any wonder, then, that the Lord would provide a book containing the fulness of the gospel as part of the “restitution of all things”? The Book of Mormon has the power to draw all men and women to Christ. Its references to the Savior’s Atonement are the clearest on record with regard to its purpose and powers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p11" pid="0t-H2zUGcUCW9pNCw9ad9Q" hash="KSbRyw">The Holy Spirit has whispered to my soul that Joseph saw the Father and the Son in the Sacred Grove and that the Book of Mormon is true. I am grateful for the additional knowledge concerning the Savior’s Atonement contained in the Book of Mormon. One of the titles given to the Savior is that of Only Begotten Son of the Father. For example, the Apostle John in his Gospel states that he beheld the majesty and glory of the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration and that His glory was that of the “only begotten of the Father” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.14" class="scriptureRef">John 1:14</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.18" class="scriptureRef">John 1:18</a>). The Book of Mormon likewise uses this title many times.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p12" pid="s_iHdECi8kS4G369LJlvUg" hash="6q0-uQ">Unlike mortals who inherit the seeds of death from both parents, Jesus was born of a mortal mother but an immortal Father. The seeds of death received from Mary meant that He could die, but the inheritance from His Father gave Him infinite life, which meant death was a voluntary act. Thus, Jesus told the Jewish people, “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.26" class="scriptureRef">John 5:26</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p15" pid="JbIZ_s9oNUuc0e9PY5J-yA" hash="vJWIdA">“No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.17-18" class="scriptureRef">John 10:17–18</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p16" pid="0VQ7wyfO2kiChnMVdRbg0A" hash="KCYTXA">The infinite nature received from His Father gave Jesus power to perform the Atonement, to suffer for the sins of all. The prophet Alma in the Book of Mormon teaches that Jesus not only took upon Himself our sins but also our pains, afflictions, and temptations. Alma also explains that Jesus took upon Himself our sicknesses, death, and our infirmities. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-13" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–13</a>.) This He did, Alma said, so that His “bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know … how to succor his people” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p17" pid="MmUlzJA5VkiWzSicaXnfug" hash="AJdu7w">The prophet Abinadi further states that “when his soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see his seed” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.10" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 15:10</a>). Abinadi then identifies the Savior’s seed as the prophets and those who follow them. For many years I thought of the Savior’s experience in the garden and on the cross as places where a large mass of sin was heaped upon Him. Through the words of Alma, Abinadi, Isaiah, and other prophets, however, my view has changed. Instead of an impersonal mass of sin, there was a long line of people, as Jesus felt “our infirmities” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/4.15" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 4:15</a>), “[bore] our griefs, … carried our sorrows … [and] was bruised for our iniquities” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/53.4-5" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 53:4–5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p18" pid="Ph-VIFrRx02A85rUxu5W9g" hash="RRR1sg">The Atonement was an intimate, personal experience in which Jesus came to know how to help each of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p19" pid="DB8ovc9XPECe0vuR_26hHQ" hash="TmIgNg">The Pearl of Great Price teaches that Moses was shown all the inhabitants of the earth, which were “numberless as the sand upon the sea shore” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.28" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:28</a>). If Moses beheld every soul, then it seems reasonable that the Creator of the universe has the power to become intimately acquainted with each of us. He learned about your weaknesses and mine. He experienced your pains and sufferings. He experienced mine. I testify that He knows us. He understands the way in which we deal with temptations. He knows our weaknesses. But more than that, more than just knowing us, He knows how to help us if we come to Him in faith. That is why a young Hispanic woman suddenly realized that she was more than a speck in the universe when the Holy Spirit gave her a witness of the Restoration. She felt God’s love, that she was His daughter, and realized that He knew her. It also explains why the plan of salvation seemed familiar to my Japanese friend as the missionaries taught him and as the Holy Spirit confirmed his purposes on earth and his potential.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/a-pattern-for-all.p20" pid="A_T-D8URt0u6C4pdAFc9DQ" hash="3dCD7g">I testify that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is a pattern for all. It is not the location of events that matters; it is the good news—the timeless doctrine and atoning powers of the Lord Jesus Christ. I bear witness that He lives, that He is the Christ. I testify that the gospel restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith is Peter’s “restitution of all things.” I bear witness that President Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord’s prophet today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
