      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p1" pid="SCDUIDsKu0qgMuBQm1fAqA" hash="kN9rJg">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="35"></span>Suppose for a moment someone told you these three facts about a New Testament personality and nothing more: first, the Savior said of this man, “O thou of little faith” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/14.31" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 14:31</a>); second, this man, in a moment of anger, cut off an ear of the high priest’s servant; and third, this man denied knowing who the Savior was on three occasions, even though he had walked with Him daily. If that is all you knew or focused upon, you might have thought this man a scoundrel or a no-good, but in the process you would have failed to come to know one of the greatest men who ever walked the earth: Peter the Apostle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p2" pid="BgyQFESJqkONk8IGAV22_w" hash="cqDOfA">Similarly, attempts have been made by some to focus upon or magnify some minor weaknesses of the Prophet Joseph Smith, but in that process they too have missed the mark, the man, and his mission. Joseph Smith was the Lord’s anointed to restore Christ’s Church to the earth. When he emerged from the grove of trees, he eventually learned four fundamental truths not then taught by the majority of the contemporary Christian world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p3" pid="x4L6tZy8HUyADIGyqDEKJQ" hash="cIWJJg">First, he learned that God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, are two separate, distinct beings. The Bible confirms Joseph Smith’s discovery. It tells us that the Son submitted His will to the Father (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.42" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 26:42</a>). We are moved by the Savior’s submission and find strength in His example to do likewise, but what would have been the depth and passion of Christ’s submission or the motivational power of that example if the Father and the Son were the same being and in reality the Son was merely following His own will under a different name?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p4" pid="vLf29li2C0WTQw5uRXWz6w" hash="nddFoA">The scriptures give further evidence of this great truth: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16</a>). A father offering up his only son is the supreme demonstration of love that the human mind and heart can conceive and feel. It is symbolized by the touching story of Abraham and Isaac (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/22" class="scriptureRef">Genesis 22</a>). But if the Father is the same being as the Son, then this sacrifice of all sacrifices is lost, and Abraham is no longer offering up Isaac—Abraham is now offering up Abraham.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p5" pid="ARXK1no4ukacQzSNn77lig" hash="HFakgg">The second great truth Joseph Smith discovered was that the Father and the Son have glorified bodies of flesh and bones. Following the Savior’s Resurrection, He appeared to His disciples and said, “Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.39" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:39</a>). Some have suggested this was a temporary physical manifestation and that when He ascended to heaven He shed His body and returned to His spirit form. But the scriptures tell us this was not possible. Paul taught, “Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Romans 6:9</a>). In other words, once Christ was resurrected, His body could never again be separated from His spirit; otherwise He would suffer death, the very consequence Paul said was no longer possible after His Resurrection.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p6" pid="Su6qQLsvKEqUfRMgu_cWhQ" hash="dIvLwQ">The third truth that Joseph Smith learned was that God still speaks to man today—that the heavens are not closed. One need but ask three questions, once proposed by President Hugh B. Brown, to arrive at that conclusion (see “The Profile of a Prophet,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> June 2006, 13; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> June 2006, 37). First, does God love us as much today as He loved the people to whom He spoke in New Testament times? Second, does God have the same power today <span class="pageBreak" page-number="36"></span>as He did then? And third, do we need Him as much today as they needed Him anciently? If the answers to those questions are yes and if God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, as the scriptures so declare (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.9" class="scriptureRef">Mormon 9:9</a>), then there is little doubt: God does speak to man today exactly as Joseph Smith testified.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p7" pid="GrSadaie3U-v_JEZ9Z-CmA" hash="vZoerg">The fourth truth that Joseph Smith learned was that the full and complete Church of Jesus Christ was not then upon the earth. Of course there were good people and some components of the truth, but the Apostle Paul had anciently prophesied that the Second Coming of Christ would not come “except there come a falling away first” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p8" pid="vClL6R1THUezVVVkt2WgZw" hash="M4He3w">Following Joseph Smith’s First Vision, the Restoration of Christ’s Church commenced “line upon line, precept upon precept” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 98:12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p9" pid="rN58c4Ith0qU86h_6LsA4A" hash="b88Tgg">Through Joseph Smith was restored the doctrine of the gospel being preached to the dead in the spirit world to those who did not have a fair chance on earth to hear it (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.5-22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 128:5–22</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.30-34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 138:30–34</a>). This was not the invention of a creative mind; it was the restoration of a biblical truth. Peter had long ago taught, “For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/4.6" class="scriptureRef">1 Peter 4:6</a>). Frederic W. Farrar, the well-known Church of England author and theologian, made the following observation about this teaching of Peter: “Every effort has been made to explain away the plain meaning of <span class="emphasis">this</span> passage. It is one of the most precious passages of Scripture, and it involves no ambiguity. … For if language have any meaning, this language means that Christ, when His Spirit descended into the lower world, proclaimed the message of salvation to the once impenitent dead” (<span class="emphasis">The Early Days of Christianity</span> [1883], 78).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p10" pid="YNt-lI4oN06gEJIZuwmy0w" hash="eJMHoA">Many teach that there is one heaven and one hell. Joseph Smith restored the truth that there are multiple heavens. Paul spoke of a man who was caught up into the third heaven (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.2" class="scriptureRef">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>). Could there be a third heaven if there was no second heaven or first heaven?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p11" pid="3Y83hao1dEuBcbie4HaD8w" hash="Hn-hmg">In many ways the gospel of Jesus Christ is like a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. When Joseph Smith came on the scene, perhaps 100 pieces were in place. Then Joseph Smith came along and put many of the other 900 pieces in place so that people could say, “Oh, now I understand where I came from, why I am here, and where I am going.” As for Joseph Smith’s role in the Restoration, the Lord defined it clearly: “This generation shall have my word through you” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/5.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 5:10</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p12" pid="poZ2sqP4sE-9ZMmlpjU2TA" hash="rGEMZQ">In spite of this flood of restored biblical truths, some honest searchers have commented: “I can accept these doctrines, but what about all those angels and visions Joseph Smith claimed to have? It seems so hard to believe in modern times.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p13" pid="vb_LiyyRaUaQwa2oxJ-23w" hash="zSKThA">To those honest searchers, we lovingly respond: “Were there not angels <span class="pageBreak" page-number="37"></span>and visions in Christ’s Church in New Testament times? Did not an angel appear to Mary and to Joseph? Did not angels appear to Peter, James, and John on the Mount of Transfiguration? Did not an angel rescue Peter and John from prison? Did not an angel appear to Cornelius, then to Paul before he was shipwrecked and to John on the Isle of Patmos? Did not Peter have a vision of the gospel going to the Gentiles, Paul a vision of the third heaven, John a vision of the latter days, and Stephen a vision of the Father and Son?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p14" pid="ezcp8CAjh0aNlhRh3U8iZg" hash="ZyJChQ">Yes, Joseph Smith did see angels and visions—because he was the instrument in God’s hands to restore the same Church of Jesus Christ as existed in primitive times—all of its powers as well as all of its doctrines.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p15" pid="bh1SAUo1fUqyXnhvGWAcPg" hash="0P403A">Yet sorrowfully, on occasion, some are willing to set aside the precious gospel truths restored by Joseph Smith because they get diverted on some historical issue or some scientific hypothesis not central to their exaltation, and in so doing they trade their spiritual birthright for a mess of pottage. They exchange the absolute certainty of the Restoration for a doubt, and in that process they fall into the trap of losing faith in the many things they <span class="emphasis">do</span> know because of a few things they do not know. There will always be some seemingly intellectual crisis looming on the horizon as long as faith is required and our minds are finite, but likewise there will always be the sure and solid doctrines of the Restoration to cling to, which will provide the rock foundation upon which our testimonies may be built.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p16" pid="XDqTLThgwUCDplhdcjAdhg" hash="zRzs-A">When many of Christ’s followers turned from Him, He asked His Apostles, “Will ye also go away?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p17" pid="hdvbE0FswkKhgsTs0dTRdw" hash="Tm58lw">Peter then responded with an answer that should be engraved on every heart: “To whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.66-68" class="scriptureRef">John 6:66–68</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p18" pid="zaD_lmZABUCrVl7n23_xsw" hash="Zf77Eg">If someone turns from these restored doctrines, where will he go to learn the true nature of God as taught in the grove of trees? Where will he go to find the doctrines of the premortal existence, baptism for the dead, and eternal marriage? And where will he go to find the sealing powers that can bind husbands and wives and children beyond the grave?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/joseph-smith-prophet-of-the-restoration.p19" pid="D6iAIGyzm0anJWK4BXFm4A" hash="MuTmOQ">Through Joseph Smith have been restored all the powers, keys, teachings, and ordinances necessary for salvation and exaltation. You cannot go anywhere else in the world and get that. It is not to be found in any other church. It is not to be found in any philosophy of man or scientific digest or individual pilgrimage, however intellectual it may seem. Salvation is to be found in one place alone, as so designated by the Lord Himself when He said that this is “the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:30</a>).</p>

I echo the strains of that stirring hymn: “Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!” (“Praise to the Man,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 27). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p1" guid="a3f9cef5-d41c-4683-bb13-e57e7083f7fe" pid="xsvizYHLPEaOWEYNM644ng" hash="1jCR1g">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="74"></span>Years ago my great-great-grandfather picked up a copy of the Book of Mormon for the first time. He opened it to the center and read a few pages. He then declared, “That book was either written by God or the devil, and I am going to find out who wrote it.” He read it through twice in the next 10 days and then declared, “The devil could not have written it—it must be from God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p2" guid="a9627bac-4a09-460b-b701-d405f4cd78a4" pid="yCJ6gcee80CRmDJpIg6RBQ" hash="2Reykw">That is the genius of the Book of Mormon—there is no middle ground. It is either the word of God as professed, or it is a total fraud. This book does not merely claim to be a moral treatise or theological commentary or collection of insightful writings. It claims to be the word of God—every sentence, every verse, every page. Joseph Smith declared that an angel of God directed him to gold plates, which contained the writings of prophets in ancient America, and that he translated those plates by divine powers. If that story is true, then the Book of Mormon is holy scripture, just as it professes to be; if not, it is a sophisticated but, nonetheless, diabolical hoax.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p3" guid="57c6677b-aea1-49e4-8db4-7b6eedf4c4fd" pid="KZzsXT-CCUSjqz2eu29GhA" hash="hpmfgQ">C. S. Lewis spoke of a similar dilemma faced by someone who must choose whether to accept or reject the Savior’s divinity—where there is likewise no middle ground: “I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept His claim to be God.’ That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. … You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. … But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p4" guid="d26d4437-4217-4995-8c33-d092ec2961d5" pid="NlWq7nr1-EeZVb0N_YYvgA" hash="Mx5pGA">Likewise, we must make a simple choice with the Book of Mormon: it is either of God or the devil. There is no other option. For a moment I invite you to take a test that will help you determine the true nature of this book. Ask yourself if the following scriptures from the Book of Mormon draw you <span class="pageBreak" page-number="75"></span>closer to God or to the devil:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p5" guid="2c06aae3-7594-443d-be10-a83069500cfc" pid="cb87pLNVdUSYB7tYpY4mtA" hash="ZmrTVA">“Feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 32:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p6" guid="9a009a15-91be-4c97-b9ce-a7de800ab654" pid="tqoDdBa4pk2FkGnRHRK0OQ" hash="UgyZLg">Or these words of a loving father to his sons: “And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 5:12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p7" guid="d7ff95d4-3229-483e-9d6a-bcc43acbf19c" pid="q9EEn5_tMUeoFMq-OSW2NA" hash="7Vwhkg">Or these words of a prophet: “Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 10:32</a>).</p>

After the Savior cast out certain devils, the Pharisees claimed that He did so “by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.” The Savior responded that such a conclusion was nonsensical: “Every kingdom,” He said, “divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every … house divided against itself shall not stand.” And then His compelling climax: <span class="emphasis">“And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?”</span> (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/12.24-26" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 12:24–26</a>; emphasis added).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p9" guid="3e496760-e941-4a57-8572-8cafdaeaa19d" pid="rnvtO0N5uEy3lOG0GFckxQ" hash="eUBupw">If the foregoing scriptures from the Book of Mormon teach us to worship and love and serve the Savior (which they do), how can they be from the devil? If so, he would be divided against himself and thus be destroying his own kingdom, the very condition the Savior said could not exist. An honest, unbiased reading of the Book of Mormon will bring someone to the same conclusion as my great-great-grandfather, namely: “The devil could not have written it—it must be from God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-a-book-from-god.p10" guid="05233fcf-99c3-4f48-a818-fbc19b83f837" pid="ZgYEZ0WaukqC1VOU8kP_dQ" hash="bxujaw">But why is the Book of Mormon so essential if we already have the Bible to teach us about Jesus Christ? Have you ever wondered why there are so many Christian churches in the world today when they obtain their doctrines from essentially the same Bible? It is because they interpret the Bible differently. If they interpreted it the same, they would be the same church. This is not a condition the Lord desires, for the Apostle Paul declared that there is “one Lord, one faith, one baptism” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.5" class="scriptureRef">Ephesians 4:5</a>). To help bring this oneness about, the Lord established a divine law of witnesses. Paul taught, “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/13.1" class="scriptureRef">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).</p>

Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.</p>

How many straight lines could you draw between these two reference points: the Bible and the Book of Mormon? Only one. Only one interpretation of Christ’s doctrines survives the testimony of these two witnesses.</p>

The Book of Mormon, however, eliminates all doubt on that subject: “And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, … or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.23" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 9:23</a>).</p>

Could He have come up out of the water unless He first went down into the water? Lest there be any discord on this subject, the Book of Mormon dispels it with this straightforward statement of doctrine as to the proper manner of baptism: “And then shall ye immerse them in the water” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.26" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 11:26</a>).</p>

But one incorrect doctrine such as this is like a domino set in motion that causes the fall of other dominoes or, in this case, the fall of correct doctrines. A belief in the cessation of revelation causes the doctrine that “God is the same yesterday, today, and forever” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.9" class="scriptureRef">Mormon 9:9</a>) to fall; it causes the doctrine taught by Amos that “surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>) to fall; and it causes the doctrine that “God is no respecter of persons” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.34" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:34</a>) and thus speaks to all men of all ages to fall. But fortunately the Book of Mormon reenthrones the biblical truth of continuous revelation:</p>

Would you like to have emblazoned on your soul an undeniable witness that the Savior descended beneath your sins and that there is no sin, no mortal plight outside the merciful reach of His Atonement—that for each of your struggles He has a remedy of superior healing power? Then read the Book of Mormon. It will teach you and testify to you that Christ’s Atonement is infinite because it circumscribes and encompasses and transcends every finite frailty known to man. That is why the prophet Mormon declared, “Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.41" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 7:41</a>).</p>

Together with the Bible, the Book of Mormon is an indispensable witness of the doctrines of Christ and His divinity. Together with the Bible, it “teach[es] all men that they should do good” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.10" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 33:10</a>). And together with the Bible, it brings us to “one Lord, one faith, one baptism.” That is why the Book of Mormon is so crucial in our lives.</p>

				<span class="pageBreak" page-number="52"></span>In 1878 my great-grandfather George F. Richards was 17 years of age. As was sometimes the case in those days, he had already been ordained an elder. One Sunday his mother was groaning in intense pain. As his father was not available, the bishop and several others were invited to give her a blessing, but no relief came. Accordingly, she turned to her son George and asked him to lay hands on her head. He wrote in his diary, “In the midst of my tears for my mother’s suffering and the task of performing an administration such as I had never yet done, I retired to another room where I wept and prayed.”</p>

He later noted, “My mother ceased her groaning and received relief from her suffering while my hands were yet on her head.” He then recorded in his diary this most insightful observation. He said he had always felt that the reason his mother did not get relief from the bishop’s blessing was not because the Lord failed to honor the bishop’s blessing but because the Lord had reserved this blessing for a boy, to teach him a lesson that the priesthood in the boy is just as powerful as the priesthood in the man when exercised in righteousness.</p>

Though I will refer to deacons quorum presidents, the principles discussed apply to all Aaronic Priesthood youth and their respective leaders, including our teachers quorum presidents and assistants to the priests quorum president.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/the-power-of-the-priesthood-in-the-boy.p8" pid="IsarW-BAtUKKd3vf5J69JQ" hash="-zM81A">While serving as a mission president, I observed that there was a dramatic increase in the spirituality and leadership skills of young men during their mission years. If we could somehow quantify these qualities over their Aaronic Priesthood and mission years, perhaps they would look something like the blue line you see on this graph. In my mind there are at least three key factors that contribute to such dramatic growth in the mission years: (1) we trust these young men as never before, (2) we have high but loving expectations of them, and (3) we train and retrain them so they can fulfill those expectations with excellence.</p>

For a moment, may I address how these principles might apply to a deacons quorum president.</p>

We can entrust our deacons quorum presidents with great responsibility. The Lord certainly does—as demonstrated by His willingness to give them keys, meaning the right to preside over and direct the work in their quorum. As an evidence of this trust, we call deacons quorum presidents by revelation, not solely by seniority or any other similar factor. Every leader in this Church, including the deacons quorum president, has the right to know, and should know, that he has been called by revelation. This assurance helps him know that God both trusts him and sustains him.</p>

I learned a great lesson in the mission field: missionaries generally rise or fall to the mission president’s level of expectation, and so it is with deacons quorum presidents. If they are expected only to conduct quorum meetings and attend bishopric youth committee meetings, then that is all they will do. But you leaders can give them a greater vision—the Lord’s vision. And why is vision so critical? <span class="pageBreak" page-number="53"></span>Because with increased vision comes increased motivation.</p>

Hence, these deacons quorum presidents need to know they have the right to receive revelation to recommend their counselors, the right to receive revelation concerning rescue of the lost, and the right to receive revelation to train the quorum members in their duties.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/the-power-of-the-priesthood-in-the-boy.p15" pid="ydJFhuNbPEWZ1Xarv2hRsg" hash="KD3Hqg">A wise leader will teach the deacons quorum president those principles that will be helpful in obtaining revelation. He may teach him the unequivocal promise of the Lord: “If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.61" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:61</a>). The Lord is most generous in giving revelation. Did He not remind Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, “As often as thou hast inquired thou hast received instruction of my Spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:14</a>)? And so it can be with you deacons quorum presidents. The Lord loves you and wants to reveal to you His mind and will. Could you ever imagine the Lord having a problem He could not solve? I can’t. Because you are entitled to revelation, He can help you solve every concern you have as president of your quorum if you will but seek His help.</p>

President Henry B. Eyring once asked President Harold B. Lee, “How do I get revelation?” President Lee responded, “If you want to get revelation, do your homework.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> The wise leader might discuss with his deacons quorum president some of the spiritual homework he might do in preparing to recommend his counselors. He might need to ask and answer questions such as: Who would be a good example that could lift the other boys? Or who would be sensitive to the needs of those who face special challenges?</p>

We live in an action-packed, fast-paced world where bright lights and high-volume speakers are the norm. But this young man needs to know that this is the world’s way, not the Lord’s way. The Savior was born in the relative anonymity of a manger; He performed the most magnificent and incomparable act of all time in the quiet of a garden; and Joseph received his First Vision in the seclusion of a grove. God’s answers come by the still, small voice—feelings of peace or comfort, impressions to do good, enlightenment—sometimes in the form of tiny seeds of thoughts which if reverenced and nourished can grow into spiritual redwoods. Sometimes these impressions or thoughts might even cause you deacons quorum presidents to recommend as a counselor or extend an assignment to a young man who is currently less active.</p>

The Lord declared His central mission in these terms: “For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.11" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 18:11</a>). If it is a priority of the Savior to rescue the lost, if it is a priority of President Thomas S. Monson to do so, as demonstrated by his entire life, should it not be a priority of every leader, every deacons quorum president in this Church to do likewise? At the core of our leadership, as a central part of our ministry, should be the burning, driving, unrelenting resolve to go get the lost and bring them back.</p>

Several weeks ago I attended a deacons quorum class. A 12-year-old boy gave a 25-minute lesson on the Atonement. He commenced by asking his fellow deacons what they thought the Atonement was. Then he shared some meaningful scriptures and asked thoughtful questions, to which they responded. Realizing, however, there was more time than remaining lesson material, he had enough presence of mind and perhaps some forewarning from his father to ask the leaders who were present what questions they had been asked about the Atonement on their missions and their responses. He then concluded with his testimony. I listened in awe. I thought to myself, “I don’t recall ever giving a significant part of a lesson when I was an Aaronic Priesthood youth.” We can raise the bar and vision for these young men, and they will respond.</p>

You have magnified your calling best not when you give a great lesson but when you help them give a great lesson, not when you rescue the one but when you help them do so.</p>

In like manner I would say to you adult leaders, do not get released with your leadership skills still in you. Teach our youth at every opportunity; teach them how to prepare an agenda, how to conduct meetings with dignity and warmth, how to rescue the one, how to prepare and give an inspired lesson, and how to receive revelation. This will be the measure of your success—the legacy of leadership and spirituality you leave ingrained in the hearts and minds of these young men.</p>

And then when you make temple covenants and become the missionaries and future leaders of this Church, you will know how to receive revelation, how to rescue the one, and how to teach the doctrine of the kingdom with power and authority. Then you will have become the youth of the noble birthright. Of this I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, who is the Savior and Redeemer of the world, amen.</p>

The student behind him corrected it and handed it back. The teacher, Mrs. Williamson, started calling each student’s name for the score. Finally, she got to Ben. Out of embarrassment, he mumbled the answer. Mrs. Williamson, thinking he had said “9,” replied that for Ben to score 9 out of 30 was a wonderful improvement. The student behind Ben then yelled out, “Not nine! … He got none … right.” Ben said he wanted to drop through the floor.</p>

She was one of 24 children, had only a third-grade education, and could not read. She was married at age 13, was divorced, had two sons, and was raising them in the ghettos of Detroit. Nonetheless, she was fiercely self-reliant and had a firm belief that God would help her and her sons if they did their part.</p>

It dawned on her that successful people for whom she cleaned homes had libraries—they read. After work she went home and turned off the television that Ben and his brother were watching. She said in essence: You boys are watching too much television. From now on you can watch three programs a week. In your free time you will go to the library—read two books a week and give me a report.</p>

Ben said he had never read a book in his entire life except when required to do so at school. They protested, they complained, they argued, but it was to no avail. Then Ben reflected, “She laid down the law. I didn’t like the rule, but her determination to see us improve changed the course of my life.”</p>

By the seventh grade he was at the top of his class. He went on to attend Yale University on a scholarship, then Johns Hopkins medical school, where at age 33 he became its chief of pediatric neurosurgery and a world-renowned surgeon. How was that possible? Largely because of a mother who, without many of the advantages of life, magnified her calling as a parent.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

As their prime gospel teachers, we can teach them the power and reality of the Atonement—of their identity and divine destiny—and in so doing give them a rock foundation upon which to build. When all is said and done, the home is the ideal forum for teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

While there, I learned about a 12-year-old girl, Sarah. Her parents and two older siblings had converted to the Church in Romania but were then required to return to their homeland when Sarah was just 7 years of age. In their homeland there was no Church presence, no organized units, no Sunday School or Young Women program. After five years this family learned of a branch in Beirut and, just before I arrived, sent their 12-year-old daughter, Sarah, accompanied by older siblings, to be baptized. While there, I gave a devotional on the plan of salvation. With some frequency Sarah raised her hand and answered the questions.</p>

Her mother was her prime gospel teacher.</p>

There is no question who Enos’s prime gospel teacher was.</p>

I remember the cards he would keep in his shirt pocket with quotes of the scriptures and Shakespeare and new words that he would memorize and learn. I remember the gospel questions and discussions at the dinner table. I remember the many times my father took me to visit the elderly—how we would stop by to pick up ice cream for one or a chicken dinner for another or his final handshake with some money enclosed. I remember the good feeling and the desire to be like him.</p>

I asked her where she was going. She replied, “Oh, I am taking some food to the elderly.” I thought to myself, “Mother, you are the elderly.” I can never express enough gratitude for my parents, who were my prime gospel teachers.</p>

When I was about 17 years of age, I was kneeling by my bed, saying my evening prayers. Unbeknown to me, my mother was standing in the doorway. When I finished, she said, “Tad, are you asking the Lord to help you find a good wife?”</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/parents-the-prime-gospel-teachers-of-their-children.p18" pid="P7mlPzuFfUqTlxjYNC5uFg" hash="NK7nKg">Her question caught me totally off guard. That was the furthest thing from my mind. I was thinking about basketball and school. And so, I replied, “No,” to which she responded, “Well, you should, Son; it will be the most important decision you will ever make.” Those words sunk deep into my heart, and so for the next six years, I prayed that God would help me find a good wife. And, oh, how He answered that prayer.</p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/parents-the-prime-gospel-teachers-of-their-children.p20" pid="4niXT_3qKES25uJybQu8Yg" hash="YvJhig">No doubt most of our youth have their evening prayers, but perhaps many of them struggle with the habit of personal morning prayer. As parents, as their prime gospel teachers, we can correct this. Which parent in Book of Mormon times would have let their sons march out to the front of battle without a breastplate and shield and sword to protect them against the potentially mortal blows of the enemy? But how many of us let our children march out the front door each morning to the most dangerous of all battlefields, to face Satan and his myriad of temptations, without their spiritual breastplate and shield and sword that come from the protective power of prayer? The Lord said, “Pray always, … that you may conquer Satan” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 10:5</a>). As parents, we can help instill within our children the habit and power of morning prayer.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/parents-the-prime-gospel-teachers-of-their-children.p21" pid="AGuKr6LUaEqBN-uvU1e1kg" hash="EYeVlw">We can also teach our children to use their time wisely. On occasion, like Sonya Carson, we will need to put our foot lovingly but firmly down to restrict our children’s time with television and other electronic devices that in many cases are monopolizing their lives. Instead we may need to redirect their time into more productive gospel-oriented efforts. There may be some initial resistance, some complaining, but like Sonya Carson, we need to have the vision and the will to stick with it. One day our children will understand and appreciate what we have done. If we do not do this, who will?</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/parents-the-prime-gospel-teachers-of-their-children.p22" pid="9Bj0yvSLTk2bOfvttvpL0g" hash="ZjkW6A">We might all ask ourselves: do our children receive our best spiritual, intellectual, and creative efforts, or do they receive our leftover time and talents, after we have given our all to our Church calling or professional pursuits? In the life to come, I do not know if titles such as bishop or Relief Society president will survive, but I do know that the titles of husband and wife, father and mother, will continue and be revered, worlds without end. That is one reason it is so important to honor our responsibilities as parents here on earth so we can prepare for those even greater, but similar, responsibilities in the life to come.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/parents-the-prime-gospel-teachers-of-their-children.p23" pid="tEBRiY2Uh0-PT0SAE53hfg" hash="JHR-_Q">As parents, we can proceed with the assurance God will never leave us alone. God never gives us a responsibility without offering divine aid—of that I can testify. May we in our divine role as parents, and in partnership with God, become the prime gospel teachers and examples for our children, I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
