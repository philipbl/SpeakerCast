As I have accepted this invitation, I have found myself discovering new and exciting things in this book even though I have read it many times before. For instance, I rediscovered 2 Nephi 4:15 [<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.15" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:15</a>], which reads, “For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p2" pid="TGXkrzBlYUGyh03iZeVI2Q" hash="0DBKrA">This scripture teaches us how to read the Book of Mormon. It mentions three important ideas.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p3" pid="VW27ofaNc0yDx0G-ZPe7qA" hash="nKvuvw">First, “My soul delighteth.” I love this phrase! I have thought about hungering and thirsting after knowledge as I read the scriptures, but delighting in them is something else. I find that what I take away from the scriptures is determined by what I bring. Each time I read them, I am, in a sense, bringing a new person with new eyes to the experience. Where I am in my life, the experiences I am having, and my attitude all affect how much I will gain. I love the scriptures. I treasure the truths I find as I read them. Joy fills my heart as I receive encouragement, direction, comfort, strength, and answers to my needs. Life looks brighter, and the way opens before me. I am reassured of my Heavenly Father’s love and concern for me every time I read. Surely this is a delight to me. As one little boy in a Sunbeam class put it, “I feel happy about the scriptures!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p4" pid="qZBSbh1OQEGM3ekRtI7Mxg" hash="zSpD0g">Second, “My heart pondereth them.” How I love to carry the scriptures with me in my heart! The spirit of what I have read rests there to bring me peace and comfort. The knowledge I have gained gives me guidance and direction. I have the confidence born out of obedience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p5" pid="u6sc3ZdUn0i9akS6kWjw6A" hash="Vb8ffw">Sometimes I have the luxury of immersing myself in the scriptures. Sometimes I read them in snatches. However, it doesn’t seem to matter where or when I read the scriptures; I can still carry them in my heart. I have found that by reading them in the morning I am able to carry the influence of the Spirit with me throughout the day. When I read them midday, it is usually because a need has taken me there where I am able to find answers and directions that influence my decisions and actions. When I read them at night, the sweet, comforting messages from the Lord linger in my subconscious mind as I rest. Many times I awaken at night with ideas or thoughts that originate from the words I read just before drifting off to sleep. My mind may go many places during the day, but my heart securely embraces the words of the Lord found in the scriptures and “pondereth them.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p6" pid="WNN6SQ72T0S9I_XYwIgsSw" hash="Jp9XFw">Through this I have learned that “as [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/23.7" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 23:7</a>). As I ponder the scriptures, something happens to me. I have a stronger desire to live close to my Heavenly Father. I long to serve Him. I want to live the principles that I learn in the scriptures, and as I do, my heart “writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-scriptures.p7" pid="176A-Cdxj0iE33Y7eHpupQ" hash="5IzsfQ">I, of course, do not write scriptures as did Nephi, but when I read the scriptures and live the principles learned, those scriptures become written in my life. They govern my actions and are written there for my children to see and follow. I can build a legacy, a tradition of righteous living, based on the principles I learn in the scriptures.</p>

As I know what to do, I can work to bring my actions—my “traditions”—into line with what I know. Then my example will not lead my children astray but rather will lead them to the scriptures and to the truth that is found there.</p>

I can see where I am in my life and where my Heavenly Father wants me to be. I can understand principles of truth, and I can see how to make the needed changes in my life. I can feel assured that the Lord will help and strengthen me to accomplish the task. Thus the scriptures become written in my life.</p>

How blessed is the child whose parents base their lives on the teachings in the scriptures! There is absolutely nothing more important we can do for our families than to strengthen them in the scriptures. Parents, call your families together to read the scriptures, and work to make it possible in your busy family schedules. Children, respond quickly and happily when you are called to scripture study.</p>

      <title>Righteous Traditions</title>

      <description>Are the traditions that we are creating in our families going to make it easier for our children to follow the living prophets?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div type="article" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions" schema-version="1" doc-id="general-conference_PD00009475_000_006" doc-version="2" hash="uNjtIA">

    <p class="kicker" pid="Fz0JFv9LH0uNNXBu45zmiA" hash="FVOYAQ">Are the traditions that we are creating in our families going to make it easier for our children to follow the living prophets?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bodyBlock">
    <div class="topic" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.t1">
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p1" pid="EkOTHZfE6EaP5B6-JwOJTQ" hash="TiePKQ">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="13"></span>For as long as I can remember, my father wore a beautiful red ruby ring on his left hand. It was passed on to my only brother. I suppose it will become a tradition in our family—a legacy passed from generation to generation. It will be a good tradition, with sweet memories associated with it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p2" pid="GqhlUof180WWzlWYkes-Rg" hash="hbDMjQ">Each of us has traditions in our families. Some of them are material. Some of them have deep meaning. The most important traditions are connected with the way we live our lives and will last beyond us as our children’s lives are influenced and shaped. In the Book of Mormon, we read of the Lamanites who were deeply affected by the traditions of their fathers. King Benjamin said they were a people who knew nothing about the principles of the gospel “or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the traditions of their fathers, which are not correct” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1.5" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 1:5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p3" pid="_YCpwTAKFk6l3AY6ufUYwA" hash="23ZzyQ">What kinds of traditions do we have? Some of them may have come from our fathers, and now we are passing them along to our own children. Are they what we want them to be? Are they based on actions of righteousness and faith? Are they mostly material in nature, or are they eternal? Are we consciously creating righteous traditions, or is life just happening to us? Are our traditions being created in response to the loud voices of the world, or are they influenced by the still, small voice of the Spirit? Are the traditions that we are creating in our families going to make it easier for our children to follow the living prophets, or will they make it difficult for them?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p4" pid="Mdxjlra9REOu80tIra5QrA" hash="LjVNsw">How should we determine what our traditions will be? The scriptures give us a great pattern. In <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.15" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:15</a> it states, “Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p5" pid="vjtRvDuGCkGKhLwb8k0L1A" hash="rjNsaw">I love this because we know that traditions are formed over time as we repeat the same actions over and over again. As we are steady and unchanging in doing that which is good, our traditions become firmly rooted in righteousness. But I have a question. How do we determine what is good or, more importantly, what is good enough? Another scripture that gives us a little more information is found in <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.14" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 6:14</a>. It speaks of people “who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p6" pid="VuIsvM_np0qZRAIEFTxn4w" hash="qzBUfw">We learn that our conversion to the “true faith” precedes our ability to remain firm, steadfast, and immovable in keeping the commandments. This conversion is a firm belief in Jesus Christ as our Redeemer. A witness of this is found in the Book of Mormon, which is another witness of Jesus Christ. It goes hand in hand with the Bible in proclaiming the divinity and mission of Jesus Christ as well as the reality of a living Father in Heaven. Every prophet recorded in these sacred books gives his personal witness of these things, as well as teachings on how we need to live our lives in order to partake of the Atonement and find personal peace and happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p7" pid="xbAO_Fg900GiG9D88kKE5w" hash="1VkkaA">There is only one way to become personally converted. It is through a witness of the Spirit as we study these very scriptures that testify of Jesus Christ. It comes as we pray and as we fast. It comes only when we have a deep desire to know the truth. Our motivation must be to openly seek truth rather than justify our actions by finding fault with the scriptures, the teachings of the prophets, or the Church itself. Our effort must be toward hearing the interpretations of the Spirit rather than the understandings of the world. We must be willing to open our hearts and minds, accept <span class="pageBreak" page-number="14"></span>the Lord’s way, and, if need be, change our lives. Our personal conversion comes as we begin to live the way the Lord wants us to live—steadfast and immovable in keeping all of the commandments, not just those that are convenient. This then becomes a process of refinement as we strive to make each day a little better than the last. Thus our traditions become traditions of righteousness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p8" pid="vavbHclH20--yG-OQG1S3g" hash="bWek8Q">I would invite all of us to take a moment to reflect on the traditions in our lives and how they might be affecting our families. Our traditions of Sabbath day observance, family prayer, family scripture study, service and activity in the Church, as well as patterns of respect and loyalty in the home, will have a great effect on our children and on their future. If our parenting is based on the teachings of the scriptures and of the latter-day prophets, we cannot go wrong. If every time there is a challenge our hearts turn first and always to our Father in Heaven for direction, we will be in a safe place. If our children know where we stand and we always stand on the Lord’s side, we know we are where we need to be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p9" pid="soXzp5BZLkqOwsa-0I8mvA" hash="MDNTVw">Now, the important thing is that we consistently work to do these things. We will not be perfect at it, and our families will not always respond positively, but we will be building a strong foundation of righteous traditions that our children can depend on. They can hold to that foundation when things get difficult, and they can return to that foundation if they should stray for a period of time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p10" pid="-uK5TzmGqE-qpn1dHzvI1A" hash="XCSLsg">At the end of my father’s life, he passed much more on to us, his children, than a red ruby ring. His body was spent, but in reality he stood as a pillar of strength, an example of righteousness and truth. His very life held the traditions that strengthen us today, even though he is no longer with us. He was “steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p11" pid="92ctj5vWMUqZBVYnHbazeg" hash="M_1Itw">Can we do this for our children? What is the legacy we are giving them today? What will it be tomorrow? It can start with us. Will their hearts and lives be full of traditions that make it easy for them to accept and follow the Lord and the latter-day prophets? Will we as families be able to claim the blessings promised, “that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.15" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:15</a>)?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p12" pid="7FJ_ybHUhEmJVpVqsB2z-Q" hash="Q18IRA">Brothers and sisters, I know that we can! I know that God loves us and is waiting to help us come unto Him. Each of us can know that these things are true. I know that they are! I know that God lives; Jesus Christ is His Son and our Redeemer. The gospel of Jesus Christ is true; the scriptures contain it and testify of it. And we have a true and living prophet today—President Thomas S. Monson. He has been prepared and brought forth in this day to lead the Lord’s Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p13" pid="S2xJiog4VEiUNc_RZfVP9A" hash="yLQOTw">As we become “steadfast and immovable” in keeping the commandments of the Lord, we will secure the blessings of heaven for ourselves and for our families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/righteous-traditions.p14" pid="M_suszV5JkSw8B1uFr43pQ" hash="jZdfvA">I pray that we will feel this deep in our hearts and in our lives, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="81"></span>Several years ago I was teaching a group of nursery leaders how to give a short gospel lesson to very young children. One of the leaders had her young son on her lap. I held a picture of the Savior in my hand and, demonstrating how to speak to young children, began talking about Jesus. The tiny boy slid off his mother’s lap, toddled over to me, looked intently at the picture, and touched the face. At that point in the dialogue, I asked the question, “Who is this?” With a smile on his face, the child responded, “Jesus.”</p>

As I watched this sweet response, I thought of the words of the Savior when He said, “Seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may possess your souls, and ye shall have eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:38</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p3" pid="tICZBpcUwUaKfve0YEWy3A" hash="870J-Q">What does it mean to seek the face of the Savior? Surely it means more than just recognizing His picture. Christ’s invitation to seek Him is an invitation to know who He is, what He has done for us, and what He has asked us to do. Coming to Christ, and eventually seeing His face, comes only as we draw close to Him through our faith and our actions. It comes through a lifetime of effort. So how do we seek Him in this life so that we might see His face in the next?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p4" pid="5ypZ7QoV8EmAc7PSgNHklA" hash="-B4zfg">We have the account in 3 Nephi of a people who actually saw the face of the Savior in this life. And while we may not see Him now, perhaps we can learn from their experience. After the Savior’s death, He appeared to these people, taught them, and blessed them. And then “it came to pass that he commanded that their little children should be brought” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.11" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 17:11</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p5" pid="C4gJ8Nqt_0CBiywaQhhAFg" hash="-aGgIg">It is our sacred responsibility as parents and leaders of this rising generation of children to bring them to the Savior so that they might see His face and the face of our Father in Heaven as well. As we do so, we also bring ourselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p6" pid="N1j2eyJClEmCGhjQOzI7xQ" hash="8iawdQ">Again the question, how do we do this, especially in a world that is full of distractions? In 3 Nephi, the parents loved the Lord. They were believers. They had faith in the miracles Jesus performed. They loved their children. They gathered them to hear the words of the Lord and obeyed His commandment to bring the children to Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p7" pid="h1LCjnHAq0G4GCHsbYRvZg" hash="_X3s0w">After the children had been brought, Christ bid the parents kneel down. Then He did for them that which He has done for all of us. He prayed for them to the Father, and as He did, His prayer was said to be “so great and marvelous” that words could not describe it (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.16" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 17:16</a>). By coming to the Savior and accepting His Atonement, these parents were strengthened to do all that was necessary to “bring” their children.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p9" pid="ggrUCi9ll0CbmPyEUQVViw" hash="NCWXxQ">And so, following their own experiences with the Savior, these Nephite parents taught their children about Him. They taught them to love the Lord. They taught them His gospel. They taught them how to live it. They taught them so well that there was righteousness and peace in the land for 200 years (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.1-22" class="scriptureRef">4 Nephi 1:1–22</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p10" pid="8S6mQ-Qg4Uq8oGibr_B6Vg" hash="Tn68rw">Now, I would ask you to look around you at those you love. This is <span class="pageBreak" page-number="82"></span>what matters most—our families. I am sure that more than anything, you want this family to be yours eternally. The account in 3 Nephi can help us bring our children to Him because it gives us a pattern to follow. First, we must love the Lord with all our hearts, and we must love our children. Second, we must become a worthy example to them by continually seeking the Lord and striving to live the gospel. Third, we must teach our children the gospel and how to live its teachings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p11" pid="S-1tzPyoXEWiVwK8pgKtPA" hash="j_t30g">Following this pattern to bring our children to the Savior is a process. Let’s look at the pattern again. First, we must learn how to love the Lord and our families. This takes time, experience, and faith. It requires selfless service. Then, as we are filled with the love of the Lord, we can love. He might weep over what we do, but He loves us and is always there to help us. That is how we must learn to love our children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p12" pid="3ExDqpNh10aZMWu3f5MUQQ" hash="L7XesA">Second, we must become worthy examples. This is also a process. If we want our children to come to Christ so that they might see His face, it is important that we seek to see it as well. We have to know the way in order to show it to them. We must put our own lives in order so that the children can look to us and follow. We might ask: “What do my children see when they look at my face? Do they see the image of the Savior in my countenance because of how I live my life?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p13" pid="3Ws6_zcHl0-BvyN0hJylpQ" hash="hFbiWA">Now remember, none of us will be the perfect example for our children, but we all can become worthy parents and leaders. Our striving to be worthy is an example in itself. We may feel as though we are failing at times, but we can keep on trying. With the Lord and through Him, we can be strengthened to be who we need to be. We can do what we need to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p14" pid="8mkntPLaUk6GHcpiHBKG7w" hash="R5ci3w">And third, we have the process of bringing our children to the Savior by teaching them the truths of the gospel from the scriptures and the prophets and by helping them to feel and recognize the Spirit. Even very young children can understand and accept things of an eternal nature. They love the scriptures, and they love the prophet. They intuitively want to be good. It is up to us to help them keep that connection to heaven open. It is up to us to protect them from influences that detract from the Spirit. We can find help and direction in the scriptures. Then we can teach our children to find their own answers there. We can teach our children correct principles and help them apply those principles to their lives. We can direct them toward the Spirit so that they can receive their own witness of the truths they are learning. We can help them find the joy of living the gospel. This will build a firm foundation of faith and obedience in their lives that will strengthen them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/that-our-children-might-see-the-face-of-the-savior.p15" pid="4Bf_nuhKAUat-x6uyT7eHA" hash="Jxns7g">Now, all of this does not come easily. The Nephite account says that those families had 200 years of peace. But surely it took great effort. It takes a lot of hard work and patience and faith, but nothing is more important or rewarding. And the Lord will help us, for He loves these children even more than we do. He loves them, and He will bless them.</p>

Then “he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.</p>

Elder M. Russell Ballard has said, “Clearly, those of us who have been entrusted with precious children have been given a sacred, noble stewardship, for we are the ones God has appointed to encircle today’s children with love and the fire of faith and an understanding of who they are” (“Behold Your Little Ones,” <span class="emphasis">Tambuli,</span> Oct. 1994, 40; “Great Shall Be the Peace of Thy Children,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Apr. 1994, 60).</p>

Together we can come to know Him. We can feel of His love and His blessings. And through Him we can return to the presence of the Father. We do this as we are willing to be obedient, faithful, and diligent in following His teachings.</p>

Jesus Christ is His Son, our Savior and Redeemer. He has invited us to come unto Him and has commanded us to bring our children that we, together, might see His face and live eternally with Him and with our Father in Heaven. It is my prayer that we might all work to receive this great blessing in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
