      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p1" pid="nDDlO6_5AkawA9YtCRLHMQ" hash="A1QF5w">My dear brothers and sisters, I pray that you and I might be united by the Spirit, uplifted together, and rejoice in the beautiful things of the gospel. I have in my pocket a silver dollar. On one side it says, “in God we trust.” We have been taught by the prophets to trust in the Lord, to trust as did young David when facing the giant Goliath. Now, there is another side to that coin. Would that it read, “and God can trust in you.” The Lord wants us to trust in him, but he also wants to be able to trust in us. One of our great prophet leaders said, “To be trusted is a greater compliment than to be loved” (David O. McKay, “Character,” <span class="emphasis">True to the Faith,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966, p. 274).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p2" pid="abvXeQOLlkuNATIQKF334Q" hash="XSrYzA">One of the principal purposes of this life is to find out if the Lord <span class="emphasis">can</span> trust us. One of our familiar scriptures says, “And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.25" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:25</a>). We are destined to be tried, tested, and proven during our sojourn on earth to see if we are trustworthy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p3" pid="NC_p36i_9kakFRcRuyRuUA" hash="sdV1gg">The Prophet Joseph Smith indicated that to attain the highest blessing of this life, we will first be tested and proved thoroughly until the Lord is certain that he can trust us in all things, regardless of the personal hazard or sacrifice involved. The Lord loves all of his children, but he can trust some more than others. It is far better when he can both love <span class="emphasis">and</span> trust each one of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p4" pid="B24ioOtEFE28Bw6wkmf0DA" hash="JAiEPg">It has been said that one measure of a man is not how much he is worth, but rather how much he can borrow, how much he can be trusted with someone else’s money. I feel that the banker’s formula for measuring trust has a direct application to spiritual trust. Just as a banker measures a person’s <span class="emphasis">character, capacity,</span> and <span class="emphasis">capital,</span> so the Lord might measure our character, our capacity, and our spiritual capital (or spiritual reserves) to identify those in whom he might trust the more.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p5" pid="e4IqQoDbyUqZY9mpLH7bMQ" hash="JCBBuw">Character is part of trust. If there is any doubt as to the borrower’s character (his ethics and morals that lead him to meet his obligations on time no matter what sacrifice is required), there will be no trust and no loan will be granted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p6" pid="vmts5rRplkefC-qzhocX0g" hash="Q403Nw">The Lord needs to know if he can trust us to do the right thing in every situation. Joseph of Egypt had a fine position as Potiphar’s principal steward. Then the wife of Potiphar attempted to entice him to sin. Joseph was far from home and family. He was a trusted slave, but still a slave nonetheless. No one would know or care about his morals. To spurn the woman would certainly bring severe complications to his life, but he was true to his noble character. He fled sin, was caught, and imprisoned. He paid a price for his purity; yet to have done otherwise would have been a tragic flaw in his character. Nephi’s strength of character led him to obey a commandment. He could easily have been slain by the wicked Laban. Yet to not obey, when he had the testimony that the Lord would open the way for him to obtain the plates, would have been a flaw in his character. The Lord could trust Joseph and Nephi.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p7" pid="PhdkMOKYhUS3osnIXd486Q" hash="le30yw">A person of high character testifies and then lives in harmony with his testimony. Martin Luther, at the Diet of Worms, demonstrated this principle of being true to oneself: “I cannot and [I] will not recant, for it is neither safe nor expedient to act against conscience. Here I take my stand; I can do no otherwise, so help me God!” (Quoted in “The Building of Human Character,” <span class="emphasis">Gospel Ideals,</span> David O. McKay, Salt Lake City: <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> 1953, p. 354.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p8" pid="X0x6VvHDT0azy8YLSiGycg" hash="wtcM-A">Joseph Smith describes Paul’s character: “He saw a light, and heard a voice; … some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad. … But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise.” Then Joseph adds his testimony regarding his own vision, revealing his own strength of character; “I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.24-25" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:24–25</a>.) Joseph Smith was a man of great, noble character that the Lord knew he could trust, no matter what the sacrifice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p9" pid="G1mb_n-GuU20nODyTqL7qQ" hash="VD1qtA">President David O. McKay said: “Man’s chief concern in life should not be the acquiring of gold, or of fame, or of material possessions. It should not be the development of physical prowess, nor of intellectual strength, but his aim, the highest in life, should be the development of a Christlike character.” (McKay, <span class="emphasis">True to the Faith,</span> p. 32.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p10" pid="64-LyAVPz0-NV6brsgyecg" hash="JEV1HQ">Active membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints builds a Christlike character. Serving a full-time mission builds a Christlike character in whom the Lord can trust.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p11" pid="aDdblaXx80m3r7UKibxEFA" hash="N7XtSQ">Now, capacity is also part of trust. The capacity which the banker looks for in his client is that proven ability to perform as promised. The capacity the Lord looks for in us is that ability to perform to the degree that we become profitable servants unto him. The Lord has given us talents, gifts, and blessings. He expects us to magnify them and to use them in the service of others if he is to trust us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p12" pid="OIZBzs7xCU-Vo7XzAaa1-Q" hash="l_ToPA">The servant who received five talents returned ten and received the praise “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:21</a>). The servant who had received two talents returned four talents, and he received equal praise with the first. However, the Lord chastised the slothful servant that received one talent for not multiplying that which had been given to him. The principle is clear: The Lord likes to see capacity double; he likes to see his servants double that which has been given to them—in talents or in responsibilities. It is evident that President Kimball, our great president, also likes to see things double. He likes to see double the number of missionaries, double the number of new faithful members coming into the Church, double the attendance at sacrament meeting, and so on. I believe that each one of us has a sacred responsibility to multiply our capacity and our performance in every measurable way. If we do so, the Lord can better trust our capacity as his servants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p13" pid="pMkpM9pjSUWZmbSq1_pD5w" hash="6Vucmg">There are many areas besides Church service in which we could make a sustained effort to increase our capacity. We should strive to increase our technical capacity in our daily breadwinning labors. We should strive to improve our capacity as parents and teachers. We should multiply our capacity as member-missionaries in asking the Golden Questions and in sharing with everyone. We should improve our capacity as informed citizens, as Christian neighbors giving service to others. The Lord can trust us according to our capacity. He can trust us in proportion to what we have done with that which he has given us. Active membership in the Mormon church builds both spiritual and temporal capacity. Serving a full-time mission develops personal capacity that the Lord can trust.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p14" pid="NP31C3dGzkKgOnYvU6zW3g" hash="Ne5xUQ">Spiritual capacity is also part of trust. The banker looks at capital as both a reserve which the client has available with which to meet emergencies, as well as a measure of the client’s commitment to the venture. On the spiritual side of the coin, we might say that the Lord is looking for <span class="emphasis">both</span> a spiritual reserve in the individual with which he would meet life’s emergencies, as well as a measure of the person’s commitment to His kingdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p15" pid="3s6qC-e7mEikxTPCCmkV9A" hash="12OGBg">Spiritual capital in a sense is an investment each has made in righteous living. It is an asset—in reserve—upon which we may draw in time of need. How do we develop spiritual capital and reserves? We need to make an investment in time studying the scriptures and the words of our living prophets; an investment in more meaningful communication with our Father in Heaven; an investment in service to others; an investment in unconditional, unselfish love of others; an investment in missionary labor, which lays up in store blessings and forgiveness of our sins; an investment in being wiser parents and more obedient children; an investment in doubling our performance in every calling. These investments will provide such spiritual capital and reserves that the Lord can truly trust us to overcome the temptations and frustrations of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p16" pid="aWNCi0ArpEGmfWi3C3Atvw" hash="c9qnUQ">Our forefathers built great spiritual reserves by investing in sacrifice. They could face any challenge because they knew that their individual lives were in order and that they were the favored ones of heaven because of the sacrifices they made in giving up everything that was dear to them in order to follow the prophet. They suffered persecutions. They went out as missionaries, leaving families behind. They left producing farms and well-built homes to go out into dry deserts or cold mountains to begin again. The Prophet Joseph said “that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation” (<span class="emphasis">Lectures on Faith,</span> comp. N. B. Lundwall, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, p. 58).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-cs-of-spirituality.p18" pid="seNFBvfNQkSjbNvMyFLXrg" hash="ohd07A">I read from Doctrine and Covenants 124:20 [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:20</a>]: “My servant … may be trusted because of the integrity of his heart; and for the love which he has to my testimony,” he adds, “I, the Lord, love him.”</p>

Amen.</p>

They felt that she was the most sophisticated, cultured, and best-educated investigator they had ever met. They held a few meetings in her lovely home, and when they invited her to accompany them to a Sunday Church meeting, she readily agreed. The service was being held in an old building. The members attending were of somewhat humble circumstances compared to the new investigator.</p>

The branch leaders had just been recently called, and they were still learning their duties. There was some confusion at the pulpit. There was an interruption at the sacrament table at the most sacred moment. The sermons seemed to be less interesting than those desired by the eager missionaries. The reverence was threatened from time to time by children moving or crying. There was no organ to provide deep, religious sounds. The missionaries agonizingly thought of the negative impressions their elegant investigator must be receiving. They knew she normally worshiped in a very fashionable cathedral where everything would have been highly professional and the congregation would have been of the highest stratum of local society.</p>

He explained: “Please excuse our present building. Some day we will build a lovely new chapel here.” Then he added: “Please excuse our new leaders. We have a lay priesthood, so we take turns conducting, and the new leaders are still learning how to conduct services.” He was just about to give another excuse when Sister Herta Mellor turned to him and said somewhat sternly: “Elder, don’t you apologize! It must have been like this at the time of Christ!”</p>

She saw past cathedrals and organs. She saw back through the corridors of time to the Shepherd meeting with his humble fishermen-Apostles, with some sinners, and even with leper outcasts. She saw the early Saints meeting in a small, rented, upstairs room. She saw children, with the Savior smiling at them lovingly. Because she knew the Shepherd, she could say with profound and deep insight, “It must have been like this at the time of Christ.”</p>

We are Christians. We know additional details about the Savior’s role in the premortal existence before we came here: we have new information about His part in the creation of the world under the direction of our Father; we can identify Him as Jehovah of the Old Testament, communicating with the prophets of Israel. We have the Book of Mormon, which is another testament of Jesus Christ, which has great illuminating doctrines and information about the Savior. Our modern prophets have given revealed explanations, doctrines, light, and knowledge on the Christ as the Redeemer to whom we look for the remission of our sins. We have a wealth of information of tremendous value to all Christian churches. We do not diminish or tear down the faith others have in Christ, but seek only to share with them our additional knowledge of the Lamb, the Shepherd, the Holy One of Israel (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/71.22" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 71:22</a>)—for their benefit and salvation.</p>

We do not worship the Prophet Joseph Smith, although we love and honor him. But we never pray to him. In our doctrine, philosophy, and practice, he is not an intermediary of any kind, nor is any other prophet or saint. Christ alone is the advocate with the Father”—and I repeated for emphasis—“not Mary, not Joseph, not Peter, James, or John, not any of the ancient prophets like Adam, Moses, or Abraham. No modern prophet like Joseph Smith or Brigham Young is ever worshiped or prayed to.”</p>

To make my point that we do not worship our prophets, I said, “Please believe me when I say that we never make a pilgrimage to where the Prophet Joseph is buried; as a matter of fact, <span class="emphasis">I</span> do not even know <span class="emphasis">where</span> he is buried!”</p>

He was thoroughly astonished, but he could easily see that his understanding of our Church had been completely wrong. This turnabout then led to a conversation in which truths regarding how we <span class="emphasis">do</span> worship the Savior could be discussed easily and openly. The positive fact that we are practicing Christians was established.</p>

Let me discuss each one of these three roles:</p>

When he was in the hospital ready to undergo open-heart surgery a few years ago, he was being wheeled down the hall and into the operating room by a young orderly. The young man accidentally smashed his finger between the metal door frame and the metal frame of the bed on which lay the already sedated prophet. When this mishap occurred, the young man, in pain, used an unfortunate expression in which he took in vain the name of the Savior. The prophet stirred, opened his eyes, and gently rebuked the orderly, saying, “Young man, don’t say that; He’s my best friend!”</p>

He called and asked if I were busy. I quickly responded, “Not at all. What can I do for you, President Kimball?” He told me he needed a companion to go with him to the Primary Children’s Hospital to give a few blessings. It turned out that he had heard of several children from South America, as well as some American Indian children, who were in the hospital. We went from floor to floor giving blessings to all the Latins and Lamanites and many others too. I was deeply affected by the love of President Kimball and his tender friendship with each child. He was a friend to the sick—a friend to those far from home. He exemplified the tender, loving friendship that the Savior would give. It was easy to see how he could say, “The Savior is my best friend.”</p>

The reporters posed for President Lee what could have been a difficult question: “What is your position with regard to the Vietnam war?” You recall that at that time the war was underway, and there were those who supported it and those who were against our involvement.</p>

His answer disarmed them, impressed them. As I remember, he said, “We, together with the entire Christian world, abhor war.” And he went on, “The Savior said, ‘In the world ye shall have tribulations.’ But He also said, ‘In me ye might have peace’.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.33" class="scriptureRef">John 16:33</a>.) Continuing, President Lee quoted from John 14: “‘Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I [peace] unto you.’” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>.)</p>

And he said to them: “The Savior was not speaking of the kind of peace which is won with armies or navies or force; nor was He speaking of the kind of peace which can be negotiated in the halls of congresses. He was speaking of the kind of peace we each can have in our hearts only when we live His commandments to such a degree that we know He is pleased with us.” President Lee, speaking as a true servant of the Prince of Peace, had answered them with inspiration.</p>

To go to school, to make friends, to marry, to rear children, to face through life the swift changes of circumstances that no man can certainly predict an hour ahead.” (<span class="emphasis">Vital Quotations,</span> comp.

The Lord needs you out in the mission field. Forget your fears. We don’t expect you to do everything the young missionaries do. In fact, I was in Idaho trying to eliminate the fears of some high priests, and I said, “You retired couples don’t have to memorize scriptures like the young missionaries, you don’t have to memorize any presentations unless you want to.” I told them, “You don’t have to get up early in the morning like the young missionaries do to study, and if it is raining or snowing, you don’t have to go outside until you feel up to it. …” At that point a fellow down in the middle shot up his hand and said, “When can I go? That’s a better life than I’ve got now!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/adventures-of-the-spirit.p8" pid="xFj4kdsYaUS6Ud0OISFMAQ" hash="hP67kQ">Joe and Zella Wendel went on a mission. Her legs were bothering her, and they got worse in the mission field instead of better. She wrote home, “I thought we were just to work in the office, but now we find we are to proselyte also. But my knees are so bad we just can’t go out looking for people, so we are praying very hard to find someone right here in our apartment building.” In three months they had three baptisms—new move-ins from their apartment building! Those missionaries were my parents.</p>

Former Bishop Walser was soon called as a branch president in the remote interior mountains. With his limited Missionary Training Center Spanish, Elder Walser had to choose counselors, hold meetings, teach, train, reactivate, ordain, and so on. In fasting and prayer he received impressions from the Spirit and went about his work. Elder Walser wrote, “I learned that even with limited language, whenever it was needed, enough Spanish was given me to communicate, and I knew it was from the Lord.”</p>

They are grateful for their spiritual adventure in serving the Lord.</p>

They were welcomed in, so they immediately told about Joseph Smith’s first vision, the angel Moroni, the gold plates, and the restoration of the priesthood. Then the senior companion, noting that about forty-five minutes had gone by, said, “We would like to return next week to tell you more.”</p>

The family asked for baptism that same evening.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/adventures-of-the-spirit.p15" pid="5vXwgfQud02P4QxRLQNqqQ" hash="r-rbXA">President Kimball said, “Should <span class="emphasis">every</span> young man fill a mission? The answer has been given by the Lord. It is <span class="emphasis">yes. Every</span> young man should fill a mission.” President Kimball then equated this instruction of going on a mission with the commandments of paying tithing, of observing the Sabbath, of marrying in the temple. (in Regional Representatives’ seminar, 4 Apr. 1974.)</p>

His mind was not open to their message, but the man had to go to the hospital for surgery. While he was recuperating in the hospital, his yard and garden suffered. The two missionaries felt impressed to use their preparation day to mow his lawn, trim the hedge, and weed the flowers.</p>

Previously skeptical, he now paid rapt attention and visibly became more meek and humble. He prayed for the first time since he was a child, and he received a testimony and was baptized.</p>

He hesitated, and the missionary simply said, “That’s what my mom and dad do at home. Please take your wife by the hand.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/adventures-of-the-spirit.p22" pid="5QWrlhPLtkezLZsFfbQeZg" hash="zU7yow">After they were baptized, the husband and wife tearfully confessed that they were on the verge of divorce when they met the missionaries. The husband had already moved out of the home. He was just there to visit the children when the missionaries appeared. The husband said that as his hand touched his wife’s, a healing spirit came over them. Love replaced the wounds and the misunderstandings; they forgave each other, and the husband came home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/adventures-of-the-spirit.p23" pid="0i3p-NClykmYPdRE6UTuEg" hash="lxheNg">Another man said that he would not go to church but that his family could go. The missionaries told him that they would always save him a seat right by the door in case he changed his mind. One Sunday he was prompted to go to church even though his family had left without him. From the foyer he could see his family seated with the missionaries and a space at the end of the pew vacant and easily accessible. He entered the little chapel, and his footsteps were heard. The missionaries turned their heads, and when they saw him, tears came to their eyes. After baptism the husband would say, “Never in my life had anyone ever cried out of happiness just to see me enter a room.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/adventures-of-the-spirit.p24" pid="_biu4RHgW0C-CHWtFcMsnQ" hash="aeOXXw">A new senior companion faced a sophisticated woman lawyer who was polite but very intellectual. When the missionary asked her who the boy prophet saw in the column of light, she answered, “I am an atheist.” The elder didn’t really understand the implication, so he repeated the question. She answered again, “I am an atheist. You want me to say that Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son, but I do not believe in God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/adventures-of-the-spirit.p25" pid="2A9kK9kMzU-WPizhnetTgg" hash="nassGQ">The elder had never encountered an atheist before, and his first impulse was to give up and leave, but the Spirit said, “No, she will listen. Just answer the questions for her.” So the elder proceeded and said, “You are right. He saw the Father and the Son.” He continued with the presentation, but instead of asking questions directly, he asked them indirectly and answered them himself for her.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/adventures-of-the-spirit.p26" pid="AqT2ZrqEykqo7eRSrKoekA" hash="f8EzRg">At the end of the presentation he taught her how we pray, and then courageously asked her to kneel with them and to be the voice. She did kneel and did pray to her Heavenly Father. Never again did she say that she was an atheist. She and her family subsequently were baptized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/adventures-of-the-spirit.p27" pid="bf9Ozj9lFk6vqhXoIcCrZA" hash="VyAiSQ">In the mission field, more than anywhere else, you can enjoy those adventures of the spirit we call “thin-veil experiences” and “liquid-fire experiences,” the things so spiritual and miraculous that tongue cannot adequately confess nor the hand of man appropriately write.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace.p1" pid="AM5xwqOVskWE29OtNVqsSw" hash="5YlyuQ">Last Sunday Latter-day Saints joined together with the entire Christian world in remembering and celebrating Easter. We were worshipping our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and honoring his resurrection. We were also thanking God, as we have done today on this special day of prayer, for the liberation of Kuwait and the hope of lasting peace in the Persian Gulf area with the returning of troops to their homelands.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace.p2" pid="f4ReLGZM3kiGomTdXCU7kg" hash="AVJwxg">When Christ was born to this world, angels proclaimed, “Peace on earth, good will toward men.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.14" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:14</a>.) Yet in the two thousand years since that proclamation there has been little peace in the world. Even with the successful cessation of major hostilities in the Gulf, there still remains an uneasy peace between some nations and great unrest within other nations. Just as Christ’s atonement has saved us from both physical and spiritual death, the peace of which the Savior of mankind spoke is also both physical and spiritual.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace.p3" pid="F3EAQbFgD0SHRb8gCItQXg" hash="d9C6ww">Today I’d like to speak about this spiritual peace offered by Christ in the Sermon on the Mount, when he gave us the beautiful beatitude about peace and peacemakers. The entire sermon is a blueprint for us to use in our personal path towards perfection, as well as a pattern of the many attributes and qualities we must develop in our eternal quest to approach the perfection and peace Jesus personifies.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace.p4" pid="cWVeoUKnJkSux6uOT242yQ" hash="SCCsgQ">I like to think of when the sermon was first taught. In my mind’s eye, I see a scene of peaceful beauty: I envision an afternoon in early April. The sky is softening toward dusk, with not even a breeze. White, wispy cirrus clouds stand almost motionless in the clear blue sky. And below, on the coast of the Sea of Galilee, soft waves lap against moored fishing boats. A great crowd assembles on the side of the hill. Eager listeners sit on the grass or stand amidst the rocks and early spring flowers. All are hushed and thoughtful as every face is lifted up, every eye looking towards the Lord, and every ear listening as the Savior tells them what they need to do in order to have peace in their lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace.p5" pid="sP7wWHd0N0SUFRy412J0Bg" hash="FOX1HA">Tenderly Christ speaks: “Blessed are the peacemakers.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:9</a>.) Another Bible translator quotes the Savior, saying, “Happy are those who <span class="emphasis">make</span> peace.” (<span class="emphasis">The New Testament in Modern English,</span> trans. J. B. Phillips, New York: The Macmillan Co., 1958, p. 9; italics added.) Either way, we focus on the strong verb <span class="emphasis">make</span> as in “make peace” or “peacemakers.” To follow Christ and bring forth the blessings of heaven, we must actively make peace in the world, in the community, in the neighborhood, and above all, in the home we live in.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace.p6" pid="7iK8-qAwNkGW35d-D7c_7Q" hash="R8Kk6w">In the meridian of time, many expected Christ to take a political stand against Roman rule and offer peace to the oppressed people. Christ did indeed offer peace, but it was not external or political; rather, the peace Christ taught was internal and personal.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace.p7" pid="KBRXIBaJUESuEu3INyO19g" hash="NH5r7w">I would like to share an incident which took place during the Vietnam War. There were some who were convinced that the United States was engaged in a noble and justifiable war. However, public opinion was changing, and there was opposition which argued that the U.S. should pull out of Vietnam.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace.p8" pid="GXhQnyUhuUKas2kZdvEPuQ" hash="n-PaUA">President Harold B. Lee was the President of the Church at the time. While at an area conference in another country he was interviewed by reporters from the international news services. One reporter asked President Lee, “What is your church’s position on the Vietnam War?” Some recognized the question as a trap—one which could not be answered without a very real risk of being misunderstood or misinterpreted. If the prophet answered, “We are against the war,” the international media could state, “How strange—a religious leader who is against the position of the country he is obliged to sustain in his own church’s articles of faith.” On the other hand, if President Lee answered, “We are in favor of the war,” the media could question, “How strange—a religious leader in favor of war?” Either way, the answer could result in serious problems regarding public opinion both inside and outside the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace.p9" pid="a2E_6HTVwU6YE2oH91OADQ" hash="ywzNVA">President Lee, with great inspiration and wisdom, answered as would a man who knows the Savior: “We, together with the whole Christian world, abhor war. But the Savior said, ‘In me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation.’” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.33" class="scriptureRef">John 16:33</a>.) And then the prophet quoted that other comforting scripture from John: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>.) President Lee then explained: “The Savior was not talking about the peace that can be achieved between nations, by military force or by negotiation in the halls of parliaments. Rather, he was speaking of the peace we can each have in our own lives when we live the commandments and come unto Christ with broken hearts and contrite spirits.” (See <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1982, p. 70.)</p>

Using a few excerpts, I quote from her article: “Dad decided that our family should begin an intensive study of the scriptures to help my brother Bruce prepare for his mission. Dad’s goal was to read the entire Book of Mormon before Bruce left, tape-recording our voices as we went along. … We would take turns reading a chapter [each]. …</p>

He often listened to them, partly just to hear Bruce’s voice, I thought, since they had been very close. Sometimes at night Dad would fall asleep listening, and I would smile to myself as I heard the familiar click-click-click of the recorder that had run to tape’s end. …</p>

I began rewinding the tape, stopping it at random, hoping to find solace in hearing the gentle resonance of Dad’s voice. … I sat upright as my father spoke from the tape:</p>

Paul says that it is the Spirit: “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/5.22" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 5:22</a>.) Our closeness to the Lord will, in great measure, determine the peace and comfort and renewed strength that we feel as we invite the Spirit into our lives.</p>

His priesthood leader had requested earlier that I accept his call. Desperately he pleaded, “We need to see someone. We just have to find some peace in our lives.” There are probably as many different sources of personal strife and lack of peace as there are people. The roots might be in one’s own life or in the life of a loved one. The causes can be sin, failure to live the commandments of God, selfishness, pride, lack of love, lack of commitment, lack of willingness to make sacrifices for others, or even just being an innocent victim. No matter what the reason, the solution to achieve peace is always the same: Turn to Christ; follow his example; repent of all transgressions. His command to the storm-tossed sea, “Peace, be still” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/4.39" class="scriptureRef">Mark 4:39</a>), can also apply to his calming influence in our lives as we experience the buffetings of life’s storms.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace.p23" pid="mPuzYcKu_E2go3tGohQR_g" hash="yATaxw">Personal peace and our level of spirituality will increase as we focus on studying and thinking about Christ every day; by loving and thanking Christ more each day for his atoning sacrifice; by daily striving to serve Christ better through becoming more involved in missionary service; by making a greater effort to find his lost sheep, his lost coins, his lost prodigals, and helping them to return to the fold; by making a more concerted effort to be in the temple more frequently; and by researching more diligently our family’s history. Is there any peace greater than that of the faithful missionary, the caring shepherd, the dedicated temple patron and worker?</p>

Christ is the way to peace, the truth of peace, the life of peace, the source of peace. Look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, talk of Christ, rejoice in Christ, preach of Christ, live as Christ would have us live, and worship him and our Heavenly Father with all your heart, might, mind, and strength.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/our-message-to-the-world.p2" pid="MEql4dSRbU2a0ersVDPLkw" hash="7UXGWQ">First is the divine Sonship of Jesus Christ, which is central to understanding the entire plan of salvation. He is the First Begotten Son of the Father in the premortal existence and the Only Begotten Son of the Father on earth. God the Eternal Father is the literal parent of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and of His other spirit children (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.18,21" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11:18, 21</a>; James E. Talmage, <span class="emphasis">The Articles of Faith,</span> 12th ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924, p. 466).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/our-message-to-the-world.p3" pid="sxFIYKNJ9kK-gnHRPzDUvA" hash="ybV5qg">When we refer to the divine Sonship of Jesus Christ, we are also referring to His role as a God in the premortal sphere. This Firstborn Son of Elohim the Father was chosen and ordained in the primeval councils in heaven to be the Savior of the yet-to-be-born race of mortals (see James E. Talmage, <span class="emphasis">Jesus the Christ,</span> 3rd ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916, p. 4). Jesus was also chosen and sent by the Father to organize and create this earth, our solar system, our galaxy, even worlds without number.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/our-message-to-the-world.p4" pid="7aZZYV0CdkyDveoMAgCDhQ" hash="DshdkA">Jesus Christ was and is Jehovah of the Old Testament, the God of Adam and of Noah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Jehovah appeared to and talked to the ancient prophets. When He spoke He did so on behalf of the Father, and He said what His Father would have said. Jehovah of the Old Testament became Jesus Christ of the New Testament when He was born into mortality.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/our-message-to-the-world.p5" pid="ntADDLavwkCoWbyS__aPKQ" hash="qGz88Q">The “divine Sonship” also refers to the designation “Only Begotten Son in the flesh.” Ancient and modern scriptures use the title “Only Begotten Son” to emphasize the divine nature of Jesus Christ. This title signifies that Jesus’ physical body was the offspring of a mortal mother and of an immortal Eternal Father, which verity is crucial to the Atonement, a supreme act that could not have been accomplished by an ordinary man. Christ had power to lay down His life and power to take it again because He had inherited immortality from His Heavenly Father. From Mary, His mother, Christ inherited mortality, or the power to die.</p>

Elder Bruce R. McConkie said, “We view the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ as the center and core and heart of revealed religion” (<span class="emphasis">A New Witness for the Articles of Faith,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1985, p. 81). The book of Alma declared, “This is the whole meaning of the law” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:14</a>).</p>

In that pillar stood two personages—God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ—whose brightness and glory defied all description. The Father spoke, saying, Joseph, “This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/our-message-to-the-world.p9" pid="9GBjnJPitUqlPgAOq17dmg" hash="o-devw">One of the hallmarks of the calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith was his divine education in the writings and prophecies of the ancient apostles and prophets. The writings and teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith “read like a seamless gospel fabric, woven from the sacred truths of ancient and modern scripture” (Richard C. Galbraith, introduction to <span class="emphasis">Scriptural Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1993, p. 5).</p>

Rather, he received the greatest heavenly tutorials ever given to man in the process of his divine education. He received direct answer to prayer from God, not from books. After the First Vision he received other visions and numerous visits from angelic ministers, and “he was taught for years by … holy angels sent from God out of heaven to teach and instruct him and prepare him to lay the foundation of this Church” (Wilford Woodruff, in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 16:265). The inspiration of the Holy Ghost was likewise fundamental in Joseph’s expounding of biblical scripture. He received revelations from Jesus Christ, and the Urim and Thummim provided another means by which Joseph Smith received scriptural instructions.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/our-message-to-the-world.p11" pid="Z2ggK-TCh0OVPENhmaKFvQ" hash="Zc2hCg">The eternal truths he taught answered a brood of questions that had been in the minds of philosophers for centuries. When one studies the doctrinal teachings revealed to Joseph Smith, that person, if he or she is sincere in the search for truth, will be led to Jesus Christ and His role as our Savior, Redeemer, and Advocate with the Father. In studying these teachings of Joseph about the Savior, uncertainty and doubt flee, and hearts are changed. The honest person finds greater meaning in life by the Prophet’s answers to the philosophical questions, Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going? Because of revelations given to Joseph, the memory veil between this life and our premortal existence becomes almost transparent at times. And the veil between this life and the spirit world becomes thinner, causing family ties to become stronger, sweeter, and more meaningful as the hearts of the children turn to their fathers and the hearts of the fathers turn to their children.</p>

The doctrines of salvation taught by this prophet distill upon our souls as the very dews from heaven (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>). Joseph taught eternal truths that lead those who hunger and thirst for righteousness to the living Christ and to the bosom of God the Father.</p>

It is a collection of writings by prophets who lived in the Western Hemisphere, who believed in Christ, and who prophesied of Christ, some of whom associated with Christ during the brief time He visited the Americas after His resurrection. Those ancient American prophets wrote the Book of Mormon for our day. It has withstood every conceivable test by both skeptical and sincere minds. It is not on trial. We are the ones on trial, being tested by our acceptance or rejection of its truths, teachings, commandments, and declarations (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.11-14" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 33:11–14</a>).</p>

We have a mission and a commandment to declare its contents to the world and to bear testimony of it (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.54-58" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:54–58</a>).</p>

Furthermore, Paul had warned that the Second Coming would occur only after a falling away from the original teachings of Christ and the Apostles (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.3-4" class="scriptureRef">2 Thes. 2:3–4</a>).</p>

I so declare in all humility and testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
