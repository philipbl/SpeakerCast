Upon my return I was talking with my cousin about the estate of the deceased, and I asked the inevitable question, “How much did he leave?” My cousin said, “He left it all; he didn’t take any of it with him.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p2" guid="fa6f7c52-4217-4f1f-bc0e-440bfab1dbf7" pid="tNO_O_dguEa11oyTD91oOA" hash="XsIX3A">That struck me as being a great truth that very, very few men seem ever to comprehend. Certainly many of us act as though we are going to take it all with us when we go; of course, we are not. In terms of material things, <span class="emphasis">each of us </span>leaves it all. In the words of Paul to Timothy, “For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/6.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 6:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p3" guid="1588e03c-0b15-4238-8564-e9c300cc3ec4" pid="Qz5RVJVQn0aGoTCO3KJtnQ" hash="HGUaaw">Well, isn’t there anything good we can take with us when we go, we may ask? The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the knowledge and intelligence gained here in this life would go with us when we leave.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p4" guid="a2966372-42f0-4640-926a-6f8eb6c346ff" pid="JcqcZmgv9Eu3MwzlYdK4OA" hash="czUjuA">“And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p5" guid="0232f965-fa0f-4016-883b-a3ea2dc056ed" pid="wSmKElbv3k2WzwedcVTIUg" hash="f2-edA">“There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated—</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p6" guid="bc013cfb-3dc1-405e-b913-41ebf556b8e5" pid="6QNdBOlnH068mIzlT3e__g" hash="s1nykQ">“And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.19-21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:19–21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p7" guid="2dbb1651-9e63-473f-aac7-36894c7f4b3b" pid="un6AjKYRkkKORngQCXygHA" hash="eKCF2w">This being true, then it would seem that we all should place the pursuit of light and truth, or intelligence, uppermost in our selection of goals, since we may have them eternally. We must seek after enlightenment. Since “the glory of God is intelligence” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:36</a>), if we would be like our Heavenly Father, our course is fixed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p8" guid="f999430b-57ae-4bfa-b838-9652e5e9f8b2" pid="UqLOqMIOwEC0JjVBzJW6zQ" hash="OBolGg">Ignorance is expensive; in fact, it is the most expensive commodity we know anything about. Certainly we make many mistakes through ignorance. If it is a violation of a commandment of God which we have never received and thus do not know, then the Lord does not hold us guilty of the sin. “… to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/4.17" class="scriptureRef">James 4:17</a>.) And in Paul’s words, “… where no law is, there is no transgression.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/4.15" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 4:15</a>.) But even though we may not be guilty of the sin because of our ignorance, neither can we receive the blessing, which is predicated on obedience, without rendering obedience to that law. Therefore, we are denied the blessing through our ignorance. If it is a traffic law we have violated through ignorance, the penalty assessed us is exactly the same as if we had known. Also, if we stick a finger in an electric light socket, we will receive the same shock, irrespective of our knowledge of electricity. I repeat, ignorance is expensive. Particularly is this true since the Lord has decreed, “It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 131:6</a>.) For surely no man is truly enlightened unless he knows the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p9" guid="680daf33-09c8-46a6-bd8d-0d422387fd50" pid="9pswDihavEC9yymoKrTYVw" hash="m7YowQ">Why is it we are so slow to learn, to receive the light? Is it because the Lord is slow to speak or doesn’t want to be bothered? Not according to his word to James wherein he says he “giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not. …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p10" guid="91b2bc1b-6645-4e77-b3a4-12fcf57e215a" pid="2mQr-6srOUOv7GC8g7r3Gw" hash="T3cQig">Then the real problem is in that we receive not the light! “… and here is the condemnation of man,” saith the Lord; “because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and they receive not the light.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p11" guid="bb01b3bd-961e-4664-a29a-ce8655017448" pid="CVMiMUmgM0mJGD_sABcn6w" hash="_2YqnQ">“And every man whose spirit receiveth not the light is under condemnation.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.31-32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:31–32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p12" guid="bd2def60-e644-40db-9bc0-0f879699d4c3" pid="LrVjEQNzKUuJb-y-V8AC6g" hash="WW5QBA">But why do we receive not the light? The Lord tells us why over and over again in the scriptures. Simply stated, the reason we do not learn is because we are not in condition to learn. We are not in condition to receive the light because we are not willing to receive it. <span class="emphasis">We just plain don’t want it.</span> Now most of us would violently disagree with this statement, I am sure. Of course we want light and learning from God, our Heavenly Father. Still, the words of the Lord are true. In speaking of those who would be resurrected from the dead but would not receive a degree of glory, he said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p13" guid="d158770b-cd00-4642-af0f-16ad61b0ac38" pid="xIM18MdrTUaEzu4L72duOA" hash="VzfN0w">“And they who remain shall also be quickened; nevertheless, they shall return again to their own place, to enjoy that which they are willing to receive, because they were not willing to enjoy that which they might have received.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p14" guid="4659dd06-9b4c-42bf-874c-8ff7f8f62852" pid="95Jt9iXDQkqKN8qjcHb_WQ" hash="KPEAfA">“For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.32-33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:32–33</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p15" guid="75a201b6-a285-4181-8f64-12bd5f2d9d26" pid="yr_o8rRiJUCOlE7IBWl1rA" hash="_nNgwA">Then Cassius’s words to Brutus in Shakespeare’s <span class="emphasis">Julius Caesar </span>apply equally to us. “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings.” We must look to ourselves for the reason for our ignorance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p16" guid="fd0ee23e-286b-43e7-bb19-e2127002e7ae" pid="U5nykcfH_0GF-_snD2SLFA" hash="zO2upw">We are prone to say that we are waiting on the Lord to receive light and truth when, as a matter of fact, the Lord is waiting on us—waiting for us to get into condition so he can reveal the light we seek and so desperately need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p17" guid="8829c1dd-9a29-4f45-b4e7-2040c19bf3d0" pid="SUJI_fR7sEaeAUpFn6s60A" hash="DhJZGg">The Lord has well stated our plight. “And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men [love] darkness rather than light, because their deeds [are] evil.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.19" class="scriptureRef">John 3:19</a>.) I repeat: “because their deeds [are] evil.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p18" guid="efd37c87-4cec-4f7c-b13d-3975dfbf33dc" pid="K0NYpe9gdEK6lTP2PuTeKA" hash="I_nqHw">Revelation, light, and knowledge come through the power of the Holy Ghost. The words of the Master as recorded in John are expressive. “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>.) And again, “… he [the Holy Ghost] will guide you into all truth … and [shall show] you things to come.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.13" class="scriptureRef">John 16:13</a>.) In fact, we can neither teach nor learn gospel truths without the Holy Ghost. In this day the Lord has reconfirmed this great truth in these words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p19" guid="e5d668c7-0f13-4b65-82eb-0e71e4cff132" pid="-mpWu8bMtUyPdbdwG00a5w" hash="ke1VBQ">“Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that he that receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached by the Spirit of truth?</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p26" guid="e71863d4-4bb7-466e-9250-318fbf90b71f" pid="1FrXx6VahE6srWmMOxw6QQ" hash="tTULiQ">A great Book of Mormon prophet, Alma, after preaching a great sermon on obedience under the influence of the Holy Spirit, stated in part how he received such knowledge and power. “Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.46" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:46</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p27" guid="d2adaa25-5d67-4023-88f7-a68b1f918b44" pid="770f0RcGNUuOfIr5cIDy-A" hash="pA6lbA">Sometimes members appear to feel that fasting and prayer is all that is necessary to receive the answers to their problems. Sometime ago a young lady came into my office concerned because she had fasted and prayed for two days to know if a certain young man should marry her, and she felt that she had received an answer in the affirmative. Shortly thereafter, the young man became engaged to another girl. Her question to me was, “How can this be, since I received an answer that he should marry me?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p28" guid="d84bd73c-4189-4bb2-a75d-ed58d4566e22" pid="dila_VJjmEKNSVOyvTuMlQ" hash="2L9KLA">Upon further interview it became apparent that there were a number of commandments of which she was certainly aware but was not keeping. It takes more than fasting and prayer. We must begin again; we must repent—confess and forsake our sins. We must study the scriptures, yea, search the scriptures; we must keep the commandments of God, and keep them precisely. For the commandments are calculated to get us in condition so that we can receive light and truth, even intelligence, which is communication from God, our Father, which we so desperately need and which is the only thing of real worth we can take with us when we go.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/ignorance-is-expensive.p29" guid="a390d8d6-8360-43cf-b36a-2c38223204a1" pid="V_jLedmaL0SOtRq4nJ-2MA" hash="g90S1w">May I bear witness to you, my brethren and sisters, that what you have heard from this place in this conference is the mind of the Lord, the will of the Lord, and the word of the Lord for the salvation of his saints at this particular juncture in time, for he lives and speaks to his servants today. We must give heed to the word of the Lord; therefore, it is tremendously important that we give heed to these words, and work out our salvation with fear and trembling before him, as we precisely keep these commandments. May we do so, and may it be said of us when we depart that “he took with him a clean, free, enlightened and happy spirit, and a conscience void of offense to his fellowmen.” That this may be our happy state, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

It is interesting that about the same time, the <span class="emphasis">other side </span>announced that there would be professional football games on Monday nights. You might be surprised to know how many families tried to work family home evenings in between half time of the football games. Of course it cannot be done. It appears the prophet’s request required too great a sacrifice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/sacrifice-still-brings-forth-blessings.p2" guid="584c44ac-45f9-4709-a16d-279f1f9c2622" pid="XX80JJDkp0-K1Hy_c5U_kA" hash="jQNzng">In the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord sets forth the qualifications for the labors of the ministry. He says that they are “faith, hope, charity, and love, with an eye single to the glory of God.” The faith, hope, charity, and love we know something about. They are very important. But the eye single to the glory of God is probably the most important of those qualifications. Generally speaking, “an eye single to the glory of God” means sacrifice. It means that instead of endlessly doing what we want to do, we have to do what the Lord wants us to do, but we have to do it in his way when he wants us to do it. This, of course, is not the natural inclination of man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/sacrifice-still-brings-forth-blessings.p3" guid="a0d32061-5a83-440f-a081-c0266ee15214" pid="xMFaKbMs9EeW23C2mQxUjw" hash="ELIDJw">We hear much in the world today about “doing our own thing.” I doubt that this is really new. I think it has been going on since the beginning of time. Perhaps this is just a little different way of saying it. Certainly Lucifer did his own thing, contrary to the will of the Lord. Cain did his own thing, directly contrary to the counsel of his Heavenly Father. They were not concerned with what the Lord wanted them to do but rather only with what they wanted to do. Of course this kind of action has never been very profitable measured in terms of happiness, and happiness is the whole purpose for the existence of man. The prophet Lehi’s statement that “men are, that they might have joy” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.25" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:25</a>) is all-inclusive.</p>

I presume Abraham could not have received a more disagreeable commandment from his Heavenly Father. Still he arose immediately, took his son and the necessary firewood, and started for the designated place. He could not be diverted from his course until an angel of the Lord intervened to stay his hand. And what was the reward for such action? Hear the Lord’s statement to Abraham: “… because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:</p>

His great agony in the Garden I presume has never been approached and cannot be matched by human man. He in Gethsemane prayed, saying, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:39</a>.) The Master did not want to endure what was before him even though he knew this was the major purpose of his coming to earth—but he did what his Father had asked, and because he did, he holds “all power … in heaven and in earth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.18" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:18</a>) and has, as Paul records, become “the author and finisher of our faith” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.2" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:2</a>), and as many as receive him become his sons and daughters.</p>

The Prophet said, “An actual knowledge to any person, that the course of life which he pursues is according to the will of God, is essentially necessary to enable him to have that confidence in God without which no person can obtain eternal life … and unless they have an actual knowledge that the course they are pursuing is according to the will of God they will grow weary in their minds and faint … It was through this sacrifice, and this only, that God has ordained that men should enjoy eternal life; and it is through the medium of the sacrifice of all earthly things that men do actually know that they are doing the things that are well pleasing in the sight of God. …</p>

For doubt and faith do not exist in the same person at the same time; so that persons whose minds are under doubts and fears cannot have unshaken confidence; and where unshaken confidence is not there faith is weak; and where faith is weak the persons will not be able to contend against all opposition, tribulations, and afflictions which they will have to encounter in order to be heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ Jesus; and they will grow weary in their minds, and the adversary will have power over them and destroy them.” (Lectures on Faith, 1891 ed., 6:2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12.)</p>

All too often when we hear the word sacrifice we think of burnt offerings or one man laying down his life for another as the Master did for us all.

We want the whole world to know that we are. Sometimes we are accused of not being Christians, but such is not the case. In the words of the great prophet Nephi, “… we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:26</a>.) We look to Christ as the Author and Finisher of our faith. He is our Redeemer.</p>

They received his teachings. He ordained them and gave them authority to act for him in all things with respect to the salvation of mankind. He knew he was not going to remain upon the earth for very long, for he so stated: “… the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/20.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 20:28</a>.)</p>

This kind of communication is known as revelation, and those who receive it are designated prophets by God. In the beginning of his ministry, he chose twelve special witnesses, who were with him in mortality. But after his crucifixion, he chose others by revelation, who may not have known him in mortality. Certainly Paul was one of these.</p>

But over a time the church became corrupt. The members refused to follow the inspired counsel of the apostles. Paul wrote many letters trying to bring them back to the fold. Persecution became intense, and the apostles, who were prophets, were killed or otherwise taken from the earth. And when they were gone, the light of revelation went out. Even secular history records this period as the dark ages.</p>

He was but a lad in his fifteenth year. His name was Joseph Smith, Jr. God called upon him in a great vision in the year 1820. He spoke unto him from heaven and gave him commandments, and also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the whole world, and all this that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets: “The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh—</p>

It would seem this way, but such is not the Case. We can show that each principle that we teach is taught in the Holy Bible, which is a record of God’s dealings with his people, particularly the Hebrews and the Jews, generally speaking. But if all the Bibles on earth had been destroyed in the year 1830 (when this church was organized), it would still be organized exactly as it is organized today.</p>

I love them and they know it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p2" guid="24626e01-f132-4fc0-8b59-ca5fbc006ae1" pid="uvT3yMbWekyTJVMzVcuWPg" hash="cTZEaA">The story of Joseph, the son of Jacob who was called Israel, is a vivid representation of the great truth that “all things work together for good to [those] who” love God. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.28" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:28</a>.) Joseph always seemed to do the right thing; but still, more importantly, he did it for the right reason. And how very, very significant that is! Joseph was sold by his own brothers as a slave and was purchased by Potiphar, a captain of the guard of Pharaoh. But even as an indentured servant, Joseph turned every experience and all circumstances, no matter how trying, into something good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p3" guid="8ece641b-b042-430c-80a7-9383a30d2b10" pid="a2H5nxAK6UGd8TEjSvT2jw" hash="byK9WQ">This ability to turn everything into something good appears to be a godly characteristic. Our Heavenly Father always seems able to do this. Everything, no matter how dire, becomes a victory to the Lord. Joseph, although a slave and wholly undeserving of this fate, nevertheless remained faithful to the Lord and continued to live the commandments and made something very good of his degrading circumstances. People like this cannot be defeated, because they will not give up. They have the correct, positive attitude, and Dale Carnegie’s expression seems to apply: If you feel you have a lemon, you can either complain about how sour it is, or you can make a lemonade. It is all up to you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p4" guid="d6cf8a49-4e5f-4d7b-8627-55c59954cda3" pid="V7vlo-4rDkK6cV4q7KsIeg" hash="KJsJnw">“Failure ceases to exist in the face of persistence.” So, the Lord prospered Joseph, and his master saw that the Lord was with him and made Joseph overseer over all his house; and all that he had, he put in Joseph’s hands. So implicit was his trust in this remarkable young man that Potiphar did not bother to keep any accounting of his own possessions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p5" guid="36fee9c4-62ba-4bd5-9958-3dc29f2b0dc8" pid="aBerl_LwtEKCG0b3tM_9Jg" hash="kQ5CxA">Naturally, such a remarkable person would be enticing to the opposite sex, and so it was with Joseph. Potiphar’s wife, who, to say the most for her, was of very doubtful character, attempted to seduce Joseph; but Joseph was untouchable because of his trust and reliance on the Lord. He tried to reason with her, saying:</p>

But he did not; instead, his statement of why he could not submit to her demands revealed the real strength of this choice young man. He said: “… how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/39.9" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 39:9</a>.) With this statement Joseph showed that he was determined to do the right thing, but do it for the right reason. That reason: because he loved the Lord.</p>

Loyalty is akin to honesty; and if you are not honest, you are really not much good. You are no good to yourself because you lie to yourself. This is called rationalization, but it is really just lying. You are no good to your friends because they cannot trust you. You are no good to the Lord because he cannot use you—unless, of course, it would be as a bad example. If you make a mistake, all is not lost. You can always be used as a bad example.</p>

His reliance was upon the Lord. His trust was in the Lord, and his allegiance ran to the Lord.</p>

It is so vitally important that, I feel, if you do anything in righteousness for any other reason than you love the Lord, you are wrong—at least you are on very shaky ground. And, somewhere your reasons for acting in righteousness will not be strong enough to see you through. You will give way to expediency, or peer group pressure, or honor, or fame, or applause, or the thrill of the moment, or some other worldly reason. Unless your motives are built upon the firm foundation of love of the Lord, you will not be able to stand.</p>

There appears to be nothing in this life that is not subject to erosion, or decay, or just change for the sake of change—like the new automobile models each year. There is only one place where we can go and find consistency, and that is where Joseph went: to the Lord, for “he is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.” And the most important fact is that there is no place you can go where he is not. In the words of the psalmist,</p>

The scripture records that Joseph stoutly resisted the advances of Potiphar’s wife, but one day as he went into the house “to do his business,” it so happened that “there was none of the men of the house there within.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/39.11" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 39:11</a>.)</p>

Potiphar’s wife became particularly insistent, even to taking hold of his coat and attempting to draw him to her. But Joseph did the very best thing he could do under the circumstances. The scripture records, “… he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/39.12" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 39:12</a>.) Or, in today’s language—<span class="emphasis">he ran.</span></p>

This was such a time. I am sure that Joseph did not know he was going to be alone with her, or he would not have gone into the house. I have great faith in Joseph.</p>

We must avoid them. If we don’t, we will run the great risk of being overcome.</p>

I spent twenty-six years flying the navy’s airplanes. It was very exciting to see how close I could fly to the trees. This is called “flat hatting” in the navy, and it is extremely dangerous. When you are flying just high enough to miss the trees and your engine coughs once, you are in the trees.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/live-above-the-law-to-be-free.p26" guid="603e3bbc-733c-4561-99bd-00b88ac4cc88" pid="oKyCWOBk0EuMEaKN61HiMw" hash="IDCjOg">Now let’s pretend that the navy had a commandment—“Thou shalt not fly thy airplane in the trees.” As a matter of fact, they did have such a commandment. In order to really be free of the commandment, it becomes necessary for me to add a commandment of my own to the navy’s commandment, such as, “Thou shalt not fly thy airplane closer than 5,000 feet to the trees.” When you do this, you make the navy’s commandment of not flying in the trees easy to live, and the safety factor is tremendously increased.</p>

Rather, it is your own commandment, invented by you for your own self-preservation; and, if you are going to preach it, it should be expounded as such.</p>

Paul’s admonition that we avoid even the appearance of evil certainly represents an addition to the Lord’s commandment, which is, to “forsake all evil” and “entangle not yourselves in sin.” (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 98:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.86" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:86</a>.) But if we follow Paul’s admonition, we will find the Lord’s commandment much easier to live.</p>

A second definition is, “the attainment of wealth, favor, or eminence,” and surely this is the most commonly used definition today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p4" guid="9a18bdc9-1d11-4466-9135-1cb430a9299f" pid="eIVInZ13V0qRNz1MgRx6wg" hash="idUvfg">We are prone to apply the term <span class="emphasis">successful </span>to those who <span class="emphasis">look </span>prosperous or wealthy or appear to have scaled the pinnacle of accomplishment in their own particular profession. Whether a man be a doctor, lawyer, financier, builder, politician, an admiral or a general, an actor, an airline pilot, or an athlete, all these and many others have the term <span class="emphasis">success </span>applied to them. But is this really success?</p>

Some feel to be right is to be successful. Henry Clay said he would rather be right than president. Perhaps he felt successful: he ran for the presidency three times and failed all three times. “Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. After some years it can boast a long series of successes.” (Abner-Eschenbach.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p6" guid="6126e2c9-bc0e-4ca4-80d1-0c1313c3df7d" pid="K3YG5HMw1UuJZRUyc8Wp1A" hash="taYCLg">“The reasonable man will know that the actual magnitude of success obtained bears no real relation to the amount of pleasure that is conveyed; the man who becomes prime minister or wins a Nobel prize is not really more elated than he who secures a trophy for playing Ping Pong or wins a bronze medal for growing large chrysanthemums.” (Harold Necholson.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p7" guid="ef48d7c4-b09b-4746-94f0-0411d7b27681" pid="kxIXTPGdKEygS44F_VHaRg" hash="XJPDFg">The Lord doesn’t seem to measure success in terms of attainment of position or power or wealth. A prophet in the Book of Mormon (where, by the way, the most succinct and unvarnished truths can be found) said, “But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things. Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.24-25" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:24–25</a>.) If man is that he might have joy, then success to the Lord must include the attainment of real joy. On the basis of this definition, then, no one is really successful who is not happy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p8" guid="8ca97e59-ade3-4a7b-a124-55e971f12dbf" pid="a-Z54gWFfkmv9suzRCYVGQ" hash="YA9RGA">If this be the Lord’s definition, then there is precious little success in this world. Success in its practical application seems to be more a state of mind than anything else. Obviously, many people never make it because they are ungrateful. They are not thankful for what they have; therefore, they are unhappy and thus are not successful. I have never seen a happy person who was not thankful for what he had, to paraphrase the Prophet Joseph Smith, who stated that “doubt and faith cannot exist in the same person at the same time.” (6th Lecture on Faith.) It is also doubtful that success and unhappiness can exist in the same person at the same time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p9" guid="cb29f12e-f985-42f9-b747-ee106aedbae8" pid="1YfKXVwxCUaraNN9fCqOkA" hash="9qsmhw">Generally speaking, we are unhappy because we are dissatisfied, and this because we pursue after things that cannot make us happy, even if we obtain them. In the words of H. W. Beecher, “Success is full of promise till men get it, and then is as a last year’s nest, from which the bird has flown.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p10" guid="7a7d68c6-d7e3-4088-91db-d2f678620a32" pid="CZBmPT2gOk-YsV2-GSgQcA" hash="rEm7KQ">There is a great lesson to be learned here. Some think of success as obtaining “something for nothing” or the securing of a great bargain. The words of James Russell Lowell seem particularly applicable. He said, “Earth gets its price from what Earth gives us.” In order to be happy, it is particularly important that we learn that everything has its price and not expect something for nothing. This seems to be what earth life is all about—to teach us the lesson that as ye sow, so shall ye reap. We cannot receive something for nothing: on the contrary, we will pay for everything we receive. To continue with Lowell’s quote:</p>

We pursue after bubbles many times, thinking they will make us happy and that obtaining this particular bubble would make us successful. There are many, many bubbles for sale. This is another word for material possessions, which the world would have us believe are necessary to make us happy. We get the idea from modern advertising that happiness comes from the accumulation of material possessions. We must have a new house, a new car, or a snowmobile, or maybe even a boat.</p>

Christiansen tells an interesting story about his neighbor who bought a boat. He really couldn’t afford a boat; but he bought it anyway, because he had a credit card. In order to pay for the boat, he had to take a second job, which meant he had to work on Saturday. This, of course, left one day per week on which he could use the boat. When do you suppose that was? Yes, you are right—it was Sunday. But he loved his boat and invited Brother Christiansen over to admire it, saying, “Isn’t it beautiful? What shall we name it?” (Now, you see, it is a member of the family—it has to have a name.)</p>

Now, please don’t misunderstand me—I have nothing against boats. I have a friend who has a boat, and he calls his boat “Never on Sunday,” which, of course, is a better name for a boat.</p>

There are too many people today who are so miserable in this life that they cannot stand themselves. They are seeking any avenue of escape—to get out of this life, even to taking their own lives. Many of these people have material possessions heaped up in piles all around them—and many of their associates would say they were successful. But material possessions have not made them happy.</p>

And then he added significantly, “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.33" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:33</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p16" guid="76160818-a75f-4878-96ad-46933b177a27" pid="lTiLFU13e0iy_P64MIYLxA" hash="_5nEGA">A young man came to see me recently who had been called by the Lord to fill a mission. He was a fine young man—handsome, strong, sharp—but he said he didn’t want to go on his mission because there were other things that he would rather do. As we visited he told me that one thing he would rather do was drive a dune buggy. We talked about the relative merits of trading eternal life for a dune buggy; and he decided, perhaps, that was not exactly a fair exchange. I suggested to him that if he still wanted to drive a dune buggy after he had filled his mission, the Lord would probably let him do so, since the Lord always grants unto men “according to their desire.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.4" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:4</a>.)</p>

The only real joy and happiness we can know here upon this earth, as well as in the eternities, will come through obedience to the Lord’s commandments. Alma’s statement that “wickedness never was happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>) is still valid. Again he has said, “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.17" class="scriptureRef">John 13:17</a>.) He did not say, but could have said, “Unhappy are ye if you don’t.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p18" guid="0f33695b-9a3f-4fce-a2a8-5ff2a044e9a1" pid="cNyYz5eV30CY3PsKw6xz0w" hash="VK41rg">Sometimes young people get upset because they do not know what profession to follow. They feel it is so vital that they must have a revelation from the Lord, so they will know what to do with their lives. Generally speaking, I’m not sure that the Lord really cares what we choose as a vocation—whether we are a plumber or a librarian—so long as we keep the commandments of God. Of course, it is sometimes easier to keep the commandments when we are happy in our professions, and to that extent it is important that we do something we enjoy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p19" guid="1c058b2c-8401-45b8-80e3-e60dcf850964" pid="IK-NgcUydE-4d1wJ2sY6Ug" hash="xokBYA">The Lord, through living prophets as well as prophets in earlier times, has made it abundantly clear where real joy can be found, and he has placed the emphasis for real joy squarely on the family. President David O. McKay’s statement that “no other success can compensate for failure in the home” will forever live in our hearts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p20" guid="85a416c0-d147-436c-b7c8-1edd9d240035" pid="nKTIMCh_PUi2_hjQnYH_YQ" hash="IsvLjQ">President Harold B. Lee uttered an equally significant statement when he said, “Now, you husbands, remember that the most important of the Lord’s work that you will ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home.” (First Presidency Directive, April 14, 1969.) These statements and others update and reemphasize the Lord’s injunction to Adam and Eve in the Garden when he commanded them to “be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.28" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:28</a>.) Why should they do this? “That ye may have joy and rejoicing in your posterity.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p21" guid="b26b262c-b57c-4eb7-914a-5f8fae23f969" pid="CWsM4zGnfEuD0pRQDLOSXg" hash="SjJycQ">The Lord gives no commandments to his children that are not calculated to make them happy and thus successful. Therefore, he has added to the basic commandment of “be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth,” the reason for so doing: that you may have joy and rejoicing in your posterity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p22" guid="44f456c1-bab3-4382-a05f-645431270f8d" pid="9aGAOAPkKkCWN-HpUuC9Vw" hash="WSeuGw">Lehi’s statement that “man is that he might have joy” takes on even more significance in light of this and the foregoing statement made by living prophets. And the Prophet Joseph Smith also added to this statement when he said, “Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it. …” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, </span>p. 255.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p23" guid="da1065d7-bad4-4f6a-872c-92f56816d9c0" pid="1l621URV40SV1Qwt5u6jsg" hash="ikhDcg">From what we have considered, that path inevitably leads to the altar of the temple. I have, many times, seen the Spirit lift choice young people who had come to the temple to become a family; and it seemed to me in these instances that the temple became a “heavenly family house,” the sealing room became a “heavenly family room,” and the altar of the temple became a “heavenly family altar.” For as they knelt there, they were joined by the Lord through his priesthood for all eternity and thus were made “one,” a family, in the Lord. The importance of this ordinance cannot be overemphasized, for if we raise a family outside the temple, we may lose it. We have no promise with respect to the continuation of family ties after we leave this life unless the covenants have been solemnized at the altar of the temple. Otherwise, it is only “until death do ye part.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p24" guid="5dc699be-9bbc-4563-bf9e-0d53d6152d43" pid="UrSyxV_eV0KqDwK2m3f_9Q" hash="8q2e3g">God is the Heavenly Father of the human family. He is obviously concerned with families. If you doubt it, look around you. We are all his children—we belong to him. For this reason, he has commanded that a house be built for his family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p25" guid="e2775c60-5673-4682-a917-2bb307cbbee8" pid="n1XkItTY_kqeKDvkjMBSpA" hash="9i2Yjg">Our heavenly and eternal Father wants us to be happy, so he has established and ordained families as the basic unit of his church. Yes—and also of exaltation in his celestial kingdom. Happiness seems vital to success, or is it that success is vital to happiness? Either way. I do not believe I have ever seen happy parents who had unhappy children; and, conversely, I have never seen unhappy children who had happy parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p26" guid="cc68cf84-b1c9-4cb9-9b3f-272ffa0b5795" pid="_HvGBawN80SSjOqPiCdbFg" hash="bu0D4w">So, then, what is required of parents, who have been so joined in the Lord’s house, concerning their children? First, they are to love each other—this is so vital; then they are to welcome choice spirits from the Lord and teach them to love the Lord, keep his commandments, and walk uprightly before him. When they do this, they have given these children the foundation for attaining real joy here in this world and in the world to come. For they will have eternal life, which is the ultimate success, and they will be made rich. “… Behold, he that has eternal life is rich.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p27" guid="c579d3cb-85ff-4ca8-b199-39c82e60425c" pid="Z03k7NKzek-j7dR6sS-bvw" hash="RIjYBw">May this be our goal, and may we be willing to pay the price to obtain it and not be taken in by all the misinformation which is abroad in the land today about birth control, abortion and sex education, and other Satan-inspired philosophies; that we may look to the Lord and follow his living prophets and oracles today. I pray that we will, for I bear witness that God our Heavenly Father lives, and that he hears and answers prayers, and that he is concerned about his children, so much so that he sent his Only Begotten Son that we might have immortality and eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/success-a-journey-or-a-destination.p28" guid="2bc239c5-d3d6-484c-90b7-27cfd8e3ade2" pid="P5D66Cmn2EOyfWiosI95yQ" hash="Bwbc5g">May we follow him, and may we keep his commandments, and may we be successful, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

The difference is <span class="emphasis">faith, </span>and what <span class="emphasis">is </span>faith? Of course, there are many definitions of faith, but one definition is “a strong belief plus <span class="emphasis">action.</span>” It is not perfect knowledge (as Alma explains in Alma 32), but real faith lets a man <span class="emphasis">act </span>as if he knows it is true when he really doesn’t.</p>

The Lord’s formula for receiving the Spirit, then, is to get on our knees and communicate with him.

In order to get the spirit of a bishop, he must get on his knees and communicate with the Lord and then get up off his knees and go and do precisely what he has told the Lord he would do.

And while the spirit of a fisherman is not altogether bad, it is not the spirit that he needs to conduct a priesthood executive committee meeting.

He had dedicated his life to the quest. He was young, handsome, and strong, clothed in bright and shining armor, mounted on a gallant white charger. As he crossed the drawbridge riding out into the world, a beggar (who was a leper) put up his hand to him, begging alms. The young knight reached into his pouch, took out a gold coin and flung it to the beggar as he rode on, but he really did not give the beggar very much because no one would accept even a gold coin from a leper.</p>

He did, however, learn a lot, and at the close of his life he was returning to his castle, no longer young. He is now shrunken with age. His armor is no longer bright; his mount is no longer a charger but just a tired old gray horse. As he was about to cross the drawbridge into the castle, once again a beggar put up his hand begging for alms. This time Sir Launfal stopped, got down from his horse, reached into his knapsack and took out the only thing he had—a crust of bread. He then dipped his cup into the stream and gave the crust of bread and one cup of cold water to the beggar.</p>

He said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-strength-of-testimony.p3" pid="HAysO0s6vE2BWNKxC06BGA" hash="CKnMLw">“The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> p. 121.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-strength-of-testimony.p4" pid="Hn6J2RAfiUmTENDUZpwdAg" hash="8QV9zA">Testimony is a sure knowledge of the truth of the gospel received by revelation from the Holy Ghost, as President Romney outlined this morning. As such, it is vital to the soul who would have communion with the Creator. Testimony is vitally important, <span class="emphasis">but</span> men are not saved by virtue of their testimony alone, although it is the beginning of real spiritual progress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-strength-of-testimony.p5" pid="8xUO6BBo10moe3OV4RWTvg" hash="ZvNPhA">It is a common error to feel that testimony means full conversion. We many times equate testimony with a man’s faith. We say, “He has great faith,” meaning that he has a strong testimony, or we say, “He has a strong testimony,” meaning that he has great faith. However, I don’t believe the two are always synonymous. Faith is based on knowledge; it is a hope in that which is not seen which is true. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.21" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:21</a>.) Testimony is revealed knowledge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-strength-of-testimony.p6" pid="lZ4msna3WkC1gis3HUHIFg" hash="wjp8FQ">Bearing testimony has to do with bearing witness to that which we know to be true. Much of what we call testimony bearing is not really testimony at all—it is a statement or expression of public thanks. It is good to be thankful, but public thanks is not testimony. Testimony comes from the Holy Ghost. The Spirit of Christ, which John testifies is “the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.9" class="scriptureRef">John 1:9</a>), will lead a man to Christ and help him get a testimony, and if followed will lead to baptism in Jesus Christ’s church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-strength-of-testimony.p7" pid="ANf9xXLAR0uN7ZqXVu70RA" hash="-5qyfw">Many people feel they receive a witness that Jesus is the Christ, and they think this alone saves them. They say they are “saved.” Of course, it does not. It didn’t save a third of the hosts of heaven. James records, “… the devils also believe, and tremble.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/2.19" class="scriptureRef">James 2:19</a>.) What do they believe? That Jesus is the Christ; in fact, they know it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-strength-of-testimony.p8" pid="6rnTBqjnYkiOiI2eyW52MQ" hash="4x93Qw">Peter had a testimony that Jesus is the Christ, which he bore, and it surely came from the Lord, for the Master said, “… flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.17" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:17</a>.) It is very doubtful that Peter was at that time converted, because he could not admit that he knew the Lord Jesus Christ when he felt his own life was in danger. Later the Master confirmed that Peter lacked conversion when, just before going to his agony and death on the cross, he said to Peter, “… when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:32</a>.) Peter’s testimony or knowledge that Jesus was the Christ did not “save” him from denying the Master—probably because he was not converted. He did not follow the Lord at the peril of his own life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-strength-of-testimony.p9" pid="F4wiOnuvs0aRKEB3anbX1g" hash="ZFaxMg">When we are converted, we sustain and follow the Lord’s anointed servants; we find ourselves in agreement with them. This is one of the real marks of conversion. Many men with testimonies have been unable to do this. In this dispensation, to name a few, Martin Harris, David Whitmer, and Oliver Cowdery (the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon) and Thomas B. Marsh (the first president of the Quorum of the Twelve) had this very problem. They refused to sustain the Lord’s anointed servant, and it led to their expulsion from his church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-strength-of-testimony.p10" pid="aIzgLdTpnkOdVeQ_M3pjFg" hash="Cpkrrg">Conversion implies a change; as King Benjamin says, it means putting “off the natural man,” which is selfish, conceited, impatient, intemperate, disobedient, and rebellious, so that a person becomes “a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord.” This would mean becoming even “as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-strength-of-testimony.p12" pid="t424AkZO2kauXcVMnJFtxQ" hash="6DSlxw">Jesus was committed completely to doing the will of his Father, and he was unequivocal in his counsel to us that we follow him in doing the will of the Father. Those who are truly converted desire to do the will of the Father. How are we to know his will? Surely it can come direct from the Father by revelation, but it seldom does. When he has authorized servants to act for him, generally we get it through his servants—the president of the Church, the General Authorities, the stake president, the bishop, the branch president, or in other words, the Lord’s anointed servants. Thus the clear necessity of sustaining the Lord’s anointed servants in righteousness. If we are truly converted, we will find ourselves in harmony with them. This is a sign of true conversion; this is doing the will of the Father.</p>

Generally it is the Lord Jesus Christ who speaks. He is Jehovah of the Old Testament. He has authority to speak for his Father. There are, however, some recorded instances where there is no doubt who is speaking—it is the Father. His voice was heard at the baptism of Jesus by John in the River Jordan. It was heard again at the Mount of Transfiguration. It was heard again in 1820 in the grove near Palmyra, New York, by the Prophet Joseph Smith—always either introducing his Son Jesus Christ or bearing testimony of him.</p>

Some of these are in the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon is that book about which the Prophet Joseph Smith bore his testimony: it is “the most correct of any book on earth, … and a man [will] get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.” (<span class="emphasis">Documentary History of the Church,</span> vol. 4, p. 461.)</p>

This is extremely serious. Rebellion is the opposite of obedience and leads to expulsion from the kingdom. This is what happened to Lucifer. He refused to sustain the Lord in that he would not follow and do the things which he had seen the Father do before him.</p>

We came to this earth to win, and we will win if we stick with the Lord, because the Lord is not going to lose. He can’t lose.

The world seems to delight in jumping from one theory to the next, but that which was thought and purported to be the hope of the world only yesterday often turns out to become the bane of the world today. A miracle drug used to treat the discomforts of pregnancy was found to cause deformity in the offspring. The “war to end wars” merely spawned the next conflict. We seem to be eternally searching for answers in <span class="emphasis">new programs.</span> But of course there is no answer in a new program. We’re looking for secret potions to prolong life, maintain youth, end suffering, eliminate fatigue, and abolish work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-roots-of-mormonism.p2" pid="JywN6qwaTUCDY5wixHejyQ" hash="hLX76g">Of course, if the truth were understood, the things that we’re trying to get rid of are the very things we ought to have; suffering is essential. “Learned he obedience by the things which he suffered” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/5.8" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 5:8</a>); and how great it is to be able to get tired enough to sleep soundly. The glory of work cannot be overemphasized. The satisfaction of a difficult task successfully completed or accomplished is one of the greatest satisfactions that we know in this life. The fulfillment of old age, looking back on a full life, the serenity of understanding gained by long experience make old age a golden, glorious time of life.</p>

But there is no magic in programs. It matters not from whence they come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-roots-of-mormonism.p4" pid="ZRNGIU10GEaSBkbtlPXOqA" hash="ehTqqg">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is being lionized today in many quarters. Articles like “Utah’s Shining Oasis” in <span class="emphasis">National Geographic</span> (Apr. 1975, pp. 440–73) and “When the Saints Go Singing In” in the <span class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest</span> (Apr. 1975, pp. 45–50) make the Church look <span class="emphasis">almost</span> as good as it really is. Also, the sincerest form of flattery has other churches copying our Church programs. The family home evening program is being copied by other churches, even down to using the same manual. There is a feeling that they can have the same results if they use the same program, but it will not work. The vitality of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not in the programs of the Church but in the doctrines of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-roots-of-mormonism.p5" pid="8BG-skaFA0y1lyoNT53ttw" hash="TGCf5A">I have a very good friend who served as a Congregational minister for over 26 years. He had one of the largest churches on Long Island, New York, at one time. He became acquainted with the Mormons by visiting Salt Lake City and receiving visits from Latter-day Saint missionaries in his home. He developed a great admiration for the programs of the Church, primarily <span class="emphasis">because of</span> the fruits he saw that were produced by the Church. So he thought to borrow these programs and adopt them into his own church, which he tried to do. But he found that they did not work. His statement to me was:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-roots-of-mormonism.p6" pid="xWKDY75XqECmYykpGEDvxw" hash="kfcbqA">“It was somewhat of a jolt to discover that the genius of Mormonism was in its theology, not its methodology, and that the amazing vitality of the Church sprang from the commitment of its members to the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ received by revelation. It became obvious that <span class="emphasis">one could not have the fruits of Mormonism without its roots.</span>” (John F. Heidenreich, “It May Change Your Life.”)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-roots-of-mormonism.p7" pid="YFOGwcFaf0yRmv3eHZfUyA" hash="_MHWiw">I am convinced that others who are attempting the same thing today will ultimately arrive at the same conclusion. The family home evening program, the youth activity program, young adult program, building programs, welfare programs, and Relief Society programs will not produce for others. The programs will not work for other churches. The magic is not in the program; it is in the theology. We can help them set up the programs, but we cannot guarantee them success.</p>

The programs are inspired of the Lord, but only to those who know where they came from, who know why they are here, and who know where they are going after they leave this mortal life. These are those who have a testimony. In other words, those who know that God is our Father know that we are begotten sons and daughters made eternally in his image, and also know that because he is our Father, we not only call him Father but we expect him to help us to become as he is, realizing that children become like their parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-roots-of-mormonism.p9" pid="WRwRLDGOOkyNdowunv0uvw" hash="6eufYA">Those who have a testimony know that the Son, Jesus Christ, is our elder brother. He is a god; however, he is not his own Father but a son of the Father, and the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind; the Mediator between God and man. There is no magic or confusion or mystery in this.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-roots-of-mormonism.p10" pid="pBQRdRDXVUm0mwXmpdWM-g" hash="1EiqdA">Those who have a testimony know that God our Father doesn’t leave us without guidance on this earth today but has given us a living prophet to reveal the mind of the Lord and the word of the Lord and the will of the Lord for his children today.</p>

Therefore, he has once again given authority to man on earth to act for him, and by this authority or priesthood man has authority to baptize, to lay on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, to heal the sick, cast out devils, speak with new tongues, and, in general, show forth the signs that Jesus said would always follow the believers. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/16.17-18" class="scriptureRef">Mark 16:17–18</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:19</a>.) When these truths are not only believed but indelibly etched upon the heart of a man, woman, or child by the Holy Ghost, then the programs that the Lord established on the earth to allow his children to grow in light and knowledge and experience become a living, vital part of the pathway to immortality and eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-roots-of-mormonism.p13" pid="JmZI1Gr1jkmriUWubjlc2Q" hash="ie7HbA">These programs do not run by themselves. They are made to work by people, and every program requires sacrifice, just as Elder McConkie has so eloquently said. It seems we are eternally having to do that which we may not particularly want to do to bring to pass the purposes of God among his children on earth. The real secret of the success of the Lord’s program here on earth, or anywhere else for that matter, is sacrifice.</p>

If Joseph Smith’s claims are true, that God the Father and the Son did appear to him and did in fact talk to him and give him commandments for all mankind; if a heavenly messenger, Moroni (an angel of the Lord), did visit him and deliver an ancient record written on gold plates containing the fulness of the gospel as delivered by Jesus Christ himself to the ancient inhabitants of this land of North and South America; if John the Baptist did return on the fifteenth of May, 1829, and restore the authority to baptize and have it accepted by God; if Peter, James, and John did return to restore the Melchizedek Priesthood with authority to perform all ordinances and bind on earth and therefore bind in heaven just as though Jesus had done it himself in person; I say, if these things are true, then everyone should know about it, for they were done for the blessing of <span class="emphasis">all</span> God’s children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-roots-of-mormonism.p17" pid="zZaVSlqodUy-FkKqAY6cng" hash="OCrxfg">Many of the three and one-half million Latter-day Saints bear witness that they know these claims are true, and because they know it, they live their lives in harmony with the directions that come from the living prophet of God. When he advises them to hold family home evening, approximately 500,000 Latter-day Saint families gather their children about them every week to talk about the goodness of the Lord to them, their love for him, for their neighbor, and for each other. They strive to live so as to secure the blessings of a kind, loving Heavenly Father to themselves and their children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-roots-of-mormonism.p18" pid="MViX_g6PbkWEMC-Quy3w4g" hash="CNPtzA">Tithing has been an integral part of the Lord’s program since the days of Abraham and before. Thus, the Bible scriptures contain abundant evidence of this eternal principle. And so, all churches that accept the Bible as their sacred record should live this principle, but none even approach that which is the norm in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

Surely not for monetary reward (they pay their own way), not to secure position or power or worldly acclaim, but only to share the truth of the message of the restoration—the roots of Mormonism—with the children of our Heavenly Father. I ask, why do they do it? They do it because they know they have the answer to all the world’s problems, <span class="emphasis">particularly man’s inhumanity to man.</span></p>

We have transportation and communication facilities that boggle the mind. We can walk on the moon, send deep probes into space, and look closely at faraway planets; we can produce food in quantities and qualities never before possible. We have a distribution system which assures freshness and nutrition of fresh-picked fruits and vegetables in the middle of the winter. We have mastered the art of making and preserving physical things, but we are unable to control the passions and desires of man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p3" pid="Z5AHIyPpoEaQQiFoWP1XEw" hash="yNCPuw">Man’s inhumanity to man makes daily advances, and the man-made efforts that are proffered to solve the problems of inequity between a man and his neighbor seem only to make the situation worse. The great welfare debacle in this and other countries is only now coming to light. For instance, New York City is currently facing a tremendous financial crisis as reported in <span class="emphasis">Newsweek</span> magazine of August 4, 1975, which states that fully 22 percent of this city’s total budget goes for public welfare. (“New York’s Last Gasp,” p. 24.) This is more than is spent on police protection, health or hospitals, or education. More than a million New Yorkers are now receiving welfare payments, and the number is rising daily.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p4" pid="68_qf2qViEy7mW4QylDYJw" hash="65z50g">The food stamp program which was initially designed to assist the poor to share in the marvelous productivity of this nation at a time of agricultural surplus is totally out of hand, a monster that threatens us all. Over $6.6 billion will be spent for this program in fiscal year 1976. That represents over one-half of the total U.S. Department of Agriculture budget. Over 19 million people—almost one American out of eleven—are now getting food stamps.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p5" pid="ocf52cvrzkufqZpUC7V0mQ" hash="JjrTdQ">Recent findings in the program reveal errors in 56.1 percent of the cases investigated: 12.2 percent of the households receiving food stamps were completely ineligible; 37.9 percent were issued too many or too few stamps, and 6 percent were incompletely registered. Of the food stamps issued, 15.2 percent went to ineligible households. Carl B. Williams, Deputy U.S. Commissioner of Welfare, says, “As it now stands, the system is in such a mess that the Government has practically abdicated its responsibility for seeing that the money gets to people who really need it. In effect,” he said, “the Government is giving away billions of dollars with virtually no controls at all.” (“Food Stamps—Out of Control?” <span class="emphasis">U.S. News</span><span class="emphasis">and World Report,</span> Sept. 1, 1975, p. 12.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p6" pid="kwMggyKUI06VzMd0ydkFOA" hash="cpl5sQ">Welfare lists grow daily, and we now face the startling fact that we have third and fourth generations growing up on welfare. They have known nothing else. These people even strike and picket to get more sooner. Candidates for public office seem to be trying to out-promise each other in giveaway programs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p7" pid="hGZAXp8pjkSL8AFy9NQH8g" hash="LAMPAQ">As a commentator said some time ago, “Three men were running for office. The first promised $20 every Thursday. His opponent promised $40 every Tuesday, twice as much two days earlier.

As long as we in America have the mistaken idea that because we are born we have everything coming to us without effort, Americans cannot solve this problem.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p9" pid="Nfca9v9zckCkHd-fyffPeA" hash="kd-e1A">Certainly the Lord speaks out strongly against people who are able who won’t work but still expect to be fed. He said, “Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:42</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p11" pid="pCqNLxX_CUuEcvEDcuJAxA" hash="7p8ang">Why are these conditions seemingly worsening by the hour? Because their solutions are not based on true principles revealed by God through his prophet. We have a living prophet of God on earth. He has spoken this morning in clear, unmistakable terms. He is not a prophet just for Latter-day Saints. He is the Lord’s oracle for the whole world. God has solutions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p12" pid="OxXNSmM180O5ql8eoasTKQ" hash="BNW7KA">As the Lord said of the Prophet Joseph Smith, so he also says of the Prophet Spencer W.

There is only one real road to safety and that is to hearken unto the voice of the prophet of God, because man in his wisdom cannot solve the problems which he is facing today anymore than he could when Paul wrote to the Corinthians. He said, “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 3:19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p16" pid="J5RudgxvbkOaHrcZ4RYpKw" hash="gpDPFw">And again, “But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.14" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p17" pid="AlnLsSlQXEa39KhY-nl6cw" hash="hM56LA">Can man’s knowledge and intellect supplant the revealed word of God? Do we really believe we can prosper by letting this land, established by the hand of God, be run by those who know not God and acknowledge not his hand in all things? There have always been ungodly men who fancied their wisdom superior to any other. Why should we, who have testimonies of the reality of God burning within us, submit ourselves to the wisdom of men, which has always been foolishness to God?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p18" pid="MNzkkEcudU2LX2waeyOUrA" hash="K0Pcxg">The Lord has made plain that we have a solemn obligation to choose good and honest men to represent us in secular governmental service. It is obvious that a man’s spiritual and moral qualifications should be considered before his academic record or his oratorical ability. It is a sobering thought that whatever laws the elected enact, we are obligated then to obey. The Lord said, “And now, verily I say unto you concerning the laws of the land, it is my will that my people should observe to do all things whatsoever I command them.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p24" pid="oY-p3Om940ufexz_vjhUSw" hash="AWuOwA">There are examples of the foolishness of men’s programs all around us. At the October conference of 1974, Elder Neal A. Maxwell uttered a truth upon which I have reflected much in recent weeks as successive failures of government programs have become more evident. He said, “The living of one protective principle of the gospel is better than a thousand compensatory government programs—which programs are, so often, like ‘straightening the deck chairs on the Titanic.’” (“Why Not Now?” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1974, p. 12.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p25" pid="qQA2JPV9Tk62-cuwmVXiZA" hash="aVD6Kw">For instance, let us take one simple principle of the gospel, which we call the Word of Wisdom. This revelation is recorded in the 89th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. And we won’t even consider all of this revelation, but only a part of it, only that part where the Lord warns “that inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good. … And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.5-7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89:5–7</a>.) This is a prohibition against drinking alcoholic beverages. If those in the United States would follow the Lord’s counsel by living this divine law, we would be able to feed the starving masses of the world. I cite an Associated Press quote of Harvard University nutritionist Dr. Jean Mayer. Said he, “Every year we convert in this nation into alcoholic liquor enough grain to feed 50 million people in the starving nations.” In the United States there are 95 million drinkers, of whom 10 million are confirmed alcoholics. These 10 million alcoholics in the United States cost this nation $10 billion a year counted in lost time, slow downs in work, illnesses, mistakes resulting in spoiled materials, domestic problems, and the rest of the attendant evils that go with alcoholism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p26" pid="UUCN9OHjIUWiHoIdDZ2dhA" hash="Hn33AQ">Also, it has been proven that alcoholism shortens the life of every alcoholic from 10 to 12 years; 250,000 new alcoholics are added to this total every year. The Connecticut state mental health commissioner reports that 40 percent of the cases in the state mental health hospitals are attributed directly to alcohol. Superior Judge John A. Starbaro of Chicago has said that “75 percent of all the divorce cases I have heard resulted from alcohol.” Alcohol is responsible for one-half of the total traffic deaths in the United States. There are 25,000 persons killed every year on the highways in the U.S. It might be interesting to note that we had 57,000 American servicemen killed in the Vietnam War. This total is nearly duplicated every two years on America’s highways.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p27" pid="p501TQc-DE-hn7Z5hrJ1uw" hash="cxBJ9A">There has been much said about increasing the safety of automobiles, and much has been done. No doubt there are still some improvements to expect, but no matter what we do, there is no way to make a car safe enough for a drunk to drive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p28" pid="De4kQdbqykiBxd5dk2ofjg" hash="do1yiQ">A U.S. Government report issued by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare recently said, “Alcoholic beverages drain the national economy of $15 billion every year.” This is nearly three times the total given to religious and charitable causes. Living this simple principle of the Word of Wisdom would enable us to feed the starving masses of the world. What is man’s solution to this problem of starvation? It is pretty well summarized in this clipping that I took from the newspaper recently. It is datelined Singapore. It says that “parents who insist on having more than two children will lose tax benefits, face discrimination in public housing and pay more maternity costs, the government has announced.” Earlier the health ministry said that some discriminatory measures will be taken against new additions to large families in 9 1/2 months. “For the Singapore of the 1970s,” it said, “the third child is luxury. The fourth and fifth are antisocial acts.” The new measures include vigorous family planning campaigns coupled with sterilization and abortion programs. “The government hopes to reduce the natural increase in the birth rate to less than one percent by 1980.” (“Family Size Labels a Guy,” <span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> Oct. 25, 1972, p. A9.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p29" pid="BuTBDkoP0Eas8n19hxig6w" hash="LEkflw">And so, this is man’s solution to the problem—birth control, sterilization, and abortion to destroy the unborn children. But you can be assured that this is not the Lord’s solution. Hear the words of a living prophet as you heard reiterated this morning:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p30" pid="QfcfWqaxtEK-EkquDZvKNw" hash="mZMozg">“Much is being said,” said the prophet, “in the press and in the pulpit concerning abortion. This Church of Jesus Christ opposes abortion and counsels all members <span class="emphasis">not</span> to submit to nor participate in any abortion, in any way, for convenience or to hide sins.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p31" pid="XMue7exzJ0eFipmdNfPayA" hash="bQN-AA">“Abortion must be considered one of the most revolting and sinful practices in this day. … To interfere with any of the processes in the procreation of offspring is to violate one of the most sacred of God’s commandments.” (Spencer W. Kimball, “Why Call Ye Me Lord, Lord, and Do Not the Things Which I Say?” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1975, p. 7.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p32" pid="0mNWkDZGlEKt7sLwj5Ta0Q" hash="QsIL2Q">All of these man-made solutions remind us very much of the cartoon which appeared recently in a national magazine. It depicted a department store clerk showing a weird kind of Tinker Toy to a mother. The clerk remarked, “Madam, this toy will prepare your child for modern living. It will teach him about life. No matter how you put it together, it still won’t work.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p33" pid="4eNTnE8zLUWLB-hcTRJJoA" hash="dAvTmw">Certainly we are witnessing this kind of folly today. The programs devised by men, without the light of the Lord, will not work. They never have. They are like straightening the deck chairs on the Titanic. What is the answer? It was given by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he was asked how he governed such a great and diverse people as the Latter-day Saints. He said, “I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.” (As quoted by John Taylor, <span class="emphasis">Millennial Star</span> 13:339.) The real answer is expanded missionary effort—teach more people more truth, and they will improve their own lives. Where the gospel is lived, error gives way to truth; idleness becomes productive service; hate and envy become love. Children become blessings; virtue becomes its own reward; and life becomes sacred, a probation to see if we will do “all things whatsoever the Lord God commands us.” (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.25" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:25</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-worlds-greatest-need.p34" pid="Y2uh8supOEa1QDJTsc9Qdw" hash="WuHN_Q">All that is needed is to hearken unto the voice of him whom the Lord has chosen to give a clear sound of the trumpet so that all might prepare for the battle. May the world have eyes that see, and ears that hear, and hearts that understand that they may be converted (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.15" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 13:15</a>), for which I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Reverend Novak and his wife had been born, baptized, raised, confirmed, and married in the Lutheran Church. It was with a sense of pride on the part of his parents and a sense of duty on his own part that he went through two Lutheran private colleges and a Lutheran theological graduate school to become a pastor in the American Lutheran Church. For nearly fourteen years he and his wife served in the Lutheran Church and endeavored to find truth and spiritual peace. During that period, from all external appearances, they were able to attain a level of income, style of life, social stratum, and educational prestige which left little to be desired. With such stability and high approval from family, friends, and supervisors, it could be said “they had it made.” Yet they were not satisfied. They had haunting insecurity in their souls that something very basic and important was missing in their lives. They could not be satisfied.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p3" pid="jqgzkMhK4UaPuDtnVEYBNg" hash="g36wZQ">The soul that is honest in heart must search.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p4" pid="n07VMO_8BUChUJpuRXe_Bg" hash="i-wu1g">In Reverend Novak’s words, “As I look back on my life and experience, I realize my dissatisfaction stemmed from a number of areas. [First] I had a deep and negative reaction to my association with my fellow pastors. The strong and seemingly overwhelming stress on church politics, self-advancement, personal glory, financial achievement, and congregational statistics made me feel that true spirituality was seriously lacking.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p5" pid="4d2Emhl5HEuJbF-txP-uDg" hash="7GqBUw">“[Second] I had deep theological concerns—the order of worship service seemed cold, impersonal, and unimaginative. The great stress on salvation by grace and minimization on works was to me a scriptural contradiction. On contemplating scripture I found that the ‘works’ passages far exceeded the ‘grace’ passages.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p6" pid="otejHbStAEeq1WrH_ibPSw" hash="OXq6pw">“I found myself recoiling at the indifferent reaction of my church leadership to the virgin birth, the creation, the wide acceptance and use of loose translations of scripture and the general lack of response to basic Christian morals.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p7" pid="Vh0JgTn7jk-tWk_LSt3cNw" hash="RgLMrg">“Was God really dead, or had He gone into retirement and ceased to care about His creation? Why did He sink into strange and sudden silence with the last word in the Bible?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p8" pid="YxBJZatzCEynVOgTOw9tBw" hash="WGmczg">On September 1, 1968, Reverend Novak and his family moved to Broomfield, Colorado, where he was made pastor of the Lutheran Church of Hope, a very prestigious and desirable assignment. From all outward appearances it left nothing to be desired, but there was something desperately wrong. Something was missing: there was a feeling of spiritual hollowness in his heart and it was shared equally by his wife, Alice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p9" pid="eQJpMQuQO0CySjO7426wow" hash="u_KQUw">Alice was a music educator and in Broomfield she had a number of Latter-day Saint students. She could not help but notice something very special about them. She reported to her husband that she had asked one of her Mormon students if Mormons were Christian. Of course, Reverend Novak knew well the Lutheran position that Mormons were non-Christian. The little Mormon girl boldly stated that Mormons most definitely <span class="emphasis">were</span> Christian.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p10" pid="yIgdkXFRR0iRvnGsGzRMnw" hash="MaRGvg">Alice had been touched by the young girl’s testimony. Next came an invitation from the family of one of the piano students to attend the Broomfield Ward open house. The young student’s family had resisted because they did not think it appropriate to send such an invitation to a Lutheran pastor. But this little girl persisted to the point that the parents reluctantly consented.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p11" pid="1Zyzpf4eSUOvIlq5Fbk-Ag" hash="gldJFw">On the appointed day Alice was unavailable to attend the open house and Reverend Novak was hosting a regional meeting of the Lutheran Church of Hope. As the time for the open house arrived he had a strange and overpowering urge to leave the Lutheran meeting and attend. <span class="emphasis">He yielded.</span></p>

I shall never forget it. From the chapel we were led to the baptismal font by a young priest who explained baptism according to the theology of the Latter-day Saints. This mature presentation by such a young man made a great impression, because I had seriously questioned the Lutheran theology of baptism for years. I sensed that what this young man said was true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p14" pid="MXxXIwAlNEOXfYh-lgUYhw" hash="J8fI-g">“We then went to the Relief Society room where we were given a beautiful and intelligent presentation. To hear a lovely woman give such a positive and strong testimony was heartwarming to me. We were then ushered into a seminary room to view the film <span class="emphasis">Christ in America.</span> I could hardly contain my excitement as so many of my questions regarding church history were suddenly answered.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p15" pid="q04QbC6HzUagrqFNxrxozg" hash="V3rayA">“I was currently pursuing a doctorate in religion. Here I was, my doctorate nearly complete and the answers to my quest for the truth coming in the Latter-day Saint chapel! It was probably at this time, at the culmination of so much presented so well, that I was actually converted. I knew that this had to be the true church. My heart was ready but how could I become a part of it all? How hard it is to give up physical security and comfortable tradition. I purchased a Book of Mormon that day and went home elated. I remember telling Alice later, ‘There <span class="emphasis">is</span> something special there. I really felt good at that church. They have something I have never known before.’</p>

The ward open house remained a haunting reminder that something better was available. One evening the mother of one of the Mormon students called regarding a musical question. For the first time I bared my spiritual turmoil to a patient and understanding ear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p17" pid="DGifIvTwDU2cIaPRKTXpOA" hash="3B2nqg">“Not long after this our family was invited to their family home evening. We came away so warmed; yet how impossible it seemed for us to make such a change. My job, security, comfortable life, social standing, family ties, house, pension—it all flooded through my mind. Yet how does one in the name of Jesus Christ preach and teach that which he knows is not true?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p18" pid="7dm95ClfFU-yzhn4EV2ldg" hash="N7Mc9w">“Finally in the fall of 1974, although things were still going well at my parish, I knew in my heart that a change was necessary. I knew I was spiritually starved and I was even more concerned for the spiritual malnutrition of my family.</p>

I had memorized the address long before and so, although I had many other pressing matters on my agenda, my automobile seemed to refuse to go anywhere except to 709 Clarkson Street. I kept telling myself I merely wanted to drive by to see what the mission home looked like.</p>

I remember sitting there for a moment intending not to shut off the engine. But somehow the engine did shut off and I sat there and looked at my watch. It was noon—12:35 <small>P.M.</small>—and I told myself it was inappropriate to call on anyone during the lunch hour. But I remember getting out of the car. I remember standing on the sidewalk at the base of the steps thinking, ‘This is a nice place and I’ll just turn around now and go back to the car. I have no business here. After all, I <span class="emphasis">am</span> a Lutheran pastor.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p21" pid="BMteYZK8ZE2ShcHNZHqJ7g" hash="cgDgDw">“But instead I labored up those steps. I must have rung the buzzer because the door opened. There stood a bright-eyed missionary. He invited me in. I said, ‘I really shouldn’t be here today. Besides, it’s lunch hour.’ He said, ‘We are through eating.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p22" pid="ZmUqfbH28ECI5GidacEgpQ" hash="zs8exQ">“I almost panicked. Why <span class="emphasis">was</span> I here? How could I get out of this one? So I said, ‘I want you to know something. I am a Lutheran pastor and I’m here because I’m interested in all the world religions. So I thought I’d stop by and see what the Mormons are all about. I don’t want to take too much of your time because it is the noon hour.’ The young man explained again, ‘We are through eating.’ One thing led to another; all the while I was reminding them that I was a minister of the gospel and, therefore, not a good prospect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/a-gospel-of-conversion.p23" pid="FMBIOAMGRE-egeefnvXt_Q" hash="rKrN_A">“Somehow we spent an hour or two. I apologized upon leaving that I had taken so much time and wished them well, reminding them again that I was a Lutheran pastor and therefore not a prospect. As I drove away I had a warm feeling in my heart and yet a nagging fear that these good missionaries just might believe that I <span class="emphasis">wasn’t</span> a prospect!</p>

How glad I was he called! During the conversation he asked if he and his companion could come over and meet my family. The next evening two missionaries came to our home and the process of our conversion continued to develop step by step, logically and without hesitation. On January 25, 1975, three months and five hours exactly from the time I rang the door bell at the Colorado Mission home, our family entered the waters of baptism at the Broomfield Ward Chapel. After half a lifetime of searching, finally our joy was full.</p>

They grew and matured beautifully. It was a joy to see them blossom as they learned the ways of Christ’s true church on earth. Alice and I equally relished the joy of having found the truth. Our hearts were finally at peace.</p>

As soon as we were able to go to the Salt Lake Temple following our first year in the Church, we eagerly went. The support of so many people who accompanied us was tremendous. The sealing for all time and eternity was one of the most glorious occasions of our lives.</p>

As we stagger under the heavy loss and grieve her mortal absence in our lives, and as we examine and study the process of the accident, we know in our hearts that it was the will of Heavenly Father to call her spirit unto Himself. We are strengthened and comforted in the knowledge that her joy is full. We have gratitude in our hearts that the timing of our Heavenly Father was so kind and merciful.</p>

What if we had delayed the conversion to a more convenient time? What if we had not gone to the temple with a sense of urgency when we did? What if we had not given Kristin the great joy of Primary, Sunday School, sacrament meetings and family home evenings?</p>

Though he was tempted in all things like unto us, yet he lived without sin (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/4.15" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 4:15</a>), and thus he made possible our victory over sin and death as well.</p>

Surely we will never be able to do precisely what he did, partly because his mission and purpose is different than ours. He is the Savior; we are the saved. He is the Mediator between God and man; we are those for whom he mediates. He is the Redeemer; we are the redeemed. The list of differences is long, and possibly endless. The Master’s statement to Moses is a summation of his mission on earth: “My work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>). The immortality portion of this mission he has already accomplished—the resurrection is a reality and <span class="emphasis">all</span> will partake.</p>

His promise to us of things which I do, ye can do, and greater things than I do, ye can do (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.12" class="scriptureRef">John 14:12</a>) rings loudly in the ears, stimulating the amazement of everyone who reads the holy scriptures.</p>

All things are possible to them that believe (see Mark 9:23). Surely we must believe in a thing before we can desire it. And God does grant unto men according to their desire (see Alma 29:4). If the desire is strong enough, performance is assured.</p>

Self-esteem is vitally important to successful performance. Self-esteem is different than conceit—conceit is the weirdest disease in the world. It makes everyone sick except the one who has it. It is immensely important that you feel good about yourself. I am sure that you can only feel good about yourself if you are on the way to reaching your potential. I am positive also that no one can be emotionally or physically healthy unless he is keeping the commandments and rendering unto God the things that are God’s. I did not say that this obedience would also make you satisfied with your every performance—I seldom am; I’m sure I can improve my performance in the job. But when I’m on the Lord’s side, keeping the basic commandments, I feel good about me, I esteem myself as a worthy child of God, and I find I am very positive.</p>

Refuse also to <span class="emphasis">speak</span> negatively. Now you have become an optimist rather than a pessimist. There is a big difference between an optimist and a pessimist—one is positive, a believer; the other is negative, a doubter. The optimist, as you probably know, is a person who, when he wears out his shoes, just figures he’s back on his feet. The pessimist says, “I’ll believe it when I see it.” The optimist says, “I’ll see it when I believe it.”</p>

I have had missionaries complain to me, “They didn’t give me any contacts, so I had no one to teach.” My response was, “Oh, is that so?

I have had missionaries report, “President, we put in the contacting hours. We didn’t get the contacts from tracting, but they came to us from completely unexpected sources. It’s almost as though they fell out of the trees or the sky.” Surely they came from the Lord. Look to the Lord for your blessings. He alone is the giver of every good and perfect gift (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.17" class="scriptureRef">James 1:17</a>).</p>

There is no such thing as “something for nothing” with the Lord. Blessings come because of obedience to the law upon which they are predicated (see D&amp;C 130:21). The Lord requires sacrifice, meaning something above and beyond the minimum. The Master spoke of the “second mile” and told us to go there (see Matt. 5:41). Why? Because he wants to bless us. So he put all the blessings in the second mile, but we must go where they are before we get them.</p>

Knowing that it is “sacrifice [that] brings forth the blessings of heaven” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 147), then we should cheerfully do all things that lie in our power to bring to pass the Lord’s work, even to “wast[ing] and wear[ing] out our lives” if that be necessary (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 123:13</a>).

For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.38" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:38</a>.) When the Master said, “Give, and it shall be given unto you,” this means if you want to receive, you must first give. That’s different from paying tithing where you receive and then give back ten percent. Here, the Master tells us to give first; then we shall receive. “Well, how <span class="emphasis">much</span> am I going to get?” (That’s always the question, isn’t it?) The Lord tells us how much. His words: “good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over. …” Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? He continues, “… shall men give into your bosom.” Men? I thought you said it was the <span class="emphasis">Lord.</span> Yes, it is the Lord, but he always uses men. If you pray for a revelation from the Lord, he will probably send you your bishop with the answer. You really don’t need a visit from an angel so long as you have a bishop. The Lord continues, “For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.”</p>

So we pray for the Lord to cause a miracle which will break down those barriers that prohibit us from entering the nations where we are presently excluded. But are we, in fact, accelerating the preparation of our young men who should be ready to enter when the barriers fall? At the same time we must not overlook our need for help—the help we must have from the Lord—to hurdle the hedge to our next-door neighbor.</p>

It seems that nothing is more important to the Lord than a family. He has designed the greatest blessings for His children to be received through families, and the temple, of course, is the means of creating these eternal, exalted families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/turning-the-hearts.p3" pid="Vo6RPjTWUEWWNJlKBCKUYg" hash="EDr8FQ">I believe that families are under a more serious attack today than at any time since the beginning of the world, with the possible exception of the days of Noah. It must have been bad then too. Maybe we today are not quite as bad as they were.

I am sure you will never turn your own children’s hearts more to you than you will by keeping a journal and writing your personal history. They will ultimately love to find out about your successes and your failures and your peculiarities. It will tell them a lot about themselves, too.

This must be one of the most pointed questions ever asked in the holy scriptures. The implications are that an affirmative answer would mean that those who rob God will be cursed by God and burned as stubble at the Lord’s second coming. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.9" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:9</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/4.1" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 4:1</a>.)</p>

It quite obviously applied to the Nephites and Lamanites on this continent, too, for the resurrected Lord repeated it to them when he visited them in about <small>A.D.</small> 34. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/24.8-9" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 24:8–9</a>.) I presume modern Israel is also included under the same injunction, for surely the Lord used almost the same words when he warned of the burning that would precede his second coming, and tithing seems to be the critical judgment criterion. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.23-24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:23–24</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:10</a>.) Further, the Lord “will rebuke the devourer for [their] sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of [their] ground.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.11" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:11</a>.) This is a blessing of great magnitude.</p>

But then he does speed up—just enough to get through on the yellow light—and you have to stop. This has a great tendency to test the patience. Sometimes we even start thinking rather derogatorily about him as he drives away. However, it just may be that the Lord is protecting us from an accident two miles down the road because we stopped at that light, even though we did it reluctantly. If you entertain these kinds of thoughts, it may have a tendency to make you thankful instead of irate or angry, which is much better for your digestion.</p>

I was living back in Virginia at the time, and one beautiful fall day I drove out into the country to pick up some walnuts. There were sixteen Stop signs between my home and the very, very heavily wooded lane where I turned in to get those walnuts. I stopped fifteen times. The last Stop sign was way out in the country. I could see in both directions. There were no other cars in sight. I thought to myself: “Why should I stop? Stop signs are to protect people, but I am the only one around. So why stop?” <span class="emphasis">So I didn’t!</span> I wasn’t speeding. I just went through at the speed limit. When I reached the heavily wooded lane, I found I couldn’t see around the corner. It’s that way back there in Virginia. So I slowed down and turned in. Just as I did, there was another car coming out of the lane, and because we couldn’t see each other, we ran together at about five miles per hour. It wasn’t a hard impact and the cars weren’t severely damaged. As I recall, it only cost me $168 to replace my grill and headlights.</p>

Of course, if I had stopped at the last Stop sign, it would never have happened. I said, “Lord, I get the message. You really didn’t have to go this far, but I do understand.” In fact, I stopped sixteen times on the way home with the front end of my car beat up.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.20-21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:20–21</a>; italics added.) This could reach even to a Stop sign, too, I suppose.</p>

Surely, it is very difficult not to be partial to your own son who is working for you, if he does a good job. I presume there is nothing wrong in feeling that way about your own son. The Lord seems to think not.</p>

And, as it turns out, when a man pays tithing, the Lord opens the windows of heaven and rebukes the devourer so that it doesn’t cost him anything, but really puts him far more ahead than he ever could have been if he had not paid it. It is a principle of great promise and brings eternal joy and happiness.</p>

I think more properly for us, the gospel is the <span class="emphasis">way</span> to salvation, and surely there is no other way. Mortals will get there through the gospel of Jesus Christ, or they will not receive salvation, meaning eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p2" pid="_264KhWUx0OSGOgJL59awQ" hash="YWgydQ">The word <span class="emphasis">gospel</span> means literally “glad tidings” or “good news.” If you were to receive the news that a long-lost relative of whom you had never heard had died and left you a million dollars, that quite possibly could be considered good news, but it would not be the gospel. The gospel is, then, a particular kind of good news. It is the good news about Jesus Christ and his atoning sacrifice for our sins and the original transgression that took place in the Garden of Eden.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p3" pid="88r5j1IHC0-04UbJyCe0Tg" hash="AR32Aw">If we were to search for the best definition of what is contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ, we could hardly do better than look to the Lord Jesus Christ’s definition of what his gospel is. We read from 3 Nephi 27, beginning with verse 13, “Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you—that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.” [<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.13" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:13</a>] I presume we—you and I—also came into this world to do the will of the Father because our Father sent us, too. We have not been sent to do precisely the same thing that Jesus Christ was sent to do, but it is vitally important to us that we also do the will of the Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p4" pid="Eipht1B_3Eq6UV_uhUFQVw" hash="iMpTmw">Jesus continues telling us precisely what he was sent to do, “And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, … to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.14" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p5" pid="pj0m50x5NUifDxHprW1MsQ" hash="rhYOrg">Jesus came to give his life upon the cross to save all mankind on condition of their acceptance of what he did. It might be permissible to ask, Did he seek to die on the cross? I think not. If so, why should he pray, “Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.42" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:42</a>.) It appears that he did not seek to die on the cross, but he did want to do the will of the Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p6" pid="f6wRR-mcUUq2pNJD4kz35A" hash="D9Y96g">I learned this lesson from my father at a very early age. My dad was smarter than I was when I was seven years old. Of course, I was smarter than he was when I was seventeen, but that changed later, too. He said to me one time, “You are not big enough to milk the cows.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p7" pid="M2wJeY9JDE-LvCwsbYBAKA" hash="u8LPng">Now, I knew I was. I was seven years old, and I knew I could milk the cows. So I proved to him that I could.</p>

You’ve got the job.” For the next ten years I milked eight to twelve cows night and morning. You may rest assured I got to the place where I did not want to milk, and once I said to Dad, “Dad, I don’t want to milk.” He said, “That’s all right. You don’t have to want to—as long as you do it.” This seems to be what the Lord says to us at times when the going gets rough and we feel—“I really don’t want to go to the temple,” or “It is inconvenient to pay tithing,” or “I don’t want to go home teaching.” I know for sure that Jonah did not want to go on a mission. But he went.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p9" pid="-8O-lecmHUqB9ioB8u9D_g" hash="lyMjdA">Jesus was lifted up upon the cross so that he might draw all men unto him. The question could be asked, How could being lifted up upon the cross possibly draw all men unto him? Many men have been crucified without drawing all men to them. Well, it is necessary to understand who he was and what he was doing upon the earth. He was the sinless Son of God who had been sent to the earth to pay the price for sin (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/6.20" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 6:20</a>), both the original transgression in the Garden of Eden, and individual sins. The transgression in the Garden of Eden brought death into the world—both temporal death, the separation of the spirit from the body, and spiritual death, the separation of the spirit from the presence of God. In atoning for the original transgression he would bring to pass the resurrection, the rejoining of the spirits and bodies of all mankind. By paying the price for individual sins, he would open the door to eternal life for all to return to live in the presence of God, thereby eliminating spiritual death. Neither of these acts could man do for himself. Only Jesus could provide the way and the means to save fallen man. He did it because he loved mankind. Said he: “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.13" class="scriptureRef">John 15:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p10" pid="4Tw_FU5v_ECCm-LQ_U66cQ" hash="Tat7ig">When we understand this, it is easy to love our Redeemer. His sacrifice demonstrates infinite love for us; it begets infinite love in us for him who gave his life as a ransom for all. “There was no other good enough to pay the price of sin.” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 194.) As he was lifted up (crucified) by men, wherein he made the resurrection a reality, so shall all men, whether they be good or bad, be lifted up, or resurrected, by the Father. Resurrection is a free gift from Jesus Christ. There needs to be nothing done to receive it except to be born on the earth. However, those who are filthy, in the resurrection will be filthy still; and those who are righteous will be righteous still. In the words of the Master, the resurrection takes place so we can be judged. From this statement it appears that the Judgment requires the spirit and the body inseparably connected in order to receive a fulness of joy, meaning exaltation—or damnation. And what will be the basis of the Judgment? It will be according to the deeds done in the flesh—not what we did before we were born or what we do after we die, but what we do while we are here in mortality. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:15</a>.) We were all born; we will all die. So the word of the Lord is: “This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p11" pid="ASGm-vNy-kW9nHwjVT8YNQ" hash="9T6ZlQ">“Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.32,34" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:32, 34</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p12" pid="LlFaBmHXBky5e2IrrP7OSw" hash="ZcBEfw">It appears that we do not change when we die, which means that if we are addicted to drugs, bad habits, and evil desires when we go out of this life, those influences will probably follow us. Therefore, repentance and forgiveness, which come under the heading of fearing God and keeping his commandments, are our whole duty here in mortality. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/eccl/12.13" class="scriptureRef">Eccl. 12:13</a>.) Mortality is, in reality, a very, very short period. It is literally a snap of the fingers compared to an eternity. It is so short that we can do it. We can prevail. Why, you can stand your foot in a vise for a while if you know it’s going to be released soon. It is when you can see no relief in sight that it becomes unbearable. Yes, earthly probation is short compared to eternity, but so very much is riding on how we handle the trials and temptations of the flesh. It is, as the Lord said in essence to the Prophet Joseph: thine afflictions will be but for a small moment, then if thou endureth it well thy God shall stand by thee forever and ever. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.7-8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:7–8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:4</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p13" pid="NdE0OqeB40S2FSfWwzoEuA" hash="oLKNSQ">Therefore, it appears that one reason we are being resurrected is so we can be judged. The Master continues, “And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.15" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:15</a>.) The works the Master refers to here, I believe, are the works that he inspires us to do by his Holy Spirit. Paul, speaking of those who through the gospel have covenanted to do the will of Jesus, said, “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/2.13" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 2:13</a>.) Paul further stated, “Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/col/1.29" class="scriptureRef">Col. 1:29</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p14" pid="IoKdxjOLXkeTjNuxZdS-BQ" hash="s4dFbw">The works which we do of ourselves are not sufficient to exalt us. In the words of King Benjamin, “I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.21" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:21</a>.) It seems you and I can do little of ourselves, but through Christ we can do all things. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 4:13</a>.) Therefore, when we do well we are receiving credit for his works. In the words of Nephi, we are “relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.19" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:19</a>.) Moroni echoes the same theme when he says people of the Church were “relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 6:4</a>.) Then the Master tells us how we can make his atoning sacrifice effective in our lives and get credit for his works of righteousness. “And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end”—and I would add in repentance, including obedience and forgiving others—“behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.16" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:16</a>.) Ah, then you and I must be guiltless at the last day, and being the sinners that we are, that would be impossible without Christ paying for our sins and our acceptance of his payment through our own faith, repentance, and baptism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p15" pid="2wWSgoFlPUi00yITyr3M4g" hash="n8gV-w">The Master continues, “And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.17" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:17</a>.) All too often, the justice of God seems to be relegated to the back burner, while the mercy of God seems to get the lion’s share of attention. I presume this is true because we are all hoping for mercy and trying to avoid justice if at all possible. But it is a fact that God is just, and mercy cannot rob justice. Justice will have her due! It is also a fact that mercy, while it cannot rob justice, can satisfy the demands of justice in one instance and one instance only. That is beautifully stated by Amulek in the Book of Mormon:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p16" pid="5GwMMkqWPkqcwHkTeN3cNw" hash="qI5wrw">“And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law [of Moses], every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p17" pid="0IJHPnssWEKQ597BWF5Kbw" hash="6H329A">“And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p18" pid="2QW-tDlWEEGFayOooFn3Lg" hash="MqLNfA">“And thus mercy can <span class="emphasis">satisfy</span> the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the <span class="emphasis">demands</span> of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.14-16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:14–16</a>; italics added.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p19" pid="9QwmBS23bUW8D4QqhNEObw" hash="gkTZrA">Then, while mercy cannot rob justice, mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, but only in the instance where we exercise faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel.p20" pid="_fsuFMDhFUehvYum4pgAfg" hash="gtoLFg">The Master told the Nephites:</p>

Because the Lord has spoken it, you can believe it. He is a god of truth and cannot lie. The Master further states that “no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood.” And how is this done? “Because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.19" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:19</a>.)</p>

Surely there is not much known by the living about the resurrection because neither prophets nor resurrected persons have explained the process to mortals. Only this much: that the atonement of Jesus Christ “bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:23</a>), death being the separation of the spirit from the body.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-resurrection.p2" pid="hSupdNafdE6vljD_ZNI6yQ" hash="MK8tbA">The resurrection has to do with the restoration of the spirit to the body and the body to the spirit. In the words of Alma, “Yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 40:23</a>.) And why is this done? Again in the words of Alma, “The resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:23</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-resurrection.p3" pid="qyX68nwfi0yCUOfxxjgjLw" hash="QPHFRg">Jacob gives us some idea of what resurrection will be like:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-resurrection.p4" pid="lJjml3yI60645gbJytzAMg" hash="xEWn9w">“O how great the plan of our God! For … the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-resurrection.p5" pid="IiLZzUpdF0K5e8AaHW0X6g" hash="O7FkJQ">“Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-resurrection.p6" pid="hq8TGyfETEyAwbnKr8bhzQ" hash="a4T8tA">“And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath spoken it, … they who are righteous shall be righteous still, and they who are filthy shall be filthy still; wherefore, they who are filthy are the devil and his angels.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.13-14,16" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:13–14, 16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-resurrection.p7" pid="lHCyRVBeF0iM9d2NYSSHHQ" hash="RuyJiw">It seems, then, there is good news and bad news about the resurrection. The good news is that everyone will be resurrected. All will live again! And all who have been righteous (have repented) will still be righteous. The bad news is that he that is filthy (which means the devil and those who have chosen to associate with him) shall be filthy still. Others will receive a lesser glory than the celestial because they have not repented while in the flesh. Therefore, in the resurrection men will be judged. Judgment tells how well we have kept the commandments in the flesh. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-resurrection.p8" pid="yePpr3SrMkOt3TySZfc4Rw" hash="tSvEcA">Then, looking forward to what condition we will be in when we are resurrected, probably the most important commandment is, in the words of the Father, “Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son” and then endure to the end. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:11</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.15" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-resurrection.p9" pid="KKSHWAxbaki6DQYbQRRDTg" hash="YZ5qKw">In fact, the Master has indicated we should say nothing but repentance to this generation. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:9</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 11:9</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:21</a>.) Repentance seems to be the most important experience we can have on this earth to prepare for the resurrection, because “none but the truly penitent are saved.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.24" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:24</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-resurrection.p10" pid="Px7X4C24j0G27k5Ptb0TjQ" hash="4NN3qA">So the question of questions is: What makes people repent? As near as I have been able to determine, once a person has sufficient faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that he believes Christ has paid for his sins, then he will repent. And it seems that very few, if any, will repent until they believe this truth. Therefore, it is vital to teach the truth about Jesus Christ as the literal son of God and our Lord and Savior and Redeemer in order to bring souls to repentance. Faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance <span class="emphasis">is</span> the saving power of the gospel of Jesus Christ. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:16</a>.)</p>

Baptism is for the remission of sins (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/13.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 13:1</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:27</a>), and further, it is a witness before God the Father that we will be obedient unto Him hereafter in keeping His commandments (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.6-7" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:6–7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-resurrection.p12" pid="BPnxaTzzP0WaV02-pdGL6Q" hash="mOMUfA">Once baptized, we then receive the Holy Ghost, a special gift from God, which is priceless beyond expression. The Holy Ghost bears witness of the Father and the Son and guides us to all truth and comforts us and gives us peace for the rest of our lives. The Holy Ghost is received by the laying on of hands of an elder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the same time we are received into the Church and become “born again”—sons and daughters of Jesus Christ. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.12" class="scriptureRef">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.14" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:14</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.49" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:49</a>.)</p>

For instance, probably the nicest thing that parents can do for their children is to give them birth under the temple covenant or to be sealed to them thereafter. There is probably nothing of greater value than this. Why? Because it guarantees to the children eternal life—<span class="emphasis">if they</span> remain faithful. And this is true irrespective of what happens to the parents.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/col/3.20" class="scriptureRef">Col. 3:20</a>.) The nicest gift a father can give to his children is to love their mother and be true to her. Conversely, the nicest gift that a mother can give her children is to love their father and be true to him. Why is this such a nice gift? Well, basically, it assures the children that they will never have to choose between their parents.</p>

Because it is, in the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith, “the most correct … book on earth.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:461.) Why is the Book of Mormon so great? Probably because the “plain and precious” truths that were lost or taken from the Bible were put back or restored in the Book of Mormon. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.40" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 13:40</a>.) In my opinion, a man can learn more about Jesus Christ by reading the Book of Mormon than any other book.</p>

I was born and reared in Missouri, where much of the early history of this church took place. But I had never heard anything about the Mormon church. I was looking for the truth, and although I had read the Bible and believed that Jesus Christ had lived on the earth and had been resurrected, yet I had so many unanswered questions—questions such as: Why doesn’t God speak to man today as he did anciently when the Bible was being written? How can Jesus be his own father and the Holy Ghost too? Why did Jesus have to be baptized when he had no sin? Where was I before I was born, and where do I go when I die? How can just believing in Christ save me when I haven’t kept God’s Ten Commandments?</p>

The answers came when Elders Ted Raban and Ronald Flygare knocked on my door in San Diego, California, in July 1951. My wife, Connie, let them in and accepted a copy of the Book of Mormon from them. I was in Hawaii at the time, attending a fourteen-week training course preparatory to deployment to Korea.</p>

I knew the book was true before I had finished 2 Nephi—Nephi had converted one more—and began to attend church in the old Valencia Park Ward in San Diego. Because of my preparation for deployment, I was not able to study and attend church as I wanted to and longed for the time when I could. The time came aboard the aircraft carrier <span class="emphasis">Philippine Seas,</span> where I read fourteen of the best books that have ever been written. They included the standard works of the Church, plus the writings of each of the Presidents of the Church from Joseph Smith, Jr., to David O. McKay, plus Parley P. and Orson Pratt and a few others. I was like a starving man who had found food and drink for the first time. I loved it. When we arrived in Japan, the LDS group aboard ship decided I should be baptized. So we traveled to the Tokyo mission home, where I requested baptism. I was informed that I had not been an investigator for the required one-year time period; therefore, I could not be baptized. However, I persisted. I asked to be interviewed. The interview took an hour and a half, but in the end I received a recommend for baptism and confirmation. McDonald B. Johnson, the LDS group leader on the <span class="emphasis">Philippine Seas,</span> baptized me, and Fred Gaylord Peterson confirmed me, and I became a member of the Church on 26 February 1952. I was ordained a deacon that day and subsequently to another office in the priesthood each time the ship returned to Japan, until, on 26 July 1952, I was ordained an elder and returned to San Diego in August, where my wife had been baptized on March 1 of that same year. We were a united family in the gospel of Jesus Christ and were looking forward with much anticipation to being sealed together with our three children in the Mesa Arizona temple, which happened in May 1953.</p>

I have served in this capacity for twenty-six years.</p>

In the first instance we are still guilty; in the second we are free of the sin and guilt. People stop sinning all the time because they are afraid they will get AIDS or die of lung cancer or some other reason, but they do not get rid of their sins. That can happen only when a nonmember follows Jesus Christ down into the waters of baptism, then comes forth and receives the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands by priesthood authority.

If we’re not nice, I don’t think we’re going to make it. In other words, we must have charity, which is really love plus sacrifice. We must serve our fellowmen, women, and children, and if we do all else but we do not serve the poor, the needy, the downtrodden, the oppressed, the sick and afflicted, both temporally and spiritually, according to their wants, we cannot retain a remission of our sins from day to day.

The Lord was willing to spare Sodom and Gomorrah if Abraham could find just ten good men, which he could not do. I presume I could not have a more important hope for you and me than that we may be filled with this charity, this pure love of Christ, to serve our fellowman. I express this hope to you in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
