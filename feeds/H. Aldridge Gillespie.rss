      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p2" pid="SSSyAATf2Eax8mq9mEkUtA" hash="h9hM-Q">We have been instructed, edified, and spiritually nourished through the five sessions of this magnificent general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We have been taught “how to act upon the points of [the Lord’s] law and commandments”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> and have been “sanctified by that which [we] have received.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p3" pid="TUS6_8ry6Emtmjo8Xa461g" hash="54R7Lw">Now it is time to “bind [ourselves] to act in all holiness before [the Lord].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> In other words, based on this conference, we need to decide on specific actions to bring about needed changes in our lives. This action is called faith, and the changes are repentance. Blessings always follow these two principles. If we do not take action quickly, then the very thing which could have sanctified us may turn to our condemnation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p4" pid="bThCUiiEyU6X2uxu01fT0w" hash="wmaMgQ">Today is the Sabbath. It does not end when we leave this session; it does not end if someone calls on the phone or knocks at our door inviting us to come out and play, go for a ride, to a ball game, or shopping; it does not end because we are on vacation or someone is visiting us, whether member or nonmember.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p5" pid="XCqxD2FSr0m53lSqTKsJXg" hash="hZzibA">The Lord commanded: “Go ye out from among the wicked. Save yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> A critical element in observing this commandment is to “remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p6" pid="-PdM-zck20GLYFgm7LWFmA" hash="-0QhTw">The Sabbath lasts all day! In a revelation “especially applicable to the saints in Zion,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> the Lord states that the Sabbath was given that we might keep ourselves “unspotted from the world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> It is a day to partake of the sacrament, a day “to pay [our] devotions unto the Most High,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> a day of “fasting and prayer,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> a day to offer our time, talent, and means in service to our God and our fellowmen,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> a day to “[confess our] sins [to our] brethren, and before the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> It is also a good day to pay our tithes and fast offerings, a day to be marked by sincere sacrifice of the pursuits and pleasures of the world. It is a day to keep the Sabbath covenant,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> a day of “rejoicing and prayer,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> a day of “cheerful hearts and countenances.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p7" pid="5QQRwWOfkEWweLo9FrMfFw" hash="5Nui4Q">Isaiah promised, “If thou turn away thy foot … from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, … and … honour him, not … finding thine own pleasure, … then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p8" pid="6a4v3vmfDESykAnlXFnlhg" hash="kaqA3g">Obviously, our attention is on doing the Lord’s will and not continuing to work nor indulge our carnal appetites for recreation and loafing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p9" pid="1P_DDJcatUysc-tWclXJHw" hash="k9X-dQ">The prophet Spencer W. Kimball counseled: “The Sabbath is a holy day in which to do worthy and holy things. Abstinence from work and recreation is important but insufficient. The Sabbath calls for constructive thoughts and acts, and if one merely lounges about doing nothing on the Sabbath, he is breaking it. To observe it, one will be on his knees in prayer, preparing lessons, studying the gospel, meditating, visiting the ill and distressed, sleeping, reading wholesome material, and attending all the meetings of that day to which he is expected. [Failure] to do these proper things is a transgression on the omission side.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p10" pid="Kj8Kstv-wUW3gzmUV1e2QA" hash="aruU0Q">Our beloved prophet Gordon B. Hinckley has promised: “If you have any doubt about the wisdom, the divinity of observing the Sabbath Day, … stay home and gather your family about you, teach them the gospel, enjoy yourselves together on the Sabbath Day, come to your meetings, participate. You will know that the principle of the Sabbath is a true principle which brings with it great blessings.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p11" pid="cvmAkPe_zUaK8CaBn7UDaA" hash="4pCRvA">Jesus taught, “The sabbath was made for man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> What does that mean? It means for a man to have the joy and happiness which the gospel promises, on this day he must sacrifice the world, set aside his employment as possible, and keep the eternal covenant of the Sabbath day. The Lord commanded: “Wherefore the children of Israel [which includes all Latter-day Saints] shall keep the sabbath … throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p12" pid="oO2Oyl5cZUS9KGdXe36Eug" hash="VgIIIQ">Of all people on the earth, the Latter-day Saints must lead out in sanctifying this appointed day each week. “Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,” said the Lord, “ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p13" pid="Whkuoy_yPU2930S2tPbPcQ" hash="p6JbMw">To this very day, “the matter of Sabbath observance remains … as one of the great tests which divides the righteous from the worldly and wicked,” said Elder Bruce R. McConkie.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-blessing-of-keeping-the-sabbath-day-holy.p14" pid="P_aS9ulsXkGRCO-xjbljlQ" hash="22wYSQ">The promises of the Lord to those who keep the Sabbath day holy are so wonderfully clear in the scriptures that they leave one asking, “Why would anyone throw away such blessings for the tawdry, temporary pleasures of the world?” Hear again the words of Jehovah as they roll down from Mount Sinai: “Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the Lord.</p>

I know He lives and that this is His Church and kingdom on earth. I know He is at once a just and merciful God, who loves His children with all the tenderness of a kind and loving Father. May we, in turn, “offer a sacrifice unto the Lord [our] God in righteousness, even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span> I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
