Having reared twenty-four children between us, we might have had reason to feel quite confident in our ability to understand the needs of children. However, the responsibility of representing the children of the Church in today’s world weighed heavily upon us. Our greatest desire was to know the will of our Father in Heaven and to seek His direction. In counseling with Elder Robert D. Hales at the time of our call, he suggested that as we read our scriptures, we mark the passages that pertain to children. We found there are many. In fact, it seems that the scriptures were written for families. The prophets have left no doubt as to the desires of the Lord regarding His little ones:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p2" pid="K5VWzmadMEGjkbUVanNQBA" hash="4hpw2w">Nephi began his record, “I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.1" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 1:1</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p3" pid="o5oGjDRPO0KL0jLa2BDCDQ" hash="B3T2UA">Enos began his record, “Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that he was a just man—for he taught me in his language, and also in the nurture and admonition of the Lord—and blessed be the name of my God for it” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.1" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:1</a>).</p>

In her general conference message last October, I remember Sister Pinegar’s searching question: “Who will teach the children?” It was not only a question, but an invitation for all of us, all of us who find children within the circle of our influence, to answer the call of our Father in Heaven to teach His children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p6" pid="dtEIP0W8pUaPXE4G7f3wTw" hash="JiigUg">As we humbly try to answer that call, another, more probing question comes to mind: How do we teach the children? How do we impress the word of the Lord upon their hearts while they are young so that as they grow into the years of their youth they will have the ability to discern between truth and error and the inner strength to resist temptation? How can we so nourish them in their spiritual growth that their obedience moves from mere outward compliance to an inward desire born out of a love for their Father in Heaven and an understanding of who they are?</p>

They have challenged parents through all generations. And the counsel of the Lord, though given hundreds of years ago through Moses to the children of Israel, is as if He were speaking to us today. In Deuteronomy we read:</p>

They will grow in their devotion to the Lord as they see our devotion to Him. They will understand the power of prayer as they hear us pray to a loving Heavenly Father who is there listening and answering our prayers. They will understand faith as they see us live by faith. And they will learn the power of love by the kind and respectful ways that we relate to them. We cannot teach truth to our children apart from the trusting, caring relationships that we have with them. President Howard W. Hunter said, “A successful parent is one who has loved, one who has sacrificed, and one who has cared for, taught, and ministered to the needs of a child” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1983, p. 65).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p13" pid="UZC-_hruGUuNMCAy77xVyg" hash="3O_yZg">When our children feel our love for the Lord and our unconditional love for them, then our example becomes a meaningful guide to them as they develop their own spiritual strength. Remember the Lord’s commandment to the Israelites to, first, put His words in their hearts, and then He said, “Teach them diligently unto thy children” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/6.7" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 6:7</a>). In all that we do, we can teach our children to love the Lord. At times our most impressionable teaching happens when we don’t even realize that we’re teaching.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p14" pid="MLLq57DJUU6K0tR0jP8stw" hash="QXHlew">I remember as a teacher of the eleven-year-old girls in Primary, we held a luncheon for the girls and their mothers. I had asked each girl to introduce her mother and tell one thing that she admired about her. One of the girls said that she knew that her mother loved to read the scriptures. She held up her scriptures and said, “I can tell where she has been in the house by where I find her scriptures.” I have remembered that example over the years and thought how natural it would have been for that mother to transmit a love of the scriptures to her children, because she had developed that love herself. We teach first what we are—and those are the impressions that live in the minds and hearts of our children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p15" pid="bYXoJtut2kGDkl6ld6q3sg" hash="Cqu6TQ">There is a spirit that pervades our homes when there is a love of the Lord, a love for one another, and a commitment to obedience that springs out of that love. As I speak of that spirit, I remember our mission home in Frankfurt, Germany, where my husband served as mission president. Our daughter, Marianne, was ten years old at the time. Some of her friends from school would come to the mission home and occasionally stay overnight. One night, one of her friends said, “I like to come to your house because I feel safe here.” Marianne understood what she meant—all of our family knew the spirit of the mission home. It was a legacy that was left by thousands of dedicated missionaries who had passed through that home and shared their testimonies and their love for their Heavenly Father and the Savior. It is a spirit that can be felt in all of our homes when as families we share testimonies and feelings of the Spirit as we read the scriptures and when we kneel together in prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p16" pid="-_urqwQlREGKHWsqSsHV-A" hash="g-WdqQ">President Kimball shared vivid memories of his home when the family knelt before meals to pray, their chairs turned back from the table, dinner plates upside down. He remembers night prayers at his mother’s knee. He said, “I feel sorry for children who must learn these important lessons after they are grown, when it is so much harder” (Edward L. Kimball and Andrew E. Kimball, Jr., <span class="emphasis">Spencer W. Kimball,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1977, p. 31). Home can be an oasis in the world. It’s a place where every child has a right to feel safe.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p17" pid="oh0b4lHKxU21rnjbxjJKfQ" hash="rmyw1g">In a fast and testimony meeting I attended recently in my own ward, three children bore their testimonies. Richie stood at the beginning of the meeting and said, “Last night I was reading from 1 Nephi, chapters 1 [<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.title" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 1</a>], 2, and 3; and as I was reading, I felt a great feeling of peace. I felt good inside. I’m thankful for the scriptures.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p18" pid="MRTwrPx2TUWB-_Ig1X-zJg" hash="-Ndm0g">Charity told of an experience she had of attending a concert with her family and becoming separated from her parents. She said, “I found a corner and sat down and prayed to Heavenly Father. I asked Him to send the Holy Ghost to be with me until my parents could find me—and I wasn’t afraid.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p19" pid="prEhvqgjskeDsCUqVjsXAw" hash="4R3IjQ">Spencer had just been ordained to be a deacon. He expressed his appreciation for the bishop who had ordained him to the Aaronic Priesthood and told how much it meant to him to be a deacon. These children had been touched in their hearts by parents, teachers, and leaders who first loved the Lord and then turned the children to Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p20" pid="JYu0vsHB9kSj4tfSNndE_w" hash="_Uvf0g">Within our family circle, we can help our children identify feelings of the Spirit and encourage them to express those feelings in their own words. We can invite them to share the things they are learning in Primary and other Church meetings. By so doing, we open the door for the Spirit to confirm those teachings in their hearts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/touch-the-hearts-of-the-children.p21" pid="EQNfTUOW106GthoI1xgs3Q" hash="SAxOBQ">Brothers and sisters, we can touch the hearts of our children and bring them to the Savior. They will see Him first through our eyes, and they will learn how to know and love Him as their most trusted friend. They will understand what it means to have His Spirit to be with them—and that will be their strength. It is my prayer, my brothers and sisters, that we may all keep that vision before us, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We are Israel of the latter days. We are they who must teach our children of Him. Peace that endures is not dependent upon outside forces that are beyond our control. “Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:23</a>).</p>

They speak to us at a time when peace in the hearts of children can seem but an elusive dream. But the Savior has assured us that it can be a reality if we teach our children. Primary supports parents in this important responsibility.</p>

Approximately eight children were seated around a table with their teacher. I watched in awe as these little ones, two and three years old, sat for a few brief moments focused in rapt attention on a picture the teacher was holding of the Savior with the children. I heard her tell them how He loves children and how He loves each one of them. She taught them that Heavenly Father loves them too. I watched them listen, and I felt that they were understanding much more than I might have thought possible. They were hearing her words and feeling her love. In the beauty and simplicity of those few moments, those children were being taught the answer to life’s most important question, “Who Am I?” In their pure, childlike faith, their spirits were receptive to the truths they were being taught. That experience will be repeated for them in their nursery class Sunday after Sunday. These are significant teaching moments in the lives of young children at a time when they are ready to learn.</p>

I quote from a recent study: “From birth, a baby’s brain cells proliferate wildly, making connections that may shape a lifetime of experience. The first three years are critical” (J. Madeleine Nash, “Fertile Minds,” <span class="emphasis">Time,</span> 3 Feb. 1997, 49).</p>

The years from birth to age 10 are the peak years for acquiring the language that will become the foundation for understanding future knowledge and truth. That foundation is formed by the words they hear and the impressions that come to them from the world around them. It is an ideal time for parents to read to their children from the scriptures. They will begin to learn the language of the scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/teaching-our-children-to-love-the-scriptures.p10" pid="FrmS6wXk20GIT7bc9sIxlw" hash="qnbtWQ">You may have noticed children on their way to Primary with their scriptures in hand. Primary children this year are being taught from the scriptures, and they are learning to use them. Our theme for sharing time is “I Know the Scriptures Are True.” One Sunday morning I visited a Primary sharing time, and I noticed the children had their scriptures open on their laps. The Primary presidency and the teachers were helping them find stories of the prophets in their scriptures. I was asked to share a favorite scripture with the children. When I finished, a little four-year-old girl on the front row held up her scriptures and said, “That scripture is in my scriptures too.” Through the guidance of loving parents and dedicated teachers, small children can become familiar with the scriptures and the spirit that accompanies them.</p>

She said that she and her husband read the scriptures to their children—ages 2, 3, and 4—every night before they go to bed. I asked her to tell me more. I must admit I questioned that children so young could understand the language of the scriptures. She said that she and her husband had the same doubts when they first began reading with their children. But she said after the first week the language was not an issue. The children love reading together and feeling the Spirit, and it’s amazing how much they understand.</p>

The exciting possibility is that while children are learning new words daily, they can learn the language of the scriptures. In time, through the guidance of parents and teachers, they will grow in their understanding that Heavenly Father is speaking to them through the scriptures, that the scriptures can help them find answers to their problems.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/teaching-our-children-to-love-the-scriptures.p13" pid="fSdCdfgnVkq2xLKVxhGNhg" hash="nOKb8g">A friend shared an experience she had with her son, Alex, when their family moved to another location. The move was not easy for Alex. It was difficult for him to go to a new school. He was worried about being away from his home and family so much so that he didn’t want to go to school. One day his mother read to him the scripture found in 2 Timothy 1:7 [<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 1:7</a>]: “For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/teaching-our-children-to-love-the-scriptures.p15" pid="kcDmJL0nTUK600-vFQiHAg" hash="fIfVbg">Nephi said: “For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.15" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:15</a>). How can we engage our children in learning from the scriptures so that the testimonies of the prophets will make a difference in their lives? We have been counseled to read the scriptures together as families. When scripture reading and sharing is a tradition in our families, then our children are more likely to make it a habit in their personal lives.</p>

We decided to read the Book of Mormon with the goal to complete the book by the end of the school year. Each morning we read a chapter before breakfast, and we reached our goal. While I would not wish to take anything away from the good things that came from that experience for all of us, we reflected in the end that perhaps our focus was more on our goal than on what we were learning in the process. In the early-morning rush hour that ended at the breakfast table, we had little time to share ideas or ponder on the meaning of God’s word in our lives. When the Savior taught the Nephites, He said, “Go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand, and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.3" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 17:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/teaching-our-children-to-love-the-scriptures.p17" pid="pdDUDL3KV02dLknAOOgcOw" hash="yXKPzg">The Savior has given us a pattern to follow as we study the scriptures. We hear the word, we ponder upon its meaning, we ask our Heavenly Father to help us understand, and then our minds and hearts are prepared to receive the promised blessings. Pondering is more than reading words; it is searching for meanings that will help us as we relate to one another and as we make choices in our lives. It is allowing the word to move from our minds to our hearts. The Spirit bears witness to our hearts as we prayerfully seek to know the things of our Heavenly Father. When we have that witness and knowledge, we think and live and relate to each other in more Christlike ways.</p>

When we consistently live what the scriptures teach, we provide them with an anchor that will guide them in discerning truth in a world of conflicting values. With the scriptures as a reference point, we can help them process their experiences and the consequences of their choices. By so doing, we help them keep the eternal perspective always in focus so they never forget who they are and where they are going.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/teaching-our-children-to-love-the-scriptures.p19" pid="9fnJXkM1H0iSoicLTiUSEA" hash="3FTkAw">The Prophet Joseph was prepared for the work he was to do through devoted, wise parents who loved the Lord. They read from the scriptures and taught their children from them. And so when young Joseph was confused and needed direction, it was natural for him to go to the scriptures. He said, “At about the age of twelve years my mind became seriously impressed with regard to the all important concerns for the welfare of my immortal soul which led me to search the scriptures believing as I was taught, that they contained the word of God” (<span class="emphasis">The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith,</span> comp. Dean C. Jessee [1984], 4–5; spelling modernized).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/teaching-our-children-to-love-the-scriptures.p20" pid="0u5yCmspaki41BkzEmGN4A" hash="rOc74w">President Hinckley has counseled parents: “Read to your children. Read the story of the Son of God. Read to them from the New Testament. Read to them from the Book of Mormon. It will take time, and you are very busy, but it will prove to be a great blessing in your lives as well as in their lives. And there will grow in their hearts a great love for the Savior of the world, the only perfect man who walked the earth. He will become to them a very real living being, and His great atoning sacrifice as they grow to manhood and womanhood, will take on a new and more glorious meaning in their lives” (quoted in <span class="emphasis">Church News,</span> 6 Dec. 1997, 2). Brothers and sisters, that glorious promise from our prophet can be ours if we read to our children from the scriptures.</p>

That spirit which comes when we share sacred things of the heart will bond us together as families. John expressed it well: “I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/3-jn/1.4" class="scriptureRef">3 Jn. 1:4</a>).</p>
