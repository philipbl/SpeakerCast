      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p1" pid="ulyYI1TT-U-wGbiwrkSmRA" hash="5iWsQg">President Kimball, we love you. Prior to getting into my text, let me offer my apologies to you in the audience and across the world who must listen to these proceedings through a translator. During the past year, I have been privileged to travel extensively in your lands, and I have a feeling of love and respect for you. I apologize that I cannot speak to you in your language. May the Lord bless us, as I speak, that you will be able to hear things just as personally as if I were speaking in your language. Perhaps the day will come when we Saints on the Wasatch Front will have to put on earphones so we can understand what’s going on.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p2" pid="8v_yOTQue0mFcQzK78O0uQ" hash="4_f3Cw">I hope I can convey to you the humility with which I approach this calling. I’ve just recently been released as a second counselor. What does one say, when one day you are the second counselor of the Bountiful Thirteenth Ward bishopric, and the next day you’re the Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric. In the Regional Representatives’ seminar Friday morning, Elder Russell M. Nelson reminisced that last year he was sitting in the Regional Representatives’ seminar—sitting very inconspicuously in the back, and very comfortably. Later that day he received an interview which turned his life upside down.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p3" pid="5IDJVmFQukO8uSoX6IFI9w" hash="rhCDAg">Last Friday I was in the Regional Representatives’ seminar, but my ticket wasn’t stamped “Regional Representative”; it was stamped “Invited Guest.” By four o’clock that afternoon, I had received a letter signed by President Hinckley telling me I was to speak for thirteen minutes in the Sunday afternoon session of conference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p4" pid="2mxDksAMy0OCru2dvNLHmQ" hash="2WbYog">My first question to President Hinckley wasn’t “What should I say?” It was “How do I get in?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p5" pid="BnhH19w0y02LmkIvMpRqMg" hash="62lTHg">As late as last Wednesday night, I was rehearsing for a ward play. (By the way, Sister Lalli, wherever you are, I’m sorry I wasn’t to play practice yesterday morning.) I was released from the bishopric in January after serving for four years. How I loved that calling, and the brethren with whom I served—Bishop Lee J. Lalli, and his able and dedicated first counselor, D. Ray Alexander—Lee J. and Ray, as I affectionately called them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p6" pid="EA1f83_VY0uTbRLS_Npgxw" hash="EeJQCA">Since my release I’ve been traveling extensively, and therefore have been without a calling for two months. At that play practice Wednesday, I sent a signal to the new bishop, Russ Herscher, that I was ready to reenter the “job market.” I hope you won’t feel that I’m an aspiring person, but I told the Primary president, Susan Mabey, I wanted to teach Primary—ideally my seven-year-old daughter’s class. I know sanctification comes not with any particular calling, but with genuine acts of service, often for which there is no specific calling.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p7" pid="DAbgWoYFBk6FyHXFDvQSDQ" hash="SZAl5g">Now, despite the humility with which I approach this call, I have full confidence in my ability to perform. This, however, is not self-confidence, but confidence in the fact that the Lord makes every man and woman equal to the assignment that he or she is given. Therefore, I state clearly but humbly, “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p8" pid="u6LVW4UOE0qbAnRb6AzQiA" hash="rIkVLA">Brothers and sisters, I have never been a bishop. Since Friday afternoon I have felt puzzled, almost bewildered and overwhelmed, at how a man could be called to be a member of the Presiding Bishopric without having had the experience of being a bishop. I agonized for twenty-four hours until yesterday afternoon, when President Hinckley laid his hands upon my head and ordained me a bishop. I heard the voice of the Lord say in my heart, “No, Glenn, you have never been a bishop, but now you are a bishop, and always will be.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p9" pid="_Xd08h5fXUCFOdF_x1fgJQ" hash="DOSqbA">Several years ago, I made a covenant with the Lord. I promised to give him anything he should require of me, and prayed this gesture might warrant forgiveness of my transgressions. Yesterday I gave the only thing I had left. It was something I cherished. I held on to it until the very last moment. I never thought of it as a selfish possession. That of which I speak flew out the window of my home when I turned on the television to watch the news and saw my picture on the television screen. I speak of my prized remaining possession—anonymity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p10" pid="nKpAX9wGikyWTse20orEkw" hash="uCCSvg">How I love not to be noticed! I don’t want to sit with the General Authorities in the “fishbowl” at the BYU football games in my dark blue suit! I want to sit in the stands with my father, wearing an obnoxious T-shirt which reads: “BYU #1. Enough said!” I have license and credentials to be obnoxious! I was born and raised in Provo, Utah. I attended school at Provo High School. I received my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from BYU. I’m a member of the Church, and I even work for the Church. My credentials are impeccable. I want to go berserk in the upper tier of the San Diego Stadium as I have the last four years at the Holiday Bowl—with the exception of Ohio State [which soundly beat BYU’s team in the bowl game], when I went into deep depression. I still have one faint hope—perhaps the Brethren will let me sit with Elder Perry at the ball games. Nevertheless, I give up my prized anonymity, just as I will give up my life if it is required of me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p11" pid="bZElRktPUUm0ARZCYQDo8g" hash="K2uIBA">I love the Lord Jesus Christ. I love the transformation his atonement has wrought in me. Earlier speakers have spoken of him with such eloquence. How I wish I had command of the language which would enable me to express my feelings on this Easter afternoon. May I add my simple testimony to those who have spoken articulately. I once was in darkness, and now see light. I once lost all of my confidence, and now know all things are possible in the Lord. I once felt shame and now am “filled with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:21</a>.) “I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.15" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 1:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p12" pid="J5KL8n4NkkSrZHH7Qh2HgA" hash="482fUA">I express my deepest loyalty to Bishop Hales and his First Counselor, Bishop Eyring. I will not betray their trust. I express my love and loyalty to the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve Apostles, the First Quorum of the Seventy, and those I love most—the rank-and-file members of the Church. I express my love to my wife; without her love and understanding, I literally would not be standing at this pulpit today. I love my children, who must also give up their anonymity, as well as some time with their father. How I wish I could embrace my oldest son, who is serving a mission in the Cook Islands!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p13" pid="5DVR2F1Ih06_23ez9JEwSQ" hash="YJCVpg">I thank God I was born of goodly parents. I begged my mother not to stand and take my picture as I came to the stand for the first time yesterday morning! But what would I have done if, during my formative years, she had not demonstrated that same pride and enthusiasm for everything I accomplished, however small. My father, Bishop Kenneth L. Pace, was the bishop of the Bonneville Ward in the East Provo Stake during my teens. He remains uppermost in my mind as exemplifying the pure love of Christ throughout his life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/confidence-in-the-lord.p14" pid="MHstyzPmGEu8oN7OJ9UOtw" hash="L3GMhg">Finally, I share the prayer of my heart with you at this time. May I display in my service the courage of my convictions in a manner like unto that displayed by Bishop Victor L. Brown. May I acquire the inspired, objective judgment of Bishop H. Burke Peterson. And may I acquire the open, warm, Christlike personality of Bishop J. Richard Clarke. May I exhibit the love and loyalty to Bishop Hales taught to us so beautifully by Joseph’s beloved brother, Hyrum. And lastly, may we as a Bishopric acquire the same love, respect, and unity I felt in the bishopric of the Bountiful Thirteenth Ward with Bishop Lee J. Lalli and D. Ray Alexander, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <description>Five years ago I was asked to be the managing director of the Welfare Services Department of the Church. Within a few days I received a phone call from President Marion G. Romney. He said, “Brother Pace, do you know anything about welfare?”</description>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p2" pid="dELLGsUIP0SB4j_Ut_DRxg" hash="gDhy8A">Under the circumstances, this was a sobering question, and I responded, “President, I’m sure I have much to learn.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p3" pid="Bhv7mRyZJ0u8ePfIDCQKbA" hash="L6RfOQ">He asked me to set aside 3:00 <small>P.M.</small> each Friday for a meeting with him in which we could discuss welfare principles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p4" pid="c8i3i-x7pUiYvSPbOErOkw" hash="0y5z4w">When I arrived at his office on the first Friday, President Romney’s secretary went into his office and announced, “Glenn Pace is here, President.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p5" pid="x0LwApWRdEO-j7WFWPDChw" hash="9HPJKA">He replied, “Oh yes, I’d like to see him, if he doesn’t stay too long.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p6" pid="aVGMgFl0a0urpMiVpvXoHw" hash="DJC1_A">On my second visit, with “if he doesn’t stay too long” still ringing in my ears, I covered two items and then started shuffling my feet and papers, subtly signaling I was ready to leave. President Romney leaned across his desk with that twinkle in his eye and with a chuckle in his voice said, “Brother Pace, am I getting the impression you think you have something better to do?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p7" pid="TELmKmuDBECw1DXHLYALhg" hash="KDIjpQ">How I cherish those precious sessions spent with a man who has dedicated fifty years of service to the kingdom, especially in the area of welfare. He helped me to know President Harold B. Lee, President J. Reuben Clark, and other great leaders who emphasized the principles of welfare. I was counseled to measure all recommendations by the stated purpose of the welfare program as given by President Heber J. Grant in 1936.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p8" pid="zsjOW7MfQk6YCmOPnwpe9Q" hash="i14oVw">President Romney would quote it from memory: “Our primary purpose was to set up, in so far as it might be possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift and self respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves.” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 3.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p9" pid="8EOifAGIa0iebz0J9-FeLA" hash="it0J0g">Many times President Romney emphasized that the notion of the welfare program beginning in 1936 was a myth. He quoted President Lee, who said: “There wasn’t any beginning to the welfare program. There isn’t any ending of the welfare program, we are always in the middle of it. No endings, no beginnings, only middles.” (Harold B. Lee, “Listen and Obey,” Welfare Agricultural Meeting, 3 Apr. 1971.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p10" pid="6SnRBj9en0ONwb4b0F_SFA" hash="HXPBaQ">He quoted scriptures relating to the commandment to seek after the poor—scriptures given to the Saints in Kirtland, Ohio, and Jackson County, Missouri, at a time when almost all members were poor. He pointed out what was done relative to keeping these commands in Nauvoo in the 1840s and in the West in the late 1800s and in the early 1900s. He quoted Book of Mormon passages and used the New Testament to emphasize how much of the Savior’s time was spent helping the poor and needy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p11" pid="EB--SG-wwkukeqWBfCSp8A" hash="FO6UPA">He made the process sound so simple. “Brother Pace, don’t make things so complicated! All we have been trying to do is make our people self-reliant, because the more self-reliant one is the more able to serve he becomes, and the more he serves, the greater his sanctification.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p12" pid="QOWajJBZUUiJljor5iukgQ" hash="K0s7Ag">Over the years, there have been numerous approaches taken with the common goal of helping people become self-reliant. The welfare plan unveiled to inspired leaders in 1936 has become famous and is held up as an enviable example by leaders of other religions as well as government officials in high places.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p13" pid="74_AKzSm3EqU30JzCir7PA" hash="oVydcg">As great as the various programs of the Church are, they carry with them a potential danger. If we are not careful, it is possible to get so wrapped up in the plan that we forget the principles. We can fall into the trap of mistaking traditions for principles and confusing programs with their objectives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p14" pid="gduxyA3SO06wX_2b7Sy_jw" hash="B5vp3w">One Saturday morning I was on my way to fulfill an assignment on a welfare farm. We were to clean the weeds out of an irrigation ditch. My route took me past the home of an elderly widow in my ward, who was weeding her front yard. The temperature was already in the mid-eighties and she looked like she was near to having sunstroke. For a fleeting moment I thought I should stop and lend a helping hand, but my conscience allowed me to drive on by because, after all, I had an assignment on the welfare farm. I wonder what would have happened if I had followed the spontaneous prompting of the Spirit and unleashed the genuine compassion I was feeling. I wonder what would have happened to her; I wonder what would have happened to me. But I couldn’t do that because I hadn’t been assigned. We need more spontaneous acts of compassionate service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p15" pid="baj_KGWc2E-aHZ_PH5cI5g" hash="iczB2w">In 1983 some major modifications were made to the welfare program being followed in the United States and Canada. In making the announcement, President [Gordon B.] Hinckley said, “Permit me to say at the outset that that which you will hear has been considered in depth in all of its implications by the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p16" pid="iltPGoHMjkilPzH0jvcyWw" hash="EKDlKQ">“We reaffirm the basic principles of the welfare program. There will be no departure from those foundation principles. We feel the need to emphasize with greater clarity the obligation for members of the Church to become more independent and self-reliant, to increase personal and family responsibility, to cultivate spiritual growth and to be more fully involved in Christian service.” (Regional Representatives’ Seminar, 1 Apr. 1983.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p17" pid="s_N8pKbVw0SSf4E8pf2ZHA" hash="XE1EBA">Since these changes have been announced, some have asked if the Church is abandoning or deemphasizing welfare. This question is common only to those who are having trouble distinguishing the difference between a principle and a program.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p18" pid="v5_LCbm3Lkq9gnKIdxpjEQ" hash="H-yPfA">At the conclusion of a General Welfare Services Executive Committee meeting, where I felt I had waxed eloquent in discussing farms, trucks, silos, and canneries, President Romney invited me into his office for an unscheduled meeting. He asked one question, “Brother Pace, why is it we never discuss principles and doctrine anymore?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p19" pid="a9e4WQg6QUWw88E6TqP9BA" hash="bFDr3A">I have not been the same since I heard that penetrating inquiry. From that time until my release as the managing director of Welfare Services three years later, I vowed to be more diligent in evaluating programs to see if they were still accomplishing their objective relative to principles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p20" pid="mGNj-SMMk0mMSorTOjDbyA" hash="6KNMbA">Still true is President Lee’s statement: “Nobody changes the principles and doctrines of the Church except the Lord by revelation. But methods change as the inspired direction comes to those who preside at a given time. … You may be sure that your brethren who preside are praying most earnestly, and we do not move until we have the assurance, so far as lies within our power, that what we do has the seal of divine approval.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Jan. 1971, p. 10.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p21" pid="bTETOSdKI0OYk1WkjCzVBQ" hash="lQOzIA">As I travel into various countries, I am often asked, “When are we going to get the welfare program in this country?” I respond by asking if they have a Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price. I also ask if they have bishops or branch presidents, and if there are people with needs and people who can help. When they answer yes, I explain they already have all the ingredients necessary to activate a welfare program in their country.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p22" pid="NqOmkIpoSEWVt7Hik5sIog" hash="9pTY5w">During a trip to South America a few years ago, I spoke with a stake president whose stake had experienced over 50 percent unemployment during the previous three years. I knew the stake had received less than $200 from the Area office during that period. I asked him how the members had been able to survive without a large infusion of outside help. His answer was the families had helped each other—not just father, mother, sons, and daughters, but uncles, aunts, and cousins. When a cousin got a job, the money earned went to benefit everyone. In addition, ward members looked after each other and shared what they had, however so meager. With tears in his eyes he explained how close his stake members were to each other and to the Lord. Their spirituality had increased manyfold. Did they have the welfare program? Yes—and in its purest form.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p23" pid="aBaRmSeuV06a3SCxzt1Y3w" hash="SRPFPQ">I fear we have learned too much over the years about programs at the expense of insufficient understanding of principles. If we had learned more principles, priesthood leaders all over the world would be solving local problems with local resources without waiting for something to come from Church headquarters. Members would be helping each other without waiting for an assignment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p24" pid="zy1P5Nkrz0yaPofhK-fshQ" hash="49dbQg">Programs blindly followed bring us to a <span class="emphasis">discipline</span> of doing good, but principles properly understood and practiced bring us to a <span class="emphasis">disposition</span> to do good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p25" pid="Me49GxJ4IUaXV8QPGGsCMg" hash="-78w0g">I visited Ethiopia last year with Elder Ballard. We came home with vivid pictures of degradation and poverty etched indelibly in our minds. However, I am haunted more often with memories of the conditions under which some of our own members are living in other areas of the world. If every member could travel and observe these conditions, our fast-offering donations would increase substantially.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p26" pid="PpBGRT0zMke39a5dPYurcQ" hash="tyfJSg">Moroni was prophesying of our day when he said: “Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p27" pid="TpB_IgDq7UigPwoU2bm2xQ" hash="AZHeDQ">“For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.35,37" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:35, 37</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p28" pid="ryN4tICeRU2wBElgfhP4wg" hash="i2-plQ">I have great faith in the generosity and compassion of the membership of this church. Never has it been demonstrated more clearly than during the special fasts held in January and November of last year. Over ten million dollars were raised for people we don’t even know. Our members respond when they are aware of a need. Brothers and sisters, that need has not passed. There is much to be done among our own members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p29" pid="iaSPmFNtOEeNIKEs9kxyOg" hash="CloNqQ">Poverty is a relative term. It means something much different in one country than in another. There is no common solution or program for every situation. However, principles are universal. We cannot bring everyone to the same economic level. To do so would violate principles and foster dependence rather than independence. People living in each country have the primary responsibility for solving their own problems. They must sacrifice for each other because, as the Prophet Joseph Smith said, “A religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation.” (<span class="emphasis">Lectures on Faith</span> 6:7.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p30" pid="UMtag7ErTUOSqW1cAqhdnA" hash="6xiQeA">Members of the Church everywhere should ask themselves not “What can the Church do for me?” but “What can I do for myself, for the Church, and for my neighbors?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p31" pid="V7cAUcZoXkiXZi4wCuVyqQ" hash="UjqyTA">The solutions to poverty are extremely complex, and the balance between too much aid and not enough is very elusive. Our compassion can lead to failure if we give aid without creating independence and self-reliance in the recipient.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p32" pid="5CQCi0IGWUelyhHAmK16-A" hash="1_W__w">However, there is a state of human misery below which no Latter-day Saint should descend as long as others are living in abundance. Can some of us be content living affluent life-styles while others cannot afford the chlorine to purify their water? Can we ignore the most basic temporal needs of our brothers and sisters and profess belief in President Joseph F. Smith’s statement that “a religion that has not the power to save people temporally … cannot be depended upon to save them spiritually”? (quoted in Albert E. Bowen, <span class="emphasis">The Church Welfare Plan,</span> Sunday School Gospel Doctrine course, 1946, p. 36.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/principles-and-programs.p33" pid="AZozgzS3gkm1JrL7-JEg-w" hash="laRi4A">In 1936 we had a depression in the United States. Based on principles, a program was designed to fit the circumstances. Today we are an international church, and in many countries, the Saints face problems far more serious than those. Using welfare principles, solutions can be found to the challenges of today and tomorrow. May the Lord bless President Marion G. Romney and those with whom he labored for bringing to us an understanding of welfare principles. May we be as successful in meeting the challenges of our generation as our predecessors were in meeting theirs, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

One of my teenage sons said with a sly grin, “They’re not really happy, huh, Dad?” That statement has become a family joke whenever we see someone doing something we cannot do. When I see a teenager driving a beautiful, expensive sports car, I say to my sons, “Now there’s one miserable guy.”</p>

Activities always forbidden by the Lord and for many years frowned upon by society are now accepted and promoted by that same society.

Compare lifting people up to putting people down. Compare the ability to receive personal revelation and direction in your life to being tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.

Many have been successful, and more and more we see churches made up of the doctrines of men. There are absolute truths of eternity. They do not change as a society drifts from them. No popular vote can change an absolute, eternal truth. Legalizing an act does not make it moral. Don’t be fooled by the argument “Everybody’s doing it.” Your spirit should be offended and your intelligence insulted by such reasoning.</p>

As the winds of popular opinion intensify and the mocking increases from those who are trying to justify their own unrighteous actions, you will be required to put on the full armor of God. You will need to fight with all of your strength to keep unspotted from the world. We plead with you to stay true—not for us, but for you.</p>

For a fleeting second, I was tempted to turn the moment into the major crisis of the week, but, thankfully, I let it pass. A few days later we went to a school function where, to my amazement, I observed the shoelaces of all of the young men were untied. I then realized my son had fallen victim to another fad. I think it was in this same year that I found out it was no longer socially acceptable to go to school with boots, gloves, or earmuffs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p2" pid="L5idmjx0VUGtJRswyZvNAw" hash="Q-GqKQ">Sometimes we appear to be enslaved by fads and trends in society. Some are good. Some are silly but harmless. Others can be detrimental to our physical or spiritual health.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p3" pid="_kijqqc8dE6xZ3bUnTxMpA" hash="ASNR8g">Knowing the shortest distance from the world to the celestial kingdom is a straight line, the Lord has restored his gospel, which contains the truth and guidance we need to make the journey as smooth as possible. We can avoid unnecessary detours by reading the scriptures and listening to the Lord’s current prophets. As the Church holds firm to the traditional values taught by prophets of previous dispensations and reaffirmed by our modern-day prophets, the pointing finger of a failing society seems to be regularly aimed at us. One can hardly get through a day without hearing some form of criticism about the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p4" pid="oymoHaGAhU2Zg_WLht0rww" hash="JJOgFg">I will discuss three groups of critics. In order of ascending concern they are (1) nonmembers, (2) former members, and (3) current members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p5" pid="K_rIYEuukUS8U-kMmazxCg" hash="rmoOng">Responsible nonmember teasing and criticism is harmless. In fact, it helps keep us on our toes. Occasionally, we need to step back and look at ourselves from a nonmember’s perspective. Really now, <span class="emphasis">to them,</span> aren’t we just a little bit strange? Imagine yourself coming into a Mormon community for the first time and hearing talk about gold plates, an angel named Moroni, and baptisms for the dead. Imagine seeing, for the first time, nine children and two beleaguered parents in a beat-up station wagon with a bumper sticker reading, “Families are Forever.” The puzzled nonmember doesn’t know if this is a boast or a complaint. And where do these families go to church? At a stake house. We are strange to nonmembers—until they get to know us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p6" pid="qdQ7WVF5kESrZu8GeTtCEw" hash="4kccdA">In this regard, my counsel to members would be to relax, lighten up, mellow out, and not get so huffy. While the gospel is sacred and serious, sometimes we take ourselves a little too seriously. A sense of humor, especially about ourselves, is an attribute worthy of development.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p7" pid="AlBGmvFPvE-dL-vudSfLaA" hash="dm3V9A">Other criticisms we receive from nonmembers are a little more painful. Criticism always hurts most when we deserve it. There are a few active members who don’t live up to what they have been taught. They can be condescending, intolerant, or clannish. Such characteristics strike at the very heart of the second great commandment, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:39</a>.) One can be a friend to all without participating in all of their activities. How shortsighted one is to place church denominational limits on his friendships. How one robs himself when his friendship is contingent upon another’s willingness to listen to the first discussion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p8" pid="jtDu5TZZtUiFDgTwBhrEew" hash="WhYiRQ">We would eliminate the most painful criticism from responsible nonmembers by simply internalizing and living what the Church teaches.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p9" pid="P74GDr1I3UWVWC6WaM5pTw" hash="Bx4dHQ">The second category of critics is former members who have become disenchanted with the Church but who are obsessed with making vicious and vile attacks upon it. Most members and nonmembers alike see these attacks for what they really are. What credibility can possibly be given to a person who mocks beliefs held sacred by another? Anyone who would resort to these attacks unwittingly discloses his or her true character—or lack of the same. As members of the Church, we are appalled by such attacks. Hopefully, however, they make us more sensitive and extra careful not to make light of the sacred beliefs of other denominations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p10" pid="ehBSHCfQeUi09TWwSi3ONQ" hash="-qoPRQ">In addition to attacking our sacred beliefs, some former members speak evil of the Brethren. Joseph Smith received his share of this criticism from the dissidents of his day. The Lord’s revelation to him is applicable to us today:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p11" pid="BqJUVVhlFk-qgAUsXE2xxQ" hash="hpJZbA">“Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I commanded them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p12" pid="4FM9N_gvQk2ENNb1xaD5fg" hash="EDUiRg">“But those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.16-17" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:16–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p13" pid="2ScFwPCbjk6vp2u_jYBxpQ" hash="cmKafg">It seems that history continues to teach us: You can leave the Church, but you can’t leave it alone. The basic reason for this is simple. Once someone has received a witness of the Spirit and accepted it, he leaves neutral ground. One loses his testimony only by listening to the promptings of the evil one, and Satan’s goal is not complete when a person leaves the Church, but when he comes out in open rebellion against it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p14" pid="PCWz4ABUiEyLVEGZg2CPoQ" hash="XoHchA">The last category of criticism I will address comes from within the Church itself. This criticism is more lethal than that coming from nonmembers and former members. The danger lies not in what may come from a member critic, but in the chance that we might become one.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p15" pid="L_Ov5_27HUuMMEalvGNz3g" hash="Gu4oBw">One activity which often leads a member to be critical is engaging in inappropriate intellectualism. While it would seem the search for and discovery of truth should be the goal of all Latter-day Saints, it appears some get more satisfaction from trying to discover new uncertainties. I have friends who have literally spent their lives, thus far, trying to nail down every single intellectual loose end rather than accepting the witness of the Spirit and getting on with it. In so doing, they are depriving themselves of a gold mine of beautiful truths which cannot be tapped by the mind alone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p16" pid="6P5ox0NW4Eu3q_JwTUWH2g" hash="RqA22w">Elder Faust describes this type of intellectual as “a person who continues to chase after a bus even after he has caught it.” We invite everyone to get on the bus before it’s out of sight and you are left forever trying to figure out the infinite with a finite mind. In the words of Elijah, “How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18.21" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 18:21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p17" pid="o7eqTzMEE0WtF7vbS18XHQ" hash="8NZebA">Inappropriate intellectualism sometimes leads one to testify that he knows the <span class="emphasis">gospel</span> is true but believes the <span class="emphasis">Brethren</span> are just a little out of touch. Out of touch with what? Don’t confuse a decision to abstain from participating in a trend with a lack of awareness about its existence. These Brethren “prove all things” and “hold fast that which is good.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.21" class="scriptureRef">1 Thes. 5:21</a>.) To accomplish this, they are in constant touch with Him who created this earth and knows the world from beginning to end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p18" pid="U1IBJxSj4U-ZcuHdsPx1GA" hash="mqfaxQ">There are some of our members who practice selective obedience. A prophet is not one who displays a smorgasbord of truth from which we are free to pick and choose. However, some members become critical and suggest the prophet should change the menu. A prophet doesn’t take a poll to see which way the wind of public opinion is blowing. He reveals the will of the Lord to us. The world is full of deteriorating churches who have succumbed to public opinion and have become more dedicated to tickling the ears of their members than obeying the laws of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p19" pid="jAXwkDo9v0S6Znj8bujhjg" hash="BOqRUQ">In 1831, some converts wanted to bring a few of their previous beliefs into the Church with them. Our problem today is with members who seem very vulnerable to the trends in society (and the pointing fingers which attend them) and want the Church to change its position to accommodate them. The doctrinal grass on the other side of the fence looks very green to them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p20" pid="Kk0HwCTEUUKmXMfHdBJF-g" hash="7kmf5w">The Lord’s counsel in 1831 is relevant today: “Behold, I say unto you, that they desire to know the truth in part, but not all, for they are not right before me and must needs repent.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 49:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p21" pid="_kmPk67QPUOrmtOUiKiawg" hash="IPz3lw">We need to accept the full truth—even all of it—“put on the whole armour of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/6.11" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 6:11</a>), and get to work building up the kingdom. Each of us might ask ourselves, “Am I a positive contributor to building up the kingdom in our day of this dispensation of the fulness of times?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p22" pid="PxhWeuDAOkOEgsBVTxJCbA" hash="VVoU1Q">There was a time in my life when I fantasized about how valiant I would have been had I been born at another time. If I had been born of Adam, I would have saved Cain. If I had been born of Noah, the ark would have been larger in order to carry all of my converts. If I had been with Moses, we could have cut the forty years in the wilderness down to twenty. If I had been with Joseph Smith, we would still be in Jackson County living the united order. I had some wonderful fantasies. One time, as I was winning another imaginary battle, a question was placed in my mind. “You say you would have died for the Prophet Joseph Smith. What are you doing for President Spencer W. Kimball?” I was crushed by the answer to that question and made up my mind things were going to be different.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p23" pid="hbDfypJda0qbues6mhKnqg" hash="52QlAg">Why do we sometimes find it easier to accept and follow past prophets? It is partly because history has proven their counsel to be sound. Future generations will find the same to be true of the prophets of our day. Each of us might ask ourselves, “What am I doing for President Ezra Taft Benson?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p24" pid="hWVZQenI40S2Nd1L1863TA" hash="-3SPZw">As a Presiding Bishopric, we work closely with our current prophets, seers, and revelators. Based on that physical observation as well as a spiritual confirmation, I testify that these men have no desire or goal other than to assist the Lord in his purpose “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>.) I can also tell you firsthand they are highly intelligent individuals. They understand the current problems facing members of the Church throughout the world and are not naive to the major issues and trends of society. I testify to you that Ezra Taft Benson is a prophet of God and is surrounded by other special witnesses of the Savior. Jesus the Christ stands at the head of this church, and he has personally called these servants who preside over us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/follow-the-prophet.p25" pid="rG7f6IGCCEqp3QzZL6lPcA" hash="r1ISDg">In the Lord’s wisdom, he has not left any of us dependent on another’s testimony. May the Lord bless each of us to obtain and retain our personal witness and then follow the Brethren. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Suddenly, the silence and serenity of the moment are shattered by the piercing scream of one of your children. You bolt out of your comfortable chair and meet your child who is running hysterically up the front steps. It is obvious there is a cut that will require stitches. In a fraction of a second you form an opinion of what took place. Consequently, the first words out of your mouth, rather than words of sympathy and comfort, are, “Oh, son, why can’t you be more careful? When are you going to learn to mind me? I’ve told you a thousand times not to play on the garage roof!” Our children will testify that none of us ever claims to have told them two, three, nine, or fifteen times. We always claim to have told them a thousand times.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p2" pid="dDWK51V08065lRHU_VMadg" hash="EnlUZA">Just as earthly parents have issued warnings, the Lord has warned His children. “And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:4</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p3" pid="TW-CXOTZXUu3r2TEn0MJAA" hash="9oARuw">And after their testimonies “cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall cause groanings in the midst of [the earth]. …</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p9" pid="NC-Zf-ogLEWKWJHZZ6pcjQ" hash="d049gg">It may be an understatement to say the Lord’s warnings have begun. How are we responding to the cries for help from God’s children? Do we ask, “Why don’t you be more careful?” “Why don’t you mind the Lord?” “Our Church leaders have told you a thousand times to change your behavior.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p10" pid="V63vmpWJwkWifP3cQGFVfQ" hash="mpuYVA">Prior to discussing how we should respond, I would like to suggest, in today’s vernacular, two attitude adjustments. First, we need to overcome fatalism. We know the prophecies of the future. We know the final outcome. We know the world collectively will not repent and consequently the last days will be filled with much pain and suffering. Therefore, we could throw up our hands and do nothing but pray for the end to come so the millennial reign could begin. To do so would forfeit our right to participate in the grand event we are all awaiting. We must all become players in the winding-up scene, not spectators. We must do all we can to prevent calamities, and then do everything possible to assist and comfort the victims of tragedies that do occur.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p11" pid="epkaYZooPU-y0JdGezmAMQ" hash="oe81hw">Lehi set an excellent example for us in the way he handled his knowledge relative to the future of Laman and Lemuel. Early in their lives, Lehi had a vision that disclosed Laman and Lemuel would not partake of the fruit of the tree of life. Immediately after the vision, however, “he did exhort them … with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord would be merciful to them.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.37" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:37</a>.) During the remainder of Lehi’s life, Laman and Lemuel’s actions gave him little hope that they would repent. However, he never gave up but labored with them and loved them even with his dying breath. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 1:21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p12" pid="4yK7D79P-0efcGopoNwYyQ" hash="a4whPQ">The great prophet Mormon set another example worthy of emulation. He lived at a time that was hopeless. Imagine this: “There were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not come upon any, because of their wickedness and unbelief.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/1.14" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 1:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p13" pid="T-p6WcUJ9Em7lVTl3sbGgA" hash="PSrhiA">In spite of this hopeless situation Mormon led their armies, for, in his words, “Notwithstanding their wickedness I … loved them, according to the love of God which was in me, with all my heart; and my soul had been poured out in prayer unto my God all the day long for them.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/3.12" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 3:12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p14" pid="sjac3E7U1EmEYLXc7gabzw" hash="FkjmYA">This prophet had Christlike love for a fallen people. Can we be content with loving less? We must press forward with the pure love of Christ to spread the good news of the gospel. As we do so and fight the war of good against evil, light against darkness, and truth against falsehood, we must not neglect our responsibility of dressing the wounds of those who have fallen in battle. There is no room in the kingdom for fatalism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p15" pid="nslzmoS3uk25XLy2QPphlQ" hash="deSm8g">The second attitude adjustment is to not allow ourselves to find satisfaction in calamities of the last days. Sometimes we tend to take joy in seeing the natural consequences of sin unfold. We might feel some vindication for being ignored by most of the world and persecuted and berated by others. When we see earthquakes, wars, famines, disease, poverty, and heartbreak, we may be tempted to say, “Well, we warned them. We told them a thousand times not to engage in those activities.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p16" pid="0XRVyxsiB02u3Np5lr9_PQ" hash="2jBPmQ">We should take these proverbs to heart:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p17" pid="jnoFFlEwqkqnx0QkGspVXw" hash="yxQW7w">“He that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/17.5" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 17:5</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p18" pid="hvVYUbPuXUCxA4HNyi-GUQ" hash="5Q77vw">“Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/24.17" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 24:17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p19" pid="BSF-ZMVjEEa5UZ2Csg8xWw" hash="Ykb18w">On this subject Job said: “For I should have denied the God that is above.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p20" pid="Vg5nzGX3VEqPdokb8zdT3w" hash="_HBjUA">“If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/31.28-29" class="scriptureRef">Job 31:28–29</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p21" pid="-CMah5pGmkC1JBAmCFgppg" hash="KqbwBw">King Benjamin addressed the sin of judging a person in need very clearly:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p22" pid="WW_ai1q2wUadniMlWj4wbw" hash="qgZhrA">“Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just—</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p23" pid="ypxdvBVooU6Dtf5JGJCY8Q" hash="1Fd8eg">“But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.17-18" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:17–18</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p24" pid="uLlFBXZP5UC0J8Q7e8oc2w" hash="9qpUew">We know many wounds are self-inflicted and could have been avoided simply by obeying gospel principles. However, to shrug it off as “their problem” is not acceptable to the Lord. He said, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:28</a>.) Although He does not condone sin, His arms are always open to the repentant sinner. In modern revelation the Lord has asked us to go one step further: “I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p25" pid="FYOfRKe7ZEu08dQI0HUAoA" hash="2STjEA">Our forgiveness must be manifest by reaching out to help mend wounds even when they are the result of transgression. To react in any other way would be akin to setting up a lung cancer clinic for nonsmokers only. Whether the pain has come to someone who is completely innocent or is something of his own making is irrelevant. When a person has been hit by a truck, we don’t withhold our help even when it is obvious he didn’t stay in the pedestrian lane.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p26" pid="qF_qiaHfr026EXGjiYXdaw" hash="Qc5VRQ">While some of the world’s suffering can be traced to an individual’s disobedience or lack of judgment, there is wholesale suffering taking place that is not the result of anyone’s own mistakes. Millions of people around the world go to sleep hungry. In their waking hours, they are racked with disease and other afflictions. The causes are many, varied, and complex. Also, natural disasters fall on the righteous as well as the wicked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p27" pid="LJWeAsQIB0mV9FieVF5ekQ" hash="bQhr6w">Now that we have discussed some attitude adjustments concerning fatalism and having any joy in calamities, what action should we take? What should we be doing as a church and as individuals in response to the mammoth need in the world?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p28" pid="R6-j2gs8xkmRG7IIwv6EeA" hash="czsYnw">Our numbers are few. For every member of the Church in the world, there are approximately a thousand who are not. Our resources are limited, and the needs of the world are vast. We cannot do everything, but we must do everything we can.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p29" pid="Uos41wgIG0CrSvAfCr_VBA" hash="jGNBmA">The Brethren closely monitor the multitude of crises throughout the world and give assistance to a wide range of countries. The assistance is given where the need seems to be the greatest without consideration to the political or religious ideologies that exist in each country.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p30" pid="MrK6uj_NeUyDyPO_4SPraA" hash="a9X44A">On this subject, Joseph Smith, in response to the question, “What is required to constitute good [Church] membership?” said, among other things, “He is to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to provide for the widow, to dry up the tear of the orphan, to comfort the afflicted, whether in this church, or in any other, or in no church at all, wherever he finds them.” (<span class="emphasis">Times and Seasons,</span> 15 Mar. 1842, p. 732.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p31" pid="qqzz3Mw-4UKNA9lXLaKjsg" hash="pgqgOA">More recently President Hinckley said, “Where there is stark hunger, regardless of the cause, I will not let political considerations dull my sense of mercy or thwart my responsibility to the sons and daughters of God, wherever they may be or whatever their circumstances.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1985, p. 54.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p32" pid="Nr8t8j5SDUitkVxsjEKQcA" hash="OQUeig">As Church members read accounts or see graphic pictures of human suffering, they are touched and ask, “What can we do?” Most of us will not be in a position to help on a person-to-person basis when the need is many miles away. However, every member of the Church can pray for peace throughout the world and for the well-being of all its inhabitants. Also, members may fast and increase their fast offerings when they are able and thus enable the Church to do more.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p33" pid="ptBWUxqL3EuVuV1Fm8TZuA" hash="tPmU_w">As far as person-to-person assistance is concerned, the greatest compassionate service each of us can give may be in our own neighborhoods and communities. Wherever we live in the world there is pain and sorrow all around us. We need to take more initiative as individuals in deciding how we can best be of service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p34" pid="cSbfUYw3NkmLhiOYqYKsoQ" hash="rjpRHw">The fact that a particular activity is not sponsored by the Church does not mean it is not worthy of a Church member’s support. As individuals, we should become knowledgeable of the opportunities around us. I fear some members suffer from action paralysis, waiting for the Church to put its stamp of approval on one organization or another. The Church teaches principles. Use those principles and the Spirit to decide which organizations you would like to support.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p35" pid="YmY_xXgesk-rNAaOmO5l7g" hash="dY7XIA">The Lord said, “Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27</a>.) Good things can be done through the Church organization, community organizations, and very often through no formal organization at all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p36" pid="ZrHqNtkV502wtJnmIVQx9Q" hash="yccBWQ">We must reach out beyond the walls of our own church. In humanitarian work, as in other areas of the gospel, we cannot become the salt of the earth if we stay in one lump in the cultural halls of our beautiful meetinghouses. We need not wait for a call or an assignment from a Church leader before we become involved in activities that are best carried out on a community or individual basis.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p37" pid="DuKWAE0PNkexvhLWw1EU7Q" hash="vPf3mg">When we get emotionally and spiritually involved in helping a person who is in pain, a compassion enters our heart. It hurts, but the process lifts some of the pain from another. We get from the experience a finite look into the Savior’s pain as He performed the infinite Atonement. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, a sanctification takes place within our souls and we become more like our Savior. We gain a better understanding of what was meant when He said, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-thousand-times.p38" pid="CN7sNzjK3k2dgMRJmEna9g" hash="wcr0NA">As the last days unfold, we will see all the prophecies fulfilled. We will see today’s problems compounded, and we will see new challenges scarcely imaginable at this time. We must reach out to those who are suffering from these events. We must not become fatalistic or judgmental—even if we warn the people in the world something a thousand times and they heed us not. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

For example, I was a fussy eater, and when we went to visit our grandparents I was constantly faced with being offered food I didn’t like. To minimize my embarrassment, when the plate was passed to me, I would turn to my sister and ask, “Collene, do I like this?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p2" pid="3N3Ew4Z-qUyf2uP9CI0UVA" hash="05MfFA">If it was familiar and she knew I didn’t like it, she would say, “No, he doesn’t like that.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p3" pid="2DhyAIH73kOutx23VkEgCw" hash="Vj0c6g">I could then say to Grandma, “She’s right, I don’t like it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p4" pid="619wUUVlC02KDyx5HK86BQ" hash="4ImzEA">If it was something we hadn’t eaten before she would say, “Just a minute,” and taste it, and then tell me if I liked it or not. If she said I didn’t like it, no amount of coaxing could get me to eat it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p5" pid="ZGuK_TTbZ0aQbPXWmcXweA" hash="0I_dMg">I know it is past time for me to rely on my own taste buds and stop denying myself healthy food just because my sister told me I didn’t like it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p6" pid="9ID2ohSmW0mD7_LPtOZTIQ" hash="bik2tg">On a much more serious note, I believe the time has come for all of us to feast on the fruit of our own testimony as opposed to the testimony of another person. The testimony of which I speak is much deeper than knowing the Church is true. We need to progress to the point of knowing we are true to the Church. We also need to increase our capacity to receive personal revelation. It is one thing to receive a witness that Joseph Smith saw God and Christ. It is quite another to have spiritual self-confidence in your ability to receive the revelation to which you are entitled.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p7" pid="d3W48V84jEOLwPTOaakISg" hash="5dETFQ">Many of us take the blessings of the gospel for granted. It is as if we are passengers on the train of the Church, which has been moving forward gradually and methodically. Sometimes we have looked out the window and thought, “That looks kind of fun out there. This train is so restrictive.” So we have jumped off and gone and played in the woods for a while. Sooner or later we find it isn’t as much fun as Lucifer makes it appear or we get critically injured, so we work our way back to the tracks and see the train ahead. With a determined sprint we catch up to it, breathlessly wipe the perspiration from our forehead, and thank the Lord for repentance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p8" pid="0JgIA7WqoEq2gk6K46ua5A" hash="QXacxg">While on the train we can see the world and some of our own members outside laughing and having a great time. They taunt us and coax us to get off. Some throw logs and rocks on the tracks to try and derail it. Other members run alongside the tracks, and while they may never go play in the woods, they just can’t seem to get on the train. Others try to run ahead and too often take the wrong turn.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p9" pid="-tbwCGgQTE60digJ4raHLg" hash="7yBXNw">I would propose that the luxury of getting on and off the train as we please is fading. The speed of the train is increasing. The woods are getting much too dangerous, and the fog and darkness are moving in.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p10" pid="k9AdeHO80E2puNHDl1D3rw" hash="h4KqTw">Although our detractors might as well “stretch forth [their] puny arm[s] to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:33</a>) as try to derail this train, they are occasionally successful in coaxing individuals off. With all the prophecies we have seen fulfilled, what great event are we awaiting prior to saying, “Count me in”? What more do we need to see or experience before we get on the train and stay on it until we reach our destination? It is time for a spiritual revival. It is time to dig down deep within ourselves and rekindle our own light.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p11" pid="2LTcPOOHXE6h0Dgev15rCg" hash="ZXCq3g">President Joseph F. Smith said, “One fault to be avoided by the Saints, young and old, is the tendency to live on borrowed light [and] to permit … the light within them to be reflected, rather than original” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 5th ed. [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939], p. 87).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p12" pid="RVu9LtBnaUWEANwMXODfFA" hash="-Os_TA">The whole world seems to be in commotion. Today’s news is filled with accounts of large-scale famine, civil unrest, and natural disasters. Even more devastating in the long run is the spiritually destructive hurricane of disobedience to God’s commandments that is engulfing the world. This horrible storm is blowing the moral fiber out of the nations of the earth and leaving the land in moral desolation. Many people seem to be oblivious to this hurricane and have become so desensitized they don’t even feel a breeze.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p13" pid="2ZeT_mgN1ECxQ7OPGOalyA" hash="lhq3DQ">We are following a cycle which was repeated over and over again in the Book of Mormon. As the Lord tells us, “In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but, in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:8</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p14" pid="bod-SKbWZUe7Xj6jUCb3Bw" hash="rI6v7w">We shouldn’t be too surprised, therefore, that the Lord is allowing some wake-up calls to jar us loose from apathy just as he has done in previous dispensations. In the book of Helaman, Nephi said, “And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, … they will not remember him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.3" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 12:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p15" pid="KiKXlVUokk2Fi2HXaK7USg" hash="FlvX7A">In our dispensation the Lord has said, “And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 105:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p16" pid="bx-DxnVN7EWc7D0WFI60HQ" hash="QqReAA">To some, the events unfolding in the world today are frightening. This is not a time to panic, but it is definitely a time to prepare. What can we do to better prepare ourselves for that which is at our doorstep? It is simple. We need to get back to basics and “learn obedience.” When we are obedient, we follow the first principles of the gospel and place our faith in our Lord and Savior; we repent of our sins; we are baptized and receive the Holy Ghost to guide us. We read and ponder the scriptures, pray for direction in our lives, and look for ways to help others who are going through difficult times. We share the gospel with people living on earth and make it possible for saving ordinances to be performed for those who have passed beyond the veil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p17" pid="6SXcKyQyzkC2WFHbYVjCrA" hash="10rlIw">During this conference and on many other occasions we will be taught by the Lord’s anointed servants. These prophets, seers, and revelators receive revelation relative to the kingdom to which their mantle entitles them. We follow the Brethren. Finally, we prepare ourselves to receive an endowment in the temple. If we remain faithful, this endowment literally gives us additional power to overcome the sins of the world and “stand in holy places.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p18" pid="ax6lXzu_I0qxkChFnZJb1w" hash="f3dbrQ">I make a special appeal to the youth. You will remain much safer and infinitely happier if you will place your energy into current obedience rather than saving it for future repentance. When we are obedient, we establish a base from which the challenges of the future can be addressed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p19" pid="MAVQ-qv1i0ykfKVxP7E2ng" hash="RzF8iA">In spite of our obedience, trials and tribulations will come our way. Disasters and tribulation are not always for the punishment of the wicked, but often for the sanctification of the righteous. We admire the early members of the Church for their faithfulness through their numerous trials. It is interesting to contemplate whether they succeeded in facing their obstacles because of their spirituality or whether they were spiritual because of the obstacles they faced.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p20" pid="UIXavJ1Ov0CK5_vcx_QkoQ" hash="YNOSZA">Into each of our lives come golden moments of adversity. This painful friend breaks our hearts, drops us to our knees, and makes us realize we are nothing without our Lord and Savior. This friend makes us plead all the night long for reassurance and into the next day and sometimes for weeks and months. But, ultimately, just as surely as the day follows the night, as we remain true and faithful, this strange friend, adversity, leads us straight into the outstretched arms of the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p21" pid="1anlxkFH9kqurxoURkeF2g" hash="suEBDw">I have tried to understand why we must experience tribulation before we can experience the ultimate communication. It seems there is an intense concentration which must be obtained before our pleadings reach our Father in Heaven and, perhaps even more importantly, before He can get through to us. Sometimes we must be straining very hard to hear the still small voice. Before we can be taught things hidden from the world, we must be on a spiritual frequency which is out of this world. Adversity can help fine-tune this frequency. Even the Savior communicated more intensely with our Father in Heaven when he was in agony. When the Lord was in Gethsemane, Luke recorded, “And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.44" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:44</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p22" pid="2ghazAE7Zk6Jrx-RmfHLeQ" hash="fI-lyw">The challenge for each of us, in order to prevent having to receive constant wake-up calls, is to remain obedient once we have turned upward. As the storm clears, it is possible to stay in tune by being valiant in our testimonies. We can then enjoy reprieves—sometimes long ones—and have a taste of heaven on earth. Nevertheless, it does not seem to be in the plan to have a whole lifetime of bliss if our goal is increased spirituality and perfection.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p23" pid="Tbf15os6L02Objj1DSffyw" hash="WIf-tQ">It is my hope that each of us will experience a spiritual revival as we become more obedient. This increased depth of spirituality will help give us the perspective we need to face today’s adversities and the strength we need for tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-revival.p24" pid="6M2wQ7Y85USA0eLiReEAcA" hash="L1Dh-w">While the world is in commotion, the kingdom is intact. We are living in the greatest and most exciting part of our dispensation since the Restoration itself. We plead with everyone to become active participants in building the kingdom. This is the hour of our opportunity, to which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We lost the game. I really hate it when that happens. We listened to the coaches’ show on the ride back to our home in Bountiful. When it was over, my children had no alternative but to listen to my own postgame show. Just as I had completed my final analysis of what went wrong in the game, my seven-year-old daughter asked, “Dad, when you see the temple, do you get a good feeling inside?” I wondered, <span class="emphasis">Where in the world did that come from?</span> As I was trying to figure out what that comment had to do with the football game, I glanced over at her and could see she was looking out the window at the Salt Lake Temple. For some reason the game no longer mattered.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/a-temple-for-west-africa.p2" pid="VXSGFaiHbUCX4NN1G-mnSQ" hash="OWYP0w">My whole life has been enriched by experiences of the temple. Our parents would take us to Temple Square in Salt Lake City on a regular basis. They would point to the temple and tell us that they were married there and because of that we would always be together as a family. What comfort that brought to a little boy whose biggest fear was that his parents might die. Now what comfort it brings to a grown man whose parents have passed on to the other side.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/a-temple-for-west-africa.p3" pid="QexBbEjoWUmI6HIbe-x6tg" hash="R37Ofw">When I was 10 years old, in the shadows of the Salt Lake Temple I first read the Joseph Smith story and received a powerful testimony of the truthfulness of the Restoration.</p>

In subsequent years I have had the honor of performing the temple marriages of each of our six children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/a-temple-for-west-africa.p6" pid="Pc02oucudU6wdioLhtBkWQ" hash="IGpKmA">We know many members of the Church have not had the luxury I have had of growing up around temples. Because of this knowledge we were all thrilled with the announcement made by President Hinckley in October of 1997 when he said, “We are determined … to take the temples to the people and afford them every opportunity for the very precious blessings that come of temple worship” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1997, 69; or <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1997, 50).</p>

We are witnessing a modern-day miracle and fulfillment of prophecy. What a wonderful time to be alive!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/a-temple-for-west-africa.p8" pid="wucJjl6ImE-arjTWa2tR5g" hash="25SEdw">Our excitement over the building of temples is not shared by all. The adversary in particular is having a major temper tantrum as he sees his power threatened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/a-temple-for-west-africa.p9" pid="-hQO4V-okU-_jcDegqInbw" hash="jAz4iQ">Over the last two years I have witnessed his wrath firsthand in West Africa. He has been very active, trying to prevent the building of a temple in that part of the world. Two years ago President Hinckley announced that there would be a temple in West Africa located in Accra, Ghana. Since then the adversary has been relentless in trying to prevent that from happening. Why is Lucifer so concerned?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/a-temple-for-west-africa.p10" pid="ARdwW1KWV02UwjRE7uiJpQ" hash="XIT0zg">We have 85,000 members in West Africa, and the Church is growing very rapidly. Sacrament meeting attendance is over 50 percent, but currently only 400 members have been endowed because of the prohibitive expense of traveling thousands of miles to Johannesburg or London. We have over 700 full-time African missionaries serving in the mission field, and very few of them have been endowed.</p>

Now, at last, they can receive every blessing available to God’s children. Worthy members can receive the temple endowment and be able to have their families sealed together for time and for all eternity.</p>

As Elder John A. Widtsoe explained, “They will attain more readily to their place in the presence of the Lord; they will increase more rapidly in every divine power; they will approach more nearly to the likeness of God; they will more completely realize their divine destiny” (<span class="emphasis">Evidences and Reconciliations</span> [1960], 300).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/a-temple-for-west-africa.p13" pid="KN7jjiO12EyEYPHSpmhEvQ" hash="j78RaA">That is why Lucifer is so concerned. In addition, he is aware of the large number of Africans who have accepted the gospel on the other side of the veil and are anxiously awaiting their proxy baptism and temple endowment as well as being sealed to their families. When a temple is dedicated, the dam in the spirit world will break and there will be a flood of humanity who have lived on the African continent flow into the temple of the Lord as their descendants do their work for them. We should not be surprised that Lucifer is using every means at his disposal to keep a temple from these people.</p>

I know the Savior loves the African people. Therefore, to paraphrase verse 33 of the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants, “As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the [Congo] river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from [building a temple for the African Latter-day Saints].”</p>

As we left Provo we could see the temple up on the hill. Before it was out of sight, the Mount Timpanogos Utah Temple came into view, and then the Jordan River Utah Temple appeared, followed by the Salt Lake Temple. And immediately thereafter we could see the Bountiful Utah Temple standing like a jewel above that city.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p1" pid="ZkB_98mbvEKQjdKZnUjiXA" hash="9J5Jmg">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="78"></span>Some time ago I had a delightful conversation with an impressive 16-year-old young woman. I discovered she was the only member of the Church in her high school. I asked her, “What is the most difficult challenge you face being the only member?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p2" pid="ireiViyD2k2SnYaHaiglpA" hash="crRqfg">She was thoughtful and gave a very astute answer: “It is believing something is true when everyone else believes it is false, and believing something is wrong when everyone else believes it’s all right.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p3" pid="34R_Fq4HM0ixaL1yfmtXcA" hash="r8GLXg">I asked her a second question: “Do you know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God?” Her response was, “I think so, but I’m not sure.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p4" pid="1OrmgSqSg0yYuNtRN-M8Fg" hash="3UYGTw">This morning I would like to ask the youth throughout the Church, “Do you know?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p5" pid="yOFnNsCgNEeDcTikKSdPXA" hash="6XuWiw">The first time I knew I had a testimony of Joseph Smith was when I was just 11 years old and my parents took me to Temple Square in Salt Lake City.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p6" pid="NPh6ZuILXUeQ83i7XO94iA" hash="97NM9w">My favorite activity was to collect all the free stuff. I became very adept at working the system. I would ask, “Is this free?” After a positive response I would reach out my 11-year-old hand and say, “Thank you. Is that free too? Thank you!” On occasion someone might say, “No, I’m sorry; those cost five cents.” Undeterred, I would lower my head and, showing much disappointment, say, “Oh, I always wanted to read that pamphlet, but I don’t have any money. Thank you!” It worked every time. The truth is, I never read it. I just collected it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p7" pid="QRTaYzrJokOaOEEGjtGtPQ" hash="5t0fKQ">However, on this particular trip, I was alone in our 1948 Chevrolet, waiting for my parents, when I became inescapably bored. In desperation I looked down at the seat and spotted my stack of free stuff. I picked up a pamphlet entitled <span class="emphasis">Joseph Smith Tells His Own Story</span> and began to read it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p8" pid="5lUtBrgq8EmBTyifyqPhiA" hash="-ttQ3Q">I was riveted, and my heart was filled with joy. After completing it, I caught my reflection in the rearview mirror, and much to my surprise, I was crying. I didn’t understand then, but I understand now. I had felt a witness of the Spirit. My parents weren’t there. My sister wasn’t there. My Primary teacher wasn’t there. It was just me and the Spirit of the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p9" pid="2RcoqlWSoEO_wSx254HqHw" hash="Eczhyg">Now, this can happen to you, and something similar probably already has.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p10" pid="iIgSn57dc0Ge8f8WmO1idw" hash="f73mng">When seeking a testimony, those of you born into the Church may be looking for some spectacular spiritual feeling different than anything you have ever felt before. You may have heard converts testify of their conversion and wonder if you’re missing something. One reason it seems so spectacular to them is that it is new.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p11" pid="Ag4PKk3V8ka0ErKvsnPjIA" hash="nxTrBg">You have had the same feelings your whole life during family home evenings, youth testimony meetings, seminary classes, scripture reading, and on many other occasions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p12" pid="J6Wd00inxUabD58iLrlIKg" hash="7uNWfQ">Our missionaries are trained to help investigators recognize when they are feeling the Spirit. I remember on numerous occasions stopping in the middle of an intense, spiritual discussion and saying, “Let’s pause for a moment and talk about what you are feeling right now. You’re feeling like we’ve reminded you of things you had forgotten. You’re feeling that we are telling you the truth. You’re feeling peace. You’re feeling the Holy Ghost.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p13" pid="_QV04wWKZkyBV0GN5s0LSg" hash="mOSHag">I remember teaching an extremely intelligent woman who had a hard time accepting anything until she had nailed down every intellectual loose end. However, at long last we heard her say, “I cannot deny this feeling any longer.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p14" pid="L6inIZML30izBynkdOvXHA" hash="N9Mkng">She joined the Church and was very happy for the next few years, but she gradually let her intellectual doubts creep back in and ultimately left the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p15" pid="GBUJ5rgj7kWVdCmokDfYGg" hash="dxNqsQ">Fifteen years went by, and she came to visit our family. We took her to Temple Square. As we started up the circular ramp leading to the statue of the Savior, she paused and tearfully said, “Here comes that feeling again. My heart still yearns for what my mind won’t accept!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p16" pid="rpCFFgORlU-RRkQEeQXd3A" hash="3gZNsQ">Once you have felt it, you can never forget it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p17" pid="NnkmpyiYT02das1Y9nz6tA" hash="93HdFQ">Spiritual witnesses come at a young age to those who are exposed to spiritual experiences. As parents, teachers, <span class="pageBreak" page-number="79"></span>and leaders, we are good at making certain you understand the rules and commandments. We could improve on helping you gain a testimony of the principles and doctrine. Perhaps we could pause more often and help you learn to recognize the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p18" pid="pSwxPWeprUesda-l0ONUfw" hash="6rEUXg">Once you recognize those feelings for what they are, your faith in them will increase. Soon you will find that you have developed a spiritual sixth sense which cannot be misled.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p19" pid="4BnxTfaXqEChE8Dw2Cx4wA" hash="T3TMnA">At 11 years of age, I knew Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I didn’t hear voices, see angels, or anything like that. What I felt was much more certain. My spiritual sense had been touched. I felt elation springing forth from the innermost part of my being, which is protected from all deceit. This spiritual sense vibrates only when activated by the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p20" pid="za5uWS7Y5Uq_0wZ3qUTQ9g" hash="9FSeQg">How does this spiritual witness feel? It is as difficult to describe as the scent of a rose or the song of a bird or the beauty of a landscape. Nevertheless, you know it when you feel it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p21" pid="Cp-QdSzflEmd9GS2y-m6cw" hash="-qMKcw">The scriptures give us some insights into these feelings:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p22" pid="Hue9KtTVZkyZCj6gfLRw6Q" hash="HiQPog">“Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy; and then shall ye know” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.13-14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 11:13–14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p23" pid="UJWzs9iNZ0i844z_TbgA1g" hash="SuF4dg">Sometimes the feeling is like a memory. We first learned the gospel in our heavenly home. We have come to this earth with a veil of forgetfulness. And yet lingering in each of our spirits are those dormant memories. The Holy Ghost can part the veil and bring those things out of their dormancy. Often my reaction to a supposedly newfound truth is, “Oh, I remember that!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p24" pid="rhZBcoG2I0yjpm4SSm51FQ" hash="kJVm7w">“The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost … [will] bring all things to your remembrance” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p25" pid="nprhIzDfykS5STudZPukWA" hash="2zjQ2A">My young brothers and sisters, I invite you to “experiment upon my words” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:27</a>). Will you read and pray about the Joseph Smith story?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/do-you-know.p26" pid="tXWApSwcAEiPjnKlEg-yMA" hash="RyCs3A">The wonderful thing about knowing it is true is that you know simultaneously that God the Father and Jesus Christ live and stand at the head of this Church today. I gained that knowledge when I was 11, and now I stand before you as an ordained especial witness of Jesus Christ and testify it is true. I also testify that the Lord wants you to know it is true, and He “will [reveal] the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 10:4</a>). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
