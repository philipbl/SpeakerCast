      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p2" guid="348456d8-4bc4-41df-8c6a-5aacb0aa886c" pid="fkV6K-g7C0aPJrxvSLCdEA" hash="68TQNg">Certainly the most successful lives are those that have the most worthwhile experiences. The religion of Christ itself is not so much a set of ideas as it is a set of activities. The purpose of the Church is to help us translate the principles of the gospel of Christ into constructive, meaningful human experience. And everyone should work toward this end by a daily practice of thinking some uplifting thoughts, listening to some fine music, reading some stimulating literature, doing some good deeds, and having some great experiences every day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p3" guid="b8db13e7-af45-4e81-9e94-fa429be9db39" pid="rnL7d2bTRk6sJ4T60ww5uA" hash="vD1qCg">Because we draw so much from the rebellion, weakness, and evil with which we are surrounded, we tend to load ourselves up too heavily with guilt complexes, mental problems, insecurity, and mediocrity. I recently heard of a man who compounded the problem by hoarding his mistakes. He often referred to the fact that his D.F.T. drawer was the largest file in his office. Someone once asked him what these file letters stood for, and he said they identified a collection of the damn fool things that he had done. Most of us are not bad people—we just let our D.F.T. files get too large.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p4" guid="012ff40d-3e05-4117-8788-364020a14dc2" pid="EgavhtzgpkiAo9VQmHjw4g" hash="wFXZ1w">The scriptures themselves make almost as many references to fools as to sinners. And if we were trying to make the most effective application of Solomon’s text, we might take the positive approach and make a written collection of our experiences—not just those that we have had in the past, but those that we plan to have in the future. For whenever excellence is recounted, it is increased.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p5" guid="9d79a87f-3997-489e-8f20-6019d6fde548" pid="e9ScGYosrEap5EHJutVzag" hash="QCnzoA">Recently a group of bishops were asked for a report on their work. They were told not to discuss their problems, but to describe what they did better than anyone else. This philosophy of excellence was demonstrated by the artist Whistler, who once painted a tiny picture of a spray of roses. The artistry involved was magnificent. Never before, it seemed, had the art of man been able to execute quite so deftly a reproduction of the art of nature. The picture was the envy of the artists who saw it, the despair of the collectors who yearned to buy it for their collections, but Whistler refused steadfastly to sell it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p6" guid="6c254741-30b4-4ed0-b8b7-337be8fef8e2" pid="iTurSaBQvkCaD-uw2Ue_Jg" hash="AeH1sg">“For,” said he, “whenever I feel that my hand has lost its cunning, whenever I doubt my ability, I look at the little picture of the spray of roses and say to myself, ‘Whistler, you painted that. Your hand drew it. Your imagination conceived the colors. Your skill put the roses on the canvas.’ Then,” he said, “I know that what I have done I can do again.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p7" guid="d02ed2e0-d6ef-4635-b6ea-f3f82fbbbcfe" pid="MFjNzMfx-0S5tpfIece27A" hash="GmTwzA">Then he gave us a great philosophy of success. He said, “Hang on the walls of your mind the memory of your successes. Take counsel of your strength, not your weakness. Think of the good jobs you have done. Think of the times when you rose above your average level of performance and carried out an idea or a dream or a desire for which you had deeply longed. Hang these pictures on the walls of your mind and look at them as you travel the roadway of life.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p8" guid="ee4850c5-2925-46a2-9133-20fd07e1658a" pid="CsOcoJ_zQE6KCEROguhpxA" hash="LVOPJw">Now I am not going to burden you this afternoon with the contents of my D.F.T. file, but I would like to tell you about some of my great experiences. Great experience number one is that I managed to get myself born, and I have been very pleased about that ever since.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p9" guid="2391e171-bc5c-42fd-a011-4d74a0aa94c1" pid="33I_TUHtrkuQOiuHG9gc9w" hash="AAN-Gw">Henry Thoreau, an early American philosopher, once said that we should thank God every day of our lives for the privilege of having been born. And then he went on to speculate on the rather unique supposition of what it might have been like if we had not been born. Just suppose that you had never been born or that your parents had never been born. Think of all of the excitement and opportunities you would have missed as a consequence. What Mr. Thoreau may not have known was that one-third of all of the children of God never were born and never can be born because they failed to pass the requirements of their first estate. And yet, every spirit child of God hungers for a body. We remember the unembodied spirits who appeared to Jesus in his day who preferred to have the bodies of swine rather than not to have any bodies at all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p10" guid="fa93db57-b663-4845-93ad-949767ae6a78" pid="Q-DwsWs1-Eebhhu3GvAVFw" hash="L3nIcg">In my own case, I didn’t find out that I had been born until quite a long time after it happened. And I am still finding out many important things about the good fortunes of my birth. I eventually discovered that I had inherited two parents who were very interested in my welfare. And I am very glad that they were not members of this modern breed of abortionists who are followers of King Herod in his program of slaughtering the innocents. My parents were pretty poor in material things, but I have discovered that even a little adversity can have many advantages. The poet helps us with this idea when he says,</p>

And so, on August 27, 1911, I was born of the water and of the Spirit in the exact manner prescribed by the Savior of the world. I became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and had the gift of the Holy Ghost officially conferred upon me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p14" guid="f08a8435-f505-421e-ba61-a23e29cafd6b" pid="PxRCMdduGk-aVTnAuYyIUQ" hash="kemNjw">Then I had another great experience. I discovered that I could be reborn as many times as I desired, and that each time I could be reborn better. Phillip Brooks was once asked when he was born and he said, “It was one Sunday afternoon when I was twenty-five years old, just after I had finished reading a great book.” Saul of Tarsus was reborn on the Damascus road. Joseph Smith was born again after reading a great scripture.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p15" guid="d7d1c24f-e502-457a-9039-7571029230e1" pid="g97tKzmzOUeLQ9wsJT1Yag" hash="dxoqMQ">In 1932, Walter Pitkin wrote his book <span class="emphasis">Life Begins at Forty, </span>but that is ridiculous. Life begins every morning. Life begins when we begin. And our real lives begin when we determine to live by every word of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p16" guid="80bfc265-4c60-486d-8a20-56e896d17701" pid="lP-on2zKpUeFebQJEiaN8Q" hash="glxTKA">I had another great experience when I was nine years old. In sacrament meeting one Sunday someone mentioned an article in the <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era </span>that had been written by President Heber J. Grant. And while I didn’t understand all about it, I was impressed that it was very important. And I thought what a great experience it would be if I could get possession of this magazine so I could go over it as many times as necessary for me to thoroughly understand it. Finally I took my small savings and subscribed to this great magazine. I don’t read as many good things as I should now, but back in those cow-herding days I had a little more free time and I read every article, including every advertisement in each issue. And sometimes I went over some of them many times. And I was born again each time a new issue was published.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p17" guid="2d9ab95e-894e-4402-b4c6-83bd6b80def6" pid="6smekNrNnkijdZ40mif7PQ" hash="lWbiZQ">Later I was married to a wonderful wife in the temple of the Lord, and our family is sealed together for time and for all eternity. I have in my possession a Holy Bible, and I have run each of its teachings through my mind many times. I also have three great volumes of new scripture, outlining in every detail the simple principles of the gospel of Christ. And each is attested by a “thus saith the Lord.” And I was born again when I firmly resolved to live every one of these important precepts of salvation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p18" guid="be6211cf-01c0-4de6-a8c6-130fa5c8a137" pid="2A1GbMSq-UmpnIdKeJulmg" hash="Xvdppg">Through my occupation I have had some part in helping to carry forward the work of the world. But I have also had a part in helping to carry forward the work of the Lord, and I may have as much of a part as I desire in that great enterprise in which God himself spends his entire time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p19" guid="ea42733d-6006-4b95-8016-7b7d8146951d" pid="NixHzz4avUCvuPg8D5VDIg" hash="beyHYQ">I am presently in possession of the world’s most valuable information. I know that God lives, that we were created in his image, and that by obeying the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the offspring of God may eventually hope to become like their eternal parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p20" guid="5ee5a907-4ff7-4804-80bb-582198b723b7" pid="mZMBvJAiyECGviWGeikWQg" hash="o4MSDA">But all of my great experiences are not in the past. Branch Rickey, the great baseball manager, was once asked to describe his greatest day in baseball. He said, “I can’t because I haven’t had it yet.” And most of our greatest experiences are yet ahead of us. One of them will be the glorious second coming of Jesus Christ, when with his mighty angels in flaming fire he will come to cleanse the earth of its sins and to inaugurate the millennial reign upon this earth. Every one of us will have a literal bodily resurrection, and what a great experience that will be! Charles F. Kettering, the mechanical wizard of General Motors, once said, “My interest is in the future, because I am going to spend the rest of my life there.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/great-experiences.p21" guid="d02e3565-749b-48b4-85a1-c78925e18b39" pid="hg8DCgPtXE2jpi9BHktT1A" hash="hVumOw">And my wish for each one of you is that you may spend your eternal life in the celestial kingdom of God. Then you may say, “My heart hath had its greatest experience.” And that it may be so, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

He said that when contemplating any accomplishment, one of the first steps to be taken was to definitely decide on those things that should <span class="emphasis">not </span>be done under any circumstances. That is, if one were going into business, there are certain dishonest practices and improper procedures that should definitely and permanently be ruled out of bounds in advance. Or in planning a happy marriage, there are infidelities and disloyalties that must <span class="emphasis">never </span>be entertained. When one has definitely eliminated those things that he will <span class="emphasis">not </span>do, then he can concentrate all of his time and energy on the things that he <span class="emphasis">should </span>do.</p>

A psychiatrist once said to a mental patient, “Do you ever have any trouble making up your mind?” The mental patient said, “Well, yes and no.” A yes-and-no person is a weak person. An undecided person makes far more than his share of mistakes.</p>

Certainly we place a serious handicap upon ourselves when we neglect to definitely make up our minds about those important questions of morality, honesty, integrity, industry, and religion.</p>

Three months after they were released from their Egyptian bondage, they were encamped before Mount Sinai. Then God gave them the Ten Commandments, which included a list of things that they just must not do under any circumstances. For even God himself could not make a great nation out of a group of murderers, liars, thieves, atheists, adulterers, and Sabbath breakers.</p>

He asked the president why he had been dismissed. The president said, “You let us make a mistake which cost us a lot of money.” The engineer replied, “But certainly you must remember that I specifically advised you <span class="emphasis">not </span>to do that.” The president replied, “Yes, I remember that you advised us not to do it, but you didn’t pound the table when you advised us.”</p>

Recently a minister on the radio said that he never talked about the Ten Commandments in his church anymore because they were too far out of date. He also said that their language was too harsh for the weak sensibilities of our day. This minister felt that instead of using such strong terms as <span class="emphasis">command </span>and <span class="emphasis">Thou shalt not, </span>the Lord should have employed some softer words such as <span class="emphasis">I recommend </span>or <span class="emphasis">I suggest </span>or <span class="emphasis">I advise. </span>But soft words frequently produce soft attitudes with weak meanings and built-in violations.</p>

But the Lord allowed no permissiveness to get into the Ten Commandments. He came down onto the Mount in a cloud of fire from which the smoke ascended as from a furnace. He came with such power that the mountain quaked and the people themselves trembled. Then, to the accompaniment of the lightnings and thunders of that sacred mountain, God gave the people their basic law and listed some of those things that they must not do.

But we not only disobey these important laws; many people don’t even know what they are. One man once said to his friend, “I will give you five dollars if you can repeat any one of the Ten Commandments.” His friend accepted the challenge and proceeded to demonstrate his knowledge by saying, “Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.” His friend said, “Here’s the money. I didn’t think that you could do it.”</p>

We are fulfilling the prophecy of Ezekiel, who said: “… the soul that sinneth, it shall die.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ezek/18.4" class="scriptureRef">Ezek. 18:4</a>.) Sin is more than ordinarily important, for as Martin Luther once said, “One vice can overcome ten virtues.”</p>

Recently, three men were being discussed for an important assignment. Of one it was said, “He is a hard worker and he knows his business, <span class="emphasis">but </span>he is dishonest.” Of the second it was said, “He is strictly honest and very capable, <span class="emphasis">but </span>he won’t work.” Of the third it was said, “He is very capable and well liked, <span class="emphasis">but </span>he is immoral.” And while praise is wonderful, yet when the account gets around to the <span class="emphasis">buts, </span>everyone had better pay strict attention. You can’t cancel off a little immorality with a little industry, or a little dishonesty with a little ability, or a little atheism with a few good intentions.</p>

Of these, some 777,000 were auto thefts. Many people are presently replacing the Ten Commandments with their own version of the new morality. We have millions of practicing atheists, and we have a murder or a suicide committed every fifteen minutes around the clock. This modified code says: Thou shalt not kill unless someone gets in your way, or thou shalt not commit adultery unless you like your partner, or thou shall have no other Gods before me unless you get a better idea. And some have gone so far as to repudiate their own God-given sense of responsibility.</p>

She said, “Who am I to say what is right or wrong?” And some say that it doesn’t matter anyway, either one way or the other. However, in our own day the Lord has reaffirmed and reemphasized these great laws given from Sinai. As recorded in the 59th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, he has said: “Thou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, nor kill, nor do anything like unto it.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:6</a>.) We are doing many things that are “like unto” breaking the Ten Commandments. It is easy for half-believers and underachievers to be guilty of those damaging sins of fractional devotion with marginal morals and a minimum performance. Disobedience and sloth always draw down upon us a burden of consequence that is much too heavy for us to bear.</p>

I know that those people who keep the Sabbath day holy will be a different kind of people from those who do not. I know as well as the people at Sinai knew that it is wrong to profane, steal, covet, bear false witness, kill, commit adultery, or do anything like unto any of them.</p>

And when we rob God, we are also stealing from ourselves. Unless we intend to destroy our own inheritance, we should put up some strong protecting guard rails along the boundaries of that straight and narrow way that leads to the celestial kingdom. We ought to paint some heavy yellow lines running between right and wrong and put some stop signs on those dead-end streets where travel has been forbidden.</p>

And when we assume wrong attitudes, set bad examples, or do wrong things, we are thwarting his purposes. We are violating that great command that says “Thou shalt not bear false witness” when we claim to be the children of God and then go around acting like orphans, sinners, cowards, and weaklings.</p>

God is our eternal Heavenly Father. We are all his representatives in that greatest of all family enterprises which Jesus referred to as “my Father’s business.” That is the business of building integrity, character, and eternal life into the lives of his children. And one of the things that we should very frequently do is to go in the strength of the Spirit and again stand before Mount Sinai while we take stock of those things that God himself has placed out of bounds. And the emphasis of a little table pounding will help us to more securely make up our minds to eliminate those things that must <span class="emphasis">not </span>be done under any circumstances. And may God help us so to do, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

And because ideas, ideals, and ambitions can be most effectively supplied through books, this great king had provided an ample literary storehouse as a place where his people could get the necessary help for thinking good ideas, building up proper attitudes, vitalizing their faith, motivating their ambitions, and increasing their righteousness, that they might help themselves to save their souls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/medicine-for-the-soul.p3" guid="3623befe-2f34-4cfa-a2e0-c534af50f2d1" pid="TuX7Pm0FkkWo_KD82XncgQ" hash="MKiSoA">This idea of a mental and spiritual storehouse still provides one of our most constructive opportunities. It is reported that there is a physician in Birmingham, Alabama, who goes around writing prescriptions for people, to be filled not at drugstores but at bookstores. He knows what all of us know, that our most serious sicknesses are our soul sicknesses.</p>

As someone has pointed out, we never get stomach ulcers because of what we eat; we get stomach ulcers because of what is eating us. And as we are presently being eaten up by our ignorance, our sins, and our weaknesses, we are suffering some staggering moral death-and-disability losses.</p>

The science of writing has probably made books our greatest invention. Writing is preserved speech; it is potential ambition. By effective study we can acquire knowledge, build faith, and develop an enthusiasm that will lead us to any desired accomplishment.</p>

And because of the wonders of our day, every family may have its own library of great books, including the word of God himself. But before anyone can be benefited by any of our great literature, he must effectively believe in it.</p>

On that name a eulogy is expected that cannot be. To add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of Washington is alike impossible. Let none attempt it. In solemn awe pronounce the name, and in its naked, deathless splendor leave it shining on.”</p>

They are the most remarkable creation of man. Nothing else that man builds ever lasts. Monuments fall, civilizations perish, but books continue. The perusal of a great book is as it were an interview with the noblest men of past ages who have written it.</p>

It may be a message to us from the dead, from human souls we never saw who lived perhaps thousands of miles away, and yet these little sheets of paper speak to us, arouse us, teach us, open our hearts and in turn open their hearts to us like brothers. Without books, God is silent, justice dormant, philosophy lame.”</p>

He desired to send a message to a friend many miles away, and it was arranged for a trusted native to be his messenger. The native watched as with his pen the explorer made some marks on a piece of paper, which had no significance to him. Then the explorer gave the native the letter for delivery.</p>

The native discovered that as soon as the recipient had studied the paper, he immediately knew exactly where the explorer was and what his problems were. He knew all about his health and as much about the needs that prompted him to send the letter as though the explorer had come in person.</p>

Or what about those papers containing the vitalizing thoughts expressed in that greatest of all discourses, the Sermon on the Mount?</p>

That important responsibility for feeding the flock is also in force among us. But our personal salvation is a joint enterprise, and the responsibility for feeding our souls is one of the primary do-it-yourself projects that God himself has put into our hands. This great Egyptian king had provided the library, but the people were required to take the medicine themselves.</p>

That is, our many soul-deaths do not occur because a remedy is not available; it is only because we are failing to take that medicine which has already been provided and has already proven its effectiveness.</p>

Sometimes we are furtherest away when we are closest by.” So frequently that is true.</p>

And yet they were so far away that they said, “His blood be on us, and on our children.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/27.25" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 27:25</a>.) And so it has been and so it may be with us. We are so near and yet we may be so far away. We live on the edge of an ocean of knowledge, but each must take his own steps that will bring him there.</p>

And someone said to Mr. Thomas, “What is the greatest message that you have ever had a part in broadcasting? Or,” they asked, “what is the greatest message that you could conceive as being broadcast to the people of the world?” And Mr. Thomas said, “The greatest message that I can conceive would be that God had again spoken to his people upon the earth.”</p>

We like to know what the Democrats and the Republicans think. We are interested in what the labor unions and the economists think. But above all other interests, we ought to know what God thinks. God is the Creator of the universe. He is the Father of our spirits and the designer of our destinies. Above everyone else he knows the purpose of our lives and which approach will bring us to the most satisfying success.</p>

And not only did he come in person, but he caused that his message should be written down in three great volumes of new scripture outlining in every detail the simple principles of the gospel of Christ. So again, as of old, we hear that life-giving, authoritative pronouncement: “Thus saith the Lord.”</p>

Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.10" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:10</a>.)</p>

Jesus emphasized his own mission by saying, “I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.10" class="scriptureRef">John 10:10</a>.) We must not allow the holy scriptures to sit on our shelves unopened while we continue to starve to death spiritually because we fail to practice those great success laws on which the eternal exaltation of our souls depends.</p>

This week and every other week, in this country and every other country, men and women will be getting together to discuss their problems, exchange ideas, and try to develop more effective techniques for accomplishment. If one doctor discovers better methods for improving health, relieving pain, or saving lives, that information is immediately passed on to others. As a consequence, the skill of all doctors is increased, and every one of us is made the beneficiary of every medical discovery.</p>

If you had lived in George Washington’s day in America, your life expectancy would have been 35 years. When I was born it was 48 years. But those babies who were born in an American hospital this morning have an average life expectation of 70 years.</p>

And if it is so important for doctors, lawyers, farmers, teachers, businessmen, and scientists to counsel together in order to increase their effectiveness, how much more important it is for us who work in this greatest of all enterprises that Jesus referred to as “my Father’s business.” That is the world’s biggest and most important undertaking. It has the responsibility for building integrity, character, righteousness, and eternal life into the lives of his children.</p>

That is what he believes in and thinks about and works at and fights for and lives by. Our eternal exaltation will not be awarded according to whether or not we make a good living, but according to whether or not we live a good life. Jesus announced the purpose of his own mission by saying, “… I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.10" class="scriptureRef">John 10:10</a>.) And to produce the most abundant lives is our primary responsibility.</p>

And twice each year, in obedience to the direct instruction of deity, this great general conference of the Church is held. And as we contemplate our own individual part in it, I would like to pose some questions for your consideration.</p>

On July 7, 1972, Harold B. Lee became the eleventh president of the church of Jesus Christ in this dispensation of our world’s history. And in a conference with some seventy-five members of the press and representatives of other news media, he was asked what was the most important counsel that he had to give to the people of the world. In a three-word answer, President Lee said, “Keep the commandments.”</p>

Dilworth Young recently said that in his opinion, Harold B. Lee is as strong a man as his great-granduncle, Brigham Young. And I would like to submit that these three words spoken by President Lee represent the most profitable direction that could possibly be given by anyone in any dispensation.</p>

It is not just something for us to think about; it is something for us to do. These words also constitute the world’s most powerful success formula. The best way to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher is to be a good man. These three words serve as the shortest, the most pleasant, the most direct, and the only road to the celestial kingdom.</p>

On one occasion Moses was given a revelation concerning the earliest times. He said:</p>

Excluding Enoch, who was translated at age 430, the other nine of the ten patriarchs lived to an average age of 912 years. In one sense they served as the founding fathers of our world civilization. And each was a great man in his own right. Adam will always stand at the head; and under the direction of that magnificent Being, the Savior of the world, he will forever preside over his posterity. Adam was a mighty spirit before this earth was formed, and he was faithful throughout his long mortality. Three years before his death he called together Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, and all of the residue of his posterity who were righteous unto the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there he bestowed upon them his last blessing. The record says:</p>

The Bible says that Seth, the son of Adam, was a perfect man. At age 65 Enoch was called on a special mission to preach the gospel, which lasted for the next 365 years. The record says of him:</p>

The record says that he was taught in all of the ways of God. He was not only a perfect man, but he wrote a great book of scripture and built up the famous city of Enoch, which was also called the city of holiness. This city of Zion and all of its people were translated and taken up to God in the year of the world 1052.</p>

It says, “and Noah walked with God.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 6:9</a>.) And most of his life was spent saying to the antediluvians, “Keep the commandments.”</p>

They lived on one end of our civilization, and we live on the other. They stood in the forefront of our history, and we carry the responsibility for this equally important last-day period. Both periods have great intensities of good and bad. The Lord himself looked forward to our day and made a rather uncomplimentary comparison when he said: “… as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.37" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:37</a>.)</p>

This is the place where we come each six months to be instructed in our duties and built up in our faith. This is where some of the most important business of the Church is transacted. And then twice each year we have this thrilling, exciting experience of holding up our hands and making a personal covenant with the Lord that we will sustain and support those who are placed in authority over us in the Church and that we will also keep all of the Lord’s commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p2" guid="408598d8-d770-4dd4-824e-7c48de2cfe4c" pid="TXLuXm9T1UCwUbOs1ljZpQ" hash="XkqV0g">The other evening I reread Saint Paul’s famous twelfth chapter of First Corinthians, in which he compared the various parts of the human body with the spiritual gifts and ecclesiastical offices which have been placed in the Church. He said that all were necessary and that the eye could not say to the hand, “I have no need of thee.” [<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.title" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 12</a>] And each six months, as I see the thousands of raised hands in this assembly, I like to think of the great power and many important duties, both symbolic and otherwise, that we hold in our hands.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p3" guid="a76b7acb-416a-442b-a07c-d483aa1779f7" pid="FEGh3mREv02LSrJpzlrfyw" hash="kEao3A">The Lord has placed in our hands the responsibility for working out our eternal exaltation in fear and trembling before him. When we are sick we have hands placed upon our heads and we are given a blessing for the restoration of our health. By the laying on of hands we confirm people members of the Church. We confer the Holy Ghost. We ordain people to the priesthood, and we set them apart for that portion of the work of the Lord that they are called to perform. We raise our hands in salute. We hold them over our hearts as we take our pledge of allegiance to the flag. We clasp hands in friendship and fellowship. We lay them upon the shoulders of our friends to give commendation and encouragement. With a pair of willing, ambitious, capable, clean hands, we can move mountains and we can save souls.</p>

When you put on your shirt in the morning, just imagine how you would get along if you had any other device except a hand on the end of your arm. Just suppose that you had a hoof or a claw or a wing, or a pair of pliers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p5" guid="3c55e3a4-da66-417d-8268-ee524a3f3dfc" pid="H177XRrhQ0agfAQThuZLtQ" hash="5FckuA">The story is told of a young man who went blind in his early youth. Many years later after an operation, the first thing that his newly restored vision rested upon was his own hand, and he thought he had never imagined anything quite so wonderful as his own hand with its circulation system, its communication system, its temperature control, its self-healing ability, and its wonderful covering of skin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p6" guid="ad3ce5eb-95d4-4b76-be19-6e6b3b8fd70c" pid="t1aavk9i10K6odkewgPiYw" hash="j9_fvg">Or think of the usefulness of these wonderful little bony levers that we call fingers. They can readily be trained to play the piano, dial telephone numbers, and do the accounting. Someone once said that a man’s best friends are his fingers. He said, “About the only thing that a man can really count on these days are his fingers.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p7" guid="da1c4ccf-26d6-4ae2-ad0e-170261a7cc0d" pid="xrqhnQeFI0qABQ8BhHsvSA" hash="9Sr98g">I would like to remind you of an assignment that the Lord once gave to the fingers of the Israelites when he instituted this ancient custom of wearing phylacteries. The Lord knew then what every one of us ought to know now, that there are certain passages in the scriptures that must never be forgotten if our lives are to be successful. Therefore, to help the people to remember, he required that they write some of these passages down on pieces of parchment, encase them in little leather tubes, and bind them across their foreheads and between their eyes. They were required to hang them around their necks and bind them on their arms like wrist watches and wear them like rings upon their fingers. About this custom the Lord said to the people: “And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p9" guid="06356c92-2dc2-4592-9bcd-861e2801ec01" pid="axGtuo0_gEmEaSwHvoEsQA" hash="Y_kYfA">“And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/6.6-8" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 6:6–8</a>.)</p>

When she sent you on an important errand, the purpose of which she did not want you to forget, she helped you to remember by tying a red string on your finger with a bow on the top so that no matter where you went or what you did, you would always remember what your mother wanted you to do. And that is about what the Lord did to the children of Israel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p11" guid="59bb9718-59a0-44dd-8aa0-8a6909388104" pid="-6UcTeD7MU6w6k7GBbPEDA" hash="DbofaA">When I raise up my hand to make my personal covenant with the Lord, I try to imagine which phylacteries he would most like to see on my hand, and here are some of the things that I have been thinking about.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p12" guid="4aa450f1-ab36-41de-b72c-983f23336ca5" pid="PwB_hxtgqUC7m-OPnLW5Nw" hash="7Ov7PA">The first finger on the hand is the thumb. The thumb serves as the anchor man of the hand. And the first law of any success says that “you <span class="emphasis">must </span>know your business.” Lord Bacon said, “Knowledge is power.” Jesus said, “… this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.3" class="scriptureRef">John 17:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p13" guid="628ec8e3-8cd0-401a-9fa6-95740e7add65" pid="KNJaO_WWZEuxBp4XUD3iFg" hash="1_Lkow">Dr. Henry C. Link once pointed out that “nothing puts so much order into human life as to live by a set of sound principles.” And the most sound principles are the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. However, before we can live by them very effectively, we must know what they are.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p14" guid="df2300a4-50a1-4719-a174-b62978e267c1" pid="K4o9e7qXcUqN_NFBhNNpPg" hash="UdgcIg">The first question that Adam and Eve were asked to decide when they were placed in the Garden of Eden was whether or not they would eat the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And after they had eaten, God said, “… the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/3.22" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 3:22</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p15" guid="55f46b5b-2bb8-45c5-b148-18ffe6ee262d" pid="V1BU8kjmDkOOzRolgYW71g" hash="nVKHNA">I would just like to point out in passing that the right kind of knowledge still tends to have that effect upon people. It still tends to make men and women become as God. A flaming sword was placed in the Garden of Eden to guard the tree of life, but fortunately for us there is no flaming sword guarding the tree of knowledge, and each one of us may eat to his heart’s content. And maybe you can think of something more exciting than that, but I don’t know what it would be. In this great age of restoration and enlightenment we can know about as much as we want to know about any subject, including God and his program for our eternal exaltation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p16" guid="986379d3-ba9f-4b14-83c5-92e3bd3d1b03" pid="4amfe8VE40OjXSBoPUTkdA" hash="vJp8uw">The second finger is the pointing finger. This is the finger you use to show people the way. This is the directing finger. And the second law of success says that you must be a convert before you can be a disciple. You must be a convert before you can be a leader. You must be a convert before you can show other people the way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p17" guid="0c8d463d-e4a0-41a0-aa4a-4380ba01e619" pid="zEV4kWAzaUKB2HodWQJQQA" hash="rxrAyA">Jesus said to Peter, “Simon, … when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.31-32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:31–32</a>.) Peter may have been a little bit offended at this, as he probably felt that as the chief apostle, he was already converted; but what happened that very night at the house of Caiaphas when he denied the Lord three times may have indicated that even Peter was not fully converted. And it would help us if we made up a great credenda of beliefs and had strong, well-worked-out convictions centered in each one.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p18" guid="a5c3d0fd-2d6c-4927-a2d7-ad783269b8cd" pid="jwkCB8pODUmI-sFAcOX0VA" hash="Jf8bIQ">The third finger is the big finger. This is the power finger. It has the best location on the hand. The third law of success says that you must WANT to succeed—in capital letters. If I want to succeed in letters an inch high, I will fail. But if I want to succeed in letters a yard high, then I will succeed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p19" guid="cdac98c5-4cb0-428e-9400-992b3fe3689b" pid="Tu6HWvn1gES3QY1OyMQ5jQ" hash="OJ71pw">The Lord said, “… if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:3</a>.) If we don’t WANT to do it we can’t do it. Alma said that God grants unto every man according to his desires. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.4" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:4</a>.) And we ought to spend a lot more time than we ordinarily do in increasing the volume and intensity of our righteous desires.</p>

Would you teach me how to be a man of wisdom and learning?”</p>

Then Socrates seized his friend and held his head under the water. His friend struggled and kicked and bucked and tried to get away but Socrates held him down. Now if you hold somebody’s head under the water long enough he will eventually become fairly peaceable, and when this man had quit kicking, Socrates carried him out on the bank and laid him out to dry, and he went back to the marketplace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/hold-up-your-hands.p23" guid="468981b6-fdf4-41ae-bacd-4f19cbe64dad" pid="QMMBPOQtQUa7ZpJvjucNTA" hash="Sni5Kg">After this man had thawed out a little bit he came back to Socrates to find the reason for this rather unusual behavior, and Socrates said to him, “When your head was under the water, what was the one thing you wanted more than anything else?”</p>

Someone once said to Mozart, “Would you teach me how to write symphonies?” Mozart said, “You are too young to write symphonies.” The young man said, “But you were fifteen years younger than I am when you began writing symphonies.” Mozart said, “But I didn’t have to ask anybody to teach me.” Only when we get some of these great qualities inside of ourselves are we in a position to make progress.</p>

This is the finger that you use to fall in love with. This is the finger you get married with. This is the family finger. This is where you wear your family home evening phylactery. This is the finger that represents the source of most of your education and your satisfactions and your eternal happiness for both here and hereafter.</p>

If we don’t get great pleasure out of our families, we should repent, because we are doing something wrong. If the work of the Lord seems burdensome and makes us weary, or if we don’t get exhilaration and uplift out of that part of the work of the world that life has given us to do, then we should repent. We need some more powerful satisfactions from life.</p>

This is the weakest finger. This is the finger that has the poorest position on the hand, and we might imagine that we could just take him off the team and throw him away without losing very much. However, the big finger cannot say to the little finger, “I have no need of thee.” The little finger may come at the end of the line-up, but that is the quarterback position, and you don’t need a great big man to be the quarterback, providing the other members of the team are fully qualified and effectively functioning. That is, the thumb knows his business backwards and forwards and upside down and standing on his head. The pointing finger has some powerful, well-developed convictions about it; the big finger WANTS to do it, in capital letters; the ring finger gets great satisfaction from doing it; and all the little finger has to do is to do it. He is the worker. He is the one who takes care of the mechanics of production. He is the one that handles the checkup and does the follow-through. He is the one Jesus came calling for when he pleaded for “doers of the word” and not just hearers and talkers only.</p>

And if I had the gift of speech and the power to plant a conviction that I would like to have, I would say to the millions of people in the world who are earnestly seeking to be disciples of the Master to hold up their hands to God and make a solemn covenant with him to keep all of his commandments.</p>

Moses took the rod of God in his hands and went to the top of a sacred mount, where he held up his hands to God over the battle; and as long as Moses held up his hands, Israel prevailed. But when he let his hands down, the Amalekites prevailed. And as Moses’ arms became heavy with weariness, Aaron and Hur stood on either side of Moses and helped him to hold up his hands until the battle was won.

Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.10" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:10</a>.) And may God bless you, my brothers and sisters, that all of us together may effectively hold up our hands to God and that our covenants may be acceptable to him. For this I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

And that is probably our most profitable idea.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/a-fortune-to-share.p2" guid="a4c7edf3-bd79-4245-83e6-0e6f2e35b335" pid="BYiimusnRE-LElDHNWCbgw" hash="uj-vAA">However, the thing that we spend more time doing than about anything else in our lives is laying up for ourselves treasures upon the earth. And that is also a great idea, providing we know how to handle it. Many people have contended for the treasures in heaven on the grounds that they have much greater value, they are a lot more satisfying, they are a lot more permanent. Someone has complained that one of the disadvantages of the treasures of the earth is that you can’t take them with you. Someone else has pointed out that with taxes like they are, you can’t even keep them while you are here. This man put this idea in rhyme. He said:</p>
      <div class="poetry" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/a-fortune-to-share.f1" guid="2f26496d-3573-4857-9ffd-21452af45e48">

And some pessimist has added that even if you could take them with you, they would only melt. However, it seems to me that frequently we spend a lot more time than is necessary in downgrading these great treasures that we get from the earth. We sometimes refer to our medium of exchange by calling it such unsavory names as “filthy lucre” or “tainted money,” and sometimes that may be an accurate description, but it need not necessarily be so.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/a-fortune-to-share.p4" guid="44f1ef12-7c54-49ee-9706-820791a313da" pid="B04c_B13fUK6DPWxmTrH6A" hash="U7TPzg">Somebody said, “Money can’t buy happiness,” but his friend said, “Maybe not, but it does enable one to pick out the particular kind of misery that he enjoys the most.” And someone has pointed out that if there is anyone who can’t buy happiness with money it must be that he just doesn’t know where to shop. We can build temples with money, we can send out missionaries with money, we can erect educational institutions, operate hospitals, and pay our tithing with money. We can feed and clothe our families with money, and in many ways we can build up the kingdom of God with money.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/a-fortune-to-share.p5" guid="47506078-0883-4ace-859c-6cbfeb056cf5" pid="jvScKObcKESpNUVeLH582g" hash="PPxAnw">Someone said, “Money ain’t everything,” and his friend said, “Just name me three things that it ain’t.” But we also should think of some of those things that it is. Money is preserved labor, it is industry made negotiable, it is stored up accomplishment. It is the medium of exchange that we can trade for things that we can take with us and a great many of them we can actually send on ahead. We can take our families with us. We can take our education with us. We can take our great character qualities with us. And money is the medium that we can use to share the treasures of the earth with others who need our help.</p>

Vashni Young had worked as a salesman during the lush, easy, prosperous years of the late 1920s, and then the market crash of October 1929 had plunged Vashni Young, with a few million other people, into the bottomless economic pit of the early 1930s. But he did not like the depression and he had become pretty sour on this world generally. And so he bought a gun and decided to have a look at the next world by committing suicide. But before he pulled the trigger, he spent a little time thinking about his wife and children and he decided that suicide was not a very manly way to solve a problem. And so instead of shooting himself, he did a little analyzing and he discovered that his mind had been operating like a giant junk factory, turning out all kinds of mental, emotional, and spiritual junk.</p>

He said: “I got tired of being a fool.” He wanted to get out of the junk business and so he dumped overboard a lot of his bad habits of liquor, tobacco, and irresponsibility. He decided to adopt some good attitudes, think like a man, be responsible, and go to work.</p>

And then he made a great discovery that he had personal possession of a vast fortune which he could share with every other person in the world without lessening his own supply.</p>

Then he set aside one day each week which he called “trouble day” during which he worked with other troubled people trying to persuade them to get out of the junk business and share in this great fortune which was so readily available.</p>

Pinegar mentioned Patrick Henry, one of our early American patriots who lived a long, useful, and successful life. Just before his death he said, “I have now finished distributing all of my property to my children. However, there is one more thing that I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion. If I could give them that, though I had not given them a single shilling, they would be rich. And if they did not have that, though I had given them the whole world, they would be poor.”</p>

In this is written the word of the Lord. It contains the covenants that he has made and would like to make with every person who has lived or who ever will live upon the earth. This book gives an account of one occasion some 34 centuries ago when the God of creation came down on to the top of Mt. Sinai in a cloud of fire, and to the accompaniment of the lightnings and thunders of that sacred mountain gave us the Ten Commandments, in which he enumerated ten ways that we can get out of the junk business. Just think what would happen in our world if we all fully observed the Ten Commandments. That would mean that we would stop cheating and lying and stealing and killing and being immoral and violating the Sabbath day. Then this earth would soon be God’s paradise and our material prosperity would go up like a skyrocket. The Lord has also included in the Bible a great credenda of those soul-saving truths that we can share with other people. The Bible is the Lord’s own fortune-to-share book.</p>

Read to me from the book.”</p>

Therefore, the Lord now has four fortune-to-share books.</p>

That is, they will not work unless we do. More than anything else the great message of the Lord needs messengers. The Lord has invited us to have as large a share as we like in his important family concern which Jesus referred to as “my Father’s business.” Now that is the business of building integrity and character and righteousness and eternal life into the lives of his children. The Lord has told us many things about the importance of the family. He has given us this miraculous power of procreation where we can create children in God’s own image and share with them the tremendous blessings of life itself. Then during our family home evenings we may share with them the great treasures of the gospel of salvation. And through the missionary program we can share the blessings of eternal life with all of our friends and neighbors. God has promised us that if we will effectively be his messengers he will share his fortune with both those who give it and those who receive it.</p>

Someone has said that thrift is a great virtue, especially in an ancestor. And God has been very thrifty, he has also been very wise and he has been very generous. To begin with, he created us in his own image and has endowed us with a set of his attributes and potentialities, the development of which is one of the purposes for which we live. He desires that every one of us should be rich. He has said: “… the fulness of the earth is yours …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:16</a>), and it pleaseth God that he has given all these things unto men to be used with judgment and thanksgiving.

Then as I lay there and watched the blood run out of my arm, I asked the nurse how many blood transfusions I could safely give in the course of a year, and she said that it would be perfectly all right if I gave four. That is, if it were necessary, I could save the lives of four people each year by a transfusion of my blood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/transfusion.p2" pid="523IAT478UW3wJ3y-GdBRA" hash="a42RYg">A few years later I found myself on the other end of this great miracle of transfusion. During and after some major surgery, I was given nine blood transfusions wherein a majority of my total blood supply was exchanged. One afternoon when the intern wasn’t very busy, he figured out for me that in this process I had received 27 billion white corpuscles, and as he described their function, I thought of these 27 billion little medical men dressed in white uniforms going throughout my system killing the disease and fighting the infection that otherwise might have terminated my life. But then, in addition to that, he pointed out that I had also received 18 trillion red corpuscles. These were the little engineers that carried oxygen and nutrition to every one of my locations to keep me in business. And all of this came for just the few dollars that I had previously put into the blood bank. (Incidentally, I asked the intern if he would figure out how much money I was paying per corpuscle, but he thought that problem would be a little bit complicated.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/transfusion.p3" pid="5h6EUaPHN06rqiR5P3jOXA" hash="RkTbOQ">Since that time I have thought a great deal about the wonderful men and women that I have met along life’s way who have given me another kind of transfusion. I have had some transfusions of faith, some transfusions of courage, some transfusions of industry. In fact, if you were to take away from me that which properly belonged to somebody else, there wouldn’t be very much of me left.</p>

I think it must have been this that the great apostle Paul had in mind when he said, “Be ye [therefore] transformed by the renewing of your mind.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/12.2" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 12:2</a>.)</p>

To facilitate this operation in my own case, I have written in my literary notebooks the names of over one hundred of my personal donors, and then in my best language I have tried to describe to myself the contributions that they have made to me.

For over 50 years this great sportswriter and commentator went around the country following the great champions of sport, trying to isolate those traits in human personality and character which made men and women champions.

When Gandhi was very young, he took a pledge to his mother that he would remain a vegetarian throughout his life. Many years after Gandhi’s mother had died, Gandhi became very ill, and the doctors tried to persuade him that if he would drink a little beef broth it might save his life. But Gandhi said, “Even for life itself, we may not do certain things. There is only one course open to me, to die, but never to break my pledge.” Now just think for a minute what kind of a world this would be if each one of us could manifest that kind of integrity before his family and among his friends and before the world generally.</p>

In Dempsey’s early career he had a fight contract which paid him two dollars for each of the fights he won, nothing for those he lost. Dempsey said that he used to be knocked down many times back in those days and each time he was knocked down he wanted to stay down because he knew that no one would ever try to hit him again until he started to get up. But he had to get up because he was hungry and he needed the two dollars. On one occasion he was knocked down 11 times, and 11 times he got up to win a two-dollar prizefight. Then Dempsey gave his famous formula: Anyone seeking success in athletics or in life must have two qualities. Number one, he must have the ability to <span class="emphasis">give</span> a big punch, and number two, he must have the ability to <span class="emphasis">take</span> a big punch.</p>

For many years they worked together in an old abandoned leaky shed without funds and without outside encouragement or help, trying to isolate radium from a low-grade uranium ore called pitchblende. And after their 487th experiment had failed, Pierre threw up his hands in despair and said, “It will never be done. Maybe in a hundred years, but never in my day.” Marie confronted him with a resolute face and said, “If it takes a hundred years, it will be a pity, but I will not cease to work for it as long as I live.”</p>

But if you know them well, behind the fish-eyes and the bellies, if you know them better than they do, each one burns candles at some altar of his mind in secret; secret often from himself each is a priest to some dim mystery by which he lives. Strip him of that, and bread and meat and wine won’t nourish him. … Without his chuckle-headed hidden faith, he dies and goes to dust.” (Maxwell Anderson, <span class="emphasis">The Masque of Kings,</span> New York: Anderson House, 1936, p. 125.)</p>

By direct revelation we have been informed that tomorrow will also be the 1,975th anniversary of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem of Judea.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/birth.p2" pid="bfORrzuOMkOWSaFQqqpMFw" hash="X6oLYA">But this is also the Easter season. Last Sunday we commemorated the anniversary of the initiation upon this earth of the universal resurrection. This is also the springtime of the year, when all of nature is being reawakened into a newness of life. And I thought that inasmuch as this is a season of so many new beginnings I would like to talk to you about birth. However, I don’t mean the birth of Jesus, nor the resurrection, nor the reawakening of nature. I mean your own birth and the great possibilities involved in our own human reawakenings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/birth.p3" pid="CmFB5iCxPU22OzVScdnSQQ" hash="vc0QdQ">Henry David Thoreau, an early American philosopher, once said that we should thank God every day of our lives for the privilege of having been born. And then he went on to speculate on the rather unique supposition of what it might have been like if we had not been born. Just suppose that you had never been born or that your parents or your brothers and sisters or your children or your friends had never been born. Just think of all the excitement and blessings that we would have missed as a consequence. But what Mr. Thoreau may not have known was that one-third of all the children of God never were born and never can be born because they failed to pass the requirements of their first estate.</p>

And I am very sure that if we could go today while we walk by faith and stand where we once stood when we walked by sight that we would be willing to crawl on our hands and knees through life for this tremendous opportunity which we presently enjoy.</p>

There is one distinguishing characteristic about the moment of birth in that it is an unconscious moment; that is, no one ever realizes while he is being born that that event is actually taking place. Sometimes we don’t discover that we have been born until quite a long time afterward. Sometimes we never do find out that we have been born.</p>

That is, sometimes we don’t know why we were born. We don’t know where we came from. We don’t know the purpose of life. We haven’t any very definite program for just what we are going to do about our eternal destiny.</p>

They were parents who were interested in teaching me the principles of the gospel and helping me to make as much as possible out of my life. I am everlastingly grateful for my parents. They were pretty poor financially and we had a little trouble getting along, but sometimes that is all to the good. Somebody has said that one of the most serious disadvantages that anyone can have in life is to have too many advantages. One of the most outstanding advantages of my life is my parents. And I always think of my mother when I read those stimulating lines saying:</p>

We have been given a prophet “to guide us in these latter days.” We have been given the Spirit of our Heavenly Father himself to direct and inspire us. And not the least among all of these, we have been given the tremendous resources of our own souls. William Wordsworth said:</p>

Then after his basic training had been completed, he felt for the first time in his hands the controls of those powerful engines capable of sending his aircraft through space at stupendous speeds.

A success story is a segment of the success experience which might be isolated in one person and made negotiable in the lives of a great many others.</p>

And as the squirrel collects and stores up acorns, so we collect stamps and butterflies and coins, and stocks and bonds and insurance policies and real estate and bank accounts. We also collect attitudes, skills, habits, and personality traits.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p3" pid="FHtMsIdwlUOI2wACAZqUkw" hash="G267oA">But since 1966, I have collected seventy-two success stories. These are segments from the experience of someone else which I have chiseled and painted and polished and memorized and recorded to make them immediately and eternally available for my own personal use. And in the twelve minutes of your time which has been assigned to me this afternoon, I would like to make you a present of four three-minute success stories.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p4" pid="YFGHmOlVj0qSnjKG0TXBYA" hash="l0G7nA">Success story number one: After the assassination of Julius Caesar, the world was divided into two great war camps, one led by the conspirators under Brutus, and the other led by Octavius Caesar and Mark Antony, a friend of Julius Caesar. During the long, hard war that followed, Mark Antony distinguished himself as the greatest soldier in the world. And we might ask ourselves, “How did he do it?” If we can discover the secrets of his success, we can make them available to our own success bloodstream.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p5" pid="89XbNoF1oEKJndwutBpIKQ" hash="ADOVNQ">Following are some of the clues that have been given for the accomplishments of Mark Antony. “Armed with his convincing speech, the power of his logic, the courage of his leadership, and his own self-discipline, he swept everything before him. He took upon himself the hardest tasks with the most wondrous good cheer. He lived for weeks on a diet of insects and the bark of trees. And he won the unquestioned loyalty of his men, the acclaim of the people, the support of Octavius, and his own self-confidence.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p6" pid="GPY2qAoWU0mEH0zqAY4x6w" hash="IHUDGw">Opposed by such dedication and skill, the enemy generals one by one soon began dropping out of the fight. And when the war was won, Mark Antony stood where the great Julius Caesar had once stood as the master of the world. But when the need for struggle had passed, Mark Antony became idle, and idleness accounts for some of life’s most tragic failure stories.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p7" pid="d7jG6FPLDEix7eRoZ89fyA" hash="pG6V5w">Mark Antony went to Egypt where he fell in love with the bewitching queen, Cleopatra. He became a victim of the soft luxury, perfumed elegance, and immorality of the Egyptian court. His great mind became clouded by the fumes of wine, and he became what Plutarch referred to as a “Fishing-rod general.” As Mark Antony abandoned his better self he lost the loyalty of his men, the acclaim of the people, the support of Octavius, and his own self-respect. Finally a guard of soldiers was sent to take Mark Antony into custody and bring him back to Rome in chains.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p8" pid="sENFHOMvL0qxKmLLuK6VKg" hash="9kaZuA">It didn’t require an army to overcome Mark Antony now. Just a handful of the meanest soldiers was all that was necessary. However, Mark Antony avoided arrest by thrusting a dagger into his own heart, and as he lay dying he recounted to Cleopatra that there had been no power in the world sufficient to overthrow him, except his own power. He said, “Only Antony could conquer Antony.” And then as he contemplated the arrival of the Roman soldiers and thought of the awful disgrace that he had brought upon his country and the shame and humiliation that he had caused his family, he made his last speech, which William Haines Lytle has translated into verse, in which Antony says to Cleopatra:</p>

Pygmalion was a sculptor from Cyprus, and, like all great artists, Pygmalion loved his work. Then the day came when he would create the great masterpiece of his life. In deathless ivory he would carve the statue of a beautiful woman and show the human form and human personality at its best. Week after week and month after month he labored until finally the statue was completed. And so great was the devotion and love that Pygmalion had lavished upon his work that the gods decreed that the statue would have the power to breathe and move and live. As she stepped down off the pedestal, Pygmalion called her name Galatea, and Pygmalion married his work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p15" pid="fbPbqAUxs0WNMvUSL7nrzQ" hash="l6SCjw">But this is much more than just an idle myth, as the story of Pygmalion is the story of every person who ever lives. For God has decreed that for everyone who falls in love with his work, his work shall live.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p16" pid="GBfCTURLTk2Bmv9L42k7Ng" hash="abeHZQ">Success story number four has to do with the lion-hearted King Richard, who ruled England during the latter part of the twelfth century. Richard organized a crusade to the Holy Land to dispossess the Turks of the sepulcher. But the expedition was unsuccessful and Richard himself was captured and confined to a foreign prison. During his absence from home, traitors took over the government, and when Richard finally effected his escape and returned to England, it was necessary for reasons of his own personal security that he come disguised in plain, unmarked armor. When back in England, he quietly gathered around him a few of his faithful followers with the idea of putting England back in the hands of its rightful rulers. One of the first things he did after this little group had been assembled was to attack the castle at Torquilstone. Torquilstone was the stronghold of the enemy in which Ivanhoe, the faithful friend and follower of the King, was wounded and imprisoned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p17" pid="2StLGxn1_U2nF-rQT3nlcQ" hash="EU-gCQ">When Ivanhoe heard the noises of assault beginning to take place outside the castle, and since he was unable to raise himself from his couch because of wounds and loss of blood, he asked his nurse, Rebecca, to stand by the window and tell him what was taking place. The first thing he wanted to know was who the leader was. And that is the most important thing that anyone needs to know about any undertaking. So he asked Rebecca to describe for him the insignia or other marks of identification on the armor of the leader and then he would know who he was and what their chances for rescue were.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p18" pid="vP16UJSlpUC0id3wvL4gKA" hash="wz2LaQ">But Rebecca reported back that the leader fought in plain, unmarked armor and that he had no insignia or marks of identification. Ivanhoe said, “Then tell me how he fights and I’ll know who he is.” That is, everyone has a set of traits about as characteristic as his fingerprints, and the best key to his identity is what he does. So Rebecca tried to describe this great knight clad in plain black armor as he swung his ponderous ax with thunderous blows assaulting this castle stronghold almost single-handed. And here are some of the things that she said about him. “Stones and beams are hurled down from the castle walls upon him, but he regards them no more than if they were thistledown or feathers.” Again, she said, “He fights as if there were twenty men’s strength in his single arm.” Again, she said, “It is fearful yet magnificent to behold how the arm and heart of one man can triumph over hundreds.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p19" pid="C9uPU-ZAlUGKg8Hbtqbavw" hash="As9KUQ">I suppose that Richard’s arm wasn’t much stronger than any other warrior’s arm, but that is not where strength comes from. Rebecca had said, “The arm and heart of one man.” Richard was fighting with his heart; he was fighting for England. And when one begins to put his heart in what he is doing, then things really begin to happen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p20" pid="wAWEqyeW2kWWhAOiK21b-g" hash="Slvt0A">Ivanhoe did not know who this man was. He knew that Richard fought like this, but no one fought like the King, and he believed Richard to be a prisoner in an Austrian dungeon. And then he paid this great tribute to an unknown leader. He didn’t know what this man’s name was, but he knew the traits that characterized greatness, and he said to Rebecca, “I swear by the honor of my house, I would endure ten years of captivity to fight a single day by that great man’s side in such a quarrel as this.” Captivity would have been the greatest punishment to which Ivanhoe could have been subjected, and yet he said, “I would gladly languish ten years in a dungeon cell for the privilege of fighting by the side and under the banner of a great man in a great cause.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p21" pid="0J5Q6YffgEWF3FtDnpgItA" hash="PYLqBQ">Now we have a great cause, we have the greatest cause ever known in the world. And the only question that remains unanswered is, “How will we fight?” And our own leader has said to us, “O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/success-stories.p22" pid="TayNbzVqBEeXVXE3-X-OwQ" hash="AhsFtA">Now as a special bonus, I would like to give you a thirty second witness of one of the greatest success experiences ever to take place upon this earth wherein the first prophet of our dispensation has said to all the world:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p1" pid="3FUNml6fO0OAFVVBJtHCPg" hash="_VN3aA">Two of the most important events in life are birth and death. And what a thrilling thing it is to be well born, to have goodly parents and live in a godly home! But it may be even more important to die well. Sometime ago in this general conference, I talked about the importance of birth and the life that follows it. This morning I would like to say something about the importance of death and the life that follows it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p2" pid="aL0fufbvAUaPuLExHqoGCQ" hash="S1qFtA">Sometimes we miss one of our best opportunities—to learn to die well—because we think of death as unpleasant. And because we don’t like to think about unpleasant things, we sometimes close our minds and turn away our faces. But death doesn’t cease to exist just because it is ignored. The ancient Egyptians had a much more logical way of handling this situation when on their great festive occasions they kept constantly on display before the revelers the skeleton of a dead man. That is, they held up this great image of death before themselves that each one might be continually and constantly reminded that some day he would die.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p3" pid="5QP5ZWSxhUapJi2vVo0DJg" hash="7kmH-Q">Now I don’t want to frighten anyone unduly in this audience this morning, but I would like to point out as gently and as kindly as I can that someday this tremendously important experience of our mortal estate will come to its end. Someone has said that judging by the past there will be very few of us who get out of this world alive. From the very beginning of life, each one of us lives under an irrevocable, unchangeable death sentence, with a guarantee that it will be carried out. The Lord has given us this maximum notice to enable us to adequately prepare for it. And one man indicated this certainty by an inscription on his tombstone saying, “I knew it would happen!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p4" pid="BtPYAHxiPkOOteI1i_UpKw" hash="VmGKqA">The other night I reread the old Grecian tragedy written around the fall of Athens. A Roman general had captured an Athenian philosopher and had told him that he meant to put him to death. The Athenian didn’t seem very disturbed and so the Roman thought that probably he didn’t understand. And so he said to the Athenian that maybe he didn’t know what it meant to die. The Athenian said that he thought he understood it better than the Roman did. And then he said to the Roman, “Thou dost not know what it means to die, for thou dost not know what it means to live. To die is to begin to live. It is to end all stale and weary work to begin a nobler and a better. It is to leave deceitful knaves for the society of gods and goodness.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p5" pid="XLJbuarHtkaEkOyhZqjl9w" hash="Q4VzWg">And it has been said that the most important event in life is death. We live to die and then we die to live. Death is a kind of graduation day for life. It is our only means of entrance to our eternal lives. And it seems to me to be a very helpful procedure to spend a little time preliving our death. That is, what kind of person would you like to be when the last hour of your life arrives?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p6" pid="oIpIfFFAhEWceJVbvwUHWw" hash="MpxDzQ">The last hour is the key hour. That is the hour that judges all of the other hours. No one can tell whether or not his life has been successful until his last hour. As Sophocles said, “We must wait till evening to know how pleasant the day has been.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p7" pid="vGeu6mbcdUOnjLGYNEi4lg" hash="7nrdxg">Certainly no one could write the life story of Jesus of Nazareth or Judas Iscariot without knowing what happened during their last hour. And I would like to tell you about some of the things that one man thought about during his last hour. This is the old legendary story of Faust. Dr. John Faust died in Wittenberg, Germany, in the year 1540. But twenty-four years before his death, he sold his soul to Satan. He said to Satan, “If you will aid me for twenty-four years, punishing my enemies and helping my friends, at the end of that time, I will forever deliver up my soul.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p8" pid="FiqZr_FwnUu8s3P2UWI4eQ" hash="TnvU_A">Now at that time that seemed like a good idea to Faust. Twenty-four years was a long time. Twenty-four years may last forever. And anyway, what difference did it make what happened after twenty-four years? But Satan, with better perspective, said, “I will wait on Faustus while he lives and he shall buy my service with his soul.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p9" pid="9k_9dYEcgkWrVJRPAZSc8Q" hash="IDxvlQ">And then the twenty-four years began, and Faust had every experience of good and bad. But almost before he was aware, it was said to Faust as it must be said to everyone of us, “Thine hour is come.” Now this is the first time that he had ever thought about the consequences of what he was doing. Only now did he discover how badly he had cheated himself. Then he wanted to revoke the bargain, but that was impossible. And then he prayed and he said, “Oh God, if thou canst have no mercy on my soul, at least grant some end to my incessant pain. Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years or even an hundred thousand, but at last be saved!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p10" pid="wNmYwmGjm0yFqUsH6QbzfQ" hash="WeRXCA">But he knew that, according to his own bargain, even this could never be. And then during his last hour he sat and watched the clock tick off the seconds and finally, just as the hour struck, the last words of Faust before he died were: “Faustus is gone to hell!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p11" pid="6KDkHUitVEuuEpLURQsl9w" hash="FCJ8wA">Now if Faust had lived his last hour first, he never would have permitted himself to come to this unprofitable place. I have a relative who, when she reads a novel, always reads the last chapter first. She wants to know before she begins where she is going to be when she gets through. And that is a pretty good idea for life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p12" pid="-1r7CJyqzE2n3YEO976BEg" hash="DMdaTQ">Now I don’t know what it would be like if we sometime discovered that we had missed the goal of life and had allowed ourselves to become only telestial souls. I do know that it would be as far below the celestial as the twinkle of a tiny star is below the blaze of the noonday sun. We know quite a lot about the celestial kingdom. We know that that is the place which God has prepared for those who are valiant in his service and keep all of his commandments. We know quite a lot about celestial beings, as we have had a number of them appear to us upon this earth. And each time they have come, those who have received them have said that they are impossible to describe.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p13" pid="B2P4I35KSkutGK_L2irFgw" hash="zWEyfQ">When the Prophet Joseph Smith had his vision of the Father and the Son, he said, “[Their] brightness and glory defy all description.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>) That is, we don’t have any background of knowledge; there isn’t a vocabulary to use in describing a celestial accomplishment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p14" pid="cVAyKIh8K0WhhBdMUtO7uQ" hash="_boyXQ">There are some things that we can’t describe even in this life. For example, if I tried to describe to you the look in my little granddaughter’s eyes on Christmas morning, when she’s radiant and expectant and something is shining out through her face, I might have difficulty telling you about it even though I can understand it. I might try by saying she has a light in her eye, or her face beams, or her countenance is aglow. Now none of those things are true, actually. Her eyes are the same color, the same shape, the same size as they were before. But something is shining out through her face that is indescribable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p15" pid="6dZ2F_o020mGdJejGwy75w" hash="dvt2cA">The Prophet Joseph Smith tried to describe the resurrected Jesus as he saw him in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836. And he said, “His eyes were as a flame of fire.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 110:3</a>) It isn’t a twinkle anymore; I suppose it is now magnified a few million times. I suppose that actually there wasn’t any fire there at all, any more than there is a light in my granddaughter’s eyes. He is trying to describe something which can’t be described. He said, “His face shown above the brightness of the sun”; and that is pretty bright!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p16" pid="USASA0Wdfk20Jua1eoYWkA" hash="Pvuunw">We sometimes imagine that Jesus is different than we are, but the Prophet Joseph Smith tried to describe his some fifteen or sixteen visits with the angel Moroni. Moroni was a soldier who lived upon our continent. For the last thirty-seven years of his life he lived alone. He said, “My father hath been slain [as well as] all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go. “Wherefore,” said he, “I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.5" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:5</a>, <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/1.3" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 1:3</a>)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p17" pid="vKl2MbNBxUCxfME9rvqPQw" hash="_i2dTQ">He didn’t have a warm bathroom to go into every morning or someone to get him a good breakfast or provide him with clean clothing. We might imagine that during these many long and lonely years he had allowed his personality to run down a little bit. And then we see him for the last time as he stood there on the edge of his grave, writing us his last paragraph. In closing his great book he said, “And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.34" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:34</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p18" pid="o5HTm0voyUe35wAUEiwCPQ" hash="snNs2g">And then there followed a long silence of fourteen centuries. For 1,403 years we heard nothing more, until on the night of September 21, 1823, this same old man, now resurrected and glorified, stood by the bedside of Joseph Smith. And the Prophet tried to describe him as he then appeared. And while he said that was impossible, yet he tried. And here are some of the phrases he used. He said, “His whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.32" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:32</a>) Not only was his person glorious, but even his clothing was brilliant. “Beyond anything earthly I had ever seen,” said he, “nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.31" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:31</a>)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p19" pid="C10cgmGLDUeF-1fCia3_dA" hash="gmnUPw">We all know the things that we do to make this body a pleasant habitation. We bathe it and keep it clean; we dress it in the most appropriate clothing. Sometimes we ornament it with jewelry. If we’re very wealthy we buy necklaces and bracelets and diamond rings and other things to make this body sparkle and shine and make it a pleasant place. Sometimes we work on it a little bit with cosmetics and eyebrow tweezers. Sometimes we don’t help it very much, but we keep working at it all the time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p20" pid="LczuhqhPIUiNMiowF_bEjg" hash="fScHrw">Now if you think it would be pleasant to be dressed in expensive clothing, what do you think it would be like sometime to be dressed in an expensive body—one that shines like the sun, one that is beautiful beyond all comprehension, with quickened senses, amplified powers of perception, and vastly increased capacity for love, understanding, and happiness. And we might just keep in mind that God runs the most effective beauty parlor ever known in the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p21" pid="yQyyMRJ5EkiMroUMw3Tvwg" hash="uZzQ8w">Socrates was a very homely man, and he prayed to the Lord and said, “Make me beautiful within.” We have all seen plain people who have been made beautiful by the working of a radiant spirituality. A godly spirit will make the plainest body beautiful. Great mental and spiritual qualities transform our bodies into their likeness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/to-die-well.p22" pid="jHUwDVVFkk2PNprqiNKF_Q" hash="1D09rQ">And so we come back to the place where we began. What a thrilling experience that we may live well, enabling us to die well and then live with God in the celestial kingdom throughout eternity. The apostle Paul said, we die, “and, behold, we live.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/6.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 6:9</a>.)</p>

Crowell Co., 1960). In his book Dr. Blanton explains how for forty years he had used great ideas to heal people of their emotional difficulties and psychiatric problems. These ideas were not all in poetic form. He also used the great scriptures, the great prose, and the great hymns.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-poetry-of-success.p2" pid="bobq1ANk706Vg8sUWiDS2w" hash="z8KRvQ">I suppose this healing power of the psychiatrist might be related to the practice of a medical doctor who writes prescriptions for people to be filled not at drugstores but at bookstores, for he has discovered that there is frequently more healing power in books than in bottles. A mother heals the bumps and bruises of her children by her caresses and her loving expressions of sympathy.</p>

And I think he was giving us the detail of one method for handling this healing power when he instructed Emma Smith to make a selection of the inspiring hymns to be regularly run through our minds and hearts.</p>

(<span class="emphasis">A Collection of Sacred Hymns, for the Church of the Latter Day Saints,</span> Kirtland, Ohio: F. G. Williams and Co., 1835. Available on microfilm in the Church Historical Department, Salt Lake City.) And because each of us has a different set of needs and a different set of interests, it seems to me that each one of us ought to make his own selection of hymns and then see to it that each one is thoroughly memorized and enthusiastically appreciated so that we may get the maximum from their healing message as well as their growing and saving power.</p>

But isn’t that about what usually happens? Professor James explains that the mind is made up by what it feeds upon. He said that the mind, like the dyer’s hand, is colored by what it holds. If I hold in my hand a sponge full of purple dye, my hand becomes purple. And if I hold in my mind and heart great ideas of faith and enthusiasm, my whole personality is changed accordingly.</p>

Recently a bereaved couple came into my office to tell me about their little three-year-old daughter who, without warning, died suddenly before their eyes. Of course the parents were heartbroken. They had shed many tears but their pain had not gone away, and they wanted to release their tensions by talking with someone. We all understand that we can heal others by listening sympathetically to an expression of their grief. It helped me to help them by remembering that as a very young man I sat at the bedside of my little seven-year-old sister, whom I loved very much, while she died of diphtheria.</p>

And I could understand her pain. But finally I said to her, “Sister Jones, if you think it would help, I think I can tell you something that would be worse than your present trouble.” She said, “If you know of anything worse, I would like to hear about it.” So I recited for her James Whitcomb Riley’s poem entitled “Bereaved.” This was not the bereavement of one whose child had died, it was the bereavement of one who had no children. This sorrowful person said to her bereaved friend:</p>
