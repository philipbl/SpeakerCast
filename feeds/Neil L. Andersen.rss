Throughout my life as I have heard the General Authorities speak and felt the power of their messages, I have gained a great reverence for the sacred role they perform in the Church. Now, to be invited to sit with them and to assist them in building the kingdom of God is a privilege I feel faint in accepting. I pray for your support, for your faith and prayers that I might measure up. I ask for your patience and for the patience of my Brethren who will be my tutors. More than anything, I pray for the help of our Heavenly Father and his Son, for without their help and direction I will surely fail.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/whom-the-lord-calls-the-lord-qualifies.p2" pid="nHsBCI03f0ype6SkACYLew" hash="sQ-dSg">I am grateful for my wonderful companion, Kathy. She makes goodness look easy, and the purity of her spirit keeps our family focused on the simple yet saving truths of the gospel. I’m so thankful for the valiant and precious children that have been entrusted to us. I love them dearly and appreciate so much their willingness to support me in this new calling. I have been blessed with goodly parents. My parents are now serving as proselyting missionaries in the Georgia Macon Mission. Even before I knew, I knew that they knew the Church was true. I am so appreciative of Kathy’s parents and their example of unselfish giving, and for our brothers and sisters who live the gospel in quiet yet dedicated ways.</p>

I want to express my great love for the members in France. It was in France twenty years ago that I began to glimpse what seeking first the kingdom of God really meant. And living among these French Saints during the last three years has motivated our family to a much greater consecration. I am so grateful for the tremendous missionaries who served there with us and taught us that uncompromising faith will always prevail in a doubting and cynical world.</p>

I know that when we are on the Lord’s errand, he will be with us, he will strengthen us, he will build our capacities. I have experienced it. I have felt his lifting Spirit. In the months and years ahead, I will need him so very much.</p>

I promise to be teachable, and I pray that I can be sufficiently meek that the Lord can mold and strengthen my spirit to accomplish his purposes. I commit to you and to the Lord that I will consecrate myself to advancing the cause of the Restoration and to loyally following his chosen leaders.</p>

I know that Jesus is the Christ and that he lovingly offers the way to our forgiveness. I know that through the Prophet Joseph Smith the church of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth and that the true priesthood authority of God is in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I pray that I may always be valiant in that testimony and to these eternal truths, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p1" pid="IC4uQWtJXEy-Is8rSwSGqg" hash="ycmnFg">I express my love to you this morning. I speak to the devoted and testimony-filled members of the Church spread across the nations of the earth. The very fact that on this beautiful Saturday morning you are here in the Tabernacle, or watching this conference in some other darkened room in the middle of the day, speaks to your discipleship. You are serious about what you believe, and it shows in your life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p2" pid="V-GHKn4kJ0u_6HDyAKCrjg" hash="YJ5MHg">One admonition that has been a strength to me is the powerful declaration of the Prophet Joshua, “Choose you this day whom ye will serve; … but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/24.15" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 24:15</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p3" pid="-uQtjXOj9E2KT_h4xCT7pA" hash="Bz5a8A">The words of Joshua ring with such relevance today, and yet how we demonstrate our decision to serve the Lord seems to change with each generation. Thirty-five hundred years ago as Joshua spoke, it meant leaving behind false gods, going to battle against the Canaanites, and following with sharp attention the words of the Prophet. We can almost hear the whining of the skeptics as Joshua announced his battle plans for taking the city of Jericho. First, he said, they would quietly, without any speaking, circle the city one time for each of six days. Then on the seventh day they would compass the city seven times. Following, the priests would blow the trumpets, and at that time all the people would shout with a great shout. Then, Joshua assured them, the walls would come down (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/6.title" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 6</a>). When the walls came down, the skeptics were quiet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p4" pid="kLZ5RDPYYE2ahPmtUMR1DQ" hash="zpbZcA">In our world today, one thing has not changed since Joshua spoke: Those who choose to serve the Lord will always listen attentively and specifically to the Prophet. In modern Israel, serving the Lord means carefully following the Prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p5" pid="uXx5RWXHZUO2F0sKdnuLsQ" hash="rvRwnw">The challenges that face us and our families as disciples of Christ are somewhat different than those of Joshua’s Israelites. Let me illustrate with an experience. Our family lived for many years in the state of Florida. Because Florida has a high concentration of sand, lawns there are planted with a large broadleaf grass we call Saint Augustine. A formidable enemy of a Florida lawn is a small, brown insect called a mole cricket.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p6" pid="alXSxb10ekCVddSlGgfHUQ" hash="HofTwA">One evening as my neighbor and I stood on the front steps, he noticed a little bug crossing my sidewalk. “You better spray your lawn,” he warned. “There goes a mole cricket.” I had sprayed the lawn with insecticide not too many weeks previously, and I hardly felt that I had the time or money to do it again so soon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p7" pid="1_3lviG8lUGeFh7eSNL4Ig" hash="eNizFQ">In the light of the next morning, I examined my lawn closely. It was lush and beautifully green. I looked down into the grass to see if I could see any of the little bugs. I could see none. I remember thinking, “Well, maybe that little mole cricket was just passing through my yard on the way to my neighbor’s yard.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p8" pid="mH0E2nT6l02IZKfwmMvnWA" hash="OvxpNQ">I watched my lawn for more than a week, looking for signs of invaders, but none was evident. I congratulated myself that I had not overreacted to my neighbor’s warning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p9" pid="fKt4MY7KOUGtlzRP22K8rw" hash="yN-o8A">The story, however, has a sad ending. I came out the front door one morning, about 10 days after the conversation with my neighbor. Shockingly, as if it had happened overnight, brown spots covered my lawn. I ran to the garden store, bought the insecticide, and sprayed immediately, but it was too late. The lawn was ruined, and to return it to its former state required a new crop of sod, long hours of work, and large expense.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p10" pid="3U-I40Kqy0uq1qzw3tFvsw" hash="3RtrJg">My neighbor’s warning was central to my lawn’s welfare. He saw things I could not see. He knew something I did not know. He knew that mole crickets live underground and are active only at night, making my daytime examinations ineffective. He knew that mole crickets did not eat the leaves of the grass but rather found nourishment in the roots. He knew that these little inch-long creatures could eat a lot of roots before I would ever see the effect above the ground. I paid a dear price for my smug independence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p11" pid="NMFAmbvTH0KQHdW_OfvAiw" hash="zwT5Sg">We live in a wonderful day. The blessings of our generation are lush and beautifully green. With faith in the Savior and obedience to the commandments, our lives can be full of satisfaction and joy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p12" pid="_iu4BE3h9U2A21KUP-hCag" hash="fAcPvw">Yet in these days of much beauty, our challenges in choosing to serve the Lord are more subtle than those of former days, but without question they are as spiritually pervasive. There are spiritual mole crickets that burrow under our protective walls and invade our delicate roots. Many of these insects of wickedness appear small, at times almost invisible. Yet if we do not combat them, they will do damage and attempt to destroy that which is most precious to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p13" pid="QrDHr7G28kCFHXCWtHjoyg" hash="gHxBmw">The warnings of the Prophets and Apostles lead them ever and always to speak of the home and family. Let me demonstrate the warning voice of the Prophets. On February 11 of this year, the First Presidency, with the support of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, sent to every member of the Church a letter of counsel concerning our families. Let me read you just two sentences from this letter:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p14" pid="TsGdMg3fSE-iN_lVMbieMg" hash="SddlJg">“We counsel parents and children to give highest priority to family prayer, family home evening, gospel study and instruction, and wholesome family activities. However worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may be, they must not be permitted to displace the divinely appointed duties that only parents and families can adequately perform” (“Policies, Announcements, and Appointments,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> June 1999, 80).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p15" pid="KKSnLyhKVkqv55rwzHHG6w" hash="17se_Q">What is our reaction to this prophetic counsel? What has been my response and your response to this First Presidency letter of nearly eight months ago?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p16" pid="4hwXSeCAHEactsgWC7djCQ" hash="6oq2nA">As a parent of teenagers in a busy world, I can confirm that it takes giving these issues our highest priority to see them effectively work in our family. We have just heard the beautiful story of Elder Featherstone and family prayer. With the influences of evil that surround our children, can we even imagine sending them out in the morning without kneeling and humbly asking together for the Lord’s protection? Or closing the day without kneeling together and acknowledging our accountability before Him and our thankfulness for His blessings? Brothers and sisters, we need to have family prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p17" pid="Hzd0qbCXrkC0SC6tQ9waHQ" hash="Dg4o6Q">Certainly there are times when getting the family together to read the scriptures does not stack up as a spiritual experience worthy of a journal entry. But we must not be deterred. There are special times when the spirit of a son or daughter is just right and the power of these great scriptures goes down into their heart like fire. As we honor our Heavenly Father in our homes, He will honor our efforts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p18" pid="6PuphR_mSUCLRby1wU_YlQ" hash="6o14HA">We all know the struggle necessary to retain family home evening. There are thieves among us who would steal our Monday nights. But the promises of the Lord made to families who hold family home evening, that were spoken by the First Presidency 84 years ago and reiterated by our Prophets today, have never been revoked and are there for us:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p19" pid="uWDmoBeURE--rPZNoX3gOw" hash="8R2kNA">“If the Saints obey this counsel, we promise that great blessings will result. Love at home and obedience to parents will increase. Faith will be developed in the hearts of the youth of Israel, and they will gain power to combat the evil influence and temptations which beset them” (in James R. Clark, comp., <span class="emphasis">Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</span> 6 vols. [1965–75], 4:339).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p20" pid="yYteXb5anEKO2-cMYEYyMQ" hash="D0fqAw">Who within the sound of my voice would be willing to sell these promises to those who would confiscate our Monday nights? Not one of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p21" pid="7JLT12xDDEmAiSqXnr2PRg" hash="wwr6_Q">For you and me, the disciples of Christ, these moments of building faith in the lives of our children must be strengthened. We will at times fall short as parents. I know I do. But we must begin again. The Lord sees our righteous efforts and will open the blessings of heaven as we give our families our highest priority. My brothers and sisters, there are spiritual mole crickets at work on our roots, and we must be even more serious in our family stewardship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p22" pid="EKZWfzuabEWPGeCjvQ_1_w" hash="_0Wgpg">As we participate in this conference, let us listen attentively to our dear President Hinckley, his Counselors, and the Apostles who address us.</p>

Let us never ignore the warnings. Let us never be smug in our independence. Let us always be listening and learning in humility and faith, anxious to repent should it be necessary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/prophets-and-spiritual-mole-crickets.p24" pid="t8QP0dEJsEetVx9zuJJblA" hash="NrV3Hw">This is the kingdom of God upon the earth. You and I are disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Son of God. He lives. He directs this work. President Hinckley is His Prophet, and with him are 14 others who hold the Apostolic keys. They are watchmen on the tower, messengers of the warning voice, Prophets, Seers, and Revelators.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="13"></span>I rejoice with you in being members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As President Monson shared the wonderful news of five new temples, I thought how across the world, on every continent, in large cities and in small villages, we are a great family of believers. Together, we have begun our march toward eternal life. It is the journey of journeys. We go forward, taking upon us “the name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p2" pid="pQX0T1mAjkqKTcDQhVrfew" hash="NJ4GCQ">While there are many experiences like the one we are having today, full of spiritual power and confirmation, there are also days when we feel inadequate and unprepared, when doubt and confusion enter our spirits, when we have difficulty finding our spiritual footing. Part of our victory as disciples of Christ is what we do when these feelings come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p3" pid="gtsNoghxXU-xsfoRFPMkzQ" hash="hgTvQQ">Nearly 40 years ago as I contemplated the challenge of a mission, I felt very inadequate and unprepared. I remember praying, “Heavenly Father, how can I serve a mission when I know so little?” I believed in the Church, but I felt my spiritual knowledge was very limited. As I prayed, the feeling came: “You don’t know everything, but you know enough!” That reassurance gave me the courage to take the next step into the mission field.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p4" pid="yvBDDP76hUeMJ_EWuv7mMg" hash="4mPfGg">Our spiritual journey is the process of a lifetime. We do not know everything in the beginning or even along the way. Our conversion comes step-by-step, line upon line. We first build a foundation of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We treasure the principles and ordinances of repentance, baptism, and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. We include a continuing commitment to prayer, a willingness to be obedient, and an ongoing witness of the Book of Mormon. (The Book of Mormon is powerful spiritual nourishment.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p5" pid="yF-qQnaAPEyHCEZXOSUaFA" hash="yiDNlA">We then remain steady and patient as we progress through mortality. At times, the Lord’s answer will be, “You don’t know everything, but you know enough”—enough to keep the commandments and to do what is right. Remember Nephi’s words: “I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p6" pid="uYnMksNNW0OArivcL-cXQg" hash="VnQLcw">I once visited a mission in southern Europe. I arrived on the day a new missionary was preparing to return home at his own insistence. He had his ticket to leave the next day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p7" pid="rzrjR7uvnEObO0JRcUHn_Q" hash="8jQ7WA">We sat together in the mission president’s home. The missionary told me about his challenging childhood, of learning disorders, of moving from one family to another. He spoke sincerely of his inability to learn a new language and adapt to a new culture. Then he added, “Brother Andersen, I don’t even know if God loves me.” As he said those words, I felt a sure and forceful feeling come into my spirit: “He does know I love him. He knows it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p8" pid="pgOliy6NUEm_4J3hWL8A0w" hash="8xTgMw">I let him continue for a few more minutes, and then I said, “Elder, I’m sympathetic to much of what you’ve said, but I must correct you on one thing: you do know God loves you. You know He does.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p9" pid="IXDJixuRzkWyuC6ZDXM2ww" hash="Jr-E7g">As I said those words to him, the same Spirit that had spoken to me spoke to him. He bowed his head and began to cry. He apologized. “Brother Andersen,” he said, “I do know God loves me; I do know it.” He didn’t know everything, but he knew enough. He knew God loved him. That priceless piece of spiritual knowledge was sufficient for his doubt to be replaced with faith. He found the strength to stay on his mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p10" pid="jjk7MHwDHEaPbwbYsJiiuQ" hash="oS1Mwg">Brothers and sisters, we each have moments of spiritual power, moments of inspiration and revelation. We must sink them deep into the chambers of our souls. As we do, we prepare our spiritual home storage for moments of personal difficulty. Jesus said, “Settle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p11" pid="UvmR6bSCr0GISd91OErmCA" hash="_b55bg">Several years ago a friend of mine had a young daughter die in a tragic accident. Hopes and dreams were shattered. My friend felt unbearable <span class="pageBreak" page-number="14"></span>sorrow. He began to question what he had been taught and what he had taught as a missionary. The mother of my friend wrote me a letter and asked if I would give him a blessing. As I laid my hands upon his head, I felt to tell him something that I had not thought about in exactly the same way before. The impression that came to me was: Faith is not only a feeling; it is a decision. He would need to choose faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p12" pid="QKRXdxagkEOQiOZVb_aiTg" hash="LPwH9w">My friend did not know everything, but he knew enough. He chose the road of faith and obedience. He got on his knees. His spiritual balance returned.</p>

A short time ago I received a letter from his son who is now serving a mission. It was full of conviction and testimony. As I read his beautiful letter, I saw how a father’s choice of faith in a very difficult time had deeply blessed the next generation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p14" pid="XXgXlA5HXE23R0lDzcZmxg" hash="P8W50Q">Challenges, difficulties, questions, doubts—these are part of our mortality. But we are not alone. As disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, we have enormous spiritual reservoirs of light and truth available to us. Fear and faith cannot coexist in our hearts at the same time. In our days of difficulty, we choose the road of faith. Jesus said, “Be not afraid, only believe.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p15" pid="60-KHlZK0ki9U4A-H2NVew" hash="08dAJQ">Through the years we take these important spiritual steps over and over again. We begin to see that “he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Our questions and doubts are resolved or become less concerning to us. Our faith becomes simple and pure. We come to know what we already knew.</p>

Hadley was born with a very serious hearing impairment requiring extensive surgery to bring even limited hearing. Her parents followed with tireless training to help her learn to speak.

She looked behind her and saw a little boy sitting in a wheelchair. She noticed that the boy did not have legs.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/you-know-enough.p21" pid="4PmuiKiLu0eEZJDB7zPJUw" hash="B8KFXw">Then, unexpectedly, Hadley turned to the little boy and said, “Did you know that when Heavenly Father made me, my ears did not work? That makes me special. He made you with no legs, and that makes you special. When Jesus comes, I will be able to hear and you will get your legs. Jesus will make everything all right.”</p>

All will be made well when He comes again. This is His holy work. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, His priesthood was restored upon the earth and His prophet today is President Thomas S. Monson. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Meeting with him, I felt his shame and his deep remorse at having set his covenants aside. Following our interview, I placed my hands upon his head to give him a priesthood blessing. Before speaking a word, I felt an overpowering sense of the Savior’s love and forgiveness for him. Following the blessing, we embraced and the man wept openly.</p>

Jesus said, “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> Repentance is turning away from some things, such as dishonesty, pride, anger, and impure thoughts, and turning toward other things, such as kindness, unselfishness, patience, and spirituality.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="108"></span>When you are assigned to speak at the end of the final session of general conference, you listen to every word, wondering which parts of your talk will be given before your turn comes. There are no assigned subjects, no collaboration of themes. The Lord’s way, of course, is always the best way. He takes the individual prayerful efforts of each speaker and orchestrates a spiritual symphony full of revelation and power. Repeated themes, principle building upon principle, prophetic warnings, uplifting promises—the divine harmony is a miracle! I testify that in this conference we have heard and felt the mind and will of the Lord.</p>

The parents were members but had been less active in the Church for many, many years. Elder and Sister Going helped rekindle the family’s faith. Elder Going told me of the power he felt while standing at the baptismal font next to the father of the family as the oldest son, now holding the priesthood, baptized his younger brother and sister.

Below the ability to go out at night at your leisure. Below honing your body at the gym. Below any job you may have or hope to get.” She then adds: “Motherhood is not a hobby, it is a calling. You do not collect children because you find them cuter than stamps. It is not something to do if you can squeeze the time in. It is what God gave you time for.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

At the end of the meeting, he did something that Jami will never forget. So typical of President Monson’s thoughtfulness, he surprised her with the very same balloon that she had given to him three years before. “You’re the Best!” the balloon proclaimed. He had saved it, knowing she would return to his office when she was cured of cancer.

Their three children—Gancci, age five, Angie, age three, and Gansly, age one—were at home in their apartment with a friend.</p>

As you will remember, tens of thousands lost their lives that January in Haiti. Olgan and Soline ran as fast as they could to their apartment to find the children. The three-story apartment building where the Saintelus family lived had collapsed.</p>

The neighbors tried to comfort him and help him accept the loss of his children. Olgan continued to walk around the rubble of the collapsed building, hoping, praying. Then something quite miraculous happened. Olgan heard the almost inaudible cry of a baby. It was the cry of his baby.</p>

In the dark of the night, through the piercing sounds of hammers and chisels, the rescue workers heard another sound. They stopped their pounding and listened. They couldn’t believe what they were hearing. It was the sound of a little child—and he was singing. Five-year-old Gancci later said that he knew his father would hear him if he sang. Under the weight of crushing concrete that would later result in the amputation of his arm, Gancci was singing his favorite song, “I Am a Child of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_29">29</span></p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="39"></span>Ten years ago as my wife, Kathy, and I were living in São Paulo, Brazil, President David Marriott was presiding over the Brazil São Paulo Interlagos Mission. He and his wife, Neill, and their sons Will, Wesley, and Trace lived near us. They had left their home, their business, and many in their family to respond to a call from the prophet to serve a mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/trial-of-your-faith.p6" pid="jM4cuGVhrkW8DaJjTsYDtg" hash="3EOzyA">President Marriott called me one afternoon. Their precious, righteous 21-year-old daughter, Georgia, a senior in violin performance at Indiana University, had been hit by a truck while riding her bicycle home after a Church meeting. On first report, Georgia was doing well. Hours later her condition dramatically worsened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/trial-of-your-faith.p7" pid="9T6EDoCHr0e6xUluX7lTzA" hash="3be0xw">Family and friends began fasting and praying for a miracle for Georgia. Her mother flew through the night from Brazil. Arriving in Indiana the next day, she was met by her older children, who tearfully explained that they had been with Georgia as she passed away.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/trial-of-your-faith.p8" pid="8xryvqSDFESq-ccpgmJipg" hash="PcWCBA">I watched the Marriott family at the time of this experience and in the months and years that followed. They wept, they prayed, they spoke of Georgia, they felt immense pain and sadness, but their faith did not falter. In this morning’s session, we heard of similar faith in the beautiful lives of the Bowen and Wilberger families.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/trial-of-your-faith.p10" pid="fuPiT7aw50OFOK4N3P9uvw" hash="xxMnCw">Our faith is centered in God, our Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. It is bolstered by our knowledge that the fulness of the gospel has been restored to the earth, that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, and that prophets and apostles today hold the keys of the priesthood. We treasure our faith, work to strengthen our faith, pray for increased faith, and do all within our power to protect and defend our faith.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/trial-of-your-faith.p11" pid="YAdxGFJ1L0GYOEURJ0iwOA" hash="JZ8EXw">The Apostle Peter identified something he called a “trial of your faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> He had experienced it. Remember Jesus’s words:</p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="40"></span>These fiery trials are designed to make you stronger, but they have the potential to diminish or even destroy your trust in the Son of God and to weaken your resolve to keep your promises to Him. These trials are often camouflaged, making them difficult to identify. They take root in our weaknesses, our vulnerabilities, our sensitivities, or in those things that matter most to us. A real but manageable test for one can be a fiery trial for another.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/trial-of-your-faith.p16" pid="Mo6_p5s9LE2wz8t4QTNfKQ" hash="yeTkZw">How do you remain “steadfast and immovable”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> during a trial of faith?

Meeting together with others who believe, we pray and find answers to our prayers; we worship through music, share testimony of the Savior, serve one another, and feel the Spirit of the Lord. We partake of the sacrament, receive the blessings of the priesthood, and attend the temple. The Lord declared, “In the ordinances … , the power of godliness is manifest.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> When you are faced with a test of faith, stay within the safety and security of the household of God. There is always a place for you here. No trial is so large we can’t overcome it together.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

Always faithful, serves nobly in the Church, admired professionally, adored by her family, and while she anticipated marriage and children, she is single. “I made the decision,” she said, “to put my … trust in Jesus Christ.

He hoped to have a family. His trial of faith: feelings of same-sex attraction. He wrote me recently: “I am promised in my patriarchal blessing that I will have my own family someday. Whether that will occur in this life or the next, I do not know. But what I do know is that I don’t want to do anything that will jeopardize the blessings God has promised both me and my future posterity. … Living [the law of chastity] is a challenge, but did we not come to earth to confront challenges and to show God our love and respect for Him by keeping His commandments?

In 1985, I remember a colleague walking into my business office in Florida. He had a <span class="emphasis">Time</span> magazine article entitled “Challenging Mormonism’s Roots.” It spoke of a recently discovered letter, supposedly written by Martin Harris, that conflicted with Joseph Smith’s account of finding the Book of Mormon plates.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>

There is an important principle that governs the doctrine of the Church. The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. True principles are taught frequently and by many. Our doctrine is not difficult to find.</p>

The fact that I was forced to turn to God for help almost daily over an extended period of years taught me truly how to pray and get answers to prayer and taught me in a very practical way to have faith in God. I came to know my Savior and my Heavenly Father in a way and to a degree that might not have happened otherwise or that might have taken me much longer to achieve. … I learned to trust in the Lord with all my heart.

Six months ago as President Monson announced the age change for young men and young women desiring to serve missions, there was an undeniable spiritual outpouring. Faith overcame doubt, and young men and women moved forward. The Thursday following conference, I was assigned to recommend missionary calls to the First Presidency. I was amazed to see the applications of 18-year-old men and 19-year-old women who had already adjusted their plans, visited their doctors, been interviewed by their bishops and stake presidents, and submitted their missionary applications—all in just five days. Thousands more have now joined them. It’s a miracle.</p>

As winds whip around a young sapling, forces inside the tree do two things. First, they stimulate the roots to grow faster and spread farther. Second, the forces in the tree start creating cell structures that actually make the trunk and branches thicker and more flexible to the pressure of the wind. These stronger roots and branches protect the tree from winds that are sure to return.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span>

Let your voice help fulfill Moroni’s prophetic words to speak good of the Prophet. Here are two ideas: First, find scriptures in the Book of Mormon that you feel and know are absolutely true. Then share them with family and friends in family home evening, seminary, and your Young Men and Young Women classes, acknowledging that Joseph was an instrument in God’s hands. Next, read the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h" class="scriptureRef">Pearl of Great Price</a> or in <a href="http://lds.org/topics/joseph-smith/testimony">this pamphlet</a>, now in 158 languages. You can find it online at LDS.org or with the missionaries. This is Joseph’s own testimony of what actually occurred. Read it often. Consider recording the testimony of Joseph Smith in your own voice, listening to it regularly, and sharing it with friends. Listening to the Prophet’s testimony in your own voice will help bring the witness you seek.</p>

High on the mountain overlooking Port-au-Prince, we joined with Haitian Saints in commemorating the dedication of the country by then-Elder Thomas S. Monson only 30 years earlier. None of us will ever forget the devastating Haitian earthquake of 2010. With faithful members and a courageous band of missionaries made up almost exclusively of Haitians, the Church in this island nation has continued to grow and strengthen. It lifts my faith to visualize these righteous Saints of God, clothed in white, having the power of the holy priesthood to direct and perform the sacred ordinances in the Lord’s house.</p>

Christians are only 1 percent of this principally Buddhist country. As in Haiti we also find in Bangkok that the Lord has gathered the elect of the earth. While there a few months ago, we met Sathit and Juthamas Kaivaivatana and their devoted children. Sathit joined the Church when he was 17 and served a mission in his native land. Later he met Juthamas at the institute, and they were sealed in the Manila Philippines Temple. In 1993 the Kaivaivatanas were hit by a truck whose driver had fallen asleep, and Sathit was paralyzed from his chest down. Their faith has never wavered. Sathit is an admired teacher at the International School Bangkok. He serves as the stake president of the Thailand Bangkok North Stake. We see God’s miracles in His wondrous work and in our own personal lives.</p>

They joined the Church as young married couples, one in Germany and one in France. In the 1980s, Philippe and Lucien felt drawn back to their native African country for the purpose of building the kingdom of God. For Sister Assard, who is German, to leave her family and allow Brother Assard to leave his work as an accomplished mechanical engineer required unusual faith. The two couples met each other for the first time in the Ivory Coast and started a Sunday School. That was 30 years ago. There are now eight stakes and 27,000 members in this beautiful African country. The Affoues continue to serve nobly as do the Assards, who recently completed a mission to the Accra Ghana Temple.</p>

Sadly, Aroldo’s mother was diagnosed with cancer. Three months later, only days before she died, she spoke to Aroldo of her greatest concern: There were no relatives to help. Aroldo would need to take full responsibility for his two younger sisters and his younger brother. He solemnly made this promise to his dying mother.</p>

At age 23, he received his mission call. He told his brother how much to withdraw each month from his account for the family. Aroldo still did not have enough money to pay the full cost of his mission and the living expenses for his brother and sisters, but with faith he entered the MTC. A week later he received the first of many blessings. The bank that had employed Elder Cavalcante unexpectedly doubled the money he was to receive as he concluded his work. This miracle, along with others, provided the needed income for his mission and his family during his absence.</p>

I know that she, along with Tanner, Ellie, and my dad are … praying for [my brothers and] me.

Faith is a choice. Strengthen your faith, and live to be deserving of the Savior’s approving words: “Great is thy faith.” As you do, I promise you that your faith, through the grace of Jesus Christ, will one day allow you to stand with those you love, clean and pure in the presence of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Our Church culture and vernacular are at times quite unique. The Primary children are not going to stop singing “Families Can Be Together Forever,”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; but when they sing, “I’m so glad when daddy comes home”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; or “with father and mother leading the way,”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; not all children will be singing about their own family.&lt;/p&gt;

She said: “Our teacher was sharing a lesson about temple marriage. She specifically asked me, ‘Bette, your parents weren’t married in the temple, were they?’ [My teacher and the rest of the class] knew the answer.” The teacher’s lesson followed, and Bette imagined the worst. Bette said, “I had many tearful nights. When I had heart problems two years later and thought I was going to die, I panicked, thinking I would be alone forever.”&lt;/p&gt;

Although her family was not religious, at age 12, Zuleika began to read the Bible and visit local churches, searching to know more about God. With her parents’ reluctant permission, she studied with the missionaries, gained a testimony, and was baptized. Zuleika told me: “During the discussions, I was shown a picture of the Salt Lake Temple and told about the sealing ordinances. From that moment, I had the desire of one day entering into the house of the Lord and having an eternal family.”&lt;/p&gt;

Their parents are divorced, and they have not received permission to be baptized. Even though they can’t pass the sacrament, they bring the bread each week. And even though they can’t enter the temple to do baptisms with the youth when their ward goes to the temple, the two brothers find family names next door at the family history center. The greatest influence on helping our youth feel included is other righteous youth.&lt;/p&gt;

Because the chapel was not large enough for the 2,000 members, we met out of doors under large plastic coverings supported by bamboo poles. As the meeting began, we could see dozens of children watching us, clinging to the bars on the outside of the wrought-iron fence that surrounded the property. Kathy quietly whispered, “Neil, do you think that you might want to invite the children to come in?” I approached District President Kalonji at the podium and asked him if he would welcome the children outside the fence to come join us inside.&lt;/p&gt;

It is like an enormous puzzle whose pieces will be set in place prior to the glorious events of the Second Coming. Just as we might be perplexed with a mountain of puzzle pieces, the early Saints must have seen the commission to take the restored gospel to all the world as a nearly impossible task. But they began, one person, one puzzle piece at a time, finding the straight edges, working to rightly frame this divine work. Little by little, the stone cut without hands began to roll forth; from hundreds to thousands, to tens of thousands, and now millions of covenant Latter-day Saints across every nation are connecting the puzzle pieces of this marvelous work and a wonder.</p>

He was one of the best and the brightest. After he received his doctoral degree from Harvard University, emphasizing Russian affairs, Bruce’s thinking and writing brought prominence that could have derailed him, but the wealth and praise of the world never clouded his view.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span> His loyalty was to his Savior, Jesus Christ; to his eternal companion, Susan; to his children and grandchildren.</p>
