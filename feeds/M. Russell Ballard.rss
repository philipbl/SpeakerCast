      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p2" pid="lqNKIt74WkK4GS9vEnxl6g" hash="UddSwA">Recently I held our first grandchild in my arms and had the same feelings come to me that I had when I held each one of my own children shortly after their birth. As I looked into their innocent faces, these questions came into my mind: “Who are you, my little one? What does Heavenly Father want you to accomplish in this life?” I imagine that many of you parents have had the same thoughts as you have held your infant children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p3" pid="Pw1rkNgJ3EGYbOtC6dScVQ" hash="JKmj8g">I wonder if Spencer W. Kimball’s father had any idea, when he first held this infant son, that into his home had come a spirit ordained in the premortal life to someday grow in such spiritual strength and power that he would sit in this great conference today as our prophet and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? It is possible, my brothers and sisters, that among the little ones in your homes and in your care are spirit children that were sent to you to be trained and prepared to fulfill callings as General Authorities, stake presidents, bishops, Relief Society or Primary presidents. In someone’s home there is a little one sent from our Heavenly Father that someday will be called to sit in the seat where our great prophet now sits. Whoever is training our prophet of the future generations, please train him well. Teach him to love the Lord, the scriptures, and his fellowmen as President Kimball loves us today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p4" pid="_CPff8FKkk2C7B35nSUhVg" hash="0fe8mg">What can we do to better prepare our children spiritually for their eternal roles? Perhaps the most inclusive answer is: Teach them how to live the principles of the gospel. To be good teachers, we must learn to be better listeners. Let me share one personal example: Our first child, Clark, when he was four years old, appeared to be guilty of some minor wrongdoing that at the time seemed to require some sound fatherly counsel. I took him into the bedroom and talked to him about why he must not ever again do what I had predetermined that he had done. When I concluded my great discourse, this little, brown-eyed boy looked into my eyes and said, “But Daddy, I didn’t do it.” Through his eyes his spirit talked to me and I knew that he was telling me the truth. I embraced him and asked for his forgiveness. His spirit, though in a four-year-old mortal body, spoke loudly to me that day, and I learned from him a great lesson: Always be a good listener.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p5" pid="tYq0eNrqFE27js4UegLRjg" hash="St4nBA">Oh how important it is for parents to understand the eternal plan of our Heavenly Father, as he sends his spirit children here and entrusts them to us for a few short years. Just think of it! Within every human body dwells a living spirit born to our loving, eternal heavenly parents. When parents know this, they can better guide their families by focusing upon the eternal relationships and the true purposes of this life. No thinking parent would ever allow any verbal or physical abuse of their children to creep into their home and destroy the destiny of their eternal family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p6" pid="v-2wX1127kKQqDuuvJBgMQ" hash="0-WmHA">Some children receive mortal bodies with limitations that might restrict their physical activities but not their spiritual development. In the Lord’s eternal plan, perhaps the spiritual growth of other family members required the presence of a child with some physical limitation. Just this month a lovely family shared with me this poem written for their little girl:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p7" pid="YG8aKZ2YbkW5RaCMigqfew" hash="r1UzLQ">I stand in awe when I consider the great confidence Heavenly Father has placed in you and me when he allows us the privilege of being the mortal fathers and mothers to his eternal spirit offspring. We must never forget that he has a vested interest in every one of us, and we must realize how important each human soul is in God’s eternal plan. When we understand the importance of each soul, we can go before him confidently in prayer to seek his guidance and direction in our sacred assignment as parents. He said, “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>). This seems to me to best sum up the important role that mortal parents have in the great eternal plan of life for each member of our families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p8" pid="R6OXcOyvLkuePqRA95DHTw" hash="BPMeJg">I believe that most mortal bodies grow to physical maturity with a relatively simple effort on the part of parents. When we see that our children receive the proper rest, food, and exercise, we find that the physical body generally grows into full maturity on schedule. As the maturing process continues, we start to notice that the physical body begins to age. Wrinkles appear where the skin was smooth. Most hair turns gray, thins out a bit, and then ultimately turns white. The process of aging continues and results in death. The eternal spirit of man then leaves its mortal home to return and report to our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p9" pid="kk2MPimAjUyKSqAUXkp0oQ" hash="_McvfA">Some parents become so expert at filling every physical desire for their children that they begin to suppose that all is well in this life and that their eternal stewardship is progressing right on schedule. I have noticed that some children living in too much luxury can lose their sense of spiritual values and misplace their eternal priorities. I believe that we must pause and take a careful inventory to determine how well our families are doing spiritually. We could ask how well are we feeding, nurturing, training, and exercising the spirits of our children; or how well have we taught, trained, loved, and inspired our children to build their spiritual muscles and strength? We are given many teaching moments, and the Church has given us the special family home evening to help us accomplish this purpose. Remember, eternity is now, not a vague, distant future. We prepare each day, right now, for eternal life. If we are not preparing for eternal life, we are preparing for something else, perhaps something far less.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p10" pid="vx8FyN1dbEGPU8ZXm9CfuQ" hash="GIvNGg">I have noticed that the spirit of man is not like the body as it grows older, but rather is just the opposite. If the spirit of man is properly cared for, rather than becoming slower to move and less capable, as the body does, the spirit becomes more confident and waxes strong in the presence of God. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>.) Through the eyes of the strong in spirit we can feel their power and strength. Those of us who are blessed to know the First Presidency and the members of the Council of the Twelve can witness that the age of their physical bodies has no relationship to the capacity of their spirits. I testify that when you clasp the hand of one of these brethren you feel the power and the strength of the spirit that is within them, and you realize that through years of obedient living of the gospel they have developed their spirits to such a degree that they now can strengthen the entire Church. I know that thousands of our Saints have learned that spiritual growth is the most important part of life. How blessed are children who are raised by parents that understand and teach this to them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p11" pid="o3XPIUh8t0qlORUz07Nu7Q" hash="qnj7ww">My message, then, is this. We must carefully and conscientiously provide solid spiritual training for the eternal growth of our children. Thoughtful planning will be required because providing spiritual development for them is not quite as simple as meeting their physical needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p12" pid="k-GsI2duE0GSSlUB5nSqQg" hash="ay4OCQ">The prophets of the Lord, both ancient and modern, have given clear instruction to you and me. Moses gave us the basic Ten Commandments. The Savior added to these instructions and gave to us the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. In 1820, our Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son appeared personally to the Prophet Joseph and set in motion the restoration of the fulness of the gospel, with all of the necessary priesthood powers to act in their names in spiritual matters. As one becomes more familiar with the revelations, both ancient and modern, the evidence is overwhelming that our Heavenly Father is much more concerned with the proper spiritual growth of his children than with the physical.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p13" pid="zfwM1IPvEUu2eJdHHWJw4w" hash="-4JUGQ">It is beautiful to know that if we can build upon a solid spiritual foundation—if we can repent of our sins and grow in wisdom, knowledge, and understanding—we can enjoy dwelling in the presence of our Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, forever and ever. This is eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/spiritual-development.p14" pid="DfOrYa3rCEGdDMPx1hLCtg" hash="en5ynQ">I know God lives and that all men are his children. I testify that Jesus is the Christ and if all men will seek to know the truth and follow his example we will be able to live up to the spiritual expectations of our Heavenly Father. May we be blessed so to do, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/you-can-be-the-voice.p3" pid="0iF_j4vQu0askiuQFNf2_Q" hash="K5LYmA">When we left Reno, the weather was a little cloudy, and my friend was somewhat worried about it. Because of his concern, we landed at the Lake Tahoe airport to get a second report on the weather. It did not indicate that the weather was too bad, so we continued our flight to San Rafael.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/you-can-be-the-voice.p4" pid="-njrH7earUOM_vVkKZkZtQ" hash="DdKwKw">Our destination was an airport in the northern part of San Francisco Bay. As we approached the Bay area, the clouds became increasingly low and dense. We tried to stay under the clouds so we could see the water and thus keep our bearings visually. But suddenly we flew into very dense clouds and could see nothing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/you-can-be-the-voice.p5" pid="Ixxg4NL6vEK0x6mGvLduDQ" hash="_A3zYA">When you fly into such clouds, you become totally disoriented. You do not know whether you are flying straight, sideways, or upside down. You lose your sense of forward motion, and it takes a few minutes for the pilot to orient himself from visual flying to instrument flying. At 180 miles an hour, you move a long distance in that few minutes and can get into serious trouble very quickly. Unfortunately, my friend had not flown entirely on instruments for two years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/you-can-be-the-voice.p6" pid="mZ1IShgW4ESN9mgTEFSXIg" hash="eHjVAw">My friend struggled intensely and was near the point of panic as he tried to recall all that he had learned about instrument flying. I knew very little about instrument flying, so I could not help him. All I could do was put my hand on his shoulder and tell him to take a deep breath and get hold of himself. The only instrument that I could read was the altimeter. I said, “We are now at 500 feet. Don’t make any quick moves; just think it out, and you can pull us through.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/you-can-be-the-voice.p7" pid="2e9HpoDqW06Znn9jjQAv3g" hash="HtAvJg">It seemed an eternity before he finally made radio contact with Hamilton Air Force Base. He said to them, “I am in trouble; please help me.” The air traffic controllers had us on their radar screen and immediately began to help my friend regain control of the plane. They told us where we were and started to give us instructions to help guide us to safety.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/you-can-be-the-voice.p8" pid="8MLa5CoSskCJvjA9Ai6hxA" hash="_l0JWA">When my friend heard the voice from Hamilton Tower, he regained a sense of confidence that enabled him to gain control. But he knew that the plane was completely out of control and that our chances of pulling out of this danger were marginal. We could easily go the wrong way. The foothills, buildings, towers, and bridges were not far away. At one time we dropped to only 200 feet, and must have been flying upside down at one time because the maps and other items in the visor above my head fell into my lap.</p>

I thought of my wife, my seven children, my parents, my business partners, the 37 priests whom I was the adviser to, and many other things. I prayed fervently all through this crisis and made a commitment more deep and more sincere than ever before in my life. I began, “Heavenly Father, guide us out of this thick, dense cloud, and help my friend remember all he knows about instrument flying.” And then I said, “In the name of Jesus Christ and by the power of the holy priesthood, bless my friend that he might regain control.” My prayer continued. I committed to Heavenly Father that if he would help us, I would place my life in his hands. I promised him that I would be what he wanted me to be.</p>

Please find a small piece of paper and a pencil. Borrow from your neighbor if you need to. Now, brethren, write on your piece of paper the name of one inactive or nonmember man or boy who lives in your ward. Will you make a commitment tonight that you will do all in your power, with the help of the Lord, to lead that person out of darkness into the full light of the gospel? You can be to him as the voice from Hamilton Tower was to my friend and me, and you can guide him safely into full fellowship in the Church of Jesus Christ.</p>

Hundreds of letters filled with pleas for help have come to the General Authorities. Fathers plead for their sons, mothers for their daughters, boys and girls for their parents. The contents of these letters have been heartrending.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p2" pid="-rieeAaRfUWdJnjcBUEx5A" hash="WLf4Nw">I have learned firsthand that the wounds of those who suffer spiritually can be healed when you and I put forth the extra personal effort required to reach out to them.</p>

A woman was healed by simply touching the border of his garment, as recorded in the book of Luke:</p>

Oh yes, he can, and he will if we will just do our part. A home teacher in Florida let the Savior’s touch be felt in this way. I quote excerpts from a letter to me dated July 8, 1980.</p>

For more than three years he missed coming only once. My husband found in our home teacher someone to talk to. He unburdened his years of bitterness and unhappiness. He had never had a real friend before in his entire life.</p>

My husband and I attended and at the conclusion of the meeting, you put your arm around my husband and the Lord spoke through you. You told my husband that our Heavenly Father loved him and wanted him to be baptized and that the Church needed him.</p>

We called our former home teacher, now living in Louisiana, to see when he could come to baptize my husband. He came and baptized him. One year later he was with us and our family when we were sealed for time and eternity in the Washington Temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p13" pid="EXUKYGqypUWu5_D15R4l-g" hash="quP5kA">“Although you may not remember us—for we know you meet many people every year—our lives were touched in an unforgettable way.

The teacher would go to the girl’s home and read out loud while the girl translated her personal progress book into braille. The work took two years. The teacher also encouraged the other girls in the class to help. Under her direction, they went to the blind girl’s home and read to her from the manual until it was translated into braille.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p16" pid="XNoxVN6lBU6Y4smLozI6uQ" hash="_kZIVw">Sometimes the Savior’s touch can reach others through little bodies with big hearts. A lovely woman had received the missionary discussions but had not made the final commitment to be baptized. One Sunday she decided to attend sacrament meeting in a ward where she was not acquainted. She wanted a place where she could be alone with her thoughts. She sat beside a little boy. As the sacrament was passed, this little boy noticed that she did not take the sacrament bread. When it came to him, he carefully broke it in two and gave half to her. The woman was very impressed that a child would perform such a meaningful act of kindness. That day she contacted the missionaries and said, “If this is what you teach the children in your church, I want to become a member.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p17" pid="dOmLH2JQrUyKBArqyukkkg" hash="u3styQ">The Lord taught the Nephites, “Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.24" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 18:24</a>.) A recent example of the light of the Lord touching someone who needed it desperately came when I called upon a very close friend shortly after the death of his eternal companion. I asked him, “What can I now do to help?” He answered, “Help my son to understand.” You see, this son loved his mother very much. When he saw her suffer month after month, he began to feel that the prayers and the priesthood blessings went unanswered. This caused his faith in our Heavenly Father to waiver, and he lost the light of the Lord in his life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p18" pid="ddp_IzbbAEO9nKIm_oKEOw" hash="2ZZw5g">The words rang in my ears: “Help my son to understand.” I asked myself, “How? What can I do?” Finally, I invited him to come to Church headquarters to talk with me. When he arrived and we went to the lunchroom, a most unusual circumstance unfolded while we were eating. During our visit, many General Authorities came by our table and greeted us. Most importantly, he shook hands with eight of the Twelve Apostles that sit here on the stand. Never before or since have I seen that many members of the Twelve in the lunchroom at one time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p19" pid="DyTk3CZ3gkWb5NvYEudg-A" hash="0Uc15g">As we were leaving the Church offices, another unusual thing happened. We caught a glimpse of President Kimball, and my young friend asked, “Does President Kimball ever talk to someone like me?” Circumstances that would rarely happen again placed us with President Kimball for a few minutes. The short time with him was unforgettably impressive. His instructions were eternal, and his love for this young man was unquestionable. My friend’s heart and mine were touched deeply during those few minutes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p20" pid="znDjzIu1DkaDOyT0dH6ysA" hash="m0sGTA">President Kimball’s final statement to this young man, after giving him a loving embrace, impressed my friend very much. He said, “My boy, when you come home from your mission, you will understand more fully the things we have been talking about.” That day a prophet of God reached out as I suppose only a prophet can. Through him, the Savior touched the life of my friend and turned him toward the light of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p21" pid="MIE-5NNYo0evcKGflUR4WQ" hash="X3Uhhw">As we returned to the parking area, I put my arm around him and said, “I know that your mother knows you are here today. Because of her love and devotion to the Lord and her great love for you, I am sure our Heavenly Father has allowed her influence to be felt here today.” Tears flowed, attitudes changed, directions became clear, and commitments were made.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p22" pid="A8OROwr3C0W47bWyFsGmvw" hash="_Vjipg">What a thrill, my brothers and sisters, to report a few months later to President Kimball that this fine young man was serving faithfully and diligently as a full-time missionary!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p23" pid="Yw6MdKHNNUeYC_wsFiy4LA" hash="euTS0Q">Finally, may I share how the Lord will touch our personal lives through our own faith and prayers. A beautiful baby girl came to our son’s home only to stay with them here on earth for less than five months. The love and care given to her by her parents was deeply touching. The struggle of this infant granddaughter for life was almost more than we could bear. The night before her passing, we went to the Logan hospital giving what support we could to our children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p24" pid="YPy91J0XqkSOhOMN60fzlw" hash="bNmn_w">Later that evening in my son’s home, his mother and I knelt with him and prayed for guidance. When we returned to the hospital and I took my tiny little grandchild’s hand and looked at her, I felt the Savior’s touch. Into my mind came the words, as though spoken by her to me, “Don’t worry, grandpa; I’ll be all right.” Peace came into my heart. The Master’s touch fell upon all of us. Soon thereafter she was released to go home again to her heavenly parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p25" pid="OHm5RXovLECJ3GOA9YWeOA" hash="a0ex6w">Oh, yes, brothers and sisters; we can feel the Savior’s touch, and we can help others feel that divine touch. We can bless each other by reaching out to the wayward youth, the inactive adult, the widowed, the aged, the sick, and to all of God’s children everywhere, member and nonmember of the Church alike.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p26" pid="4IVNDye7bEmT73gfSmQipg" hash="gelWuQ">We somehow need to realize the vital importance of feeling the blessings of the gospel and the peace of the Lord in our lives individually. That is much more significant than how well the mechanics of a program may be working in our wards and stakes. Oh, that every parent, teacher, and Church leader would know that we can bless each other when we administer the Savior’s touch to the benefit of our fellowmen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p27" pid="jzdR0DNd7UmaMDsLM-heAg" hash="WwBQNQ">I realize that many of you are very conscious of the needs of others. I also know that you and I can do much more. Let us make the choice never to let a day pass without striving to touch the life of someone through our service! Then we can cherish and appreciate more the Savior’s beautiful admonition: “Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-saviors-touch.p28" pid="loV9kVsNRkiBo9rZanNlVw" hash="v9LZwA">I bear testimony that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, that he touched the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and that through him the fulness of the gospel has been restored to the earth to bless and guide all mankind. This witness and testimony I bear in the sacred and beloved name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

One expert estimates that one-third of all American families are overextended. Last year tens of thousands of families filed for personal bankruptcy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/providing-for-our-needs.p3" pid="7SUIp2JVJ0mPd1evnJVYWQ" hash="Z0I5Qw">A recent survey conducted by the Welfare Services Department provided the following information: Fewer than one-half of the members surveyed have a year’s supply of financial resources, and 89 percent feel the burden of increased taxes and inflation. Thirty-four percent of the Latter-day Saint women surveyed are employed outside the home. Fifty-seven percent of them are working to earn the money they need to meet basic family requirements. Thirty-one percent of the families are doing without many things, and 39 percent are not earning enough money to meet their basic needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/providing-for-our-needs.p4" pid="wmiQB7PrbEaGN0jjDTwxZA" hash="bP3-gQ">These results demonstrate that today we as leaders need to teach our people that they must become efficient managers of their time and resources.</p>

He said, “If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/9.23" class="scriptureRef">Mark 9:23</a>.)</p>

May I suggest three important keys that will help us. They are <span class="emphasis">attitude, planning,</span> and <span class="emphasis">self-discipline.</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/providing-for-our-needs.p10" pid="ReXHk9Bx3kGx93psjgDMYw" hash="k2KY2Q">Attitude is an important part of the foundation upon which we build a productive life. In appraising our present attitude, we might ask: “Am I working to become my best self? Do I set worthy and attainable goals? Do I look toward the positive in life? Am I alert to ways that I can render more and better service? Am I doing more than is required of me?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/providing-for-our-needs.p11" pid="8VzQsUSkYU6Gh_7JolJdxA" hash="bTtWWQ">Remember, a good attitude produces good results, a fair attitude fair results, a poor attitude poor results. We each shape our own life, and the shape of it is determined largely by our attitude. George Bernard Shaw wrote: “People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don’t believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can’t find them, make them.” (<span class="emphasis">Mrs. Warren’s Profession,</span> in <span class="emphasis">Plays by George Bernard Shaw,</span> New York: New American Library, 1960, p. 82.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/providing-for-our-needs.p12" pid="NUlnX7_IVUCh-1VnQD2LSg" hash="d8nqnA">Too many people in our country today are developing the attitude that government is obligated to care and provide for them. In many ways, government has fostered this attitude, but the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints know better.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/providing-for-our-needs.p13" pid="ZCmJJl3dREC1BVRgdpkMRA" hash="-U4iGw">Some people who lived through the Great Depression and the period following, when the government bestowed gratuities upon the people, developed a feeling that the world owed them a living. In that climate, the First Presidency said in 1936: “The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 3.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/providing-for-our-needs.p14" pid="EKLONjtsJ0mzZkxIIV5cNw" hash="lQZXWA">The love of work is an attitude that members of the Church must develop. In some ways, we have gone through a period of great prosperity which may, when history is written, prove to be as devastating as the Great Depression in its effect upon the attitudes of the people. President Harold B. Lee said, “Today we are being tested and tried by another kind of test that I might call the ‘test of gold’—the test of plenty, affluence, ease—more than perhaps the youth of any generation have passed through, at least in this Church.” (<span class="emphasis">Sweet Are the Uses of Adversity … ,</span> Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year, Provo, 7 Feb. 1962, p. 3.)</p>

When I returned from my first mission, I went to work for my father as a salesman. I was attending the University of Utah and working part-time.

When I became fully aware of the immense effort required to prepare a single course of study, I was overwhelmed. I now have much greater appreciation for the approved teaching materials of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/teaching-no-greater-call.p2" pid="T2c_WPzzX0y05aw43EA9RA" hash="4jeaGg">Let me give you an example. The present <span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine Teacher’s Supplement,</span> which was prepared to help teachers teach the New Testament, was written by a committee of faithful and knowledgeable Church-service writers, who were called and set apart for that service by one of the General Authorities. Their work commenced in the spring of 1980, following General Authority approval of the outline. Writing committee members spent thousands of hours researching, writing, and attending biweekly committee meetings, where the entire committee critiqued each lesson carefully and suggested improvements. The work of the writing committee then was reviewed by General Authority Managing Directors of the Priesthood and Curriculum departments, the General Presidency and the General Board of the Sunday School, Church Editing, and Church Correlation Review. This manual received careful scrutiny at many levels before it was approved for use in Sunday School this year. All teaching materials for the Church follow this same basic procedure in their preparation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/teaching-no-greater-call.p3" pid="V1RCsmpBuU2DunKEwZXTdw" hash="AARdmg">Teachers would be well advised to study carefully the scriptures and their manuals before reaching out for supplemental materials. Far too many teachers seem to stray from the approved curriculum materials without fully reviewing them. If teachers feel a need to use some good supplemental resources beyond the scriptures and manuals in presenting a lesson, they should first consider the use of the Church magazines.</p>

Elder Hyrum M. Smith of the Council of the Twelve said, “There is more to be learned in five minutes reading in the Holy Scriptures, more that is worthy of retention in the memory, more that will be helpful if we remember and obey them, than we can find in reading all of the six best sellers in every month in the year.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1917, p. 38.)</p>

Effective teaching by the Spirit can stir the souls of men with a desire to live the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ more completely.</p>

Who is your leading man? Who is the governor and controlling spirit of that little place?’ The old gentleman replied, ‘I am the king of that little town.’ ‘Really,’ says the traveller, ‘are you the leading man?’ ‘Yes, sir, I am king in that place, and reign as king.’ ‘How do you make this to appear? Are you in affluent circumstances?’ ‘No, I am poor; but in that little village there are so many children. All those children go to my school; I rule the children, and they rule their parents, and that makes me king.’” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 9:39.)</p>

He said, “Your essential and all but sole duty, is to teach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. … You are to teach this Gospel using as your sources and authorities the Standard Works of the Church, and the words of those whom God has called to lead His people in these last days. You are not … to intrude into your work your own peculiar philosophy, no matter what its source or how pleasing or rational it seems to you to be.” (“The Charted Course of the Church in Education” [an address delivered at the Brigham Young University Summer School in Aspen Grove, Utah, 8 Aug. 1938, p. 9].)</p>

He said, “Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.29" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:29</a>.) The Lord stressed the need for prayerful preparation by teachers, as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants: “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:14</a>.)</p>

Use the scriptures and the approved curriculum materials, teaching with the objective to bless and inspire the lives of those assigned to you.

The doctrine seems quite clear to me; the remission of sins is an ongoing process. As each one of us strives to become clean, pure, and even sanctified, I see no better way for us to do this than to help others of our Heavenly Father’s children find the truth.</p>

We need not be sent to far-flung cities or set our feet on distant lands to be missionaries. Our next-door neighbors, friends, acquaintances, family members, relatives, and the stranger down the street are all part of the world with whom we should be sharing the gospel message. No member of the Church needs to wait for the ward, stake, mission, or any Church organization, to lead them in doing this work.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/write-down-a-date.p" pid="rzuE_mg1GkmCCh4A5hktNw" hash="_GkvdQ">Because living the gospel is essential to the remission of sins, and because giving missionary service is essential to living the gospel, I believe each one of us must set a definite date at least once each year to have an individual or a family ready to be taught the gospel. We should expect to have wonderful success. We in the Missionary Department would like to hear of your success as you follow this counsel. No joy equals that of bringing the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ into the life of one of Heavenly Father’s children. Missionary experiences can bring to every member of the Church the calm reassurance that his sins are in very deed being forgiven. Our Heavenly Father will love us for proclaiming the gospel of His Son, Jesus Christ, to all of His children on the earth.</p>

Our individual efforts can produce a great increase in building the kingdom of God. If just 30 percent of the active adult members of the Church would follow this simple procedure at least once each year, we would add 200,000 <span class="emphasis">additional</span> converts to those we are already baptizing. Compounded, this would mean in ten years an increase of at least 5.4 million more converts than we would have had at our present level of member effort. If 100 percent of the active adults would participate, we would soon start to see that every living soul can receive the message.</p>

May we all look upon this not as a duty but rather as a great privilege. This I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The world is very small in some ways. Had I been able to fly directly from Addis Ababa to Salt Lake City, it would have taken approximately nineteen hours. In many other ways, however, the world is very large. Billions of our Heavenly Father’s children live upon the earth in all kinds of circumstances; the plight of those who are living in the drought-stricken areas of Africa is disastrous. Human suffering there is almost beyond description. I do not know all the reasons for the suffering. However, this most recent experience in my life has had a profound effect on me. I will never be the same.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/prepare-to-serve.p2" pid="hb4aV21o80as_Vb_7wRvpw" hash="zb3KYA">I can testify to you, my brethren, that I know as I have never known before that to enjoy the privilege of holding the holy priesthood is a most treasured blessing. If every one of you young men of the Aaronic Priesthood could have been on the mission to Ethiopia with Bishop Glenn Pace and me, your hearts surely would have been filled with the <span class="emphasis">desire</span> to honor your priesthood. I do not believe even one of us in this vast priesthood gathering should take for granted the great blessings that we enjoy as bearers of the holy priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/prepare-to-serve.p3" pid="JK5fRgoEAEWVM1aMID3J_g" hash="nD1veA">When we arrived in Ethiopia, we found one member of the Church, Brother Harry Hadlock from Seattle, Washington. He was overjoyed to meet two brethren of the priesthood. On Sunday morning, the three of us held a testimony meeting and then, with our priesthood, blessed and passed the sacrament. The Spirit of the Lord was present. Because we had a deep yearning to help our Father’s children who were suffering, we offered a special prayer that rain might come to that drought-stricken area. We felt a deep sense of the importance of our mission. I knew that if we called upon the Lord to bless the land, the elements would be tempered. We prayed, brethren, for rain. During the balance of the time we were in Ethiopia it rained every day wherever we traveled. We were grateful to our Heavenly Father because the rain was a special witness to us that he was aware that his sons, bearing his holy priesthood, were about his business in that part of the world.</p>

We have a spiritual gift, the <span class="emphasis">living waters,</span> to share. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/4.10" class="scriptureRef">John 4:10</a>.) Could we but give them this, they would not thirst thereafter. My brethren, tonight I feel a deep urgency to touch the heart of every boy in the Church that each one might have a <span class="emphasis">desire</span> to live worthy to hold the Melchizedek Priesthood and serve a mission. You young men must live worthy to become elders so you can carry the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people as the Lord has commanded us to do. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.28" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 15:28</a>.)</p>

You young men who are here tonight need to prepare now for your future service. I would ask, which one of you knows what the Lord has in mind for you to do in the future? May I ask also, which of you may someday sit here in the Tabernacle in these red chairs on the rostrum? As unlikely as it may seem to you young men tonight, all of the General Authorities were boys once, much like you. Even I was your age once. No young man should aspire to a calling, but as surely as you are sitting in this priesthood meeting tonight, many of you will preside over wards, stakes, missions, quorums, and, of course, your own families. Priesthood training, my brethren, starts when a young man is ordained a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood. You Aaronic Priesthood bearers need to understand that you are in training.</p>

I recommend it to all of the boys here tonight: “And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young [he was in his teens], nevertheless being large in stature, <span class="emphasis">and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of God,</span> wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.16" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 2:16</a>; italics added.) The key, my brethren, was Nephi’s <span class="emphasis">desire</span> to “know of the mysteries of God.” You young men, fill your hearts with this <span class="emphasis">desire.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/prepare-to-serve.p7" pid="Qxg1Wk6G7kKvAp0vhxqUzA" hash="aGZwtA">Of all the training I have received in my Church assignments, none has been more important to me than the training I received as a nineteen-year-old elder serving a full-time mission in the British Isles. As I look back now, I can see that no training in my life was more important for what I am now doing in the Church than the training I received as a full-time missionary.</p>

When you are serving your mission, he will send you on errands to act in his name. He will give you experience with the power of the Holy Ghost. He will authorize you to teach, to convert, and then to perform the sacred ordinances of salvation in his name. He will come to know you. He will come to know that he can trust you and can rely on you. He will help you learn the lessons that will qualify you for the great work that you must perform as you do your part in carrying the message of the Restoration to everyone in the world.</p>

We knew what to do. We knew what to say. We knew where to go. In many ways, boys, I relived some of my missionary experiences of thirty-four years ago. For example, we needed a permit from the government to travel to Makale to visit the food stations and the distribution centers where tens of thousands of homeless refugees were gathered. When the permit was delayed, desiring to fill our mission, we knelt in prayer and asked the Lord for help. The next morning the permits were issued. Then we needed to get from Addis Ababa to Makale. We again prayed for help and then found passage with a British Royal Air Force mercy flight in a C-130 Hercules transport plane. From Makale, we had no way to travel to Asmara. The Lord knew of our need. Late in the afternoon we hitched a ride with a Swedish Air Force mercy flight. Hitchhiking is not a good idea, and especially not by air, but being on the Lord’s errand, it was all right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/prepare-to-serve.p10" pid="wc_qNHRIo0OFR67IgIs3Ug" hash="Vd7wTQ">I have deep affection for the goodness of people, many of whom I met in far-off Ethiopia, who are not members of the Church but who are giving unselfish Christian service. Brethren, I was so grateful that the Church made a significant contribution to help meet a desperate need. I believe if we had more missionaries in the world, rendering meaningful Christian service and helping people come to the knowledge of the glorious message of the Restoration, we would find favor with the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/prepare-to-serve.p11" pid="j4uCNaFj50OiKjkvnS7heQ" hash="aUSC0Q">I say to you young men tonight, get ready; every one of you, get ready. This world needs your service. Repent if you need to. Study from the standard works every day. Say your prayers morning and night. Develop in your heart a <span class="emphasis">desire</span> to know the mysteries of God. To lead the Church tomorrow, you must prepare today. Train hard, boys, and I promise you that you will live to be grateful that you made the effort to prepare.</p>

You can listen if you’d like to. The past four days we have enjoyed historic meetings with the mission presidents and their wives from every mission in the Church, along with all of the Regional Representatives, and the stake presidents. We have received instruction from the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and others. We were instructed to <span class="emphasis">call </span>every worthy boy to serve a mission. I encourage each of you bishops in the Church to review carefully the roster of boys who are old enough to serve missions so you can extend a call to every one. Don’t miss one!</p>

When I served as bishop many years ago, a fine young man in our ward had fallen in love before being called to serve his mission. He made it known that he was going to get married and would not be available for missionary service. I worried how I was going to approach this young man because I felt an urgency as his bishop to see that he served our Father in Heaven as a missionary. When I invited Doug into my office, I approached him in a different way than I had ever approached a prospective missionary. I was prompted to say, “Doug, the Lord wants you to serve a mission.” Doug said he was not going to serve a mission because he was going to be married. I asked him to get together with his sweetheart and his parents and to fast and to pray. I asked him to come back within a week and tell me what he was going to do about the fact that he had been called to serve the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/prepare-to-serve.p14" pid="VA7Zvx3DpkSSg4h5hV_xsQ" hash="Swi9qg">One week later, with a great deal of emotion, Doug said to me, “Bishop, we did what you asked us to do. I cannot ignore a call from the Lord. I <span class="emphasis">desire</span> to serve. How do I proceed?” Doug served his mission. In fact, he served as a counselor to his mission president. Upon returning, he married his sweetheart. She waited for him—that is not always the case, and it may not always be best that they do—but in Doug’s case it worked out. He has since served as a bishop and presently serves as the first counselor in his stake presidency. His mission was one of the most important training periods of his life.</p>

For many years, I have given blessings to others. I have fasted and prayed for their well-being and have exercised my faith for their recovery. Recently, during a serious illness, I was the recipient of such faith, prayers, and blessings. I thank you, brothers and sisters, for the prayers that you have offered in my behalf.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p2" pid="JxdL8c4L30W9GMQPPsg9Og" hash="EH3GPw">One of my colleagues said to me that some good would come from this illness. He suggested that it is good, on occasion, for everyone to face adversity, especially if it causes introspection that enables us to openly and honestly assess our lives. That is what I did.</p>

When I was left alone, my mind filled with thoughts of my family and of my ministry. I found comfort in the ordinances of the gospel that bind me to my family if we are faithful. I realized that I needed to rearrange some of my priorities to accomplish the things that matter most to me.</p>

The scriptures are filled with examples of people facing crises before learning how to better serve God and others. Perhaps if you, too, search your hearts and courageously assess the priorities in your life, you may discover, as I did, that you need a better balance among your priorities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p5" pid="uy2KUBFC6UanNWiwkP7ndQ" hash="Qu-cIw">All of us must come to an honest, open self-examination, an awareness within as to who and what we want to be.</p>

Many good people who care a great deal are trying very hard to maintain balance, but they sometimes feel overwhelmed and defeated.</p>

They are common human experiences. Many people have heavy demands upon them stemming from parental, family, employment, church, and civic responsibilities. Keeping everything in balance can be a real problem.</p>

This review will help us see where we need to repent and change our lives to ensure that we are worthy of the promises that accompany our covenants and sacred ordinances. Working out our own salvation requires good planning and a deliberate, valiant effort.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p15" pid="sxndmf3JfEKaqNGW7fRUDA" hash="wWDCog">I have a few suggestions that I hope will be valuable to those of you concerned with balancing life’s demands. These suggestions are very basic; their concepts can easily be overlooked if you are not careful. You will need a strong commitment and personal discipline to incorporate them into your life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p16" pid="o5NEVA-BEUSZ0124CpX0aA" hash="UNQDcQ">First, think about your life and set your priorities. Find some quiet time regularly to think deeply about where you are going and what you will need to do to get there. Jesus, our exemplar, often “withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/5.16" class="scriptureRef">Luke 5:16</a>). We need to do the same thing occasionally to rejuvenate ourselves spiritually as the Savior did. Write down the tasks you would like to accomplish each day. Keep foremost in mind the sacred covenants you have made with the Lord as you write down your daily schedules.</p>

Set goals that are well balanced—not too many nor too few, and not too high nor too low. Write down your attainable goals and work on them according to their importance. Pray for divine guidance in your goal setting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p18" pid="KC6EweJJ3kW9717p_uEKww" hash="vxiCsw">You recall that Alma said he would like to be an angel so he could “speak with the trump of God, … to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.1" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:1</a>). He then said, “But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me. …</p>

Through wise budgeting, control your real needs and measure them carefully against your many wants in life. Far too many individuals and families have incurred too much debt. Be careful of the many attractive offers to borrow money. It is much easier to borrow money than it is to pay it back. There are no shortcuts to financial security. There are no get-rich-quick schemes that work. Perhaps none need the principle of balance in their lives more than those who are driven toward accumulating “things” in this world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p21" pid="uR_D-ZD-N0-NQKZaILvQJg" hash="TlP0Pg">Do not trust your money to others without a thorough evaluation of any proposed investment. Our people have lost far too much money by trusting their assets to others. In my judgment, we never will have balance in our lives unless our finances are securely under control.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p22" pid="7126HU5MMUSGH6B96kY49Q" hash="oMsX5A">The prophet Jacob said to his people: “Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.51" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:51</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p24" pid="Fa0ya_uUdEWirsQVTFXTMQ" hash="LLnt0g">Fourth, stay close to your spouse, children, relatives, and friends. They will help you keep a balance in your life. In a recent study by the Church, adults in the United States were asked to identify a time when they were very happy and to describe the experience. They were also asked to describe a time when they were very unhappy. For most people, one thing that had made them the most happy or the most sad was their personal relationships with others. Much less important were their personal health, employment, money, and other material things. Build relationships with your family and friends through open and honest communication.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p25" pid="A0Lf8xYxjUqVTjfdlrjrJw" hash="S27lKg">A good marriage and good family relationships can be maintained through gentle, loving, thoughtful communication. Remember that often a glance, a wink, a nod, or a touch will say more than words. A sense of humor and good listening are also vital parts of good communication.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p26" pid="8DHR0VSSaEKZ3v90ObfScg" hash="yFTNyA">Fifth, study the scriptures. They offer one of the best sources we have to keep in touch with the Spirit of the Lord. One of the ways I have gained my sure knowledge that Jesus is the Christ is through my study of the scriptures. President Ezra Taft Benson has called upon members of the Church to make the study of the Book of Mormon a daily habit and a lifetime pursuit. The Apostle Paul’s advice to Timothy is good counsel for each of us. He wrote: “From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p27" pid="ttfLROjK-0yCmv-asg9fnQ" hash="wWou4Q">“All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.15-16" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 3:15–16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p28" pid="LwxuQnBe9ESIpMydohPpiQ" hash="7dO9iQ">Sixth, many people, including me, have difficulty finding the time for sufficient rest, exercise, and relaxation. We must schedule time on our daily calendars for these activities if we are to enjoy a healthy and balanced life. Good physical appearance enhances our dignity and self-respect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p29" pid="omge58l1Z0-z6YrWBxkeDg" hash="1_uGSQ">Seventh, the prophets have taught repeatedly that families should teach one another the gospel, preferably in a weekly family home evening. This family practice, if we are not very careful, can slowly drift away from us. We must not lose this special opportunity to “teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:77</a>), which will lead families to eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p30" pid="0xWz0auqf0ijduKGzXxRKA" hash="x40anQ">Satan is always working to destroy our testimonies, but he will not have the power to tempt or disturb us beyond our strength to resist when we are studying the gospel and living its commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p31" pid="HvxMEBWJxEOBWjzcmiT6-Q" hash="pGS7rw">My last suggestion is to pray often as individuals and as families. Parents need to exercise the discipline required to lead out and motivate children to join together for regular family prayers. Our youth can know the right decisions to make each day through constant, sincere prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p32" pid="ksQhIbEJ4kCp6hqmGpfz6w" hash="-4TPKg">The prophet Alma summarized the importance of prayer in these words: “But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 13:28</a>). When I am in tune spiritually, I find that I can balance everything in my life much more easily.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p33" pid="kHcJsqAW0Umr6KLl9K8qJA" hash="7gkN0g">I realize, brothers and sisters, that other suggestions could be added to these. However, I believe that when we focus on a few basic objectives, we are more likely to be able to manage the many demands that life makes on us. Remember, too much of anything in life can throw us off-balance. At the same time, too little of the important things can do the same thing. King Benjamin counseled “that all these things are done in wisdom and order” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.27" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:27</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p34" pid="TiXP9MnmNEqftzp8Kf0_4Q" hash="8dYrug">Often the lack of clear direction and goals can waste away our time and energy and contribute to imbalance in our lives. A life that gets out of balance is much like a car tire that is out of balance. It will make the operation of the car rough and unsafe. Tires in perfect balance can give a smooth and comfortable ride. So it is with life. The ride through mortality can be smoother for us when we strive to stay in balance. Our main goal should be to seek “immortality and eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>). With this as our goal, why not eliminate from our lives the things that clamor for and consume our thoughts, feelings, and energies without contributing to our reaching that goal?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p35" pid="j8fEcaAfR0WzKjLfAWkStg" hash="MCaqwQ">Just a word to Church leaders: Be very careful that what you ask from members will help them attain eternal life. For Church members to be able to balance their lives, Church leaders must be sure they do not require so much from members that they have no time to accomplish their personal and family goals.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/keeping-lifes-demands-in-balance.p36" pid="c7DtVsjycU6WuG6RUzqEbg" hash="jClLzQ">Not long ago, one of my children said, “Dad, sometimes I wonder if I will ever make it.” The answer I gave to her is the same as I would give to you if you have had similar feelings. Just do the very best you can each day. Do the basic things and, before you realize it, your life will be full of spiritual understanding that will confirm to you that your Heavenly Father loves you. When a person knows this, then life will be full of purpose and meaning, making balance easier to maintain.</p>

For example, when the Church leaders in South America turned their attention to decreasing the cost of missionary service, the Lord blessed them with a simple but marvelous idea: the members could provide the noon meal each day for the full-time missionaries. This was a task the Saints in South America could do, and one that would strengthen both the members and missionaries. It proved to be the means for the members in this part of the world to perfect the Saints and to proclaim the gospel—two parts of the mission of the Church.</p>

Attendance at sacrament meetings climbed from eighty to ninety people a week to nearly one hundred fifty now. The number of baptisms has increased from 1 or 2 a month to nearly 12 a month.

These children raised their hands in support of the program, and then went home to tell their parents that they had incurred an obligation to feed the missionaries.

The wise stake president suggested that the bishop invite less-active members of the ward to participate. Much to the surprise of the bishop, many of the less-active members were pleased to have the missionaries come to their homes for a noon meal. In fact, many of these less-active members were anxious to share with the missionaries the stories of their conversions. More often than not, they would get out photographs of the missionaries who baptized them. This simple idea is bringing many unexpected blessings to the Church.</p>

How often, brothers and sisters, we can solve seemingly large problems through relatively simple means!</p>

When it is our turn, two handsome young men dressed in white shirts, wearing ties, their hair cut neatly, come into our home. They are full of the gospel light. They play with the children. They tell us about their wonderful missionary experiences. They are gentlemen, courteous and kind. After about an hour with us, they leave to do the work of the Lord.”</p>

After a few visits, they stopped on the way to her home and bought a bouquet of flowers to give to her as a token of thanks for the lunches. When they gave the flowers to her, the sister looked shocked and then began to cry. The elders thought they had done something wrong and began to apologize. The widow stopped them and said that no one had ever given her flowers during her entire life, not even her husband when he was alive. She beamed with delight during the lunch and then asked the elders to wait one more minute. She presented them with the name and address of one of her best friends and asked them to please teach the friend’s family.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/gods-love-for-his-children.p5" pid="0_YCTKzNmkWQDm6rwPQzig" hash="v6hytg">Each rose is a compact chemical-processing factory. Using sunlight, the green leaves take carbon dioxide from the air and replace it with oxygen, which we breathe. When other chemicals within the plant react with sunlight, it produces starch that becomes food. As you know, this process is called photosynthesis, and without it the earth’s atmosphere would soon be devoid of oxygen, and most living things would disappear from the earth. My friend told me that the chemical energy and the electrical energy our brains were using at that very moment were once sunlight that was absorbed by the chlorophyll in green vegetation we previously had eaten.</p>

My esteem for our little roses took on an element of wonder and reverence. I pondered the power of the creative genius who lovingly provided such marvels for his children. I thought then how important it is for every human soul to see and appreciate the glory and grandeur of God in everything about us. Into my mind came the words and message of a beautiful hymn:</p>

In the Book of Mormon we learn of Korihor, an anti-Christ who was brought to the Prophet Alma. He asked for a sign of God’s existence before he would believe. “But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.44" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:44</a>).

United States Senator Jake Garn wrote of his experience in space: “It is impossible for me to describe the beauty of the earth. It is a breathtaking, awe-inspiring, spiritual experience to view the earth from space while traveling at twenty-five times the speed of sound. I could also look into the blackness of the vacuum of space and see billions of stars and galaxies millions of light-years away. The universe is so vast as to be impossible to comprehend. But I did comprehend the hand of God in all things. I felt his presence throughout my seven days in space. I know that God created this earth and the universe. I know that we are his children wherever we live on the earth, without regard to our nationality or the color of our skin. Most important, I know that God lives and is the Creator of us all” (letter to M. Russell Ballard, 3 March 1988).</p>

A wise father intervened and took his son to a local vendor, where they obtained an instruction manual. After all, who would know more about a complex computer than the person or company that created it? Who would know most about its capacity and potential? Who would better know the safeguards required to avoid damaging or ruining this fine instrument? Soon the boy enjoyed the full potential of his computer by working within the guidelines given in the instruction book provided by its creator.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p2" pid="aEiH0QjoF0erb7WhvKt27w" hash="K7htbw">In the New Testament we read that Peter, the head of the Church after the Savior’s resurrection and ascension, was informed in a vision that the gospel is for all mankind. He said, “Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.34-35" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:34–35</a>.) This same message appears in the Book of Mormon and in the Doctrine and Covenants. Every soul is to have an opportunity to hear and then accept or reject the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p3" pid="vjPqTJg4xUWolbAA0lYklw" hash="1Poefg">In the Church we use the word <span class="emphasis">fellowship</span> to describe our efforts (1) to encourage less-active members to return to full activity and (2) to help new converts make the transition into the Church following baptism. I believe those meanings are valid, but to me the word <span class="emphasis">fellowship</span> has a much broader connotation. I believe we members do not have the option to extend the hand of fellowship only to relatives, close friends, certain Church members, and those selected nonmembers who express an interest in the Church. Limiting or withholding our fellowship seems to me to be contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Savior offered the effects of his atoning sacrifice to all mankind. He said, “Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:10</a>.) Can we justify doing less? Let me give you a few examples that illustrate my message.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p4" pid="_ATkeV035U6VBO_Lw2jWXg" hash="K8wkDg">Near the end of his earthly ministry, the resurrected Jesus instructed his disciples with these words: “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.19-20" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:19–20</a>.) That instruction is in force today and is the mandate for General Authorities, missionaries, and other members of the Church to travel to the four corners of the world teaching the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p5" pid="vRlzX5DbmEumuldMGbUI1g" hash="_BqdAw">Proclaiming the gospel to all mankind is a fundamental part of the mission of the Church. As those of you know who have supported full-time missionaries, the Church devotes very substantial resources, in time and money, to missionary work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p6" pid="zHg3lXahGkK4XejxKrqWFA" hash="LxXgMw">This big world is filled with billions of people. Today more than 35,700 full-time missionaries are combing the earth looking for those of our Father’s children who will listen to the message of the Restoration. These dedicated servants of the Lord are serving in 221 missions and are teaching the gospel in 64 different languages. We expect that approximately 245,000 converts will be baptized during 1988. This number is impressive; however, approximately that same number of people are being born in the world every day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p7" pid="VoSCqAcI5Uy7kOXmg8o8jg" hash="gAMKlQ">In the missionary training centers, we teach the missionaries that they must have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. They are taught that they need to develop genuinely warm, personal, caring relationships with those whom they meet. They must learn to listen with understanding and to show sincere sensitivity to the interests and concerns of those they teach. As missionaries teach the doctrines, they need to find out what their contacts think and feel so they can clarify misunderstandings, ease doubts, resolve concerns, and provide encouragement. The warm, sincere spirit of the missionaries is essential to help nonmembers feel and recognize the Spirit of the Lord, because the Spirit is the power that leads to conversion.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p9" pid="bLofIupENkOIArgt4-NVPg" hash="78G06w">We know from years of experience that the first contacts new converts have with members in wards or branches are critical to the conversion process. Recently, several of the Brethren were discussing how we accept and welcome newcomers. Two of them shared experiences with me.</p>

He said, “I entered there as a stranger and tried every way that I knew to strike up a conversation, or to say hello, or to be kind, or to be greeted, or to be known. Everyone ignored me; nobody would speak to me—no one!</p>

It wasn’t long before I was asked to sit on the stand; they wondered if I wouldn’t like to bear my testimony. After the meeting, many people shook my hand. As I left, I thought, ‘What a tragedy! A gray-haired man who was unknown walks into a meeting. Nobody recognizes him, nobody says hello, nobody is kind. Then, because of his Church position, everybody changes and wants to be friendly.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p13" pid="fAMfpPGJ90OoS3zIcvXBcw" hash="RSj3fQ">The second story involves two sisters who live two thousand miles from each other. Each was taught the missionary discussions by the full-time missionaries. Each felt the confirming witness of the Spirit and was baptized. Both were single adults in their early twenties. One sister attended church meetings, met the bishop, developed friendships with members who invited her into their homes. Ward members made her feel welcome and wanted. She was given a Church calling immediately after her baptism, and she continued to learn and live gospel principles while associating with ward and stake members. She participated continually, serving in various ward, stake, and general Church callings. In time, she married in the temple, and she maintains her standing as a member in full fellowship.</p>

She received no visits by home teachers or visiting teachers and was given no Church calling. For several weeks she attended Sunday ward meetings, but she was mostly ignored. In due course, the missionaries who had taught her left the area, and her interest in the gospel waned without the support of members. She was not “remembered and nourished.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 6:4</a>.) Soon she stopped attending church services, resumed her old friendships and life-style, and married a nonmember. Today she is a fine, productive, contributing citizen in her community and a loving, conscientious wife and mother. But she does not enjoy the rich blessings that come from full fellowship in the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p15" pid="ykY8ppm9q0e9BI1dxWcB1g" hash="a6C-9g">Recently, the <span class="emphasis">Church News</span> featured two older sister missionaries who exemplify the attributes of love and caring for others while serving on their missions in Duchesne, Utah. The stake president credited these sisters with bringing a spirit of warmth and friendship to his stake. In fact, the teaching and fellowshipping efforts of these sisters have helped change the attitude of the whole stake. The work of the Lord is more effectively coming together and influencing everyone, including the less active as well as nonmembers. The stake president said that in small farming communities, the activation of a less-active family has a big effect on others. He expects twelve to fifteen families to become active and go through the temple this year.</p>

Surely, every one of us ought to be alert, looking for ways to be of service to the newcomer. We might ask ourselves how the newcomers in our wards would be treated if we were the only ones they ever met. Every member of the Church should foster the attributes of warmth, sincerity, and love for the newcomers, as the missionaries are taught to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p17" pid="wdGmeCESskujUM6MiI8v2Q" hash="Y6AFBw">Brothers and sisters, we members must help with the conversion process by making our wards and branches friendly places, with no exclusivity, where all people feel welcome and comfortable. You bishops have been given many who can help you foster fellowship. Teach the children, youth, and adults that being warm and friendly are Christlike qualities. In your ward council meetings, consider ways to improve the feeling of fellowship in your ward. Be sure the missionaries introduce you to every investigator before he or she is baptized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p18" pid="Gciecj92mECcLkVZN3jYpw" hash="YG0kcg">Assign someone to greet at the doors, paying special attention to newcomers and guests. On occasion, use priesthood and Relief Society meetings to teach home and visiting teachers how to fellowship all who live within the ward. Take advantage of the flexibility you have in using high priests and stake and full-time missionaries to lead the less active and new converts into full fellowship. In the true spirit of shepherding, bishoprics can help create a friendly atmosphere by mingling with members when they are gathering together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p19" pid="TFAfGF3WB0Olfi2ZbS99aA" hash="0FOUlA">Brothers and sisters, my message is urgent because we need to retain in full fellowship many more of the new converts and return to activity many more of the less active. I urge you to increase the spirit of friendship and pure Christian fellowship in your neighborhoods. A new convert or recently activated member should feel the warmth of being wanted and being welcomed into full fellowship of the Church. Members and leaders of the Church should nurture and love them as Jesus would.</p>

We must not be too selective in identifying those we feel are worthy or appreciative of our attention. The spirit of true Christian fellowship must include everyone. Our understanding of the gospel should help us see clearly that all people are our brothers and sisters, children of our Heavenly Father. Perhaps more of us could emulate this example.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p21" pid="R8rSWC1CvU67Gte_YClsDg" hash="Ieytww">Years ago while walking up Main Street with his father, Elder LeGrand Richards, then the Presiding Bishop of the Church, tipped his hat and greeted everyone. Upon arrival at their destination, President George F. Richards, then the President of the Council of the Twelve, said, “Son, do you know all those people?” Bishop Richards responded, “Yes, Daddy, I know them all—all but their names.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p22" pid="kQBFVzPGUUuV3mSkTA-VUA" hash="0GIdvA">During his earthly ministry, Jesus posed this challenging question: “For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.46" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:46</a>.) This teaching is clear. We should extend our love far beyond family, close friends, and fellow members of the Church. Our hearts should be open to everyone.</p>

For example, the warmth of a radiant smile and friendly greeting can go far in smoothing the way for good neighborly relations. Jesus posed another question: “And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.47" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:47</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p24" pid="9gcnceB_w0uHeh5UibMaGA" hash="Viot2Q">Some years ago, a friend of mine was doing some work one morning on his garage roof. He looked down and saw a load of cement being delivered to his nonmember neighbor. He could see that the neighbor could use some help. My friend came down from his roof and, without being asked, carried his own cement finishing tools across the street and began helping with the job. Having had experience doing cement work, he and his help turned out to be most welcome. Although the neighbor had expressed a dislike for members of the Church, he showed genuine appreciation for this one by the end of the day. This was the beginning of a long and lasting friendship.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p28" pid="Vyznig_iuUuimg5iirQPNw" hash="ZJX_ow">As disciples of Christ, we need to feel genuine charity for one another. As we do, new light will come into our own lives. This charity is essential in missionary work, but we must never allow ourselves to treat our neighbors only as potential converts. We have had the sad experience of seeing members of the Church who attempted to convert their neighbors and friends and, when they did not respond, withdrew their friendship and neighborliness. We must not be so anxious to share the gospel that we become insensitive to the feelings of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p29" pid="zLwY-RXzwUOvbwJ6zDxYWw" hash="ncJojA">I encourage you to build personal, meaningful relationships with your nonmember friends and acquaintances. Interest in the gospel may come later as a natural extension of a good friendship. Invitations to participate in gospel-related activities often will strengthen relationships with acquaintances. If they are not interested in the gospel, we should show unconditional love through acts of service and kindness, and never imply that we see an acquaintance only as a potential convert. Members must understand that when a nonmember declines one invitation to investigate the gospel, he has not necessarily rejected the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-hand-of-fellowship.p30" pid="8FUt31xxg0mfXJYdJDWuNA" hash="__WnLg">Let us adhere to the counsel of the Apostle Paul and be “no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:19</a>.)</p>

This can appear to be clannish. We must not reserve our kindness and affection only for our fellow members. We must be sensitive and not oblivious to the feelings of those whose views may differ from ours. Considering the early history of the Church in these latter days, unkindness or indifference toward others should be abhorrent to members of the Church.</p>

I testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior of all mankind. He loves all men and looks to each one of us to do the same. May we so do I pray humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I am sure we all appreciate the inspired and timely messages we have heard. They have been translated simultaneously into twenty-nine languages, many of which have been broadcast via satellite and television to millions of people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/the-effects-of-television.p2" pid="X5BFEX4zskyIGC6rWSkiaA" hash="lTmgvQ">The wonder of television causes me to believe that Philo T. Farnsworth, back in 1927, must surely have been inspired of the Lord to develop this remarkable medium of communication. As you know, Brother Farnsworth was a member of the Church. Applying his scientific skills, he brought to the world this marvelous invention, which I believe is to be used for the primary purpose of furthering the work of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/the-effects-of-television.p3" pid="oSUa93Cnck63-KCoKr8M3Q" hash="zWu-BA">In the past sixty years, television has become a major industry in the world. It is estimated that more than 750 million television sets are owned by people living in 160 countries. Approximately 2.5 billion people view television broadcasting every day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/the-effects-of-television.p4" pid="4prs6fJcg0SFhdpg__LjTA" hash="mAv25Q">Most of us recognize both the many benefits and the many challenges that come from television in our modern, fast-paced world. Some of the benefits, besides listening to the teaching of the gospel, we can receive by merely touching a button include receiving instant reports of local and world events and updates on weather; watching fantasy; exploring geography; living history; enjoying good theater, dance, and music; and experiencing culture from almost every country in the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/the-effects-of-television.p5" pid="tH2T8-SR20iXWY_BvOtIbw" hash="KzcgpQ">For these kinds of programs we praise the industry. Unfortunately, however, far too much programming is not wholesome and uplifting but is violent, degrading, and destructive to moral values. This kind of television offends the Spirit of the Lord; therefore, I express a word of warning and caution about such programming.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/the-effects-of-television.p6" pid="npLf2T7IaUOA8k_1d-i21Q" hash="gZgjDw">Good families face very significant challenges in controlling the use of television and videotapes in their homes. I agree with Dr. Victor B. Cline when he said, “I am convinced by a vast amount of research that the images, fantasies, and models which we are repeatedly exposed to in advertisements, entertainment, novels, motion pictures, and other works of art can and do … affect the self-image and, later, the behavior of nearly all young people and adults too.” (Address at Tidewater Assembly on Family Life, Norfolk, Virginia.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/the-effects-of-television.p7" pid="YjH0fUVG3EGeXKF5khJzow" hash="nENSnw">On another occasion, Dr. Cline said that the mental diet is as important as the nutritional diet. “The amount of violence a child sees at 7 predicts how violent he will be at 17, 27, and 37. … Children’s minds are like banks—whatever you put in, you get back 10 years later with interest.” He said that violent television teaches children, step-by-step, “how to commit violent acts, and it desensitizes them to the horror of such behavior and to the feelings of victims.” Dr. Cline said that America is suffering from “an explosion of interpersonal violence like we have never seen before. … The violence is because of violence in our entertainment.” (See “Therapist says children who view TV violence tend to become violent,” <span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> 24 Mar. 1989, p. 2B.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/the-effects-of-television.p8" pid="Ioz4VIs2qEGTcKvy1WMx8g" hash="6HiHCg">Some may be surprised to know that in the average American home, the television set is on just under seven hours each day, and more than sixty-six million Americans who are under age nineteen live in these homes. A recent magazine article included this statement: “Once, television’s ‘window on the world’ mirrored solid <span class="emphasis">family ties,</span> heroes drawn in bright primary colors, and a society of permanence and belonging. Now, … it’s clear that our TV shows are showing quite a different picture. In fact, it’s arguable that television is no longer a mere window on our world but the <span class="emphasis">value-setter itself.</span>” (<span class="emphasis">Another View of the Window.</span> Triangle Publications, n.d., p. 3.)</p>

Wright of the Bolivia La Paz Mission, I share this special experience that came to him in a dream: “I saw these two elders dressed in white, standing at the doors of a beautiful building. They were greeting numerous people, who also were dressed in white as they entered the building. It was obvious from their dress that those who entered were Bolivians. I envisioned the temple that will someday be built in Bolivia. Elders Wilson and Ball were ushering those they had prepared to receive the gospel in the spirit world into the temple to witness the vicarious ordinances being performed in their behalf. This dream has been a great comfort to me and has helped me to understand and accept their deaths.”</p>

It was by His voice that we were called to a dispensation of His Gospel in the beginning of the fullness of times. It was by Him we received the Book of Mormon; and it is by Him that we remain unto this day; and by Him we shall remain, if it shall be for our glory; and in His Almighty name we are determined to endure tribulation as good soldiers unto the end.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 139.)</p>

These new members have experienced a mighty change in their hearts and have “humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/duties-rewards-and-risks.p7" pid="mMUWhX8brEm52unsbZk_rw" hash="u2f54g">Our missionaries have not participated in this great work without serious challenges, tribulations, and difficulties. Parents of missionaries have always known the risk of losing a loved one serving in the mission field due to accident or illness. Now, we must add to the risk of missionary service the possibility of acts of terrorism. Terrorism is centuries old but perhaps has never before been so open and blatant nor had such extensive news coverage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/duties-rewards-and-risks.p8" pid="XlPJszoERkmW549xa2q5IQ" hash="BBAoUg">Terrorism has many victims. They include the innocent and law-abiding people residing in a troubled region who are striving to provide for their families and to do what is right. Missionaries live among the peoples of the world; and even with the protection of the members, they also can become innocent victims of acts of violence. We must not judge the people of any nation or region because of the irresponsible, cowardly acts of terrorism perpetrated by a few.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/duties-rewards-and-risks.p9" pid="vE5TWxTHDka8-WtmmPQyKA" hash="8FJs-w">Sometimes terrorists attack Church members or Church property because they believe, mistakenly, that the Church represents the interests of a country. Contrary to such misguided beliefs, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has no past or present affiliation with any government agency of any country, including the United States of America. In genuine Christian kindness and loving concern, missionaries and other Church members offer to all sincere and law-abiding peoples nothing more or less than the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Sad experience has taught us that not all people accept these assurances of fact. Therefore, leaders and members must be prepared for any event that may occur in the future.</p>

However, you parents and prospective missionaries have <span class="emphasis">no</span> reason to be fearful and to feel that serving a mission is unusually dangerous or risky. Our records since 1981 reveal that the total number of missionaries who have lost their lives through accident, illness, or other causes is very small. The life-style of Latter-day Saint missionaries before and during their missions contributes to their health and safety. For example, the death rate of young male missionaries from the United States serving worldwide is one-fifth the rate of young males of comparable age living in Utah. It is one-seventh the rate of young males of comparable age in the general population of the United States. I do not imply that missionary service is a guarantee of increased longevity, but missionaries obviously have a much lower risk of death than others of comparable age.</p>

In the past year, a highly qualified team of LDS doctors visited many of the missions in developing nations and made important recommendations that have been adopted to improve missionary health. We are doing and will continue to do all within our power to reduce any risks that could harm the missionaries. However, in a world of free agency, the Church cannot eliminate all risk nor guarantee absolutely that a missionary never will be ill, injured, or harmed.</p>

At the same time, however, the Church cannot retreat from areas of the world that are in turmoil unless absolutely necessary. Brothers and sisters, the charge from the Lord to “go ye therefore, and teach all nations” is a difficult one to fulfill.

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/12.7" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 12:7</a>.) That same battle continues today in the conflict between right and wrong and between the gospel and false principles. The members of the Church hold a frontline position in the contest for the souls of men. The missionaries are on the battlefield fighting with the sword of truth to carry the glorious message of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the peoples of the earth. No war has ever been free of risk. The prophecies of the last days lead me to believe that the intensity of the battle for the souls of men will increase and the risks will become greater as we draw closer to the second coming of the Lord.</p>

We must be able to overcome the fear of enemies who oppose and threaten us. The Lord has said, “Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:34</a>.)</p>

Their intense desire to continue serving the precious people of their mission is beyond description. Sometimes parents and family members understandably voice worry, anxiety, or even feel alarm about the safety of their missionary sons or daughters, but rarely, if ever, do we hear the missionaries express such concerns. They love and care deeply about the people they are serving, and generally they want to continue in the service of the Lord. These dedicated missionaries illustrate so powerfully for the rest of us that “there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.18" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 4:18</a>.)</p>

Persecutions and tribulations have been minimal. Perhaps some of these recent events are a toughening process to help us learn how to shoulder and not shrink from our responsibilities to preach the gospel to all the peoples of the earth.</p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith put it this way: “When a man has offered in sacrifice all that he has for the truth’s sake, not even withholding his life, and believing before God that he has been called to make this sacrifice because he seeks to do his will, … he can obtain the faith necessary for him to lay hold on eternal life.” (<span class="emphasis">Lectures on Faith,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1985, p. 69.)</p>

In recent years the Lord’s servants have unlocked the door and opened the work in the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. They have opened many nations of Africa, including Nigeria, Ghana, Zaire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Ivory Coast, and Namibia; and Papua New Guinea. Thirteen nations and territories have been opened for missionary work in just the past four years. Many others will be opened to the preaching of the gospel. Truly, no unhallowed hand can stop the sacred work of proclaiming life and salvation to all nations and peoples, but this work will not continue without challenges and risks.</p>

Courage, … and on, on to the victory!” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 128:22</a>.)

Pray fervently every day for their safety and protection, for this is one very important way we all can support them in accomplishing their essential assignment of proclaiming the gospel to all the world. I bear testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. We are engaged in his work. I testify that through the faith and prayers of all members of the Church, we will continue moving this great work forward to the final victory. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

You are never sure exactly how much they understand. They will live and die in this small town. They are so poor and so simple and so childlike. They may never see a General Authority, never attend general conference, never go to BYU. They’ll never be Boy Scouts, never play basketball in a huge Church gym, never drive a car to stake conference, regional basketball finals, or anywhere. Many of the things we think about when we think of the Church—and take for granted—they may never see. [Now, the point.] But they have faith, they repent, they are baptized, they receive the Holy Ghost, and they renew their baptismal covenants each week when they partake of the sacrament. They pray and read the scriptures daily. They know God lives and that Christ is our Savior. And, I believe, they are going to the celestial kingdom. I do all the things they never will, but I’m not so sure about my own salvation.</p>

I have to keep reminding myself it is the same church and we all follow the same prophet. We have a sacrament meeting in the country each week because the members there really can’t afford to come into town. And as I sit there outside on a wooden chair on the plain ground, with the sun setting and the six people in attendance, as we sing hymns, pray, and partake of the sacrament, I wonder if that isn’t closer to Christ’s church than at home. But I guess it is really the same. The things that matter, the true elements of the gospel as Christ taught in 3 Nephi 11, are the same here as they are in Orem, Utah.” [<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.title" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11</a>]</p>

Unfortunately, some of us look beyond the mark and depend too much on buildings, budgets, programs, and activities for conversion rather than on the small and simple things that are central to the gospel. We need not look beyond our own hearts to experience the sweet spiritual feelings promised to those who obey God. That is why a new member in the most humble conditions can experience the gospel as deeply as a lifetime member who was raised in the shadow of Church headquarters.</p>

The gospel is taught from the scriptures and from the <span class="emphasis">Gospel Principles</span> manual. The people feel the Spirit and bear testimonies as they come unto Christ and are baptized in his name. Their love for the Lord radiates from their faces. They know that faith, repentance, baptism, the Holy Ghost, service to others, and keeping the commandments are the essentials for exaltation in the celestial kingdom.</p>

They had no momentous or spectacular events or activities, only daily spiritual experiences resulting from their sensitive response to the promptings of the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/small-and-simple-things.p14" pid="egfhDnPnz0Glbv0a7KpT1g" hash="o4ZQeg">A new missionary couple, Brother and Sister Don Rapier, arrived in Suriname one day ahead of Elder Didier and me, so they met the Saints for the first time along with us. We held four sacrament meetings in homes of the Saints on the Sunday we were there. Elder Rapier shared his feelings about blessing the sacrament in the humble home of one of our new converts. He said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/small-and-simple-things.p15" pid="JbV7FHAJY0KxZSOTFk4EUQ" hash="O5HsEQ">“This was the most humble circumstance that I had ever been in in my life. The house was made of mostly short pieces of lumber. No electricity, no running water. The roof was corrugated sheets. The house and the yard were clean. The place where we held our sacrament meeting was under the overhang in front of the house. The members and the Brethren sat on wooden boards that were laid on bricks. The sacrament table was a small wooden stand that was set on top of a piece of linoleum covering the dirt floor. The sacrament cloths were very simple and very clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/small-and-simple-things.p16" pid="TpObXSuybU6hKOVoCw7Mqw" hash="pp8-JA">“As I knelt down to bless the sacrament, I was overwhelmed with the spirit of love that I had quickly developed for this people. I thought surely our Savior was pleased that He was being remembered in such humble circumstances. I thought of our chapels at home. I could never have appreciated the sacrament there like I can now after this special experience. I also observed that it might take several years before these sweet, humble members would fully realize the significance of having two General Authorities, one an Apostle, in their home, blessing them and their family.”</p>

After the fourth sacrament meeting, my mind reflected upon the words of the Lord: “Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:33</a>).</p>

We took the newspaper clipping, a Book of Mormon, and a box of macaroni and knocked on his door. We have taught and baptized seven of the family since our first visit.” This small thing resulted in a great benefit in establishing the Church in Guyana.</p>

A series of seemingly small but incorrect choices can become those little soul-destroying termites that eat away at the foundations of our testimony until, before we are aware, we may be brought near to spiritual and moral destruction.</p>

Over the next few years we had three children, and during this time I remained active in the Church. The demands of my business became much greater, and I became more determined to do whatever it would take to succeed financially. The effects of this were felt immediately at home; but with the support of an understanding wife, we felt we could endure until things ‘picked up.’”</p>

The love and tenderness we once knew as husband and wife had diminished to only memories. We found character flaws in each other and began to focus on them, wounding each other over the smallest incident. I began to blame everyone but myself, taking no responsibility for failures. A great feeling of hopelessness began to fill my heart, and I felt a cloud of darkness envelop me in my desperation.</p>

I decided to get some financial counseling; and after reviewing my finances, it became the joke that I was worth more dead than alive, which seemed funny and rather innocent at the time. After continuing for a few more weeks, the threat of divorce as well as the very real threat of complete financial collapse seemed only a matter of time. The innocent joke of being worth more dead than alive developed into the appearance of a very real solution. I found myself alone at home, facing the crossroads of my decision. The thought came to me to reach out to the Lord one last time. Kneeling, I wept uncontrollably as I cried to the Lord for his mercy and help in my desperate hour.</p>

Like weak fibers that form a yarn, then a strand, and finally a rope, these small things combined together can become too strong to be broken. We must ever be aware of the power that the small and simple things can have in building spirituality. At the same time, we must be aware that Satan will use small and simple things to lead us into despair and misery.</p>

We must never ignore or pass by the prompting of the Spirit to render service to one another.</p>

Noting that the Liahona worked by faith, Alma stated, “Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small means … [the people of Lehi] were slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those marvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.41" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:41</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.46" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:46</a>.)

The subject is the moral cleanliness of our youth. The leaders of the Church care so deeply about every one of you that I feel an urgent need to warn you once again of the consequences of moral misconduct. At the same time, I want to impress upon you the great promises extended to those who remain morally clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p2" pid="lScD4dHpakOBFxDZSvJ-zw" hash="6_SFEw">We are aware that the youth of the Church are growing up in a world that is plagued with teenage moral misconduct. We also know that sexual sin has increased tremendously during the past twenty years. Far too many of the youth, particularly American youth, have violated the law of chastity before they reach the age of nineteen. Unfortunately, the youth of the Church are not immune. For this reason, I want to assure you young men that your leaders know of the challenges you face in today’s society. However, we have confidence that you can develop the strength and integrity to surmount these challenges and live for the blessings that are promised to those who remain morally clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p3" pid="9pG13Dnti0Og3ZrSa4VVMA" hash="ePN4Og">I emphasize that you do <span class="emphasis">not</span> need to be caught in the trap of being immoral—not one of you, ever. Each one of you must look into the future to understand the consequences of your actions, both good and bad. The cartoon character Ziggy said it this way: “Our future is shaped by our past, … so be very careful what you do in your past!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p4" pid="V9RVJZwcpE-XXBMkii0Miw" hash="cdsgiQ">Let me relate a personal experience to show the importance of keeping your future continually in mind. When I was in the Aaronic Priesthood, I and one of my friends attended general priesthood meeting in this tabernacle and found ourselves over here by the stairs where we didn’t belong. President George Albert Smith, in his kindly way, saw our plight and invited us to sit on the stairs. As we sat there and watched the proceedings of the meeting, I did not believe that I ever again would get that close to this pulpit. I remember saying to my friend as we left the Tabernacle, “It would sure be nice to be a General Authority; then you would have one of those seats on the stand to sit in.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p5" pid="o4xY12mNrU-2dValK0f8tw" hash="0qhOWg">I know now by personal experience that, in some ways, brethren, the benches you are sitting on are much more comfortable than these on the stand. Now the point: As an Aaronic Priesthood holder, I had no idea that the time would come in my life when I would serve as a bishop, a mission president, a Seventy, and now as an Apostle. We cannot foresee what the Lord has in mind for us. Our only course of action is to be prepared and worthy for whatever he requires. We must govern our actions every day with our future in mind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p6" pid="qVZOv8KvLUCcTVBHy0Io0g" hash="d6CbFA">One of Satan’s clever tactics is to tempt us to concentrate on the present and ignore the future. The Lord warned Joseph Smith that “Satan seeketh to turn their hearts away from the truth, that they become blinded and understand not the things which are prepared for them.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:10</a>.) The “things which are prepared for them” are the promised rewards of eternal life, which come as a result of obedience. The devil attempts to blind us to these rewards. President Heber J. Grant said that “if we are faithful in keeping the commandments of God His promises will be fulfilled to the very letter. … The trouble is, the adversary of men’s souls blinds their minds. He throws dust, so to speak, in their eyes, and they are blinded with the things of this world.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Standards,</span> Salt Lake City: Improvement Era, 1942, pp. 44–45.) He tempts us with the transitory pleasures of the world so that we will not focus our minds and efforts on the things that bring eternal joy. The devil is a dirty fighter, and we must be aware of his tactics.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p7" pid="H40VJHAmtkGAnGdlAfObEw" hash="TWY6SA">Recently I talked with several groups of young men and women in Utah and Idaho. They told me that some of our youth feel that they can be immoral during their teen years and then repent when they decide to go on a mission or be married in the temple. Some young men talk about a mission as a time when they will be forgiven from their past sins. They have the notion that a few transgressions now are no big deal because they can repent quickly, go on a mission, and then live happily ever after.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p8" pid="4kpa2OZI40-JJTfnSB_ERA" hash="28ti4Q">Young men, please believe me when I tell you that this scenario is a gross deception by Satan; it is a fairy tale. Sin will always, <span class="emphasis">always,</span> result in suffering. It may come sooner, or it may come later, but it will come. The scriptures state that you will “stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 6:9</a>) and that you will experience “a lively sense of … guilt, and pain, and anguish.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.38" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:38</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p9" pid="-N2-r5wk50uxw9yg1bubug" hash="2XzJKA">A related misconception is that repentance is easy. President Kimball said that “one has not begun to repent until he has suffered intensely for his sins. … If a person hasn’t suffered, he hasn’t repented.” (<span class="emphasis">The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982, pp. 88, 99.) You need only talk to a person who has truly repented of serious sin to understand that the momentary pleasure of an immoral act is simply not worth the pain that always follows.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p10" pid="gjncJpclukevJr_BMxwj4g" hash="KJfP1A">The youth told me that some are tempted to be immoral because they want to be accepted by their peers. For the young men, it may mean acceptance based on some sort of macho image. For the young women, it may be the need to feel they are accepted by having a boyfriend. Acceptance by your peers must not come at the expense of your virtue and self-esteem. King Benjamin indicates that those guilty of sin will “shrink from the presence of the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.38" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:38</a>.) In a very real way, those who have been immoral shrink from the presence of others: their friends, their parents, other members of their family, and Church leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p11" pid="7gzxTq-f-UiGNLu3ovhg4w" hash="G7ZK_g">Now, let us consider the grand blessings the Lord has promised those who are obedient to the commandment to be morally clean. You never need to repent of a sin you have not committed. That seems obvious, but I want to emphasize it. Repentance is a great blessing, but you should never make yourself sick just so you can try out the remedy. You are infinitely better to maintain your spiritual health by staying morally clean. If you feel confident in the presence of your parents, peers, and priesthood leaders, you can sense how you will feel when you have the confidence and acceptance of the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p12" pid="RCchimn3HEGHmLJ4YjBWLw" hash="GShk3Q">Can you think of any better promise for the future than spoken by King Benjamin: “I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:41</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p13" pid="mfQzIMFPU0mW21awa1v11w" hash="6F6m4g">The youth told me that a clean conscience improves their self-esteem. Their relationships with others are better, and they enjoy a very positive acceptance. In fact, some of them said they have lots more fun because of their high standards. They never have to worry about the dreaded diseases that often follow those who transgress the law of chastity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p14" pid="TypGUaOkkUOIfelRvtqO2g" hash="qG0FAQ">Here are some suggestions that will help you stay morally clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p15" pid="8Pd3hnvWzkW8-cBxfa15MQ" hash="OCdrBA">First, understand the standards of moral cleanliness. The Lord said concerning his commandments, “I give unto you directions how you may act before me, that it may turn to you for your salvation.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:9</a>.) In other words, commandments are guidance for happy living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p16" pid="CDHT--DVdE-one-an5_Duw" hash="2cXb-Q">Our youth seem confused about the definition of moral cleanliness. Some young men and women take a certain definition and then push it to its limits to see how far they can go without being immoral by that definition. I suggest an opposite approach.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p17" pid="5t7ODHjZJUy6NYeM8mbXyg" hash="hlnigg">Several years ago, Elder Hartman Rector, who spent twenty-six years as a navy pilot, gave an interesting analogy. The navy had a rule that said, in effect, “Thou shalt not fly thy airplane in the trees.” That makes sense. But to ensure that he obeyed this rule, he set his own standard: “Thou shalt not fly thy airplane closer than 5,000 feet to the trees.” He said, “When you do this you make the navy’s commandment of not flying in the trees easy to live.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Jan. 1973, p. 131.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p18" pid="fTRVQwmA2UCISPzUSuiqnQ" hash="X4R-wQ">Some standards must not be compromised. If you are not sure about the Church’s standard of morality, talk to your parents or to your priesthood leaders. Also, you can know the correct standards of moral conduct by following the promptings of the Spirit. These promptings never will lead you to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, unclean, or ashamed. You must be sensitive to these promptings because your physical passions can obscure them if you are not careful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p19" pid="8oRFcbL_pE6HbW0GmcdObA" hash="6ZV-6A">Second, once you understand the standards, you must determine that you will live by them. This kind of commitment is a fundamental gospel principle. The scriptures teach that “there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but what he will do it.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:17</a>.) You must be the same way. You must be as Joseph who fled from the presence of Potiphar’s wife rather than sin against God. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/39.7-12" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 39:7–12</a>.) You must avoid moral misconduct by making a firm decision to avoid compromising situations and to stand firm for what is right. You must have self-control and high goals. I urge every one of you tonight to set a goal to be morally clean, if you have not already done so.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p20" pid="ce8XC6HxCU-PlVEsTUHKyA" hash="FRhzLQ">Third, while you must exercise your agency and bear the responsibility for your decisions, you need not face temptation alone. Just two weeks ago at a stake conference, Elder Charles “Tiny” Grant, one of our fine regional representatives, shared an experience with us. He said that some years ago while he was the football coach at Ricks College, he met a man named Hal Barton, who was famous for his love of fishing. He was warned, however, that “although Hal knows where to find the big fish, he often goes into strong waters to find them.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p21" pid="qWuyEpfkpUaAlmnVqLNR5A" hash="aqSeBg">Their first opportunity to go fishing together was in February as the ice was breaking up. As they walked together up the river, Hal pointed to an island about fifty yards away and said, “Coach, that is where we will find the big ones.” The day was cold, and now they had to cross a dangerous part of the river. The coach soon discovered that the rocks were round and slick, and the water was only inches from the top of his waders. Since he is six feet five inches tall, that meant it was deep. He was about to tell Hal that he was afraid he couldn’t cross the water, but realized that the football coach could not admit that he was afraid.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p22" pid="BhQtCwlhIUeGBZ8-93xDDg" hash="2hVTmA">Just then Hal said, “Coach, this is how we are going to cross the water. You take a step and get a firm footing while I hold your hand and arm steady. Then I will take a step while you stand firmly and furnish the support. We will work our way through this roiling, swift water over these slippery rocks.” With this mutual support, they crossed the river safely and caught the big ones.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p23" pid="WXr2Bca6nkWO0RUgbidEyg" hash="QmmZDQ">This is an excellent analogy for the way you can live the Lord’s standard of morality. Some who have gone before you have a firm footing, having lived the moral standard and experienced the blessings of doing so. As you take steps into the deep water of life, they will support you. Then, as you gain a firm footing in righteousness, you can help others who come after you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p24" pid="JcbtV82oOEC4wS48mip0bw" hash="YLtJGg">Generally, your most important source of support is your parents. Their teachings should be a powerful influence in your decision to be clean. I realize, however, that morality can be a sensitive subject. I urge you young men to initiate conversations with your parents about their moral values. Ask them to help you define the standards that will keep you morally clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p25" pid="U6J4BzPT70S-yYkkz6fHUw" hash="jbDvyA">Also seek counsel from your priesthood leaders, especially your bishop. He knows the standards, and he knows what to teach you. Seek opportunities to be with him. You can expect him to ask pointed, searching questions. Trust him. Confide in him. Ask him to help you understand what the Lord expects from you. Make a commitment to live according to the Church’s standards of morality. A meaningful relationship with an adult leader is vital to help you keep morally clean and worthy. Your Aaronic Priesthood advisers will teach you and give you the support and direction you may need. Ask them for guidance. They will know how to help you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p26" pid="uc0Hn-Q0UEGA11oxTjS43w" hash="QjxzUg">Fourth, choose friends who share your standards, both members and nonmembers. Such friends will make peer pressure uplifting and positive. The young men and women I talked to said that acceptance of the peer group is a powerful influence either for good or bad. When your friends observe high moral standards, you are more likely to do the same. When you have established a strong bond with such friends, you can reach out to those who have not made firm decisions about morality. Help them to know that immorality is not “cool.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p27" pid="hijCY-iYo0eWtsJVXt5v5g" hash="_EZdaA">Fifth, you young men must cultivate a considerate attitude toward women of all ages. The young women asked me to tell you that they want you to respect them and show them common, sincere courtesy. Do not hesitate to show your good manners by opening a door for them, taking the initiative in inviting them on a date, and standing as they enter a room. Believe it or not, in this age of equal rights, the young women want you to extend these simple courtesies.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p28" pid="uayO8av37ESabE7mAK8i5Q" hash="VZzg-g">Finally, seek help from the Lord, the source of spiritual power. If you “call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually,” you will “not be tempted above that which ye can bear.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 13:28</a>.) Your daily prayers must include a heartfelt request for help in keeping your commitment to remain morally clean. When you do this, the Lord will bless you with the strength to remain morally clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p29" pid="kOIuwjIBR0C0kwNSc-9Rzw" hash="ZtzqYg">Remember, young men, that purity precedes power. The Lord said, “But purify your hearts before me; and then go ye into all the world, and preach my gospel unto every creature who has not received it.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 112:28</a>.) Missionaries discover this very early in their missions and make every effort to be worthy so they can serve with power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p30" pid="eStxyxsIn0O94UahPRYaSg" hash="SrttaA">Now, just a word to those of you who have violated the moral law. I hold out the hope of repentance to you. The Savior’s atonement provides forgiveness when you have repented completely. You will necessarily suffer because of sin, but you can know the joy of being forgiven completely. Your bishop can guide you through the process of repentance, so talk to him as soon as possible. You must also seek divine forgiveness through your personal prayers. Alma said, “Never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins. But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.8" class="scriptureRef">Alma 38:8</a>.) Once you have forsaken your sins, never return to them, because “unto that soul who sinneth shall the former sins return.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p31" pid="IquTmBYBZ0qexWZ3kccMSA" hash="SdGsuw">Tonight, I echo the prayer offered by President Hugh B. Brown in a setting such as this more than twenty years ago, when the moral misconduct of youth was not as commonplace as it is today. He prayed, “O Father, help these young men who are listening tonight, when they go home to get on their knees and commit themselves to thee; and then they may know, and I promise them in thy name that they will know, that with thy help they need not fear the future.” (<span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> Dec. 1967, p. 94.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/purity-precedes-power.p32" pid="XaIAIZOZBkOBwVW8tl26QA" hash="90oOvQ">Brethren, we need not fear the future if we will keep the Lord’s commandments and live to be his worthy servants. You can stay morally clean and prepare now for a happy future. May the Lord bless every one of you to so live I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

When I turned on the 200,000 lights, they seemed to dance and sparkle in the trees, with the majestic temple glowing in the background. That night, outside of their Soviet community for the first time, thirty-five children from the Soviet Embassy School performed. They presented the dances and songs of their homeland beautifully. Following their program, boys and girls who were members of the Church performed for an appreciative audience that included embassy officials from twenty-two nations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p2" pid="bNCErtH4706VuU1p72x3yg" hash="IQrfwg">The children who were members of the Church were sitting on risers that had been placed directly in front of the eight-foot Christus statue that stands as the focal point of the visitors’ center lobby. The Soviet children were sitting with their teachers and parents apart from our youngsters. When I stood to speak, these beautiful young people with their vibrant countenances captured my attention. I asked the Soviet boys and girls to come and sit with our youth. As they did, it was a beautiful sight and an appropriate way to begin the Christmas season. Sweet and pure children from two powerful nations showed an instant love for one another as they were seated at the feet of the <span class="emphasis">Christus.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p3" pid="OMFtbBPeRUGwHyz2tDCxPw" hash="kYDjlA">I said to the audience that perhaps the world’s troubles could be solved if we could turn over the leadership of nations to the children for a few days. Through love they would find solutions to the misunderstandings, mistrust, and misconduct of adults in the world. I had the clear impression that night that if all men and women could love Jesus Christ as these lovely children do, many world problems could be solved. Sooner, perhaps, than we realize, the fate of nations will be in the hands of today’s children. An anonymous author penned it this way:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p5" pid="l-dLzpBUg0mnR1_qiHEZLA" hash="rb5Afw">Have you seen the future when you gazed through the hospital nursery window and saw the bassinet wheeled into your view? You see that beautiful newborn infant for the first time. A new spirit comes into your life as a son or daughter, grandchild, or child of a friend, and you know that your life will never be quite the same again. How often have you had to blink back the tears as you stood in awe and contemplated the miracle of a new life? This newly arrived spirit has come in sweet innocence from the presence of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p6" pid="zlT4lTSyHE2LdRYJx7ccLA" hash="NHaAbw">Every human being is a spirit child of God and lived with Heavenly Father before coming to earth. He entrusts his spirit children to earthly parents who provide a mortal body for them through the miracle of physical birth and gives to parents the sacred opportunity and responsibility to love, protect, teach, and to bring them up in light and truth so they may one day, through the atonement and resurrection of Jesus Christ, return to our Father’s presence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p7" pid="cQl4KkJk3UCts4nON0mUqA" hash="Io9F3Q">These precious souls come to us in purity and innocence. As parents, we assume an immense responsibility for their care and well-being. Parents share this sacred trust with brothers and sisters, grandparents, teachers, neighbors, and all who touch the lives and impress or influence the souls of these precious children. King Benjamin admonished parents many years ago, “But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.15" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p8" pid="TYq6kEuXxEKgz5z5I4AsYA" hash="0A1g0g">The critical nature of the first tender formative years cannot be overstated. These little ones are like seedlings in a plant nursery. All look much the same in the beginning, but each one will grow to become independent and unique. Parents are to nourish, tend, and teach their children so they will grow to their full stature and potential.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p9" pid="-px0-z3WGkyML8DYDsz0EQ" hash="5r6EyA">Parents and teachers should see beyond the little girl in pigtails and should not be misled by the ragged little boy with a dirty face and holes in the knees of his pants. True teachers and leaders see children as they may become. They see the valiant missionary who will one day share his testimony with the world and later become a righteous father who honors his priesthood. The inspired teacher sees pure and beautiful mothers and future presidents of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary, even though today they may be girls who giggle and chatter on the back row in the classroom. Sometimes people say, “Well, boys will be boys!” Not so—boys will be men, and almost before we know it.</p>

We should spare no effort to help our children reach their full potential. Is it any wonder that Jesus brought the little children unto himself to teach and bless them? He said, “Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/9.37" class="scriptureRef">Mark 9:37</a>.) He also said, “Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.14" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:14</a>.)</p>

One Saturday morning I was preparing for an activity with one of my grandsons. But before we could make our exit out the door, I heard another small voice inquiring, “Can I go too, Grandpa?” Did you ever try to say no to such a request? That activity would not have been the same without that someone else who really wanted to “go too.” Just as surely, heaven will not be heaven if some of our children who want to “go too” are left behind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p16" pid="bWGlF_yGC0SaAyB5Led04A" hash="YG3ptQ">Some may choose not to go. Our Heavenly Father has given them the agency to choose for themselves. We have the task of helping them learn about our Heavenly Father’s plan for us, demonstrating our faith in the Lord, and continuing to work with our children in prayerful and patient persuasion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p17" pid="hRpqx0JOEU6V8BCgQ115MA" hash="6hT6Ug">To teach our children the gospel of Jesus Christ and to protect them from the influences of a wicked world, love must abide in our homes. We should cherish and care for our children with unwavering dedication. The older we grow, the more precious our family becomes to us. We come to see more clearly that all of the wealth, honor, and positions of the world pale in significance when compared to the precious souls of our loved ones. You young parents who are beginning your families must guard against seeking financial gain, worldly comforts, or achievement at the expense of your children. You must guard against being so anxious to get to work or to a meeting that you do not have time for your family, especially time to listen to anxious little voices. Always remember this timeless counsel from a prophet of God, President David O. McKay: “No other success can compensate for failure in the home.” (<span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> June 1964, p. 445.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p18" pid="MWk9-YrrNkieFO2xBwn-HQ" hash="w9Q78g">We <span class="emphasis">cannot</span> and we <span class="emphasis">must not</span> allow the school, community, television, or even Church organizations to establish our children’s values. The Lord has placed this duty with mothers and fathers. It is one from which we cannot escape and one that cannot be delegated. Others may help, but parents remain accountable. Therefore, we must guard the sanctity of our homes because that is where children develop their values, attitudes, and habits for everyday living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p19" pid="SSBuQPuWpEyxUPOVQEpTbA" hash="J4BX1g">Children perceive their own identity much earlier than we may realize. They want to be recognized as individuals. Not long ago as my wife visited with our daughter, her three-year-old son ran to his grandmother. She picked him up and said, “Hi, how are you doing, Babes?” He looked at her and said with a serious voice, “I not a Babes, I a Dude!” In the vernacular of the day, he was asserting that he was someone special, he had a place, and he belonged.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p20" pid="5oJEfd84oE6nqWfzRziGuQ" hash="HDC6xA">What a beautiful place this world will be when every father and mother see the importance of teaching their children the principles that will help them be happy and successful. Parents teach best when they lead by good example; govern their little ones with patience, kindness, and love unfeigned; and have the same spirit of love for children that Jesus exemplified.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p21" pid="1jhDoK5hzk-G3_oyMXRClA" hash="WCgMIw">In times of need, a father may bless his children through the righteous exercise of his priesthood. Every mother can accept her children from her Father in Heaven as her great source of joy. She will know that because her children are also children of God, no sacrifice is too great to protect them from evil and to surround them with a spirit of love and trust in God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p22" pid="jRpxbwexwE24LTpGz5PPHQ" hash="rMCoNg">One of our grandsons, when he was five years old, became confused when his family moved into a new ward. He thought the meetings were over and went outside. When he realized he was alone and could not find the family or their car, he knelt down and prayed for help. Just a few minutes later, one of the counselors in the Primary presidency came out and asked him if he was lost. A Primary teacher had called to her from the door of a classroom and said that someone was missing. The teacher asked the counselor to find out who it was. The counselor felt impressed to look outside and went straight to our grandson. Later, the teacher and counselor both commented on how strong their impressions were that he needed help. We were thankful that his parents and Primary teachers had taught him that Heavenly Father loves him and had taught him to always pray for help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p23" pid="wwUSuZGMaEydEA20tTkZIQ" hash="C370Cw">Priesthood leaders should select dedicated, spiritually guided Primary teachers. Teachers should teach by love and example after prayerful preparation. A loving teacher each Sunday can calm the fear of new surroundings and help children want to come to Church meetings. One five-year-old girl began to cry as the family was preparing for Sunday meetings. When asked why, she sobbed, “I don’t know who my teacher will be.” Her class had had several teachers in recent months; the frequent change had disturbed the peace of that tender little soul.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p24" pid="5JIYiX4iD0iiGzVYa4EYzQ" hash="ong3-A">Our children do not grow to full physical stature suddenly. In like manner, their spiritual growth takes place over time. This development might be compared to erecting a block building. The walls are formed block by block with a strong mortar holding each block to the others. We could give these building blocks names, such as bedtime stories, listening to a child pray, tucking a child in bed at night, and a quiet review of the day’s activities. Other blocks could be pleasant dinner conversations, praise for tasks well done, birthday parties, and family outings. Others could be doing your chores, being kind to one another, reading from the scriptures together, serving others, and saying I love you. Still other blocks could be learning to work, taking responsibility, respecting elders, singing together, doing homework, attending Primary, and honoring the Sabbath day. Even larger blocks are family home evening, respecting and honoring the priesthood, and family prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p25" pid="P5ONYvDnVEyXVA0tsLUWnw" hash="KDBtwg">A vast array of such beautiful building blocks that are placed carefully can form a fortress of faith that the tidal waves of worldly distraction and evil cannot breach. These blocks are held together with a mortar called love: love of Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ, love of parents, love for each other, love for choosing the good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p26" pid="KWvIDypwDkOw9FGPTYzCcA" hash="a823JQ">Many children have only one parent at home, and some are left with no parents at all. We all share a responsibility to help fill such voids and to provide sustained assistance and encouragement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/teach-the-children.p27" pid="0BpAcz58QUOMuGEERU4GKQ" hash="ofeuIw">On the negative side, we hear disturbing reports of parents or guardians who are so far removed from the Spirit of Christ that they abuse children. Whether this abuse is physical, verbal, or the less evident but equally severe emotional abuse, it is an abomination and a serious offense to God. Jesus left no question about the seriousness of harming children in any way when he said, “But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:6</a>.)</p>

Special moments may come only once. Before we are aware, they have grown older, and our best opportunity for teaching them how to live happy and fulfilling lives is past.</p>

Tonight I see beautiful young and innocent faces, shining with a zest for living. I also see white-haired grandmothers, who radiate a genuine love for the Lord. Undoubtedly some of you are newly baptized members, while others have spent their lifetime in faithful service to the Church.

You want to be sure to have family prayer, read the scriptures, and have family home evening. You also feel the need help children with homework and music lessons; keep your home presentable; prepare nutritious meals; keep clothes clean and mended; chauffeur children and possibly their friends to school and to a variety of lessons, practices, and games; and keep everyone in the family on schedule, making sure they are where they should be when they should be there. And that is all within your family and home. It makes me weary just reviewing all of this! It doesn’t include PTA, volunteer service, or caring for family members who are ill or aged. You feel the need to protect you family from the many evil influences in the world such as suggestive television, films, and videos; alcohol; drugs; and pornography.

Be at peace within yourselves. Rather than berate yourself for what you didn’t do, congratulate yourself for what you did.</p>

The central character, Jean Valjean, is sentenced to years of hard labor for stealing a bit of bread to keep his loved ones from starvation. Newly released from prison, he finds food and a night’s refuge in the home of a priest. Bitter and hopeless, he slips away before dawn, taking with him the silver from the rectory table. The police apprehend him and ask the priest to identify the silver as stolen property. The priest tells them that not only was the silver given freely, but that Valjean had forgotten the two candlesticks that went with it.</p>

Years later, in a case of mistaken identity, a man is brought to trial in Valjean’s place. Jean now must make a seemingly impossible choice. He reviews in his mind the consequences if he chooses to step forward, identify himself, and serve his own sentence. By now, he has become very successful. He employs thousands; they will be jobless. He is the mayor; his town will suffer. He has been benefactor to many; they will have no advocate. Surely he is justified if he remains silent. From the depth of his soul, we hear the song’s refrain:</p>

In his Sunday morning address, President Gordon B. Hinckley called to our attention some of the poignant experiences of our pioneer forefathers whose sacrifices helped them lay the foundation of the restored Church. Our hearts were softened and our spirits grew tender with emotion as we listened to him recount experiences of some of those hardy handcart pioneers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p2" pid="4__r8FWHb06DRR7--6exPQ" hash="E49qsA">The images engendered in my mind and heart have not left me. Again and again, I find my thoughts returning to the high, snow-covered, windswept plains of Wyoming. In my mind’s eye, I see the suffering of those faithful Saints and know that in their extremity, under circumstances hard for us today to conceive, many of them came to know God in a way that few people will ever understand.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p3" pid="NjmtoS__hU6JZDOuMc2jqA" hash="ww3nPw">Many of us are descendants of hardy pioneers, and we feel grateful and inspired by their faith-promoting examples of sacrifice. My great-grandmother Margaret McNeil Ballard recorded in her journal a pioneer experience of sacrifice that occurred when she was between nine and eleven years of age. She wrote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p4" pid="jOyGaHdEd0u3PQPXy64EkA" hash="Pvj_Sw">“After landing we planned to go west to Utah with the Martin and Willey handcart companies; but Elder Franklin D. Richards counseled my father not to go with them. Afterwards, we were very thankful because of the great suffering, privation and cold weather to which these people were subjected. There were many of the company who were frozen that year on their journey. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p5" pid="fbjGDbmHLEWF057yhks3bQ" hash="uBFrPw">“The company we were assigned to had gone on ahead and as my mother was anxious for me to go with them she strapped my little brother James on my back with a shawl. He was only four years old and … quite sick with the measles; but I took him since my mother had all she could do to care for the other children. I hurried and caught up with the company, traveling with them all day. That night a kind lady helped me take my brother off my back. I sat up and held him on my lap with the shawl wrapped around him, alone, all night. He was a little better in the morning. The people in the camp were very good to us and gave us a little fried bacon and some bread for breakfast.</p>

It teaches also that they helped, nourished, and strengthened each other in their extremity and shared unstintingly. Their material means, such as food, clothing, and shelter, were meager, but their love for one another and their devotion to their Lord and to the gospel were boundless.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p8" pid="PLYJDjr6-EORRnU2ITpkIg" hash="MnVASQ">Our commitment to the kingdom should match that of our faithful ancestors even though our sacrifices are different. They were driven from comfortable homes and compelled to journey one thousand miles by ox-drawn wagon and handcart to reestablish their families, homes, and Church in safety. Our sacrifices may be more subtle but no less demanding. Instead of physical deprivation and hardship, we face the challenge of remaining true and faithful to gospel principles amidst such evil and destructive forces as dishonesty, corruption, drug and alcohol misuse, and disease often caused by sexual promiscuity. Also, we find ourselves in combat daily with immorality in all of its many forms. Pornography and violence, often portrayed in insidious television shows, movies, and videos, are running rampant. Hate and envy, greed and selfishness are all about us, and families are disintegrating at an ever-increasing pace. In the midst of all of this, my brothers and sisters, we must never forget the source of our abundant blessings.</p>

Under the direction of our stake president, G. Carlos Smith, we broke ground for the construction of a new ward building. At the time the ward was created, we had a total of 373 members. As I recall, more than half of them were under the age of twelve. I served as second counselor to Bishop William Partridge. Under his leadership this little band of people proceeded immediately to build a three-phase ward building.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p10" pid="a-ya4HMdeEK0sPpz4WRPGQ" hash="vu7B7w">The ward was divided in 1958, and I was named bishop of the Holladay Twelfth Ward. In those days, local members paid 50 percent of the cost of constructing a building. One of the most important leadership experiences in my life came several weeks before the announced dedication of the building. Our ward of young families, who were struggling to make ends meet, needed to raise the final $30,000 required to pay our share of the cost. I fasted and prayed, asking for help from Heavenly Father to know what I should say to our ward members regarding this obligation. We already had pressed them very hard, and they had willingly contributed money and personal labor beyond anything I believed possible. But still we needed to raise the last $30,000.</p>

I quote just a small portion of his testimony.</p>

Many questions arose that we had to settle. There was no precedent for us to follow, and we just had to go to the Lord and tell Him our troubles, and get inspiration and help from Him. On this occasion I had sought the Lord, under such circumstances, and that night I received a wonderful manifestation and impression which has never left me. I was carried to this place—into this room. I saw myself here with you. I was told there was another privilege that was to be mine; and I was led into a room where I was informed I was to meet someone. As I entered the room I saw, seated on a raised platform, the most glorious being I have ever conceived of, and was taken forward to be introduced to Him. As I approached He smiled, called my name, and stretched out His hands towards me. If I live to be a million years old I shall never forget that smile. He put His arms around me and kissed me, as He took me into His bosom, and He blessed me until my whole being was thrilled. As He finished I fell at His feet, and there saw the marks of the nails; and as I kissed them, with deep joy swelling through my whole being, I felt that I was in heaven indeed. The feeling that came to my heart then was: Oh! If I could live worthy, though it would require four-score years, so that in the end when I have finished I could go into His presence and receive the feeling that I <span class="emphasis">then </span>had in His presence, I would give everything that I am or ever hope to be!” (<span class="emphasis">Melvin J. Ballard—Crusader for Righteousness, </span>Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966, p. 65–66.)</p>

Very little else was said because this small group of faithful people also knew in their own way that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He is our Savior and our Redeemer. We all knew that with greater faith in Him, we could reach our goal. During that same day, family after family came to my office with money, making personal sacrifices that were far beyond what I, the bishop, would ever have asked of them. By eight o’clock Sunday evening, the ward clerk had written receipts for a little more than $30,000.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p14" pid="D8wCRDa32kqobIslU3NKuQ" hash="PGrb-A">Sacrifice truly brought forth the blessings of heaven to the members of our ward. Never have I lived among people who were more united, more caring, more concerned for one another than these ward members were when making their greatest sacrifice. In the midst of this effort, the sick of our ward were healed through priesthood blessings. The youth committed to live righteously. The young men set their goals to be fully worthy to serve missions, and most of them did; and the young women resolved to settle for nothing but a worthy temple marriage. Sisters of the Relief Society found great joy in rendering compassionate service to others, and home teaching and visiting teaching were completed every month in the spirit of joy and service. In the midst of our greatest sacrifice, our ward members became bonded together in the true spirit of the gospel of love and service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p15" pid="j7dDpIEFyUmKbixkEObC-Q" hash="9DSlIA">Sacrifice is a demonstration of pure love. The degree of our love for the Lord, for the gospel, and for our fellowman can be measured by what we are willing to sacrifice for them. Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ manifested the supreme example of this love. His life and ministry established a pattern for us to follow. His divine mission was culminated in a supreme act of love as He allowed His life to be sacrificed for us. Having power over life and death, He chose to submit himself to pain, ridicule, and suffering, and offered His life as a ransom for our sins. Because of His love, He suffered both body and spirit to a degree beyond our comprehension and took upon Himself our sins if we repent. Through His personal sacrifice, He provided a way for us to have our sins forgiven and, through Him, to find our way back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p16" pid="7GIas8wKbEKZXEqaRLsi9w" hash="us4LwA">The sacrifice he requires of us is “a broken heart and a contrite spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 9:20</a>) that can lead us to repentance. When we consider His example, the demands made upon our time or means are slight in comparison. We should, therefore, give gladly and count it as a blessing and an opportunity.</p>

As I have pondered these simple acts of faith, I have asked myself, however, “How many of us really measure up to our potential in living the spirit of the law of sacrifice?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p18" pid="XemH4U91NEK_QOl6GpRWag" hash="91LLJg">Church members today have been blessed greatly to have some of our financial burdens lifted. Faithful payment of tithes that are administered carefully now provides funds for constructing our buildings, paying for utilities, and meeting many other obligations that formerly necessitated additional contributions. We must realize that decreasing these needs for financial contributions gives birth to enlarged opportunities for us to live a higher law. By this I mean that on our own initiative we can find ways to extend ourselves in helping others and contributing to the building of the Lord’s kingdom. The Lord has instructed us that we “should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of [our] own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; For the power is in [us], wherein [we] are agents unto [ourselves].” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27-28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27–28</a>.)</p>

Some of the Lord’s choicest blessings await those who practice this eternal principle through extending themselves in service to God and to their fellowmen. The sacrificing spirit and the happiness that come through service to others can bring peace and joy even amid trials.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p20" pid="Ry0uhZ5qe0q-NVnWe8GgIg" hash="X4oevA">The principle of sacrifice should be taught in every Latter-day Saint home and should be practiced in many simple yet important ways. We can do this by setting an example of reverence that will bring the true spirit of worship into our meetings and by guarding against murmuring and complaining about the challenges of the Sunday worship schedule. We can contribute a generous fast offering, find joy in supporting missionaries, and pay an honest tithing. We can accept Church callings and serve with a happy and grateful heart, do temple work regularly, offer family and personal daily prayers, and teach one another each week in well-planned family home evenings. Both younger members and those who are older can prepare early and make themselves worthy to accept calls to serve as missionaries. We all can be good neighbors and can take care of widows, the poor, and the less fortunate. We can reach out to others in our service as home and visiting teachers. Brethren, we must be clean and worthy to bless others with the priesthood we hold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p21" pid="duDopOfltUq3XmmLTwElEg" hash="o397OQ">Today we are not called to pull handcarts through the snow-swept plains of Wyoming. However, we are called to live, foster, and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is our privilege to invest our means and our time to bless others. Each one of us must do all we can to preserve our Latter-day Saint way of life. A vital part of this preservation is a willingness to set aside personal desires and replace them with unselfish sacrifice for others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-blessings-of-sacrifice.p22" pid="ap8YL80UfkONZdgH7WtAyw" hash="16ykEQ">God bless you, brothers and sisters, to know as I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that being a member of His church, the only true and living church, is never a burden but always a great blessing. That we may be grateful for this blessing I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Today, more so than in the past, I am asked about the signs of the times and if I think the end of the world is near. My answer is the same one that Jesus gave some two thousand years ago: “But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</p>

As members of the Church, we must not forget the Savior’s admonition, “Be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass.” These are difficult times, when the forces of nature seem to be unleashing a flood of “famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.”</p>

According to the article, only two major earthquakes (earthquakes measuring at least six on the Richter scale) occurred during the 1920s. In the 1930s the number increased to five, and then it decreased to four during the 1940s. But in the 1950s, nine major earthquakes occurred, followed by fifteen during the 1960s, forty-six during the 1970s, and fifty-two during the 1980s. Already almost as many major earthquakes have occurred during the 1990s as during the entire decade of the 1980s.</p>

Here in the United States, we are still reeling from two incredibly destructive hurricanes. People in the Philippines see no end to the devastation of the volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Famine grips portions of Africa, where tragic human suffering is prevalent. To a lesser degree, hunger afflicts millions, even in countries that have a high standard of living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p9" pid="OA4WTjxKjUWgXWNMdo-lmw" hash="U14rgw">Political unrest, warfare, and economic chaos prevail in many parts of the world, and the plagues of pornography, drug misuse, immorality, AIDS, and child abuse become more oppressive with each passing day. The media busily satisfies an apparently insatiable appetite of audiences to witness murder, violence, nudity, sex, and profanity. Is not this the day of which Moroni spoke when he recorded: “Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.35" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:35</a>.) And then he prophesied of conditions of the world as they are today.</p>

Many feel helpless to deal with the chaos that seems to prevail in the world. Others anguish over family members who are being carried downstream in a swift, raging current of weakening values and declining moral standards. Children particularly are suffering as society drifts further and further away from the commandments of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-joy-of-hope-fulfilled.p11" pid="AeMK1HczWE2s1HjZr5wr2g" hash="sEHUWw">Many have even resigned themselves to accept the wickedness and cruelty of the world as being irreparable. They have given up hope. They have decided to quit trying to make the world a better place in which they and their families can live. They have surrendered to despair.</p>

But regardless of this dark picture, which will ultimately get worse, we must never allow ourselves to give up hope! Moroni, having seen our day, counseled, “Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.20" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:20</a>.)</p>

He knows the end from the beginning. He has given us adequate instruction that, if followed, will see us safely through any crisis. His purposes will be fulfilled, and someday we will understand the eternal reasons for all of these events. Therefore, today we must be careful to not overreact, nor should we be caught up in extreme preparations; but what we must do is keep the commandments of God and never lose hope!</p>

Quite simply, our one hope for spiritual safety during these turbulent times is to turn our minds and our hearts to Jesus Christ. The prophet Mormon taught: “Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise.</p>

Remember, nothing will occur in our lives that He does not understand. Alma taught, “And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11</a>.)</p>

Armed with the shield of faith, we can overcome many of our daily challenges and overpower our greatest weaknesses and fears, knowing that if we do our best to keep the commandments of God, come what may, we will be all right.</p>

Righteousness has never precluded adversity. But faith in the Lord Jesus Christ—<span class="emphasis">real</span> faith, whole-souled and unshakable—is a power to be reckoned with in the universe. It can be a causative force through which miracles are wrought. Or it can be a source of inner strength through which we find peace, comfort, and the courage to cope.</p>

However, some among us may have lost all hope because of sin and transgression. A person can become so deeply immersed in the ways of the world that he sees no way out and loses all hope. My plea to all who have fallen into this trap of the adversary is to never give up! Regardless of how desperate things may seem or how desperate they may yet become, please believe me, you can always have hope. Always.</p>

It was a beautiful occasion, as such ceremonies almost always are.

Through her diligence and perseverance, she kindled a small ember of testimony that never left me even through some of the roughest times of my life. In my teen years Satan hit me hard. It was during the late 1960s and early 1970s, a time of great turmoil, and Satan was hard at work on me. I was taken with the practice of free drugs, free love, free fun, and the rest of the world be damned. Beginning with my first drink of alcohol, I began to slowly deteriorate. After alcohol, other drugs were that much easier to use. In order to take drugs, you must become a good liar. You learn to do whatever it takes to conceal your behavior from others.</p>

Had it not been for the small flicker of testimony instilled in me by my mother when I was a child, to know that Heavenly Father could still love me, I have reservations as to whether I would even be writing this letter today.”</p>

They are faith, hope, and charity. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13:13</a>.) Together they give us a base of support like the legs of a three-legged stool. Each principle is significant within itself, but each also plays an important supporting role. Each is incomplete without the others. Hope helps faith develop. Likewise true faith gives birth to hope. When we begin to lose hope, we are faltering also in our measure of faith. The principles of faith and hope working together must be accompanied by charity, which is the greatest of all. According to Mormon, “charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>.) It is the perfect manifestation of our faith and hope.</p>

Real faith fosters hope for the future; it allows us to look beyond ourselves and our present cares. Fortified by hope, we are moved to demonstrate the pure love of Christ through daily acts of obedience and Christian service.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p2" pid="XKeumUDtj02dE2xmmcWP5Q" hash="zuwKWQ">Some of you may not understand our Heavenly Father’s plan well enough to appreciate how important living a morally clean life is if you want to enjoy peace, happiness, and self-esteem. When you understand, the truths of the gospel will give you the guidance you need to be worthy members of the Church. When you accept the basic principles of the gospel and commit to live them, you will have the spiritual insight that will help you to be young men and women of purity, integrity, and faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p3" pid="wUllKXLR7UypYq9wd_GvWw" hash="0AziXw">Unfortunately, we live in a world that is awash in all kinds of moral pollution, including drugs, violence, filthy language, pornography in literature; and videotapes, films, and television shows that promote illicit sex and promiscuity as being normal. A national debate is raging to make elective abortion acceptable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p4" pid="E4EiEITEV0KBEZiwyfYKnA" hash="NCOKmw">With challenges like these, you need to remember that you do not face them alone. There are people who love you and want you to be happy. We want the very best for you. Most especially, your Father in Heaven loves you and wants you to have joy and happiness. He has made marvelous promises to His faithful children who love Him, who are baptized, and who keep His commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p5" pid="p2tk3bjevkSnuddpydKzlw" hash="Bpt07A">When you entered the waters of baptism, you made a promise to the Lord that you would “humble [yourselves] before God, … and witness before the church that [you] have truly repented of all [your] sins, and are willing to take upon [yourselves] the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by [your] works that [you] have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of [your] sins.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:37</a>.) You were therefore bound by covenant to “a godly walk and conversation, … walking in holiness before the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.69" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:69</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p6" pid="-Et4g47ghk-sdfLpWvySyw" hash="6iRfzA">Many of you were baptized when you were eight years old, and you may not realize that this is the promise you made to your Heavenly Father when you were baptized. Always remember that you are under this covenant. Your Heavenly Father has promised in return that He will give marvelous blessings to those who honor their covenants, keep His commandments, and endure faithfully to the end. They will be sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise and will be “given <span class="emphasis">all</span> things” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.55" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:55</a>; emphasis added; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.50-54,70" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:50–54, 70</a>), including an inheritance in the celestial kingdom (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.16-20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:16–20</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p7" pid="Vzye6ffYOkyeIPFTSlDSnA" hash="qS_YxA">The Apostle Paul wrote that “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:9</a>.) Those who live clean lives and keep the commandments “shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.62" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:62</a>.) They “shall have eternal life … the greatest of all the gifts of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p8" pid="Ce7HTapYUE2qgShvJZz6rg" hash="HFDzJA">I remind you young men who have been ordained to the priesthood that you have made an additional covenant with God. When you were ordained, you made a sacred promise with the Lord that you would honor your priesthood faithfully. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.33-42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:33–42</a>.) We are pleased to know that many of you are true and faithful in every way to your priesthood covenants and are preparing yourselves to receive the Lord’s promised blessings. Unfortunately, we know also that too many young men of the priesthood pay little attention to the serious nature of their sacred promises made with Heavenly Father. Let me explain why you young men and women must keep your covenants you have made with God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p9" pid="44Zt0FUjmEiKbA4sebxr2A" hash="SgfzrQ">In the premortal world before we left the presence of Heavenly Father, He warned and cautioned us about new experiences we would have in mortality. We knew that we would have a physical body of flesh and bone. Never having been mortal before, we had no experience dealing with the temptations of mortality. But Heavenly Father knew and understood. He charged us to control our mortal bodies and to make them subject to our spirits. Our spirits would have to master the physical temptations that our bodies would encounter in a temporal world. Spiritual power over the influence of Satan comes to us by keeping the commandments of our Lord, Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p10" pid="gv9B3cZdX02VpvHcl7LM3g" hash="HSwsUQ">Being here on earth for the first time in our eternal existence, we are away from the protective presence of our Father in Heaven and are subject to the influence of Satan and his followers. Remember that Satan even tried to tempt the Savior into betraying the promises He had made to God. After Jesus was baptized, He went into the wilderness to fast and pray for forty days. Satan chose that moment during Christ’s hunger and physical weakness to tempt Him. But Jesus did not succumb; He stood firm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p11" pid="8FnDfgtWIkGD4GmYRRgmfA" hash="QQZcPg">Satan will seek to tempt us at times and in ways that exploit our greatest weaknesses or destroy our strengths. But his promises of pleasure are short-lived deceptions. His evil design is to tempt us into sinning, knowing that when we sin we separate ourselves from our Heavenly Father and the Savior, Jesus Christ. We begin to move away from Heavenly Father’s promised blessings toward the misery and anguish in which Satan and his followers languish. By sinning we put ourselves in Satan’s power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p12" pid="3elqw5gVQ0uV7m7u6aK7sQ" hash="ZInCyQ">Now, my dear young friends, I understand the struggles you face every day in keeping the commandments of the Lord. The battle for your souls is increasingly fierce. The adversary is strong and cunning. However, you have within your physical body the powerful spirit of a son or daughter of God. Because He loves you and wants you to come home to Him, our Father in Heaven has given you a conscience that tells your spirit when you are keeping the Lord’s commandments and when you are not. If you will pay more attention to your spiritual self, which is eternal, than to your mortal self, which is temporary, you can always resist the temptations of Satan and conquer his efforts to take you into his power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p13" pid="fc-6ofq3vUOGtwM4cm2PYg" hash="aCFa0g">You must be honest with yourself and remain true to the covenants you have made with God. Do not fall into the trap of thinking you can sin a little and it will not matter. Remember, “the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.31" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:31</a>.) Some young men and women in the Church talk openly about sexual transgression. They seem to forget that the Lord forbids all sexual relations before marriage, including petting, sex perversion of any kind, or preoccupation with sex in thought, speech, or action. Some youth foolishly rationalize that it is “no big deal” to sin now because they can always repent later when they want to go to the temple or on a mission. Anyone who does that is breaking promises made to God both in the premortal life and in the waters of baptism. The idea of sinning a little is self-deception. Sin is sin! Sin weakens you spiritually, and it always places the sinner at eternal risk. Choosing to sin, even with the intent to repent, is simply turning away from God and violating covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p14" pid="3tcqh0v8BU2ODGPUf1Ngaw" hash="l-YneA">Gratefully, many of you young men honor your priesthood and many young women “stand for truth and righteousness” as stated in the Young Women’s motto. (<span class="emphasis">Young Women Leadership Handbook,</span> Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1992, p. 5.) We commend you for your fidelity and integrity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p15" pid="Cv8F1jq_wEW9sjy5dXX8ig" hash="XjZOVg">For those who have strayed, the Savior has provided a way back. But it is not without pain. Repentance is not easy; it takes time—painful time! You deceive yourself if you believe you can break the promises you have made with Heavenly Father and suffer no consequence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keeping-covenants.p16" pid="W3T2BZiKokS--0B0w4UQzA" hash="BpkkcQ">You sustain the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. We prepared for you a pamphlet entitled <span class="emphasis">For the Strength of Youth.</span> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1990.) Most of you know that this inspired pamphlet contains guidelines to help you measure your moral conduct. I urge you to read every word over and over again so you will understand what the Lord and His church expect of you. The First Presidency message is so important that I will quote a few statements from it.</p>

They plan to repent before they go on a mission or receive the sacred covenants and ordinances of the temple. Repentance for such behavior is difficult and painful and may take a long time. It is better to not commit the sin. Certain sins are of such gravity that they can put your membership in the Church and your eternal life at risk. Sexual sins are among those of such seriousness.</p>

Brethren, we expect that you will teach youth leaders, parents, and the youth these long-established principles. Missionaries must be morally clean and spiritually prepared by you to serve the Lord in today’s world. I urge you to follow the instructions precisely and to do all in your power to help young people avoid any sin that could disqualify them for service in the kingdom of God.</p>

Have your scriptures with you and as you read, ponder, and pray, take an honest look at your life. Evaluate where you stand with the promises you have made with Heavenly Father. If you have a problem, talk it over with the Lord in earnest and humble prayer. Counsel with your parents; they will help you. Your bishop and your Young Men and Young Women adult leaders will help. They love you and want you to be at peace with yourself so you can partake of the sacrament worthily each week. When all is said and done, however, only you know if you are living true to your covenants made with God.</p>

You then will be prepared for your responsibilities in your homes, in the Church, and in your communities and will be prepared to return to your Heavenly Father. May God bless every one of our precious youth, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Each one of you is a part of the largest and oldest women’s organization in the world and the only one organized by a prophet of God. I bring you greetings from the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles. We and your local priesthood leaders value you sisters and hold you in high esteem. We recognize and appreciate all you do to help build the kingdom of God. We marvel at your faith and your dedicated service to your families, the Church, and your communities. We pray for you, and we extend our love to each one of you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p2" pid="SoHWL1pTQ0C7qgrabbKBJw" hash="bivHjA">My brethren and I serve as priesthood advisers to the Relief Society general presidency and board. The task of Relief Society is more challenging than ever because of the diversity of languages, cultures and environments, and the ever-changing circumstances throughout the world. Careful planning has to be both broad and narrow: broad enough to meet the varying needs of more than three million women living in more than 130 different countries and locations, and yet narrow enough to meet the needs of each sister. Relief Society and the gospel should embrace <span class="emphasis">every</span> woman. Every one of you is welcome and needed whether you are eighteen or eighty, married or single, speak English or Portuguese, live on an island or in the mountains, have children or simply love children but have none of your own, have an advanced degree or little formal education, have a husband who is not active or are married to a stake president, have a testimony or are struggling to receive one. You belong here! You and your talents, strengths, and contributions are needed urgently in the Church. As Eliza R. Snow, the second general president of the Relief Society, said, “There is no sister so isolated and her sphere so narrow but what she can do a great deal towards establishing the kingdom of God upon the earth” (<span class="emphasis">Woman’s Exponent,</span> 15 Sept. 1893, p. 62).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p3" pid="6yN6TH9-30C12KnQd-nA0A" hash="spEKNg">I pray for the Spirit of the Lord this evening as I teach a fundamental principle of the gospel that, if understood, will fortify and bless you sisters in your quest for eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p4" pid="K6dMuRVC80KMKKpbOkvkMA" hash="uBPhRQ">Our Father in Heaven loves all of His children equally, perfectly, and infinitely. His love is no different for His daughters than for His sons. Our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, also loves men and women equally. His atonement and His gospel are for all of God’s children. During His earthly ministry Jesus served men and women alike: He healed both men and women and He taught both men and women.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p5" pid="h4VS1qDXC0OuQ82we6Li9A" hash="02JsFA">The gospel of Jesus Christ can sanctify both men and women in the same way and by identical principles. For example, faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost are requirements for all of God’s children, regardless of <span class="emphasis">gender.</span> The same is true of temple covenants and blessings. Our Father’s work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>). He loves us all equally, and His greatest gift, the gift of eternal life, is available to all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p6" pid="8YhRdu4jdEOjTK7xROt7sA" hash="cSB_TA">Even though men and women are equal before God in their eternal opportunities, they have different, but equally significant, duties in His eternal plan. We must understand that God views all of His children with infinite wisdom and perfect fairness. Consequently, He can acknowledge and even encourage our differences while providing equal opportunity for growth and development.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p7" pid="nJZicPuowUOFToulokmdSQ" hash="gArm5w">Our Heavenly Father assigned different responsibilities in mortality to men and women when we lived with Him as His spirit sons and daughters. To His sons He would give the priesthood and the responsibilities of fatherhood, and to His daughters He gave the responsibilities of motherhood, each with its attendant functions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p8" pid="BznD1-9qoU-jESNNmV5LfQ" hash="Frtxjw">The creation of the world, the atonement of Jesus Christ, and the restoration of the gospel in the latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith all have one unifying purpose: to allow all of the spirit children of our Eternal Father to obtain mortal bodies, and then, through the gift of moral agency, to follow the plan of redemption made possible by the Savior’s atonement. God prepared all of this for us that we might return to our heavenly home, clothed in immortality and eternal life, to live with Him as families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p9" pid="2ju029o6M0aXs7z3ZraWng" hash="7INKcQ">A family can live with Him only after a man and a woman are sealed in marriage for eternity by the power of the holy priesthood. We acknowledge that many in the Church desire this great blessing but see little evidence of its fulfillment in this life. Nevertheless, the promise of exaltation remains an attainable goal for each one of us. The prophets have stated clearly that no blessing will be withheld from any of God’s sons and daughters if they love Him, have faith in Him, keep His commandments, and endure faithfully to the end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p10" pid="AtTo13FozESiGRMfStI06A" hash="DOzRHw">Most of what men and women must do to qualify for an exalted family life together is based on shared responsibilities and objectives. Many of the requirements are exactly the same for men and women. For example, obedience to the laws of God should be the same for men and women. Men and women should pray in the same way. They both have the same privilege of receiving answers to their prayers and thereby obtaining personal revelation for their own spiritual development.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p11" pid="lSBE3J0xNE6GVvC4-a8D3A" hash="MloS4g">Both men and women are to serve their families and others, but the specific ways in which they do so are sometimes different. For example, God has revealed through his prophets that men are to receive the priesthood, become fathers, and with gentleness and pure, unfeigned love they are to lead and nurture their families in righteousness as the Savior leads the Church (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/5.23" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 5:23</a>). They have been given the primary responsibility for the temporal and physical needs of the family (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/83.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 83:2</a>). Women have the power to bring children into the world and have been given the primary duty and opportunity as mothers to lead, nurture, and teach them in a loving, spiritual environment. In this divine partnership, husbands and wives support one another in their God-given capacities. By appointing different accountabilities to men and women, Heavenly Father provides the greatest opportunity for growth, service, and progress. He did not give different tasks to men and women simply to perpetuate the idea of a family; rather, He did so to ensure that the family can continue forever, the ultimate goal of our Heavenly Father’s eternal plan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p12" pid="7iMAxVxIcUmNPqQiT0FzKw" hash="M70joA">We need to recognize the hard mortal realities in all of this and must use common sense and guidance by personal revelation. Some will not marry in this life. Some marriages will fail. Some will not have children. Some children will choose not to respond to even the most devoted and careful nurturing by loving parents. In some cases, health and faith may falter. Some who would rather remain at home may have to work. Let us not judge others, because we do not know their situation nor do we know what common sense and personal revelation have led them to do. We do know that throughout mortality, women and men will face challenges and tests of their commitment to God’s plan for them. We need to remember that trials and temptations are an important part of our lives. We should not criticize others for the way they choose to exercise their moral agency when faced with adversity or affliction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p13" pid="4wh-VyLJjEquLuA2RN61XA" hash="l5ffTA">In these latter days, we see people, increasing in number, who urge others to feel and voice dissent when frustration and hardship enter their lives. They would have us believe that the Church or its leaders are unfair to women, or that women are denied opportunities to realize their full potential within the gospel framework. Sisters, we know that the Church is made up of mortals, that priesthood leaders are fallible, and some may not always handle their stewardships with suitable sensitivity. However, I want you to understand this plain truth: the gospel of Jesus Christ provides the only way for women or men to achieve their full potential as children of God. Only the gospel can free us from the terrible effects of sin. Only by following God’s plan for us, with faith and determination to live ultimately in eternal families, can we qualify for eternal life in His presence. Ideally, the Church and the family do not inhibit our progress. They expedite it by putting our feet firmly on the gospel path that leads us back to God. We each have the privilege to carefully and prayerfully seek the Lord’s will for us regarding our individual challenges and dilemmas. <span class="emphasis">Personal</span> revelation is personal, indeed. It is not based on gender or position but on worthiness. It comes in response to sincere inquiry. However, revelation for the Church comes <span class="emphasis">only</span> through the Lord’s prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p14" pid="I2JjzmOl2kWZc6fbwzsGZw" hash="Dzu2eg">In these confusing times, keeping our feet on the gospel path can be difficult. We hear many persuasive voices urging us to turn our backs on revealed truth and embrace the philosophies of the world. I offer three simple suggestions that will help us all to keep our eternal perspective clear and unimpaired.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p15" pid="YtIJLBL8gUGS93rMP5V3Kg" hash="sx9g1g">First, focus on fundamentals. With so much depth and substance in the simple truths of the gospel, you never need to wade in the shallow waters of speculative theology. Teach one another in Relief Society and in your visiting teaching the pure doctrines found in the scriptures and in the approved curriculum; the Holy Ghost will guide and affirm your teaching. Teach your children faith, repentance, baptism, and the other basic principles of the restored gospel. Make your covenants with God, and receive all of the priesthood ordinances. Study and ponder the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, individually and as families. In a world filled with conflict and confusion, you will find peace and safety in the revealed word of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p16" pid="hJnPRxQDPkqIp8nW3rA-BA" hash="QzM3vw">Second, maintain balance. Free and open doctrinal discussion is important in gospel scholarship, but remember that most things have been put into place by God and simply are not subject to change. The doctrines and principles of the Church are established only through revelation, not legislation. This is God’s plan; we do not have the prerogative to alter or tamper with it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p17" pid="tZ4XQRg_kUGQzH3RK7uh1g" hash="GoPbww">Our task is to integrate the principles of the gospel into our lives so that our lives will be in balance. When our lives are in balance, before you realize it your life will be full of spiritual understanding that will confirm that your Heavenly Father loves you and that His plan is fair and true and we should strive to understand it and enjoy living it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p18" pid="EZnNa9qje0C-_c1bZRiVLQ" hash="1I_0Xw">Third, reach out to one another with love, for “charity never faileth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.46" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:46</a>). Many of your sisters, including some who are here tonight, may be hurting for one reason or another. Reach out to those who suffer, listen to their concerns, be worthy of their trust, and always keep their confidences. Share their burdens. Teach them, both by precept and by example, about Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. Help them understand our Father’s unalterable commitment to the principle of moral agency. Teach them about the essential part adversity plays in our eternal lives. Take them by the hand and help them to repent, forgive, have faith, endure, or do whatever is needed. Never forget that the Lord may work a miracle in their lives through you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p19" pid="JL8XBmdhrUSZVoijaWCi_A" hash="EC0Urg">Sisters, you belong to Relief Society. It is organized under priesthood direction in every ward and branch. The members of your local Relief Society presidency are wise, inspired women who have been called by revelation and set apart by those who hold the authority to administer the ordinances of the gospel. I have served twice as a bishop, and I want you to know that you are part of an organization that is vital to your ward and that your individual contributions are of great value to the work of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/equality-through-diversity.p20" pid="iK-ulMIPUkqe-zKqkH5vsw" hash="5Ab2ZA">May God bless you, my dear sisters, in your personal lives, in your homes and families, and in your Church callings. May He bless you for your faithful service. May you feel the comforting assurance that your Heavenly Father loves each one of you, His daughters, and that the way He marks for you is the way to perfect fairness and freedom in this life and in eternity. To this I testify and humbly pray for the Lord’s blessings to be with you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel.p4" pid="qXpbj6pFzUqE8poQOBsqhA" hash="2UD1Fg">God called a grand council in the premortal world to present His glorious plan for our eternal welfare. The Lord’s church is organized with councils at every level, beginning with the Council of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and extending to stake, ward, quorum, auxiliary, and family councils.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel.p5" pid="jtYmckVZJU2mT0JXw0TkTg" hash="6QJWWg">President Stephen L Richards said: “The genius of our Church government is government through councils.

I meet regularly with the leaders of the auxiliaries. Together we counsel, we search the scriptures, and pray for guidance as we strive to learn how the auxiliaries can more effectively bless and strengthen the members of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel.p8" pid="kHGCWL-xp0i9xVb7DP7KAQ" hash="Qq957g">In many respects, general Church councils function much the same as stake and ward councils. All councils in the Church should encourage free and open discussion by conferring with one another and striving to have clear, concise communication. Councils should discuss objectives and concerns, with mutual understanding being the ultimate goal. Stake and ward councils are ideal settings for leaders of all organizations to converse together and strengthen one another. The primary focus of stake and ward council meetings should be coordinating activities and stewardship, not calendaring. In these meetings, priesthood and auxiliary leaders should review together their responsibilities and find ways for Church programs to help members live the gospel in the home. Today, individuals and families need wise and inspired help from the Church to combat the evils of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel.p9" pid="v37OfHGuoUyqvKH5Jk4LGA" hash="gpuiNw">In a recent council meeting with the presidencies of the women’s auxiliaries, the sisters told me that very few women in the Church express any interest in wanting to hold the priesthood. But they do want to be heard and valued and want to make meaningful contributions to the stake or ward and its members that will serve the Lord and help accomplish the mission of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel.p10" pid="1AVioWE8-UiaRmzX-YthDQ" hash="itppFw">For example, not long ago we were talking about the worthiness of youth to serve missions. President Elaine Jack said, “You know, Elder Ballard, the sisters of the Church may have some good suggestions on how to better prepare the youth for missions if they were just asked. After all, you know, we <span class="emphasis">are</span> their mothers!” The sisters’ suggestions can help equally regarding temple attendance and a host of other matters with which priesthood leaders may be struggling.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel.p11" pid="pyAAOzYm-kCOJcxxU8lh-A" hash="SbDj4w">Brethren, please be sure you are seeking the vital input of the sisters in your council meetings. Encourage all council members to share their suggestions and ideas about how the stake or ward can be more effective in proclaiming the gospel, perfecting the Saints, and redeeming the dead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel.p12" pid="ZJ--o7SYdE2zOYt-X2XcFw" hash="t7oZWw">Ideally, all members of any Church or any family council should share their concerns and should suggest solutions based on gospel principles. I believe the Church and our families would be strengthened if stake presidents and bishops would use their council meetings for finding answers to questions on how to improve sacrament meetings; how to improve reverence; how to focus on children; how to strengthen youth; how to help singles, including single parents; how to teach and fellowship investigators and new members; how to improve gospel teaching; and many similar issues.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel.p13" pid="cmyZbCYXPU6EEjEc1hVEMw" hash="JZLoLg">During the last half of this year, we have been holding a special training meeting in conjunction with each stake conference to discuss the morality of our youth. Those who have been participating are members of stake and ward councils. Every question directed to me in the discussion period could be discussed most appropriately in a ward council meeting. Yet rarely do those asking the questions feel that they have had an opportunity in ward council meetings to raise their questions, voice their concerns, and offer their suggestions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel.p14" pid="zQR9EmfxR0-jf-aVA9ajJA" hash="H4COrw">In these perilous times, we need the cooperative effort of men and women officers in the Church because absolute vigilance is required on the part of all who have been entrusted to help watch over the kingdom. We each have large individual responsibilities, but just as important is the responsibility we share with others to come together in council in a united effort to solve problems and bless all of our Church members. When we act in a united effort, we create spiritual synergism which is increased effectiveness or achievement as a result of combined action or cooperation, the result of which is greater than the sum of the individual parts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/strength-in-counsel.p15" pid="nISGZasnlE6ae4yvb3slfw" hash="dDu4Lw">The ancient moralist Aesop used to illustrate the strength of synergism by holding up one stick and asking for a volunteer among his listeners who thought he could break it. Of course, the volunteer was able to break one stick easily. Then Aesop would put more sticks together until the volunteer was unable to break them. The moral to Aesop’s demonstration was simple: Together we generate synergism, which makes us much stronger than when we stand alone.</p>

We need the priesthood quorums to assert themselves and fulfill their divinely mandated stewardship, just as we need the Relief Society, the Primary, the Young Women, the Sunday School, and the activities committees to perform their vital functions. And we need the officers and members of all of these inspired organizations to work together, assisting each other as needed for the benefit of individuals and families. This is not man’s work nor woman’s work; it is <span class="emphasis">all</span> God’s work, which is centered on the atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ. I have some specific suggestions that, if followed, I believe can help us be more effective with our families and in our Church callings.</p>

        <span class="strong">First, focus on fundamentals.</span> We have certainly been taught about these fundamentals during this conference.

        <span class="strong">Second, focus on people.</span> Coordination and calendaring have their time and place, but too many council meetings begin and end there. Rather than reciting a litany of organizational plans and reports, spend most of the time in council meetings reviewing the needs of individual members. In doing so, confidentiality is critical. Council members must hold all matters discussed in council meetings in strict confidence.</p>

        <span class="strong">Third, promote free and open expression.</span> Such expression is essential if we are to achieve the purpose of councils. Leaders and parents should establish a climate that is conducive to openness, where every person is important and every opinion valued. The Lord admonished: “Let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when <span class="emphasis">all</span> have spoken that <span class="emphasis">all</span> may be edified” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.122" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:122</a>; emphasis added).

McKay told of a meeting of the Council of the Twelve Apostles where a question of grave importance was discussed. He and the other Apostles felt strongly about a certain course of action that should be taken, and they were prepared to share their feelings in a meeting with the First Presidency. To their surprise, President Joseph F. Smith did not ask for their opinion in the matter, as was his custom. Rather, “he arose and said, ‘This is what the Lord wants.’</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p1" pid="MdNeYmCtwku5KQ0WWrb2Sw" hash="dXBFhQ">Before I was called as a General Authority, I was in the automobile business, as was my father before me. Through the years I learned to appreciate the sound and the performance of a well-tuned engine. To me it is almost musical, from the gentle purring of an idling motor to the vibrant roar of a throttle that is fully open. The power that sound represents is even more exciting. Nothing is quite the same as sitting behind the wheel of a fine automobile when the engine is operating at peak performance with the assembled parts working together in perfect harmony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p2" pid="pNT7Ewo2UU6qlGU4OJcveA" hash="CsPGIw">On the other hand, nothing is more frustrating than a car engine that is not running properly. No matter how beautiful the paint or comfortable the furnishings inside are, a car with an engine that is not operating as it should is just a shell of unrealized potential. An automobile engine will run on only a part of its cylinders, but it never will go as far or as fast, nor will the ride be as smooth, as when it is tuned properly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p3" pid="4j9qsCgi7Eq8wFEqkgJHDQ" hash="HgXopA">Unfortunately, some wards in the Church are hitting on only a few cylinders, including some that are trying to make do with just one. The one-cylinder ward is the ward where the bishop handles all of the problems, makes all of the decisions, and follows through on all of the assignments. Then, like an overworked cylinder in a car engine, he is soon burned out.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p4" pid="FvrqiXkHNkOBaTypmYm0Jg" hash="3PgW5w">Our bishops have heavy demands placed upon them. They—and they alone—hold certain keys, and only they can fulfill certain responsibilities. But they are not called to be all things, at all times, to all people. They are called to preside and to lead and to extend God’s love to His children. Our Heavenly Father does not expect them to do everything by themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p5" pid="g-p-Uh0jREqQCClztGKwFg" hash="VvFRxQ">The same is true of our stake presidents, priesthood quorum and auxiliary presidents, and, for that matter, mothers and fathers. All have stewardships that require large amounts of their time, talent, and energy. But none is left to do it alone. God, the Master Organizer, has inspired a creation of a system of committees and councils. If understood and put to proper use, this system will decrease the burden on all individual leaders and will extend the reach and the impact of their ministry through the combined help of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p6" pid="gN7VFzBftk28yduwJtSx9g" hash="pqRZww">Six months ago I stood at this pulpit and talked about the importance of the council system in the Church. I spoke about the great spiritual power and inspired direction that come from properly conducted family, ward, and stake councils. The Spirit continues to bear witness to me of how vital efficiently run Church councils are to the accomplishment of the mission of the Church. For that reason, I have been anxious to see how well my remarks in October were understood, particularly by our faithful and diligent bishops.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p7" pid="jEv5_bgDDk-GyxjOn22qsg" hash="9mRXcA">During training sessions I have conducted in various locations since last general conference, I have focused attention on the ward council. As part of that training, I invited a ward council to participate. I gave to the bishop a theoretical problem about a less-active family and asked him to use the ward council to develop a plan to activate this family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p8" pid="6qm7QaKPlE6IDBkfpsW0pQ" hash="4c3TsQ">Without exception, the bishop took charge of the situation immediately and said, “Here’s the problem, and here’s what I think we should do to solve it.” Then he made assignments to the various ward council members. This was a good exercise in delegation, I suppose, but it did not even begin to use the experience and wisdom of council members to address the problem.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p9" pid="UKtm20MGkUmLbONpc3J2yg" hash="vFFSZw">Eventually I asked the bishop to try again, only this time to solicit ideas and recommendations from his council members before making any assignments. I especially encouraged him to ask the sisters for their ideas. When the bishop opened the meeting to council members and invited them to counsel together, the effect was like opening the floodgates of heaven. A reservoir of insight and inspiration suddenly began to flow between council members as they planned for fellowshipping the less-active family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p10" pid="6TKDyKugOUKelpnrotiGvA" hash="VUAaIQ">As I watched this same scenario played out before me time after time during the past six months, I decided that it would not be out of order to speak about the importance of councils once again. I speak not to scold those who did not give serious attention last time, but because we have an urgent need in the Church for leaders, particularly stake presidents and bishops, to harness and channel spiritual power through councils. Family, ward, and stake problems can be solved if we seek solutions in the Lord’s way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p11" pid="JsuCA_h70ECXSayrUr7FlA" hash="4_8Q5Q">In my experience, lives are blessed when leaders make wise use of committees and councils. They move the work of the Lord forward much faster and farther, like a fine automobile operating at peak efficiency. Committee and council members are unified. Together they experience a much more pleasant trip along the highway of Church service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p12" pid="0Gt99xAHaUi7HVi10KfW2Q" hash="E17jfQ">For my purpose today, let me review three ward committees and councils that always should follow a prearranged agenda.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p13" pid="SV3abYPRek60tnzvNuMwGA" hash="MSQsvA">First is the <span class="emphasis">priesthood executive committee.</span> It consists of the bishopric, high priests group leader, elders quorum president, ward mission leader, Young Men president, ward executive secretary, and ward clerk. This committee meets weekly under the direction of the bishop to consider ward priesthood programs, including temple and family history, missionary, welfare, home teaching, and member activation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p14" pid="nbuCzDWOEkOfex4YHzbsOg" hash="DTxMZg">Second is the <span class="emphasis">ward welfare committee.</span> It includes the priesthood executive committee plus the Relief Society presidency. This committee meets at least monthly, again under the direction of the bishop, to consider the temporal needs of ward members. Only the bishop may allocate welfare resources, but the committee helps care for the poor by planning and coordinating the use of ward resources, including the time, talents, skills, materials, and compassionate service of ward members. In this and in other committee and council meetings, delicate matters often are discussed, requiring strict confidentiality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p15" pid="VY1WfiCLgE6ApG8CI5cXYg" hash="adDtBg">The third is the <span class="emphasis">ward council.</span> It includes the priesthood executive committee; the presidents of the Relief Society, Sunday School, Young Women, and Primary; and the activities committee chairman. The bishop may invite others to attend as needed. This council meets at least monthly to correlate planning for all ward programs and activities and to review ward progress toward accomplishing the mission of the Church. The ward council brings a varied group of priesthood and women leaders together to focus on the broad range of issues that affect ward members and the community. The council reviews suggestions from home teachers and visiting teachers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p16" pid="kW6V9TTW80-B0YthEDnOvw" hash="a4JtsA">Recently, a bishop who was concerned about reverence in his ward expressed his concern to the members of the ward council and asked for their suggestions. Hesitantly, the Primary president raised her hand.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p17" pid="sDkuFtUb30i55zKPZ0909Q" hash="Pi_0IQ">“Well,” she said, “one person consistently does a lot of enthusiastic visiting in the chapel just before and after sacrament meeting. It can be pretty distracting.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p18" pid="ugtw-Kw4ikOrwV0txFOxdA" hash="Tmlrpw">The bishop had not noticed anyone being especially noisy in the chapel, but he said he would talk to the offending party. He asked the sister who it was.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p19" pid="Pn3bKQe3vEqCLu6TwcpZvA" hash="PD4ocg">She took a deep breath. “It’s you, Bishop,” she said. “I know you’re just reaching out to people, and we all appreciate your desire to greet everyone who comes to the meeting. But when others see you moving around the chapel talking to people during the prelude music, they figure it’s OK for them to do the same thing.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p20" pid="5-1_KYhGv0G5JXEsiKJ5Ug" hash="37L4EQ">When others in the ward council nodded in agreement, the bishop thanked her and asked for recommendations. The council soon decided that the bishopric, including the bishop, should be in their places on the stand five minutes before sacrament meeting to set an example of reverence in the chapel. During a follow-up discussion, the council members indicated unanimously that the simple plan had worked and that reverence in sacrament meeting had improved decidedly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p21" pid="6h36RhpD1EeiedIDyfb-Dg" hash="3ou-ng">Another bishop was concerned about the trend he noticed in ward fast and testimony meetings. Members were bearing few testimonies of Christ and His gospel; instead, they were sermonizing, giving travelogues, sharing personal experiences that were not related to the gospel, and talking about family outings and activities. The bishop understood that those topics were important to the speakers. But they were not testimonies of Christ and His gospel. He asked the ward council, “How can we teach the importance of using testimony meeting for testifying of Christ and His restored church without offending our members?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p22" pid="ANTAqF8MRUCZSkSp8CVaxA" hash="8f_7lQ">After a little time and some comments by the sisters, the council suggested that the bishop should teach the members what a testimony is and what it is not. In addition, the council concluded that the quorums and auxiliaries should discuss the purpose of testimony meeting, and home teachers and visiting teachers should review this subject with individual families during their monthly visits. The bishop now reports, “Our testimony meetings are much better. The witness of Christ and His love for us is expressed by the members, and the spirituality of our ward has improved greatly.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p23" pid="jdfsOMS0KEG06ah0qhGlQw" hash="k9aGzQ">One major concern of the General Authorities is the lack of retention in full fellowship of some new converts and those who are less active in the Church. If ward councils are functioning as they should, every new convert will be fellowshipped, will have home teachers or visiting teachers, and will receive an appropriate calling within days after baptism. The less active will receive callings that assure them that they are needed and loved by the ward members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p24" pid="HIvX4MbVCkCcnC0EEXSiHQ" hash="cVxhXw">The Brethren also have expressed “concern regarding Church members’ involvement in groups [which are often very expensive] that purport to increase self-awareness, raise self-esteem, and enhance individual agency.” Church leaders and members should not become involved in such groups. Instead, “local leaders should counsel those desiring self-improvement to anchor themselves in gospel principles and to adopt wholesome practices that strengthen one’s ability to cope with challenges” (<span class="emphasis">Bulletin,</span> 1993–2, Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1993).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p25" pid="W66EhHEiJ0SwTTZvCDzvbg" hash="OmoxMg">When stake presidents and bishops allow the priesthood and auxiliary leaders whom the Lord has called to serve with them to become part of a problem-solving team, wonderful things begin to happen. Their participation broadens the base of experience and understanding, leading to better solutions. You bishops energize your ward leaders by giving them a chance to offer suggestions and to be heard. You prepare future leaders by allowing them to participate and learn. You can lift much of the load from your shoulders through this kind of involvement. People who feel ownership of a problem are more willing to help find a solution, greatly improving the possibility of success.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p26" pid="XZ_L8uoQu0WpBtN3wuUFog" hash="SY38wQ">Once the appropriate councils are organized and the brethren and the sisters have full opportunity to contribute, ward and stake leaders can move beyond just maintaining organizations. They can focus their efforts on finding ways to make their world a better place to live. Certainly ward councils can consider such subjects as gang violence, child safety, urban blight, or community cleanup campaigns. Bishops could ask ward councils, “How can we make a difference in our community?” Such broad thinking and participation in community improvement are the right things for Latter-day Saints to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/counseling-with-our-councils.p27" pid="vikJQVB9P0um2xPy3kLBTw" hash="9l1Gpw">For the past eight and one-half years I have served as a member of a council of twelve men. We come from different backgrounds, and we bring to the Council of the Twelve Apostles a diverse assortment of experiences in the Church and in the world. In our meetings, we do not just sit around and wait for President Howard W. Hunter to tell us what to do. We counsel openly with each other, and we listen to each other with profound respect for the abilities and experiences our brethren bring to the council. We discuss a wide variety of issues, from Church administration to world events, and we do so frankly and openly. Sometimes we discuss issues for weeks before reaching a decision. We do not always agree during our discussions. But once a decision is made, we are always both united and determined.</p>

Before I escorted these prominent guests through the temple, I explained to them the position and basic doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I wanted them to know why the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith, so they could understand the divine purpose and the eternal significance of the temple. My message this morning is to remind Church members what we have and to invite nonmembers to understand the need for the restoration of the gospel.</p>

He lived only thirty-three years, and His ministry was only three years. But in those three years He taught the human family everything that is necessary to receive all of the blessings our Father in Heaven has in store for His children. He concluded His mortal ministry with the single most compassionate and significant service in the history of the world: the Atonement.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/restored-truth.p5" pid="glk8wi2QVEuBvmPxEiZuHQ" hash="561z4w">When Jesus called His twelve Apostles, He laid His hands upon them, ordained them, and conferred upon them the authority to act in His name and govern His church. Peter is commonly understood to have become the chief Apostle, or the President of the Church, after the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. Early Christians endured the challenges of persecution and hardship. Peter and his brethren had a difficult time holding the Church together and keeping the doctrine pure. They traveled extensively and wrote to one another about the problems they were facing, but information moved so slowly and the Church and its teachings were so new that heading off false teachings before they became firmly entrenched was difficult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/restored-truth.p6" pid="YzT_XjSaGEiTSAhNgPd0Jw" hash="h6cyZA">The New Testament indicates that the early Apostles worked hard to preserve the church that Jesus Christ left to their care and keeping, but they knew their efforts would ultimately be in vain. Paul wrote to the Thessalonian Saints, who were anxiously anticipating the second coming of Christ, that “that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Thes. 2:3</a>). He also warned Timothy that “the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; … And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.3-4" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 4:3–4</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/restored-truth.p7" pid="jTLPFYjm50WBhwCJinW8Ig" hash="21Fysw">And Peter presupposed the falling away, or the Apostasy, when he spoke of “the times of refreshing” that would come before God would again send Jesus Christ, who “before was preached unto you:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/restored-truth.p9" pid="ml4gC5uu_kG7tjH4WTa4FA" hash="zMqbWA">Eventually, with the known exception of John the Beloved, Peter and his fellow Apostles were martyred. The Apostle John and members of the Church struggled for survival in the face of horrifying oppression. To their everlasting credit, Christianity did survive and was truly a prominent force by the end of the second century <small>A.D.</small> Many valiant Saints were instrumental in helping Christianity to endure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/restored-truth.p10" pid="2vrI3APbtUmLmUI6acpqhA" hash="BaWDfA">Despite the significance of the ministries of these Saints, they did not hold the same apostolic authority Peter and the other Apostles had received through ordination under the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. When that authority was lost, men began looking to other sources for doctrinal understanding. As a result, many plain and precious truths were lost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/restored-truth.p11" pid="4MIbzMLvXkOnbMssw2hdNQ" hash="2yWvVg">History tells us, for example, of a great council held in <small>A.D.</small> 325 in Nicaea. By this time Christianity had emerged from the dank dungeons of Rome to become the state religion of the Roman Empire, but the church still had problems—chiefly the inability of Christians to agree among themselves on basic points of doctrine. To resolve differences, Emperor Constantine called together a group of Christian bishops to establish once and for all the official doctrines of the church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/restored-truth.p12" pid="ZY6kIcUCH0eyp23iAVQtwA" hash="PHEypA">Consensus did not come easily. Opinions on such basic subjects as the nature of God were diverse and deeply felt, and debate was spirited. Decisions were not made by inspiration or revelation, but by majority vote, and some disagreeing factions split off and formed new churches. Similar doctrinal councils were held later in <small>A.D.</small> 451, 787, and 1545, with similarly divisive results.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/restored-truth.p13" pid="29hqj1bg00uZXJR9DEvM-w" hash="iGcjqg">The beautiful simplicity of Christ’s gospel was under attack from an enemy that was even more destructive than the scourges and the crosses of early Rome: the philosophical meanderings of uninspired men. The doctrine became based more on popular opinion than on revelation. This period of time was called the Dark Ages. They were dark largely because the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ had been lost.</p>

His work led to a reformation, a movement that was taken up by such other visionaries as John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, John Wesley, and John Smith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/restored-truth.p15" pid="NH_HcuuGUUScs3_1h4kxog" hash="ClwgFw">I believe these reformers were inspired to create a religious climate in which God could restore lost truths and priesthood authority. Similarly, God inspired the earlier explorers and colonizers of America and the framers of the Constitution of the United States to develop a land and governing principles to which the gospel could be restored.</p>

Mother Smith and three of the children—Hyrum, Samuel, and Sophronia—joined one church (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.7" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:7</a>), while Father Smith and his eldest son, Alvin, affiliated with another.</p>

He knew there is “one Lord, one faith, one baptism” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.5" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:5</a>), but which was the one he did not know.</p>

While reading in the Bible, he came upon a simple, direct admonition in the epistle of James: “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/restored-truth.p22" pid="uHgPwpcobUGHXTy9GDkUtg" hash="-UUnxw">Joseph reflected: “Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.12" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:12</a>).</p>

He paused when he arrived at a quiet, secluded spot. He looked around to make sure he was alone. Then he knelt and began to pray. No sooner had he done so than an overwhelming feeling of darkness swept over him, as if some evil power was trying to dissuade him. Rather than surrender, Joseph intensified his pleas to God—and God Himself responded.</p>

It applies to everyone unconditionally as it pertains to the resurrection from temporal, or physical, death, for all shall rise from the dead with immortal bodies as a result of the Atonement. However, the Atonement is conditional as it pertains to each person’s individual sins. It touches everyone to the degree that he or she has faith in Jesus Christ, repents, and obeys the gospel. Exaltation and eternal life with God are reserved for those who keep the commandments.</p>

Obedience is essential to obtain exaltation and eternal life. King Benjamin explained that “the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe [in] Christ, … the same might receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.13" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:13</a>).</p>

For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:41</a>).</p>

Sometimes I wonder if we really appreciate what that means and how it should affect our lives. We must give adequate attention to the doctrines of happiness—real happiness, infinite and eternal. They should be the objective of everything we teach in the Church and of everything we do.</p>

Our present mortal state places a veil of forgetfulness over our minds, allowing us to prove ourselves able to “do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.25" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:25</a>). But even though our present long-range view of eternity is limited, the Lord has not left us without direction. He has provided scriptures and Apostles and prophets through whom he has revealed his plan for our exaltation and eternal life. And we have the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, to guide us.</p>

A person does not have to spend much time in the schoolroom of mortality to realize that Heavenly Father’s plan does not provide for blissful happiness at every step along our mortal journey. Life is filled with harsh realities that tug at the heart and tear away at the soul.</p>

I can understand why someone who lacks an eternal perspective might see the horrifying news footage of starving children and man’s inhumanity to man and shake a fist at the heavens and cry, “If there is a God, how could he allow such things to happen?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/answers-to-lifes-questions.p17" pid="WNZ7oVRvLECs6M3bquiXhA" hash="vjOVmg">The answer is not easy, but it isn’t that complicated, either. God has put his plan in motion. It proceeds through natural laws that are, in fact, God’s laws. Since they are his, he is bound by them, as are we. I recognize for purposes we mortals may not understand, the Lord can control the elements. For the most part, however, he does not cause but he allows nature to run its course. In this imperfect world, bad things sometimes happen. The earth’s rocky underpinnings occasionally shift and move, resulting in earthquakes. Certain weather patterns cause hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and drought.</p>

Men’s hearts turn cold, and the spirit of Satan controls their actions. In foreseeing the day of suffering in our time, the Savior said, “The love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:27</a>). Violence, immorality, and other evils run rampant on the earth. Much adversity has its origin in the principle of agency.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/answers-to-lifes-questions.p19" pid="uUmzSJdOMEi0sjA-5EmccQ" hash="PsKzrw">We tend to think of agency as a personal matter. If we ask someone to define “moral agency,” the answer will probably be something like this: “Moral agency means I am free to make choices for myself.” Often overlooked is the fact that choices have consequences; we forget also that agency offers the same privilege of choice to others. At times we will be affected adversely by the way other people choose to exercise their agency. Our Heavenly Father feels so strongly about protecting our agency that he allows his children to exercise it, either for good or for evil.</p>

If the world would embrace and live it, peace, joy, and plenty would abound on the earth. Much of the suffering we know today would be eliminated if people throughout the world would understand and live the gospel.</p>

But if we know and understand Heavenly Father’s plan, we realize that dealing with adversity is one of the chief ways we are tested. Our faith in our Heavenly Father and his beloved Son, Jesus Christ, is the source of inner strength. Through faith we can find peace, comfort, and the courage to endure. As we trust in God and his plan for our happiness with all our hearts and lean not unto our own understanding (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 3:5</a>), hope is born. Hope grows out of faith and gives meaning and purpose to all we do. It can give us comfort in the face of adversity, strength in times of trial, and peace when we have reason for doubt or anguish.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/answers-to-lifes-questions.p22" pid="TJkPE8wGsk6r0ZgGHdping" hash="XpLD8A">By focusing on and living the principles of Heavenly Father’s plan for our eternal happiness, we can separate ourselves from the wickedness of the world. If we are anchored to the correct understanding of who we are, why we are here on this earth, and where we can go after this mortal life, Satan cannot threaten our happiness through any form of temptation. If we are determined to live by Heavenly Father’s plan, we will use our God-given moral agency to make decisions based on revealed truth, not on the opinions of others or on the current thinking of the world.</p>

With fiber-optic computer technology, it can link homes to an incredible assortment of messages and influences. This highway will be the conduit of information that will have the power to change our culture and, thus, our very lives. As we consider the importance of nourishing our intellects with the promising potential of Superhighway resources, we must be ever cautious about the choices of programs and the impact of media in our lives. Those who understand our Heavenly Father’s eternal plan for the joy and happiness of his children will be better prepared to make good choices as the Information Superhighway rolls across the world. The computer, television, satellite, microchip, and even the telephone, all can bless and enhance our lives—or can make them miserable.</p>

If we truly believe that we are his children and are here on earth to learn to live, by faith, the teachings and the commandments of God and his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, we will make the choices that will qualify us to one day return to live in their presence.</p>

Those who live according to Heavenly Father’s eternal plan will not want to absorb any information that is illicit or untoward, nor will they destroy their spiritual sensitivity through immoral acts or the consumption of any harmful substances. Neither will they search for doctrinal loopholes to find reasons to challenge the ordained leadership of the Church nor tamper with the simple truths of the gospel. They will not attempt to justify any lifestyle that is contrary to the plan of happiness. If they do any of these things, they will never find the inner peace and joy that living the gospel brings. All of our Father’s children can seek prayerfully to know who they are and can find real happiness if they obey God’s commandments and endure to the end. President Howard W. Hunter said:</p>

May we learn to accept with faith the doctrines and teachings of the gospel and accept the plan of salvation with believing hearts and minds. Always know, brothers and sisters, that the leaders of the Church understand and accept the gospel plan and will defend it at all times and in all places.</p>

May we search for the doctrines and commandments of the great plan of happiness; and when we learn them, may we embrace them willingly. By doing so we will find lasting joy, happiness, and peace. Jesus said, “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>).</p>

After undergoing heart-bypass surgery two months ago, I am grateful to be able to stand anywhere. I have felt the powerful faith and prayers of Church members exercised in my behalf these past months, for which I express my sincere appreciation. I have been greatly blessed and publicly express humble gratitude to my Heavenly Father.</p>

Some people have suggested this may have contributed to my heart problems. I don’t know about that, but I do know that our tour of these locations filled our souls with an ever greater love and respect for the Prophet Joseph Smith, for his family, and for the stalwarts who first embraced the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and became members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. What an extraordinary experience it was to teach my family from the Doctrine and Covenants while standing on the very ground where many of those revelations and instructions were received.</p>

The clarity of our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ and his restored church is precious, empowering knowledge for each one of us. I thank God that in these difficult days of moral decay and departure from sound values, we have no shortage of revealed truth to guide our lives.</p>

I do not recommend the course of action that brought this gift of time to me, but I believe all of us would benefit from time to ponder and meditate. In the quiet moments of personal introspection, the Spirit can teach us much.</p>

We can derive great strength, particularly our youth, from understanding our Church history. As a descendant of Hyrum Smith, I feel a solemn obligation to ensure that the Church never forgets the significant ministry of this great leader. Recognizing that no one save Jesus only excels the singular accomplishment of the Prophet Joseph, I am stirred within my soul to remember and respect the valiant life and remarkable contributions of his older brother, the patriarch Hyrum.</p>

This venerable patriarch was dying and wanted to leave his blessing on his beloved wife and children. Hyrum, the eldest living son, asked his father to intercede with heaven when he arrived there so the enemies of the Church “may not have so much power” over the Latter-day Saints. Father Smith then laid his hands upon Hyrum’s head and blessed him to have “peace … sufficient … to accomplish the work which God has given you to do.” Knowing of Hyrum’s lifelong faithfulness, he concluded this last blessing with the promise that Hyrum would “be as firm as the pillars of heaven unto the end of [his] days.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

More than anything else, he was “firm as the pillars of heaven.” Throughout Hyrum’s life, the forces of evil combined against him in an attempt to defeat him or at least to prompt him to stray off course.</p>

At the same time, he assisted and served his brother, Joseph the Prophet, throughout the long and arduous process of the Restoration. Ultimately, he joined Joseph and other martyrs of past gospel dispensations. His blood was shed as his final testimony to the world.</p>

He knew the course his life would take, and he consciously chose to follow it. To Joseph, Hyrum became companion, protector, provider, confidant, and eventually joined him as a martyr. Unjust persecution engulfed them throughout their lives. Although he was older, Hyrum recognized his brother’s divine mantle. While he gave Joseph strong counsel on occasion, Hyrum always deferred to his younger brother.</p>

In 1829, he was among a handful of individuals who were allowed to view the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, and for the rest of his life he testified to the divine nature of the Book of Mormon as one of the Eight Witnesses who “had seen the plates with his eyes and handled them with his hands.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> He was among the first to be baptized in this gospel dispensation. At age thirty, he was the oldest of the six men chosen in 1830 to formally organize The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 1831, he stood before the Ohio conference and pledged “that all he had was the Lord’s and he was ready to do his will continually.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> In 1833, when the Lord chastised the Church for delaying the start of the Kirtland Temple, Hyrum was the first to start digging its foundation. As chairman of the temple committee, Hyrum rallied the Church to perform the seemingly impossible task of building the Kirtland Temple when most Church members literally had nothing to give to the cause. A few years later he repeated this service with the building of the Nauvoo Temple.</p>

During one mission, traveling from Kirtland to Indiana, he endured one of his greatest trials when his first wife, Jerusha, died soon after giving birth to his sixth child. Hyrum’s mother, Lucy Mack Smith, wrote that Jerusha’s death “wrung our hearts with more than common grief. … She was a woman whom everybody loved.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

I believe God rewarded his faithfulness by bringing into his life one of the great women of Church history, Mary Fielding, whom he subsequently married. Together they built an extraordinary legacy of love and discipleship.</p>

But sadly, many Church members know little about him except that he was martyred with his brother in Carthage Jail. That is significant, but he did far more. Indeed, Joseph Smith himself once suggested that his followers would do well to pattern their lives after Hyrum’s.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> May I suggest a few examples from Hyrum’s life that we may wish to follow.</p>

He asked Joseph to inquire of the Lord what he should do. In section 11 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read the Lord’s response: “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word. … Study my word which hath gone forth … , and also study my word … which is now translating.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/hyrum-smith-firm-as-the-pillars-of-heaven.p18" pid="vLq-ulXRK0ifm3rNf9X7dA" hash="D50Ebw">Hyrum’s life is a witness to his obedience to this instruction. To the very last day of his life, he devoted himself to obtaining the word through study of the scriptures. In Carthage Jail, he read and commented on extracts from the Book of Mormon. The scriptures were obviously part of Hyrum’s being, and he turned to them during times when he needed comfort and strength the most.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/hyrum-smith-firm-as-the-pillars-of-heaven.p19" pid="Jam1l-J9GE6GVd_j4amNOg" hash="06CGFA">Just think of the spiritual strength we could gain in our lives and how much more effective we would be as teachers, missionaries, and friends if we studied the scriptures regularly. I am sure we, like Hyrum, will be able to endure our greatest trials if we search the word of God as he did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/hyrum-smith-firm-as-the-pillars-of-heaven.p20" pid="wqgrDCWreEmmEkRhkFVihg" hash="xtR0cA">The second great example from Hyrum’s life that we may wish to follow occurred very early in the Restoration. According to Lucy Mack Smith, when young Joseph first told the rest of the family about his experience in the Sacred Grove, Hyrum and all the others received the message “joyfully.” The family sat “in a circle, … giving the most profound attention to a boy … who had never read the Bible through in his life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> In contrast to the reaction of Laman and Lemuel to their younger brother Nephi’s divine calling and to the jealousy of the older brothers of Joseph who was sold into Egypt, there was no jealousy or animosity in Hyrum Smith. Instead, real faith was born in him of the simple and joyful response he felt to the spiritual truth of his brother’s message. The Lord let him know in his heart what was right, and he followed Joseph—faithfully—for the rest of his life.</p>

For him, hearing the truth from Joseph’s lips and feeling the spiritual promptings whispering that it was true were enough. Faith to believe was the source of Hyrum’s spiritual strength and is the source of the spiritual strength of faithful members of the Church then and today. We do not need more members who question every detail; we need members who have felt with their hearts, who live close to the Spirit, and who follow its promptings joyfully. We need seeking hearts and minds that welcome gospel truths without argument or complaint and without requiring miraculous manifestation. Oh, how we are blessed when members respond joyfully to counsel from their bishops, stake presidents, quorum or auxiliary leaders, some of whom might be younger than they and less experienced. What great blessings we receive when we follow “that which is right” joyfully and not grudgingly.</p>

His mother commented on this quality, saying that he was “rather remarkable for his tenderness and sympathy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> When Joseph was afflicted with severe pain in his leg, Hyrum relieved his mother and sat beside Joseph almost twenty-four hours a day for more than a week.</p>

The Prophet Joseph was known to say that “if Hyrum could not make peace between two who had fallen out, the angels themselves might not hope to accomplish the task.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

Are we sensitive to the concerns of those who need special attention? Are we aware of families who are struggling spiritually or emotionally and who need our love, encouragement, and support? Hyrum’s example of selfless service could be a powerful influence in the world today if enough of us choose to follow it.</p>

Here Hyrum, Joseph, and a few others suffered exposure to cold, hunger, inhumane treatment, and the loneliness of isolation from friends. In this schoolhouse jail, Hyrum learned the lesson of patience in adversity and affliction. In the midst of this most severe trial, his primary concern was not for himself and his companions but for his family. In a letter to his wife, Hyrum wrote that the “greatest part of my trouble” was wondering how she and the family were doing. “When I think of your trouble my heart is weighed down with sorrow. … But what can I do … thy will be done O Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

I see members suffering from debilitating health concerns. I see husbands, wives, and parents living in trying circumstances they cannot change regarding their spouses or their children. Every one of us is faced at times with unpleasant situations, adversity, and affliction that we cannot change. Many circumstances can only be addressed with time, tears, prayer, and faith. For us, like Hyrum, peace may only come when we bring ourselves to say, “but what can I do … thy will be done O Lord.”</p>

I thought once again of the special fast by Church members worldwide in 1985. It provided approximately six million dollars to relieve suffering and hunger primarily in drought-stricken Ethiopia. Brother Glenn L. Pace and I witnessed firsthand the fruits of generous contributions by Church members when the First Presidency assigned us to go to Africa, assess the needs of the people, and recommend how to make the best use of these special funds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/feasting-at-the-lords-table.p4" pid="JMmpmgaC8Ummhb2NyiIUCg" hash="V1Akxg">We visited refugee camps in that arid country. The land was as barren as any I had ever seen. We visited Red Cross centers and field hospitals where the desperately ill were being cared for. Such dreadful, pitiful suffering broke our hearts. We saw sick mothers lying on cots trying to feed and comfort their children, many of whom had the sunken eyes and pencil-thin arms and legs of those in the advanced stages of starvation. This was one of the most heart-wrenching experiences of my life. I had never seen anything that touched my heart so deeply as the anxious yearning for food and nourishment that I saw there.</p>

Sadly, most of them have no idea where to find real spiritual nourishment. They wander to and fro—another form of pathetic refugees. Those who yearn for true spiritual light and knowledge can only find it through the power of the Holy Ghost. The Spirit enlightens and gives understanding of the eternal purposes of life. By the Spirit, Church members know the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is true. We should, therefore, feel compelled to share our spiritual knowledge with all of our Father’s children by inviting them to pull a chair up to the Lord’s table and feast on the words of Christ.</p>

We must “hunger and thirst after righteousness”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> before we can be filled. We need to cultivate spiritual strength within ourselves before we can ever hope to engender it in others. Individual, personal testimony of gospel truth, particularly the divine life and mission of the Lord Jesus Christ, is essential to our eternal life. “And this is life eternal,” said the Savior, “that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> In other words, life eternal is predicated upon our own individual, personal knowledge of our Father in Heaven and His Holy Son. Simply knowing about them is not enough. We must have personal, spiritual experiences to anchor us. These come through seeking them in the same intense, single-minded way that a hungry person seeks food.</p>

Once we have nourished ourselves with the good word of Christ and feasted personally at His table so that our testimony is strong and vibrant, we are obligated to join with the missionaries in a balanced effort to invite others—beginning with our families—to the spiritual banquet. As the Lord said to His beloved Apostle Peter, “When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> And again speaking to Peter, the Savior asked: “Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

Feeding the Lord’s sheep requires each of us to awaken our interest in others. The duty to invite others to partake of the gospel feast does not rest only on the shoulders of the missionaries. That sober and significant duty belongs to each member of the Church, for “it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

He asks us to see the spiritual hunger around us and to respond by willingly sharing our abundance. No power on earth can accomplish as much as one righteous man or woman or boy or girl.</p>

The family is the basic unit of society; the best place for individuals to build faith and strong testimonies is in righteous homes filled with love. Love for our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ is greatly enhanced when the gospel is taught and lived in the home. True principles of eternal life are embedded in the hearts and souls of young and old alike when scriptures are read and discussed, when prayers are offered morning and night, and where reverence for God and obedience to Him are modeled in everyday conduct. Just as the best meals are home cooked, the most nourishing gospel instruction takes place at home. Strong, faithful families have the best opportunity to produce strong, faithful members of the Church. The recent proclamation to the world on the family issued by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles makes very clear that the family is ordained of God. The proclamation warns that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/feasting-at-the-lords-table.p18" pid="EoQhFnObEUiPhkD2OqC1UA" hash="Z3bX3g">The family is where the foundation of personal, spiritual growth is built and nurtured; the Church, then, is the scaffolding that helps support and strengthen the family. While the Church is secondary to the family in teaching gospel principles, much spiritual learning and growth come through the Church. For example, carefully planned sacrament meetings should be a spiritual feast in which we worship and learn of our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Bishops, if your sacrament meetings are less than a banquet of spiritual nourishment, I urge you to invite suggestions from your ward council, especially the sisters, on ways to make every sacrament meeting a more reverent, spiritual experience. Let the council also help teach our members that the chapel is a special place in our buildings where we come in a spirit of respect for God and reverence for His holy Son. Let the quiet, peaceful promptings of the Holy Spirit abide in our worship services, causing spiritual enlightenment and nourishment to flow into our lives.</p>

Not long ago I experienced the kind of faith and spiritual strength the gospel provides when an 18-year-old sister, who was fighting for her life in a battle with cancer, asked me for a blessing. She said: “Brother Ballard, I am not afraid to die. I would like to live. There are things I would still like to accomplish in this life, but I know that Jesus is my Savior and my Redeemer. During these past few years He has become my best friend. I trust Him, and I trust you as His representative. Whatever He wants for me, I am prepared.”</p>

Likewise, young women need to prepare to make and keep sacred covenants and receive temple ordinances. Making and keeping sacred covenants in the house of the Lord is the most delicious course at the Lord’s table. It is the ultimate, satisfying spiritual feast of the gospel of Jesus Christ in mortality; it has eternal consequences. Our living prophet has expressed his great vision of those who qualify for temple ordinances, keep temple covenants, and serve regularly in the house of the Lord:</p>

In 1997 the Church will celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley. During the sesquicentennial year, Church members worldwide will have the opportunity to focus their attention on the pioneer trek from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley. The theme for the sesquicentennial celebration is “Faith in Every Footstep.”</p>

I wondered why our dedicated ancestors suffered so terribly and yet willingly faced such tremendous obstacles. Perhaps one reason they sacrificed and endured was to leave a legacy of faith for all of us to help us feel our urgent responsibility to move forward in building up the Church throughout the world. We need the same dedication today in every one of our footsteps as the pioneers had in theirs.</p>

Smith, who walked the pioneer trail to Utah as a nine-year-old boy, said in the April 1904 general conference, “I firmly believe [that] the divine approval, blessing and favor of Almighty God … has guided the destiny of His people from the organization of the Church until the present … and guided us in our footsteps and in our journeyings into the tops of these mountains.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Our pioneer ancestors sacrificed virtually all they had, including their lives in many cases, to follow a prophet of God to this chosen valley.</p>

As chairman of the Church sesquicentennial committee, I ask you stake and ward leaders to place the Church sesquicentennial celebration on your next council meeting agenda. Please study the guidelines sent to you in January 1995 and the additional information sent in intervening months. In your councils, choose the activities that will be appropriate and important to ensure a spiritually fulfilling experience for your members in 1997.</p>

Some even arrived barefoot after having suffered extreme hardships in traversing over 1,300 miles of prairie, desert, and mountain wilderness. Before the railroad reached the Utah Territory in 1869, approximately 70,000 pioneers, 9,600 wagons, and 650 handcarts made the trek from Winter Quarters in present-day Iowa and Nebraska to the Salt Lake Valley.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Each pioneer who walked from the Mississippi River to the Great Salt Lake took millions of steps to travel that distance. Under favorable circumstances, the trek took a little more than three months. Traveling 15 miles in a day was considered a good day. In total, billions of footsteps of faith were taken by our pioneers.</p>

Joseph F. Smith related: “My team leaders’ names were Thom and Joe—we raised them from calves, and they were both white. Thom was trim built, active, young, and more intelligent than many a man. Many times while traveling sandy or rough roads, on long, thirsty drives, my oxen were lowing with the heat and fatigue. I would put my arms around Thom’s neck and cry bitter tears! That was all I could do. Thom was my favorite and best and most willing and obedient servant and friend.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Nearly four years earlier, in August of 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith shared his foreknowledge of the trek west: “I prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains, many would apostatize, others would be put to death by our persecutors or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or disease, and some [would live to] build cities and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Near Mount Pisgah, one of the communities the Saints established in Iowa, Wilford Woodruff recorded: “I stopped my carriage [and] had a most splendid view.

Willie and Edward Martin, left later in the year than planned, and they encountered early winter storms in present-day Wyoming.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Peter Howard McBride, then but a boy of six years, was a member of the Martin Company. His father, after helping push handcarts through the icy river, died in the snow and freezing cold that night. Peter’s mother was sick; his older sister, Jenetta, watched out for the younger children. Her shoes had worn out, and her feet left bloody tracks in the snow. On the banks of the Sweetwater River, the wind blew their tent down during the night. Everyone scampered out as the snow covered the tent—everyone except little Peter. According to his account: “In the morning I heard someone say, ‘How many are dead in this tent?’ My sister said, ‘Well, my little brother must be frozen to death in that tent.’ So they jerked the tent loose, sent it scurrying over the snow. My hair was frozen to the tent. I picked myself up and came out quite alive, to their surprise.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

Jens, a relatively prosperous Danish farmer, heeded the call to bring his family to Zion. In Iowa he wrote that he had let all of his money go to the Church except enough to buy a handcart and stock it with 15 pounds of belongings per person. Jens wrote, “Obedience is better than sacrifice.” The people for whom Jens was responsible were himself; his wife, Elsie; their six-year-old son, Neils; and a nine-year-old girl, Bodil Mortensen, whom Jens offered to take to Utah. In the early Wyoming blizzard, temperatures plummeted below zero. The Neilsons had consumed their last pound of flour days before, but somehow they made it over the treacherous Rocky Ridge, urged on by their indomitable courage and unconquerable faith. Tragically, 13 of the company died at Rock Creek and were buried in shallow, snow-covered graves—among them, Jens and Elsie’s son, Neils, and young Bodil Mortensen.</p>

He was unable to walk another step and pleaded with Elsie, “Leave me by the trail in the snow to die, and you go ahead and try to keep up with the company and save your life.” Elsie, with her unfaltering pioneer courage, replied, “Ride, I can’t leave you, I can pull the cart.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Such was the strength and the faith of many pioneer women on the trail.</p>

After the trial of our faith, He once again shines the light ahead of us, and our journey of faith in every footstep continues. Now, it has swelled into billions and billions of footsteps throughout the world. In my 20 years as a General Authority, I have seen the worldwide expansion of the Church, and I marvel at the results of the work of our pioneers in every country where they, through their faith and sacrifice, established the Church. I share the feelings of President Heber J. Grant, who said, “I can never think of [the pioneers] but I am full of admiration and gratitude, and utter a prayer to the Lord to help me, as one of the descendants of that noble band, to be loyal, to be true, to be faithful as they were!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

We must be sure that the legacy of faith received from them is never lost. Let their heroic lives touch our hearts, and especially the hearts of our youth, so the fire of true testimony and unwavering love for the Lord and His Church will blaze brightly within each one of us as it did in our faithful pioneers. Their accomplishments were possible because they knew, as I know, that our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, restored the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith and that this Church will continue to roll forth until it fills the whole earth. To this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

It is wonderful to note that the wards and stakes are using the yearlong pioneer sesquicentennial celebration as an opportunity to honor the Utah pioneers of 1847 as well as the remarkable efforts of our pioneers in every land who have blazed spiritual trails with faith in every one of their footsteps.</p>

They left their homes, their temple, and in some cases their families, in search of a place of refuge where they could worship without fear of persecution. There was little that they could carry with them in the way of provisions and material possessions, but each wagon and handcart was heavily laden with faith—faith in God, faith in the Restoration of His Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and faith that God knew where they were going and that He would see them through.</p>

That is what makes them Saints. They were a band of believers who tried to do the right thing for the right reasons, ordinary men and women who were called on to perform an extraordinary work. At times, they gave in to discouragement and allowed themselves to murmur and complain. But ultimately their faith in God and the man they sustained as their prophet and leader prevailed, and they righted their vision and attitudes along with their wagons. In the process they found joy amid the hardships and trials of the trek.</p>

He wrote: “Although we are … distant from each other I do not forget you. … But to the praise of God be it spoken, all I have endured has never hurt or discouraged me, but done me good. … We have sometimes been almost suffocated with heat … , sometimes almost froze with cold. We have had to sleep on boards, instead of feathers. … We have had our clothes wet through with no privilege of drying them or changing them, … had to sleep … out of doors, in very severe weather, and many such things which you [have] no idea of. … [Yet] we have been … healthy &amp; cheerful. … If you will be faithful,<span class="emphasis"> you have nothing to fear from the journey.</span> The Lord will take care of his saints.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

I believe there is. The faith that motivated the pioneers of 1847 as well as pioneers in other lands was a simple faith centered in the basic doctrines of the restored gospel, which they knew to be true. That’s all that mattered to them, and I believe that is all that should matter to us. Our faith needs to be focused on the fundamental truths that God lives, that we are His children, and that Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten Son and He is our Savior. We need to know that they restored the Church to the earth in its fulness through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Through the restored gospel of Jesus Christ we learn that our Father’s plan for the happiness of His children is clear and quite simple when studied and accepted with real faith.</p>

Nearly every day our missionaries arrive in countries where they have little knowledge of the language and where the food, culture, and living conditions are often much different from that which they are accustomed to. And yet they go boldly as modern pioneers, not fearing the journey, walking with faith in every footstep to bring to people everywhere the good news of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

No matter how difficult the trail, and regardless of how heavy our load, we can take comfort in knowing that others before us have borne life’s most grievous trials and tragedies by looking to heaven for peace, comfort, and hopeful assurance. We can know as they knew that God is our Father, that He cares about us individually and collectively, and that as long as we continue to exercise our faith and trust in Him there is nothing to fear in the journey. Like the pioneers of 1847 who ventured west along a trail that kept them relatively close to life-sustaining fresh water from rivers, particularly the Platte and the Sweetwater, we need to follow and partake of the Living Water of Christ to refresh our faith and sustain our efforts as we travel the road through mortality.</p>

At some point in our journey we may feel much as the pioneers did as they crossed Iowa—up to our knees in mud, forced to bury some of our dreams along the way. We all face rocky ridges, with the wind in our face and winter coming on too soon. Sometimes it seems as though there is no end to the dust that stings our eyes and clouds our vision. Sharp edges of despair and discouragement jut out of the terrain to slow our passage. Always, there is a Devil’s Gate, which will swing wide open to lure us in. Those who are wise and faithful will steer a course as far from such temptation as possible, while others—sometimes those who are nearest and dearest to us—succumb to the attraction of ease, comfort, convenience, and rest. Occasionally we reach the top of one summit in life, as the pioneers did, only to see more mountain peaks ahead, higher and more challenging than the one we have just traversed. Tapping unseen reservoirs of faith and endurance, we, as did our forebears, inch ever forward toward that day when our voices can join with those of all pioneers who have endured in faith, singing: “All is well! All is well!” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 30).</p>

How will they feel about us? Will they see faith in our footsteps? I believe they will, particularly as they view our lives and experiences from the expanded perspective of eternity. Although our journeys today are less demanding physically than the trek of our pioneers 150 years ago, they are no less challenging. Certainly it was hard to walk across a continent to establish a new home in a dry western desert. But who can say if that was any more difficult than is the task of living faithful, righteous lives in today’s confusingly sinful world, where the trail is constantly shifting and where divine markers of right and wrong are being replaced by political expediency and diminishing morality. The road we travel today is treacherous, and the scriptures tell us it will continue to be so until the very end. But our reward will be the same as that which awaits worthy pioneers of all ages who live faithfully the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ, make right choices, and give their all to build the kingdom of God on earth.</p>

Now it is our privilege and responsibility to be part of the Restoration’s continuing drama, and there are great and heroic stories of faith to be written in our day. It will require every bit of our strength, wisdom, and energy to overcome the obstacles that will confront us. But even that will not be enough. We will learn, as did our pioneer ancestors, that it is only in faith—<span class="emphasis">real</span> faith, whole-souled, tested and tried—that we will find safety and confidence as we walk our own perilous pathways through life.</p>

While we all can appreciate the footsteps of faith walked by Joseph Smith and his followers from Palmyra to Carthage Jail and across the Great Plains, we should ever stand in reverential awe as we contemplate the path trod by the Master. His faithful footsteps to Gethsemane and to Calvary rescued all of us and opened the way for us to return to our heavenly home.</p>

Looking down at the Sweetwater where the Willie Company was stranded, cold and starving, we read from their journals of the joy of their rescue. As John Chislett wrote: “Just as the sun was sinking beautifully behind the distant hills, … several covered wagons … were seen coming towards us. The news ran through the camp like wildfire. … Shouts of joy rent the air; strong men wept till tears ran freely down their furrowed and sun-burnt cheeks. … That evening, for the first time in quite a period, the songs of Zion were to be heard in the camp. … With the cravings of hunger satisfied, and with hearts filled with gratitude to God and our good brethren, we all united in prayer, and then retired to rest.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

For it is through Him that we have promise of eternal life. Our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the source of spiritual power that will give you and me the assurance that we have nothing to fear from the journey. I know the Lord Jesus Christ lives, and our unwavering faith in Him will see us safely along our journey through life, to which I humbly testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Brethren, holding the priesthood is more than just a great blessing. It also carries with it significant responsibilities such as watching over the Church; honoring all women, especially our wives, our mothers, our daughters, our sisters; visiting the home of each member, exhorting each “to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> and to “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

It may not always be easy, convenient, or politically correct to stand for truth and right, but it is always the right thing to do. Always.</p>

As he traveled from California to his home in Utah, he was confronted one morning by a “wagonload of profane drunks … , shooting their guns, yelling wildly, and cursing the Mormons.” One of the drunks, “waving a pistol,” came toward him. Although Joseph “was terrified, he felt it would be unwise and useless to run … , and so he advanced toward the gunman as if he found nothing out of the ordinary in his conduct. ‘Are you a — — — Mormon?’ the stranger demanded. Mustering all the composure he could, Joseph answered evenly while looking the man straight in the eye, ‘Yes, siree; dyed in the wool; true blue, through and through.’ Almost stunned by this wholly unexpected response, the gunman stopped, dropped his hands to his sides, and, after looking incredulously at Joseph for a moment, said in a subdued tone, ‘Well, you are the — — pleasantest man I ever met! Shake. I am glad to see a fellow stand for his convictions.’ So saying, he turned and walked away.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Every day our neighborhoods and communities are in desperate need of our support and our commitment to safety and law and order. Crime, in all its pervasive manifestations, is a serious worldwide evil and a moral problem about which Church leaders have great concern. The social, economic, and moral costs of crime are incalculable. It is no respecter of race, religion, nationality, age, culture, or socioeconomic status.</p>

Among today’s secret combinations are gangs, drug cartels, and organized crime families. The secret combinations of our day function much like the Gadianton robbers of the Book of Mormon times. They have secret signs and code words. They participate in secret rites and initiation ceremonies. Among their purposes are to “murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country and also the laws of their God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Our young men and young women see it all around them. There is an entire subculture that celebrates contemporary gangs and their criminal conduct with music, clothing styles, language, attitudes, and behaviors. Many of you have watched as trendy friends have embraced the style as something that was “fashionable” and “cool,” only to be dragged into the subculture because of their identification with gangs. We’ve all heard the tragic stories of unsuspecting wanna-bes who have been victimized by gangs simply because they were wearing the wrong color in the wrong neighborhood.</p>

Parents bear the first and greatest responsibility to teach their children principles of gospel living and good citizenship. There are, however, those who have little or no support at home. We need to be aware of them and do all we can to bless their lives. They need positive role models who demonstrate integrity by honoring their covenants and keeping their promises.</p>

Yet we need to be positive examples if we are to help others find a better way. Thankfully, we can draw strength from those who have gone before us.

No person could object, therefore, to the practices of whittling and whistling. Many of the boys of the city had each a large bowie knife made, and when a man came to town who was known to be a villain, and was there for evil purposes, a few of them would get together, and go to where the obnoxious person was, and having previously provided themselves with pine shingles, would commence whittling. The presence of a number of boys, each [harmlessly] whittling … was not a sight to escape the notice of a stranger. … His first [reaction] … would be to … ask what this meant. The boys would make no reply, but with grave faces, keep up their [harmless] whistling. … What could the man do? If he was armed, he could shoot; but the resolute expression of the boys’ faces, and the gleaming knives … would convince him that discretion was the better part of valor. … The most we ever knew them to do was to stand for awhile and curse and threaten. … Then they would walk off … , followed by the troop of boys vigorously whittling and whistling.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

But I am suggesting that George Q. Cannon and his youthful associates exhibited great courage and faith by their actions. They saw something that needed to be done, and they did it safely within the context of what was appropriate for the times. I’m impressed by their willingness to take a stand against wicked intentions of others.</p>

However, there are some simple things that we can do in our day to prevent others from drifting toward gangs and crime. We can avoid the temptation of being cliquish at school or at church. All of us can refrain from finding fault or alienating anyone by our words or actions. Nothing is more hurtful than to feel left out or made fun of. Therefore, we must never do anything that may drive others toward being accepted by a gang because they feel rejected by us. Many new families are moving in among us. Brethren, reach out the hand of friendship and make everyone feel welcome and secure in our neighborhoods and in our Church. Guard against spreading rumors or saying unkind things or allowing anything to occur that may hurt another. Make friends with your neighbors, watch out for each other, and help build a spirit of unity, peace, and love among them. These may seem like small things, but I assure you, if we do these kinds of things, they may be every bit as effective in keeping people away from evil and crime as whittling and whistling were in the days of Nauvoo. True friendship may well be the best thing that we can do to help reach those who may be drifting toward unsafe and morally damaging activities and counterfeit forms of belonging.</p>

Unfortunately, there are also stories of those who fell short of their potential because they were unwilling to take such a stand for truth and right. Some young men and young women have rationalized their bad choices, saying that “we all make mistakes.” But you must understand that there is a big difference between an honest mistake made in a moment of spiritual weakness and a willful decision to disobey persistently the commandments of God. Those who deliberately choose to violate God’s commandments or ignore the standards of the Church, even when promising themselves and others that someday they will be strong enough to repent, are stepping onto a dangerously slippery slope upon which many have lost their spiritual footing. While it is true that some young people have made remarkable recoveries from sin through the process of repentance, the sad reality is that others have lost their way because of the paths they have chosen to follow.</p>

In some respects, it is perhaps the most challenging age of all time. We want you young men to know that we are aware of that. But we are also aware that God has reserved some of His strongest spirit children for these perilous days. While God’s laws and standards of right and wrong are under attack at every turn, we are a great army of priesthood holders who are prepared to make a valiant stand for truth and right. Brethren, let us stand, shoulder to shoulder, as bearers of the priesthood of God and as followers of Christ and do what we can to make this a better, safer, and happier world. Let us be “witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places,” I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Often others were present with him when revelations were received, and they bore witness of the Spirit and the outward manifestations that were present on these occasions. Typically, they spoke of a whiteness or a brightness that surrounded Joseph. For example, as the 76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants was given, Philo Dibble wrote that Joseph “seemed to be dressed in an element of glorious white, and his face shone as if it were transparent.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> And Brigham Young testified that “those who were acquainted with [Joseph] knew when the Spirit of revelation was upon him, for his countenance wore an expression peculiar to himself while under that influence. He preached by the Spirit of revelation, and taught in his council by it, and those who were acquainted with him could discover it at once, for at such times there was a peculiar clearness and transparency in his face.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Said Parley P. Pratt: “Each sentence was uttered slowly and very distinctly, and with a pause between each, sufficiently long for it to be recorded, by an ordinary writer, in long hand. … There was never any hesitation, reviewing or reading back, in order to keep the run of the subject; neither did any of these communications undergo revisions, interlinings or corrections. As he dictated them so they stood, so far as I have witnessed; and I was present to witness the dictation of several communications of several pages each.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

They understood more than anyone else the limitations of his formal education and natural ability. Consequently, they had the clearest view of the miraculous way God spoke through His living prophet.</p>

Pratt’s in that she continued to be amazed at the process through which revelations came. Years after the Prophet’s death she said: “I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, [Joseph] would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he could at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

Through revelation we have received the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price, which contain the words of God to us, His children. Oh, how marvelous are the revelations we have received from the Lord! I have often said either Joseph Smith was the Lord’s instrument by which the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness was accomplished, or he was not. There is no possible compromise of this doctrine. I raise my voice to the whole world in testimony that I know without reservation or question that Joseph Smith opened this dispensation through divine revelation and began the restoration to the earth of the true Church of Jesus Christ.</p>

As he and Sidney Rigdon prayed to understand the resurrection of the just and the unjust, this glorious vision—or actually a series of six visions—burst upon them. Joseph and Sidney literally conversed with the Lord for about an hour and a half as the Savior showed them what Joseph later described as “eternity sketch’d in a vision from God, / Of what was, and now is, and yet is to be.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> As it commenced, the two men viewed the glory of the Son of God on the right hand of the Father and were moved to exclaim: “And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</p>

They then saw the sons of perdition and what will become of them in the eternal worlds. Next, they viewed visions of the celestial, terrestrial, and telestial kingdoms, and they learned the requirements for attaining each of these kingdoms and the differences in glory of each respectively. They learned that those who qualify for celestial glory “shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

For more than an hour, the Lord showed them our premortal life, earth life, and life after death. As a result of that revelation, mankind’s understanding of Heavenly Father’s plan for our eternal happiness and peace was expanded and enhanced to a remarkable degree. Of course, it should be noted that Joseph was instructed not to record everything that he saw in vision. The Saints at the time were not prepared to receive all of the new information that he was given. But as we look at the Prophet’s later teachings, we see what appear to be bits and pieces of this great revelation being taught—here a little and there a little—as the Saints grew in their spiritual understanding.</p>

We cannot be saved in ignorance,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> but the Lord can only reveal light and truth to us as we are prepared to receive it. And so it is incumbent upon each of us to do everything we can to increase our spiritual knowledge and understanding by studying the scriptures and the words of the living prophets. When we read and study the revelations, the Spirit can confirm in our hearts the truth of what we are learning; in this way, the voice of the Lord speaks to each one of us.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> As we ponder the teachings of the gospel and apply them in daily living, we become better prepared to receive additional light and truth. Today, I hope we are prepared and eager to understand what President Gordon B. Hinckley is teaching us, for he, along with the other Apostles, will teach us how to cope and how to live in these troubled times.</p>

Hinckley made the historic announcement that 30 or more smaller temples will be constructed throughout the world. The first of those smaller temples was dedicated this summer in Monticello, Utah. As you know, President Hinckley’s stated goal is to have at least 100 temples in operation by the end of this century. Knowing the President as I do, I am sure that goal will be met, if not exceeded!</p>

Nothing even approaching it has ever been tried before.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Ever since this stunning announcement, I have thought what great confidence the Lord and His prophet have in you and me. How much responsibility now rests upon all of us to prepare ourselves and others to be worthy of the blessings of these holy temples.</p>

I was impressed with an experience of President Wilford Woodruff when he told of a visitation he received from the Prophet Joseph Smith some time after the Prophet was martyred. According to President Woodruff’s own account: “[Joseph Smith] came to me and spoke to me. He said he could not stop to talk with me because he was in a hurry. The next man I met was Father Smith; he could not talk with me because he was in a hurry. I met half a dozen brethren who had held high positions on earth, and none of them could stop to talk with me because they were in a hurry. I was much astonished. By and by I saw the Prophet again and I got the privilege of asking him a question.</p>

Every dispensation that has had the priesthood on the earth and has gone into the celestial kingdom has had a certain amount of work to do to prepare to go to the earth with the Savior when he goes to reign on the earth. Each dispensation has had ample time to do this work. We have not. We are the last dispensation, and so much work has to be done, and we need to be in a hurry to accomplish it.’</p>

President Hinckley is doing all that he can do to accelerate the work. He is traveling the world to an unprecedented degree to strengthen and edify the Saints and to urge them upward and onward. He has made himself available to the world media in order to share the message of the Restoration with the widest possible audience. And he is overseeing the most extensive era of temple building in history in an attempt to speed up our ability to accomplish the overwhelming amount of work we have been assigned to complete in this dispensation of time.</p>

The question we must all ask ourselves is, “Are we keeping pace with him?” Each one of us must be prepared to answer that question. I can assure you that it is a subject of considerable discussion among the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. I hope the same is true of every council in every ward and stake in the Church. This is not the time to relax or to coast in our callings. Every council of the Church should be working together on ways to be more effective in preparing our members to be worthy to enjoy all the blessings of the Church and especially the blessings of the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/are-we-keeping-pace.p13" pid="06jn5moum0uM9C0GJzzgaA" hash="h4ANdg">We are rapidly approaching a time when the number of operating temples throughout the world will be double what it was just four short years ago. Now is a good time to ask, <span class="emphasis">stake presidents</span> and <span class="emphasis">bishops,</span> what are your stake and ward councils doing to fill these temples with worthy members and sufficient dedicated workers? Are your priesthood quorums functioning at peak efficiency? Are the home and visiting teachers involved in serving those families to whom they are assigned? Are your auxiliaries actively building faith and testimonies? Are the activities in your stake and ward aimed at strengthening the family and every member? Are you carefully coordinating the proselyting efforts with the stake and full-time missionaries, helping them to find, teach, and baptize many more people? Are your councils concerning themselves with helping every new convert and less-active member become fully fellowshipped and completely anchored to the doctrines of the Church?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/are-we-keeping-pace.p14" pid="7iKyJdy4sUmJ4qIfVx7VXQ" hash="NkuoYw">Brothers and sisters, there is much to be done by us to complete the work assigned by the Lord to this dispensation. We must focus our work, and we must work smarter if we are to accomplish our role in preparing all Church members to receive their temple blessings. Church leaders, both men and women, can and must extend the length of their reach and broaden the power of their influence. We must be wise to protect and teach our own families first and then take full advantage of the inspired Church council system to achieve greater success in the work Heavenly Father has given us to do, within the time frame He has given us to do it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/are-we-keeping-pace.p15" pid="aFK6rQpgtEOQgoV-2yb2WQ" hash="-2SGbw">Take, for example, the critical role of the ward council in fellowshipping every convert and activating those who are less active. As each member now knows, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are greatly concerned over the well-being of every new and less-active member of the Church. No ward or branch council should allow a new convert to feel insecure in his newly embraced Church membership. And yet there are still too many of them who do not feel warmly welcomed.</p>

I know this Church is true, and I have a strong testimony, but I still question. … When I was investigating, everyone from my ward were always there for me and always wanted to talk to me and always wanted to help me out. … Since I was baptized it’s like they don’t even notice when I go to church or when I don’t. I hardly hear from anybody. … I just can’t understand why the people in my ward have just forgotten me. I feel so lonely and confused. … I can’t talk to my bishop because … we aren’t close at all.

This can best be accomplished when ward council members see that each organization does its part to make sure new members have friends, have an assignment, and are nourished by the good word of God. Every soul is very precious to our Heavenly Father. We must never forget that through the Atonement, the Lord Jesus Christ paid a great price for the redemption of each one of us. His suffering must not be in vain because we fail to nurture and teach those who are striving to be active in the Church.</p>

How grateful we are for your strength. Sisters, talk together in your councils about how to love, support, and teach each other the beautiful blessings and promises of the gospel. How wonderful it would be if every woman in the world understood her true destiny as expressed in the Young Women theme. You know the words: “We are daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves us, and we love him. We will ‘stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places …’ as we strive to live the Young Women Values, which are—Faith, Divine Nature, Individual Worth, Knowledge, Choice and Accountability, Good Works, and Integrity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Learning of and acting upon these values will save and bless both young and older women.</p>

This examination is particularly essential to those of us who have made covenants of consecration and sacrifice in the house of the Lord. We need to ask ourselves: Are we setting an example of Christian virtue and gospel faithfulness in our lives and in our homes?

We must be prepared to keep pace with our leaders, stride for their every lengthened stride.

These are always special times for family and friends. The feeling at such times is a sweet and satisfying mix of earthly happiness and eternal joy seen in the tear-filled eyes of mothers who have prayed for this day with all of their hearts. You see it in the eyes of fathers who, for the first time in months, are thinking about something besides how to pay for all of the expenses. But mostly you see it in the eyes of a virtuous bride and groom who have lived true to the teachings of the gospel, shunning the temptations of the world. There is a special, undeniable feeling available to those who have remained clean and pure and chaste.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p3" pid="aVabWr93gEa1qKfCqEWetQ" hash="DwF13Q">Too many of our young men and women are succumbing to the pressures imposed by a world saturated with evil messages and immoral behavior. Lucifer is waging a vicious war for the souls of young and old alike, and the casualty count is climbing. The standards of the world have shifted like the sands of a windblown desert. That which was once unheard of or unacceptable is now commonplace. The world’s perspective has been so dramatically altered that those who choose to adhere to traditional standards of morality are viewed as strange, almost as though they must justify their desire to keep the commandments of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p4" pid="fKIUarft_kmybPfngJMgsg" hash="EB1N9Q">But one thing is certain: the commandments have not changed. Let there be no mistake about that. Right is still right. Wrong is still wrong, no matter how cleverly cloaked in respectability or political correctness. We believe in chastity before marriage and fidelity ever after. That standard is an absolute standard of truth. It is neither subject to public opinion polls nor dependent upon situation or circumstance. There is no need to debate it or other gospel standards.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p5" pid="gfmw9UrytU2aFU1aoSW_aw" hash="5wYtkw">But there is a desperate need for parents, leaders, and teachers to help our youth learn to understand, love, value, and live the standards of the gospel. Parents and youth must stand together in defense against a clever and devious adversary. We must be just as dedicated, effective, and determined in our efforts to live the gospel as he is in his efforts to destroy it—and us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p6" pid="KGxLIfmBYEqlyryVJ-pCjQ" hash="cex2iQ">The challenge before us is great. At risk are the immortal souls of those we love. May I suggest four ways we can build a fortress of faith in our homes and particularly help prepare our youth to be clean and chaste and pure, completely worthy to enter the temple.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">The first is gospel information.</span> The most important, life-changing information that I know of is the knowledge that we are truly children of God our Eternal Father. This is not only doctrinally correct, it is spiritually vital. Said the Savior in His powerful intercessory prayer, “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.3" class="scriptureRef">John 17:3</a>). To know Heavenly Father and to understand our relationship to Him as our Father and our God is to find meaning in this life and hope in the life to come. Our families need to know He is real, that we are in fact His sons and His daughters and heirs to all that He has, now and forever. Secure in that knowledge, family members will be less likely to look for devilish diversions and more likely to look to God and live (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/num/21.8" class="scriptureRef">Num. 21:8</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p8" pid="YRD-JFhBQE2Fc_NG8HFjqg" hash="xIXB1Q">Somehow we need to instill in our hearts the powerful testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ like unto that of our pioneer forefathers. Remember when Nauvoo fell in September of 1846 and the unbearable conditions of the Saints in the poor camps. When word reached Winter Quarters, Brigham Young immediately called the brethren together. After explaining the situation and reminding them of the covenant made in the Nauvoo Temple that no one who wanted to come, no matter how poor, would be left behind, he gave them this remarkable challenge:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p9" pid="8FcwXdRvd0aqKpYLcF2VUQ" hash="noR_dQ">“Now is the time for labor,” he said. “<span class="emphasis">Let the fire of the covenant</span> which you made in the House of the Lord, <span class="emphasis">burn in your hearts, like flame unquenchable</span>” (Journal History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 28 Sept. 1846, 5; emphasis added). Within a few days, in spite of near-destitute conditions at Winter Quarters, many wagons were rolling eastward to rescue the Saints in the poor camps along the Mississippi River.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p10" pid="w9cC6XvCaEmmhdNiohNVGQ" hash="obmB6g">We often hear of the suffering and the sacrifice those early Saints endured, and we ask ourselves, How did they do it? What was it that gave them such strength? Part of the answer lies in President Young’s powerful words. Those early Latter-day Saints had made covenants with God, and those <span class="emphasis">covenants burned like unquenchable fire in their hearts.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p11" pid="giD2MzprrUSRrWYb3urgIQ" hash="Uk0cTQ">Sometimes we are tempted to let our lives be governed more by convenience than by covenant. It is not always convenient to live gospel standards and stand up for truth and testify of the Restoration. It usually is not convenient to share the gospel with others. It isn’t always convenient to respond to a calling in the Church, especially one that stretches our abilities. Opportunities to serve others in meaningful ways, as we have covenanted to do, rarely come at convenient times. But there is no spiritual power in living by convenience. The power comes as we keep our covenants. As we look at the lives of these early Saints, we see that their covenants were the primary force in their lives. Their example and testimony were powerful enough to influence generation after generation of their children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p12" pid="BtSpXknT-k6c_DPghGlTaw" hash="caporQ">As our children grow, they need information taught by parents more directly and plainly about what is and is not appropriate. Parents need to teach children to avoid any pornographic photographs or stories. Children and youth need to know from parents that pornography of any kind is a tool of the devil; and if anyone flirts with it, it has the power to addict, dull, and even destroy the human spirit. They need to be taught not to use vulgar language and never to use the Lord’s name in vain. Crude jokes overheard should never be repeated. Teach family members not to listen to music that celebrates the sensual. Talk to them plainly about sex and the teaching of the gospel regarding chastity. Let this information come from parents in the home in an appropriate way. All family members need to know the rules and be fortified spiritually so they can keep them. And when mistakes are made, the wondrous Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ must be understood and accepted so that through the complete and sometimes difficult process of repentance, forgiveness and continued hope for the future can be obtained. We must never give up our individual and family quest for eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p13" pid="AZ3v-CH_g0WjngTM85jo5w" hash="38rtsQ">Unfortunately, far too many parents in today’s world have abdicated the responsibility to teach these values and other Church doctrines to their families, believing that others will do it: the peer group, the school, Church leaders and teachers, or even the media. Every day our children are learning, filling their minds and hearts with experiences and perceptions that deeply influence personal value systems.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p14" pid="rtSLPnHvH0uvKawy7P5qrw" hash="H_pVmw">Brothers and sisters, we need to instruct one another and instill deeper faith in our hearts to fortify ourselves with the courage to keep the commandments in a world of ever-increasing wickedness. We need to become so deeply converted to the gospel of Christ <span class="emphasis">that the fire of the covenant will burn in our hearts like flame unquenchable.</span> And with that kind of faith we will do what is necessary to remain true and worthy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p15" pid="BuDAl-xI-Umlem8VPKLKHQ" hash="yYyckA">
        <span class="emphasis">Second is communication.</span> Nothing is more important to the relationship between family members than open, honest communication. This is particularly true for parents trying to teach gospel principles and standards to their children. The ability to counsel with our youth—and perhaps more importantly, to really listen to their concerns—is the foundation upon which successful relationships are built. Often what we see in the eyes and what we feel in the heart will communicate far more than what we hear or say. A word to you children: Never be disrespectful to your parents. You must also learn to listen, especially to the counsel of your mom and dad and to the promptings of the Spirit. We need to watch for and capture the special teaching moments that constantly occur within our family relationships, and we need to resolve now to hold family home evening every Monday night.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p16" pid="kBtPU42a2UOKh96zABoSCA" hash="4Mb3xw">There are powerful moments of communication through regular family prayer and through family scripture study. The scriptures will help define family values and goals, and talking together about them will assist family members to learn to become individually secure, spiritually strong, and self-reliant. This requires time, and so we need to counsel together about how much television, how many movies, videos, video games, time on the Internet, or out-of-the-home activities should be allowed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p17" pid="R1XI4JGR-kCuvYLfKYYXEw" hash="_RmP3Q">
        <span class="emphasis">Third is intervention.</span> It is the parents’ duty to intervene when they see wrong choices being made. That doesn’t mean parents take from children the precious gift of agency. Because agency is a God-given gift, ultimately the choice of what they will do, how they will behave, and what they will believe will always be theirs. But as parents we need to make sure they understand appropriate behavior and the consequences to them if they pursue their wrongful course. Remember, there is no such thing as unlawful censorship in the home. Movies, magazines, television, videos, the Internet, and other media are there as guests and should only be welcomed when they are appropriate for family enjoyment. Make your home a haven of peace and righteousness. Don’t allow evil influences to contaminate your own special spiritual environment. Be kind, thoughtful, gentle, and considerate in what you say and how you treat each other. Then family goals based on gospel standards will make it easier to make good decisions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p18" pid="f37gQ5x7TEauvTd75B68Nw" hash="9W4dIQ">The same principle applies to you bishops, teachers, and other leaders in the Church as you work to assist families. You don’t have to stand idly by as those over whom you have stewardship make poor moral choices. When one of our youth stands at a moral crossroad in life, almost always there is someone—a parent, a leader, a teacher—who could make a difference by intervening with love and kindness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p19" pid="cUTAG3U560uTDHf9B-fyZw" hash="hrL_gA">
        <span class="emphasis">Fourth is example.</span> Just as it is difficult for a weary sailor to find his way across uncharted seas without the aid of a compass, it is almost impossible for children and youth to find their way through the seas of life without the guiding light of a good example. We cannot expect them to avoid those things that are inappropriate if they see their parents compromising principles and failing to live the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p20" pid="S7_4n7GeQUm_tRp4XNh3Lg" hash="YeV2Nw">As parents, teachers, and leaders, it is our solemn duty to set a powerful, personal example of righteous strength, courage, sacrifice, unselfish service, and self-control. These are the traits that will help our youth hold on to the iron rod of the gospel and remain on the straight and narrow path.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p21" pid="VKnSaQQ7nU-rI5-AVzWnWg" hash="9lS7TA">I wish I could tell you that focusing on <span class="emphasis">information, communication, intervention,</span> and <span class="emphasis">example</span> would always result in a perfect family with perfect children who never stray from gospel standards. That is, unfortunately, not the case. But families that know, teach, and live gospel principles and standards are more likely to spare themselves the pain of serious mistakes. When long-established patterns of positive communication and faithful example prevail, it is much easier to counsel together about personal problems and to work through the necessary changes that will bless every family member.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/like-a-flame-unquenchable.p22" pid="JxM0EaqFv0ed1bs-ey66qg" hash="R3h-3w">Listen to King Benjamin’s significant counsel: “I cannot tell you all the things whereby [you] may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</p>

And now, O man, remember, and perish not” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.29-30" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:29–30</a>).</p>

There are, however, signs that scriptural prophecy relating to that tumultuous day is being fulfilled. Jesus cautioned several times that prior to His Second Coming, “many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.11" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:11</a>). As Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, it is our duty to be watchmen on the tower, warning Church members to beware of false prophets and false teachers who lie in wait to ensnare and destroy faith and testimony. Today we warn you that there are false prophets and false teachers arising; and if we are not careful, even those who are among the faithful members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will fall victim to their deception.</p>

Whenever you see a man rise up claiming to have received direct revelation from the Lord to the Church, independent of the order and channel of the Priesthood, you may set him down as an imposter” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine, </span>5th ed.

We often assume that such individuals are associated with small radical groups on the fringes of society. However, I reiterate: there are false prophets and false teachers who have or at least claim to have membership in the Church. There are those who, without authority, claim Church endorsement to their products and practices. Beware of such.</p>

Hinckley also being sustained as President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He, and only he, holds and exercises in their fulness all of the keys of God’s kingdom on earth. How grateful we all are to know and to sustain President Hinckley.</p>

The doctrines of eternal salvation are not unclear or uncertain, but rather they are consistent with revealed truths, both ancient and modern.</p>

Kimball reminded us that the prophets “constantly cry out against that which is intolerable in the sight of the Lord; against pollution of mind, body, and our surroundings; against vulgarity, stealing, lying, pride, and blasphemy; against fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and all other abuses of the sacred power to create; against murder and all that is like unto it; against all manner of desecration.” He continued: “That such things should be found even among the Saints to some degree is scarcely believable. … Sadly, however, we find that to be shown the way is not necessarily to walk in it” (“The False Gods We Worship,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> June 1976, 4).</p>

Beware of those who speak and publish in opposition to God’s true prophets and who actively proselyte others with reckless disregard for the eternal well-being of those whom they seduce. Like Nehor and Korihor in the Book of Mormon, they rely on sophistry to deceive and entice others to their views. They “set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.29" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:29</a>).</p>

Smith warned when he spoke of the “proud and self-vaunting ones, who read by the lamps of their own conceit; who interpret by rules of their own contriving; who have become a law unto themselves, and so pose as the sole judges of their own doings” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 381).</p>

They declare that the Book of Mormon and other canonical works are not ancient records of scripture. They also attempt to redefine the nature of the Godhead, and they deny that God has given and continues to give revelation today to His ordained and sustained prophets.</p>

They argue, therefore, that the scriptures require new interpretation and that they are uniquely qualified to offer that interpretation.</p>

They reject the need for a Savior. In short, these detractors attempt to reinterpret the doctrines of the Church to fit their own preconceived views, and in the process deny Christ and His messianic role.</p>

They advocate a redefinition of morality to justify fornication, adultery, and homosexual relationships. Some openly champion the legalization of so-called same-gender marriages. To justify their rejection of God’s immutable laws that protect the family, these false prophets and false teachers even attack the inspired proclamation on the family issued to the world in 1995 by the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles.</p>

Our example will have a powerful effect on others, making the restored gospel become much more relevant, meaningful, convincing, and desirable to them. Let us, each one, radiate to others the joy, confidence, love, and warmth of being part of the true Church of Christ. Our discipleship is not something to be endured with long face and heavy heart. Nor is it something to be jealously clutched to our bosoms and not shared with others. As we come to understand the love of the Father and the Son for us, our spirits will soar, and we will “come to Zion, singing with songs of everlasting joy” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.71" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:71</a>).</p>

Remember, too often our behavior is a bigger deterrent to others than is our doctrine. In the spirit of love for all men, women, and children, help them to understand and to feel accepted and appreciated.</p>

It takes faith—real faith, total and unreserved—to accept and strive to live prophetic counsel. Lucifer, the adversary of truth, does not want us to feel or exhibit that kind of faith. He encourages disobedience, planting defiance in the hearts of the unwary. If he is successful, they will turn away from the light into the darkness of the world. Our safety, our peace, lies in working as hard as we can to live as the Father and Son would have us live, in fleeing from false prophets and false teachers, and in being anxiously engaged in good causes.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p2" pid="SWVtX_wtR0qol9muK7Lvwg" hash="_dTCUw">One hundred years ago, President Lorenzo Snow stood in the Tabernacle to open the 70th annual conference of the Church. It was the first conference of the 1900s, and it came at the end of a period of great trial and tribulation for the Church. Total Church membership then was approaching 300,000, with the majority of those members living in Utah.</p>

We have received the Gospel. We have received the kingdom of God, established on the earth. We have had trouble; we have been persecuted. We were driven from Ohio; we were driven from Missouri; we were driven from Nauvoo; and once we were driven for a time from this beautiful city. Many have lost thousands of dollars; lost their homes and all they had, and some of the brethren have seen their wives and children lay down their lives because of the hardships they had to experience. … The people have looked with astonishment at the willingness of the Latter-day Saints to suffer these things. Why do we do this? … What is it that enables us to endure these persecutions and still rejoice?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p5" pid="wsb-8vHl1EqhKt8iAECy6g" hash="SGrZsQ">President Snow gave this answer: “It is because we have had revelations from the Almighty; because He has spoken to us in our souls and has given to us the Holy Ghost. … This Church will stand, because it is upon a firm basis. It is not from man; it is not from the study of the New Testament or the Old Testament; it is not the result of the learning that we received in colleges nor seminaries, but it has come directly from the Lord. The Lord has shown it to us by the revealing principle of the Holy Spirit of light and every man can receive this same spirit” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1900, 2–3).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p6" pid="sOKXHYbfqUCrWklCrEDC7Q" hash="lrSMPw">It would be well for us, my brothers and sisters, to give careful consideration to that same question today: “How is it with us?” A century has passed; we are now in our 171st year as a church. Church membership is now approaching 11 million worldwide. Our members are respected leaders in almost every field of endeavor in nearly every country. The Church is growing; temples are being built at an unprecedented pace. Missionary work continues to move forward. Church meetings are held on a regular basis in nearly every nation. Yet, as our prophets have indicated, “the Lord expects that we will do something.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p7" pid="6AdEtVM4qkOYFjHUa-wrMA" hash="dzdmBA">But what? What is it that needs our personal attention? As I read and ponder the scriptures and carefully consider the Lord’s counsel to His followers in every dispensation of time, it appears to me that the most important thing <span class="emphasis">every</span> one of us can do is to examine our own commitment and devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ. We must carefully guard against spiritual apathy and work to maintain the full measure of our loving loyalty to the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p8" pid="q75sm2YvHkSJ81ySbPYgXw" hash="RjF38g">While it is true that extraordinary strides are being made throughout the Church, the enormity of the task before us is overwhelming. Simply stated, we have a ministry to all of our Heavenly Father’s children on both sides of the veil. In that context, we have barely scratched the surface of our calling. True discipleship, therefore, precludes any complacency. The Lord expects us to continue moving the Church forward and even to accelerate our pace toward the literal fulfillment of Daniel’s prophetic vision of “a stone … cut out without hands … that … became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/2.34-35" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 2:34–35</a>). To do this more effectively, each one of us needs to follow Nephi’s counsel to “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. [For] if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>). The power of the Holy Ghost will fill our hearts and minds as we look to the Savior for answers to the many challenges of life.</p>

As we press forward in His service, spiritual experiences will increase our faith, and we will find great joy. Our understanding of the essential doctrines and eternal truths that have been restored will become a firm foundation of our faith. And as we come to know and understand these true doctrines for ourselves, we will discover that there is also a great need for us to share our knowledge and beliefs with others while always maintaining their friendship and goodwill.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p10" pid="AV5IWdQiKEiaXBaq_IxZXA" hash="QblFAg">While we should be pleased to testify to the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to all who will hear our message, there are times when all that we can hope to accomplish is to help those who are not members of the Church better understand our basic beliefs. There are many people who know a little about us, who are curious and who wonder about us but who are not ready to change their lifestyle or make eternal commitments. We need to be prepared to teach them in ways that they can understand and appreciate, even if they are not prepared as yet to respond to spiritual promptings and to accept the gospel in their lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p11" pid="nmZHQrSn-0m1QnpIt4tPoQ" hash="UigtMA">For example, it has been my experience that when members and our missionaries are guided by the Spirit, our conversations with non–Latter-day Saint friends and associates flow easily and naturally to the subject of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. All of us, regardless of race, color, or creed, belong to the family of our Heavenly Father. Most people share this belief. Our understanding and knowledge of this basic truth should compel us to love all of God’s children as our brothers and sisters and to explain to them that we all lived premortally as spirit children of our Heavenly Father. There we learned about and accepted His plan for us to come to earth to gain a mortal body and be tested. Our deep-rooted respect for all mankind is enhanced by our understanding of our relationship one to another in our premortal life.</p>

Our hope and faith are rooted in the profound understanding that He lives today and that He continues to lead and guide His Church and His people. We rejoice in the knowledge of the living Christ, and we reverently acknowledge the miracles He continues to work today in the lives of those who have faith in Him. He is the head of the Church, which bears His name. He is our Savior and our Redeemer. Through Him we worship and pray to our Heavenly Father. We are grateful beyond measure for the essential and awesome power His Atonement has in each of our lives.</p>

Perhaps more importantly, however, we should seek at all times to purify ourselves and to lead such worthy lives that the Light of Christ emanates from us in all that we say and do. Our day-to-day lives should stand as immutable witness of our faith in Christ. In the words of the Apostle Paul, “Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 4:12</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p15" pid="GN8UtSrcQUytWcUIrQVDrw" hash="ff9ZaA">“For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:11–12</a>).</p>

Paul wrote to the Thessalonian Christians who were eagerly anticipating the Second Coming of the Savior that “that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Thes. 2:3</a>). He also warned Timothy that “the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but … they shall turn away their ears from the truth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.3-4" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 4:3–4</a>). And Peter presupposed a falling away when he spoke of “the times of refreshing” that would come before God would again “send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p17" pid="hyHb3LF3okGjlO6eRkLIlA" hash="tNvqXQ">“Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.19-21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:19–21</a>).</p>

Peter’s prophecy almost begs for a discussion of the restoration of the gospel in these latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith. This in turn demands a dialogue about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the holy priesthood through the gift and power of God. From there it is so natural to share the principle of continuing revelation and the organization of the Church and its doctrines and programs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p19" pid="nNKXFmd3dEypmqzIBVrBWw" hash="JjBxqg">Brothers and sisters, the Lord expects us to do something. I believe we are expected to increase our own faith, shake off any possible feelings of apathy, and by the power of the Holy Ghost reaffirm our commitment and intensify our service to the Lord. Then, when we seek to clarify someone’s understanding of the Church, our lives—well and faithfully lived—can serve as a magnifying glass through which others can examine the impact of gospel living. Under the light of our good example, the Spirit can enlarge understanding of the Church and its mission to all with whom we have contact.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/how-is-it-with-us.p20" pid="vEm77zAFOEWA9YXjEDFWxg" hash="fFifsQ">We need not apologize for our beliefs nor back down from that which we know to be true. But we can share it in a spirit of loving understanding—boldly and confidently, with an eye single to the glory of God—without pressuring our listeners or feeling that we have failed in our duty if they do not immediately accept what we believe.</p>

There is no need for any new program to do this. We don’t need a handbook or a calling or a training meeting. The only need is for good members of the Church to learn to rely upon the power of the Holy Ghost and, with this power, reach out and touch the lives of our Father’s children. There is no greater service we can render than sharing our personal testimonies with those who lack an understanding of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

Can each one of us resolve today to increase our personal spiritual preparation by seeking the guidance of the Holy Ghost and then, with His power as our companion, bless more of our Father’s children with understanding and knowledge that the Church is true?</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p2" pid="wmudHaB4o0SsThO19JwLew" hash="I9YWqg">Years later, at the age of 15, the Prophet’s nephew Joseph F. Smith was called to serve a mission in Hawaii. You will remember that he was only five when his father, Hyrum, was martyred. His mother, Mary Fielding, died when he was just 13. Upon arriving on the island of Maui, young Joseph fell gravely ill. Despite these and other adversities, he wrote to Elder George A. Smith: “I am ready to bear my testimony … at any time, or at any place, or in whatsoever circumstances I may be placed. … I am ready to go through thick and thin for this cause in which I am engaged” (as quoted in Joseph Fielding Smith, comp., <span class="emphasis">Life of Joseph F. Smith</span> [1938], 176).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p3" pid="RyegSDPI8kqeChmfxZexNg" hash="cWlUSw">Today we must ask ourselves: Are we ready and willing to go through thick and thin for the cause in which we are engaged? Do we reflect in our countenances the joy of living the gospel of Christ as true disciples should? If we do not understand and willingly teach others of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith, who will? We cannot place the burden of taking the gospel to all people solely on the backs of the full-time missionaries. Families will not be fortified nor will individual testimonies be strengthened, convert baptisms will not be increased, neither will the less active be welcomed back until we as members of the Church arise individually and collectively, with dedication and action, to help build the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p4" pid="RqUYwl0VEEyrVCCWKAkEzQ" hash="5c1fUw">Our duty lies in assisting others, through the power of the Spirit, to <span class="emphasis">know </span>and <span class="emphasis">understand</span> the doctrines and principles of the gospel. Everyone must come to <span class="emphasis">feel </span>that the doctrines of the Restoration are true and of great value. And everyone who accepts the message must strive to <span class="emphasis">live</span> the gospel by making and keeping sacred covenants and by participating in all of the ordinances of salvation and exaltation. We often think of conversion as applying only to investigators, but there are some members who are not yet fully converted and who have yet to experience the mighty change of heart described in the scriptures (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p5" pid="5H54vdrG9UGa8nfeO6neww" hash="V1lLtg">Brethren and sisters, true and complete conversion is the key to accelerating the work of the Church.</p>

This is an attitude of both mind and heart that includes a desire to know the truth and a willingness to act on that desire. For those investigating the Church, the experiment can be as simple as agreeing to read the Book of Mormon, to pray about it, and to earnestly seek to know if Joseph Smith was the Lord’s prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p7" pid="zkWKeuBvAEea1key3bH7DQ" hash="yAmzPg">True conversion comes through the power of the Spirit. When the Spirit touches the heart, hearts are changed. When individuals, both members and investigators, feel the Spirit working with them, or when they see the evidence of the Lord’s love and mercy in their lives, they are edified and strengthened spiritually and their faith in Him increases. These experiences with the Spirit follow naturally when a person is willing to experiment upon the word. This is how we come to <span class="emphasis">feel</span> the gospel is true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p8" pid="qV8evklcvk-V4h5Kx1jefg" hash="a6MWPQ">A most significant evidence of our conversion and of how we feel about the gospel in our own lives is our willingness to share it with others and to help missionaries find someone to teach. The likelihood of lasting conversion greatly increases when a nonmember has a friend or a relative who radiates the joy of being a member of the Church. The influence of members of the Church is very powerful. I believe that’s why President Hinckley asked us to see that everyone has a friend (see “Converts and Young Men,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1997, 47).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p9" pid="7DJURvtdj0O2dchkrktgkw" hash="IiMitA">Here, then, is an important key to our success in accelerating the Lord’s work. As active members of the Church, and especially as priesthood and auxiliary leaders, we need to do more to assist in the process of conversion, retention, and activation. We know that faithful members desire to serve, but sometimes we lose sight of the essential outcomes that our faith and works ought to produce in strengthening the commitment of our Father’s children to the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p10" pid="K2r7EWWKA0CfebpokoY8CA" hash="lpLktQ">Bishops, you are the key. You give the vision and invite your ward council to help you strengthen the spiritual conversion of those investigating the Church as well as all of your members. Encourage council members to constantly think about the specific things they can do to assist you in helping your ward members and their nonmember friends to better know and understand the gospel. What can they do to help them feel it is true and to support them as they strive to live the principles? Ask yourselves what specific things we as priesthood and auxiliary leaders can do to encourage a family or an individual to experiment on the good word of God. What can the council do as leaders and teachers to ensure that every person who attends our Church meetings feels the Spirit and is strengthened spiritually?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p11" pid="pWLUfc6if06pPW7XCPWWeg" hash="K0O4HA">We are just now learning to focus on the right things in our council meetings, but too often we still focus only on generalities. In one stake where they are having great success in baptizing and retaining new converts, the full-time missionaries are invited to meet with the ward council to discuss people they are teaching. The council members seek inspiration in determining which leaders and ward members can best help the missionaries fellowship specific individuals and families and bring them into the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p12" pid="adG69C1yS0e7LFk9UHbY9g" hash="WIyXuQ">Some of you bishops feel like you must be involved in every action your council members take. This is a mistake, because if you do, you will never bring all the powerful resources God has given to you into full strength. At the general Relief Society meeting two weeks ago, Sister Sheri Dew said she believes the sisters are “the Lord’s secret weapon.” I think she is right. Our sister leaders have a spiritual sensitivity that will prompt them how to best approach and nurture those whom the missionaries are teaching. The best place to begin to fully utilize the talents and wisdom of our sisters is through the established council system of the Church. You are free to be flexible in how you use the ward council.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p13" pid="ekaEZJoRt0qObfdl8kUpcA" hash="8YwdMg">Just last year, President Hinckley said this to the bishops of the Church: “You are not bound by rigid rules. You have unlimited flexibility. You are entitled to answers to your prayers, to inspiration and revelation from the Lord” (“Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1999, 110). Perhaps in some cases, holding council meetings only once a month will not be sufficient to focus on the spiritual conversion of members and nonmembers alike who are under your ministering care. You are free to meet in council as often as deemed necessary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p14" pid="FttqfoWEbkePonQDmEEBAw" hash="WkUrWA">Recently a stake president shared with me a tender story demonstrating the power of the council system in building up the Church. He said that both the Relief Society and the priesthood had been working with a family in their stake but had failed to make progress with the parents. Primary leaders found the answer. Permission was given by the parents for their young daughter to attend Primary. Their one condition was that she had to want to go badly enough to get there on her own. Rides to church could not be provided. Because she had to go through a rough part of town, the ward council saw to it that someone would drive along beside her as she rode an old bicycle to church. Through summer heat, through rain and even snow, she persisted in going to church. One young man, who with his family was assigned to escort her on a snowy morning, was so touched as he watched the commitment of this little girl pedaling through the snow and cold that he decided to serve a full-time mission, citing this experience as the turning point in his life. At Christmastime, a family in the ward gave this faithful little girl a new 10-speed bicycle. This so touched the parents that they too began attending church. In May 1999 this young girl was baptized. What made the baptism even more special was that it was performed by the newest priest in the ward, her recently activated father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/now-is-the-time.p15" pid="EVJCR707UE-HRy8nqIIcNA" hash="WEggDw">Bishops, for you to accomplish what the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve are asking, your ward council needs to capture this vision and work more closely together in doing God’s great work of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of all of His children. Imagine the power that would come if every member of the Church would reach out to help all members and investigators enjoy the companionship of the Spirit. Let all of us work harder to see that the presence of the Spirit is in all of our meetings to bring about deeper spiritual conversion. This will especially require ward councils to assist the bishoprics in improving reverence in our sacrament meetings and in better teaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ in all of our church meetings.</p>

We must never forget that He suffered rejection, humiliation, unspeakable agony, and eventually death in order to save you and me and the whole world from sin. Can any one of us go before Him in some future day and say that we didn’t share the gospel with others and help others come to the missionaries because we were too busy or too shy, or for any other reason?</p>

He wants us to participate with Him and His Beloved Son in bringing the gospel into the lives of all of His children.

Let us exercise greater faith and work together, members and missionaries, to bring many more souls unto Him. Let every family in the Church include as part of their daily family prayers a plea with the Lord to go before your family members and help them to find someone prepared to receive the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

Let us say, “I am ready to bear my testimony … at any time, or at any place, or in whatsoever circumstance I may be placed.” It will help us to do this by reading often the Prophet Joseph Smith’s own story and then sharing with others our own sure knowledge that the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored once again to the earth. We must move forward with the promise that the Spirit will bless us to know what to do and what to say as we assist those who are seeking to know the truth. Let us go forward with more faith, never forgetting that the Lord will help us as we turn to Him in mighty prayer. Our Heavenly Father lives and loves each of His children. The Lord Jesus Christ lives. The most important work we can do is to help God’s children come to a full understanding of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. This I know to be true and so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Finally, in frustration, <span class="emphasis">he</span> stops and asks someone for directions. I can tell you sisters have experienced this! How much easier it is to find our way when we follow the directions of someone who knows how to locate our destination.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p2" pid="eIOizc9HT06VHDrzUP0Zeg" hash="Pgw0BA">Many of us may find ourselves in a similar situation as we make our way through life’s challenging thoroughfares. These are difficult times, and the world’s cultural and sociological landmarks of propriety, honesty, integrity, and political correctness are constantly shifting. Just when we think we know the way to happiness and peace, some new ideology comes along which can lead us down a path that will only heighten our confusion and intensify our despair. At such times, we might well ask, “Is there one clear, unpolluted, unbiased voice that we can always count on? Is there a voice that will always give us clear directions to find our way in today’s troubled world?” The answer is <span class="emphasis">yes.</span> That voice is the voice of the living prophet and apostles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p3" pid="PYo8vkZ4-UGmdfAwACVTRg" hash="YoqztA">When The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized 171 years ago this month, the Lord gave a revelation to the members of the Church through His prophet, Joseph Smith Jr. Speaking of the President of the Church, the Savior instructed Church members to “give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;</p>

Great and wonderful are the blessings that come into our lives as we listen to the word of the Lord given to us through him. At the same time, knowing that President Gordon B. Hinckley is God’s prophet also endows us with responsibility. When we hear the counsel of the Lord expressed through the words of the President of the Church, our response should be positive and prompt. History has shown that there is safety, peace, prosperity, and happiness in responding to prophetic counsel as did Nephi of old: “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p9" pid="eM2gSuvLRUKcCe7zBcUyTQ" hash="eHHvdw">We know of the experience of Naaman, who was struck with leprosy and who eventually contacted the prophet Elisha and was instructed to “go and wash in [the] Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.10" class="scriptureRef">2 Kgs. 5:10</a>).</p>

He couldn’t understand the thing he had been asked to do—to wash seven times in the Jordan river. In other words, his pride and stubbornness were keeping him from receiving the Lord’s blessing through His prophet. Thankfully, he finally went down, and “dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.14" class="scriptureRef">2 Kgs. 5:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p11" pid="vtPAxRq69EqBHSxTGKPjBQ" hash="EeTE9A">What a humbling thing it must have been for Naaman to realize how close he came to allowing his own pride and his unwillingness to listen to the counsel of the prophet to prevent him from receiving such a great, cleansing blessing. And what a humbling thing it is to contemplate how many of us might miss out on great and promised blessings because we do not listen <span class="emphasis">and then do</span> the relatively simple things our prophet is telling us to do today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p12" pid="12mf3qmZIkOYoJ6CKIcPuw" hash="I98OUw">In the last year, for example, President Hinckley has delivered three landmark addresses about strengthening the family, and particularly the youth and young adults of the Church. First he spoke very directly on the subject to mothers during the October general Relief Society meeting. Then he spoke to fathers and priesthood leaders during priesthood session of general conference. Remember, fathers? He reminded you parents that “you have entered into a partnership with our Father in Heaven to give mortal experience to His sons and daughters. They are His children and they are your children, flesh of your flesh, for whom He will hold you responsible” (“Your Greatest Challenge, Mother,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2000, 97).</p>

In heartfelt teaching that will long be remembered, he challenged the youth of the Church to set goals for themselves to <span class="emphasis">be grateful, be smart, be clean, be true, be humble, and be prayerful.</span> The six “B’s,” as President Hinckley called them, are a marvelous standard for all Latter-day Saints. He repeated these principles to the young women in their meeting last week, and I believe they apply to mothers and fathers as much as they do to youth and young single adults. As parents and adult leaders of youth, we cannot expect our young people to take to heart the things the prophet says to them if we show a complacent attitude toward his counsel in our own lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p14" pid="rH5LjoT2606ncVnUgPIivQ" hash="7hRQiA">It is significant to remember that President Hinckley petitioned the Lord on behalf of our young people. He said, “I want you to know that I have been on my knees asking the Lord to bless me with the power and the capacity and the language to reach into your hearts” (“A Prophet’s Counsel and Prayer for Youth,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Jan. 2001, 2).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p15" pid="HuRK0fzpLEWWlGAdcj6-Qw" hash="pro7Sw">During the priesthood session President Hinckley said: “I hope [your sons and daughters] can share their burden with you, their fathers and mothers. I hope that you will listen, that you will be patient and understanding, that you will draw them to you and comfort and sustain them in their loneliness. Pray for direction. Pray for patience. Pray for the strength to love even though the offenses may have been serious. Pray for understanding and kindness and, above all, for wisdom and inspiration” (“‘Great Shall Be the Peace of Thy Children,’” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2000, 51).</p>

I know a 17-year-old who, just prior to the prophet’s talk, had pierced her ears a second time. She came home from the fireside, took off the second set of earrings, and simply said to her parents, “If President Hinckley says we should only wear one set of earrings, that’s good enough for me.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p17" pid="isIkw-0Owkq388xlXC0teA" hash="LJXwLw">Wearing two pair of earrings may or may not have eternal consequences for this young woman, but her willingness to obey the prophet will. And if she will obey him now, on something relatively simple, how much easier it will be to follow him when greater issues are at stake.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p18" pid="dnfFkjkR9UCepHk0ZWiPqg" hash="ioWuGA">Are we listening, brothers and sisters? Are we hearing the words of the prophet to us as parents, as youth leaders, and as youth? Or are we allowing ourselves, as Naaman did <span class="emphasis">at first,</span> to be blinded by pride and stubbornness, which could prevent us from receiving the blessings that come from following the teachings of God’s prophet?</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p20" pid="FuD7TDI-cUqYDodXPnbNxg" hash="VpmjDw">Now, my brothers and sisters and youth of the Church, please do not miss the opportunity to sit down together as a family and discuss the counsel given by President Hinckley. Parents, teach each other and your children in family home evenings and family councils. Leaders, know and teach these principles in lessons and leadership meetings, and discuss in ward and stake council meetings how to bless the lives of our members, both young and old. All three of the President’s addresses, along with messages to the youth from his counselors, have been published in the <span class="emphasis">Ensign</span> and the <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> magazines. <span class="emphasis">President Gordon B. Hinckley Speaks to Youth and Parents</span> is now available on video and is a wonderful resource for family home evening and for bishop’s youth discussions. Bishops, we did not send this to you to sit on your filing cabinet. Please see that the youth of your ward listen again and understand and commit to live as directed by the President of the Church.</p>

As I have traveled throughout the Church these past few months I have noticed that many of you are eagerly following his counsel. Many of you have already made the decision to be even more well groomed than you were before. Many of you are striving more diligently to avoid evil talk, to choose your friends wisely, to stay away from pornography and illicit drugs, to not attend evil concerts and dangerous parties, to respect your bodies and keep yourselves morally clean in every way. To those of you who have not listened yet, I caution you to not disregard the counsel of the President of the Church. He has spoken to you plainly. Study his words and strive to obey them. They are true and come from God. We encourage you who need to repent to go forward with faith and become clean before the Lord. Each one of you is preparing now to be a leader in the Church in the future, and we need you to be clean and faithful and true to the Lord.</p>

Did you feel how precious you are as he prayed? “Bless them that they may walk acceptably before Thee as Thy cherished sons and daughters. Each is Thy child with the capacity to do great and noble things” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Jan. 2001, 11).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/his-word-ye-shall-receive.p23" pid="bRYJsSYkzEa1tEbfHXEXrg" hash="KjB6yw">Now, my dear brothers and sisters, please pay attention to those things that the leaders of the Church have taught during this general conference. Apply the teachings that will help you and your family. Let all of us, regardless of our family circumstances, bring into our homes the teachings of the prophets and the apostles to strengthen our relationships with each other and with our Father in Heaven and with the Lord Jesus Christ. I promise you in the name of the Lord that if you will listen not just with your ears but also with your heart, the Holy Ghost will manifest the truth unto you of the messages delivered by President Hinckley, his counselors, the Apostles, and other leaders of the Church. The Spirit will prompt you to know what you should do as individuals and as families in order to follow our counsel, that your testimonies might be strengthened and that you might have peace and joy.</p>

The Savior was sitting, teaching some of His disciples, when a man identified only as “a certain lawyer” stood and asked Him, “Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p2" pid="L2in0nYo-EugyBaNbSBlfQ" hash="oG0slA">Jesus knew the man’s heart and understood the question was a thinly veiled attempt to get Him to say something contrary to the law of Moses.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p3" pid="KWdVWcK10ka8sRl_tGw6tg" hash="H1TrhQ">The Savior responded to the question with two questions of His own: “What is written in the law? how readest thou?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p4" pid="upZ1fswdAki2jCijBiWhZQ" hash="X0UawQ">As you might expect, the lawyer was able to recite the law: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p5" pid="tyQZOA4UX0GhbBhPCrWJ3w" hash="_MnJzg">“Thou hast answered right,” the Savior said. “This do, and thou shalt live.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p6" pid="QAVwrYnXnUy_ZAuUetmHKw" hash="pE-5NA">But the lawyer wasn’t satisfied with that. Knowing that there were strict rules and beliefs among the Jews regarding association with those not of the faith, he pressed the Lord for more information, hoping to trap Him in controversy: “And who is my neighbour?” he asked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p7" pid="HphYBcf900uSftXPAWo28A" hash="0RPVOQ">It was time, once again, to teach. Jesus drew upon one of His favorite and most effective teaching techniques: a parable, perhaps one of the most-beloved and well-known parables in all of Christendom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p8" pid="GN-AA0yODEuExH4PJTaUvA" hash="d88laA">You know the parable, how a man from Jerusalem was on his way to Jericho and fell among thieves and was left half dead. A certain priest passed by on the other side; neither did a Levite stop to help. Then Jesus taught:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p9" pid="GYa5muO_KEKZ6TGCz5kbYg" hash="xab-Gg">“But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p13" pid="CrFjn9-Q9EGckzMzz9XUQg" hash="-aHuuQ">Then Jesus delivered His final instruction to the lawyer—and to all who have read the parable of the good Samaritan: “Go, and do thou likewise” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.25-37" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:25–37</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p14" pid="WjmDEE6tP0CGfh4sc4KK1w" hash="M3p1hQ">Every time I read this parable I am impressed with its power and its simplicity. But have you ever wondered why the Savior chose to make the hero of this story a Samaritan? There was considerable antipathy between the Jews and the Samaritans at the time of Christ. Under normal circumstances, these two groups avoided association with each other. It would still be a good, instructive parable if the man who fell among thieves had been rescued by a brother Jew.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p15" pid="rv3zy_VvRki73aMR4FPFMQ" hash="NoESkQ">His deliberate use of Jews and Samaritans clearly teaches that we are all neighbors and that we should love, esteem, respect, and serve one another despite our deepest differences—including religious, political, and cultural differences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p16" pid="WIyFJACqIkWV9Rc5545tPA" hash="4oUFPQ">That instruction continues today to be part of the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In enumerating the key doctrines of the restored Church, Joseph Smith said, while “we claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience,” we also “allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.11" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:11</a>).</p>

I recently read a news account of a tragic death in a community here in Utah. A grieving young widow was quoted: “We’ve been overwhelmed by support. We’re not Mormon, but the local ward here has been all over us with meals and help and words of comfort. It’s been a total outpouring of love, and we appreciate it” (quoted in Dick Harmon, “Former Ute’s Death Leaves Wife Coping, Wondering,” <span class="emphasis">Daily Herald</span> [Provo, Utah], 11 Aug. 2001, A3).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p18" pid="gedXzuHF-E6DLOoHzWmSIQ" hash="3Tvkqw">That’s just as it should be. If we are truly disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, we will reach out with love and understanding to all of our neighbors at all times, particularly in times of need. A recent <span class="emphasis">Church News</span> carried a story of two women who are dear friends, a “Jewish physician from New York and [a] stay-at-home [Latter-day Saint] mom of six from Utah, both a long way from home in Dallas [Texas].”</p>

I am forever grateful that assumptions were cast aside” (Shauna Erickson, “Unlikely Friends Sharing a Lifetime,” <span class="emphasis">Church News,</span> 18 Aug. 2001, 10).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p22" pid="-n1mgAbbwUGb98APlv-g7w" hash="Eppuzw">Perceptions and assumptions can be very dangerous and unfair. There are some of our members who may fail to reach out with friendly smiles, warm handshakes, and loving service to all of their neighbors. At the same time, there may be those who move into our neighborhoods who are not of our faith who come with negative preconceptions about the Church and its members. Surely good neighbors should put forth every effort to understand each other and to be kind to one another regardless of religion, nationality, race, or culture.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p23" pid="jqGBwBiCE0ySUhy4Brk37g" hash="ahTf3g">Occasionally I hear of members offending those of other faiths by overlooking them and leaving them out. This can occur especially in communities where our members are the majority. I have heard about narrow-minded parents who tell children that they cannot play with a particular child in the neighborhood simply because his or her family does not belong to our Church. This kind of behavior is not in keeping with the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. I cannot comprehend why any member of our Church would allow these kinds of things to happen. I have been a member of this Church my entire life. I have been a full-time missionary, twice a bishop, a mission president, a Seventy, and now an Apostle. I have never taught—nor have I ever heard taught—a doctrine of exclusion. I have never heard the members of this Church urged to be anything but loving, kind, tolerant, and benevolent to our friends and neighbors of other faiths.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p24" pid="8py15GVHoE6nDXxs1NsMpg" hash="pKPtbQ">The Lord expects a great deal from us. Parents, please teach your children and practice yourselves the principle of inclusion of others and not exclusion because of religious, political, or cultural differences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p25" pid="XLbfg1QdEE-HbWNeKKf1Ew" hash="2U0h1g">While it is true we declare to the world that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith and we urge our members to share their faith and testimonies with others, it has never been the policy of the Church that those who choose not to listen or to accept our message should be shunned or ignored. Indeed, the opposite is true. President Gordon B. Hinckley has repeatedly reminded us of this special obligation that we have as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. I quote just one:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p26" pid="lN4zqLL7l0SL885z03hvog" hash="uLbiwQ">“Each of us is an individual. Each of us is different. There must be respect for those differences. …</p>

Concerning these you and I may disagree. But we can do so with respect and civility” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</span> [1997], 661, 665).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p28" pid="1q3smrWigEOlLmPGNrdYKQ" hash="8E7U1w">As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we understand that we are perceived by some to be “a peculiar people” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 2:9</a>). Our doctrines and beliefs are important to us. We embrace them and cherish them. I am not suggesting for a moment that we shouldn’t. On the contrary, our peculiarity and the uniqueness of the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ are indispensable elements in offering the people of the world a clear choice. Neither am I suggesting that we should associate in any relationship that would place us or our families at spiritual risk. We must understand, however, that not everyone is going to accept our doctrine of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. For the most part, our neighbors not of our faith are good, honorable people—every bit as good and honorable as we strive to be. They care about their families, just like we do. They want to make the world a better place, just like we do. They are kind and loving and generous and faithful, just like we seek to be. Nearly 25 years ago, the First Presidency declared: “Our message … is one of special love and concern for the eternal welfare of all men and women, regardless of religious belief, race, or nationality, knowing that we are truly brothers and sisters because we are sons and daughters of the same Eternal Father” (First Presidency statement, 15 Feb. 1978).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p29" pid="goSk5rn_Nkah7X6TGp0Vvw" hash="xsl4QQ">That is our doctrine—a doctrine of inclusion. That is what we believe. That is what we have been taught. Of all people on this earth, we should be the most loving, the kindest, and the most tolerant because of that doctrine.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p31" pid="mUQpAT0UbkiwF_UL7iiq2Q" hash="0jdx1Q">First, get to know your neighbors. Learn about their families, their work, their views. Get together with them, if they are willing, and do so without being pushy and without any ulterior motives. Friendship should never be offered as a means to an end; it can and should be an end unto itself. I received a letter from a woman who recently moved to Utah, a small part of which I quote: “I must tell you, Elder Ballard, that when I greet my neighbors, or if I wave to them, they do not acknowledge my greeting. If I pass them while taking my morning or evening walk, my salutation is not returned. Other people of color consistently express similar negative responses to friendly gestures.” If members of the Church are among her neighbors, surely they must know that this should not happen. Let us cultivate meaningful relationships of mutual trust and understanding with people from different backgrounds and beliefs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p32" pid="D9Umzcn8wUubqep9PZmgQg" hash="zDPlJQ">Second, I believe it would be good if we eliminated a couple of phrases from our vocabulary: “nonmember” and “non-Mormon.” Such phrases can be demeaning and even belittling. Personally, I don’t consider myself to be a “non-Catholic” or a “non-Jew.” I am a Christian. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That is how I prefer to be identified—for who and what I am, as opposed to being identified for what I am not. Let us extend that same courtesy to those who live among us. If a collective description is needed, then “neighbors” seems to work well in most cases.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p33" pid="ibX58NYUSEC86qW_A7Lqqw" hash="uJQRMQ">And third, if neighbors become testy or frustrated because of some disagreement with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or with some law we support for moral reasons, please don’t suggest to them—even in a humorous way—that they consider moving someplace else. I cannot comprehend how any member of our Church can even think such a thing! Our pioneer ancestors were driven from place to place by uninformed and intolerant neighbors. They experienced extraordinary hardship and persecution because they thought, acted, and believed differently from others. If our history teaches us nothing else, it should teach us to respect the rights of all people to peacefully coexist with one another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p34" pid="TEiBo_LmJUSbarsEu13UsQ" hash="6NHXjA">I now speak to all those who are not of our faith. If there are issues of concern, let us talk about them. We want to be helpful. Please understand, however, that our doctrines and teachings are set by the Lord, so sometimes we will have to agree to disagree with you, but we can do so without being disagreeable. In our communities we can and must work together in an atmosphere of courtesy, respect, and civility. Here in Utah, a group of concerned citizens formed the Alliance for Unity. This effort has been endorsed by our Church as well as other churches and organizations. One of its purposes is “to seek to build a community where differing viewpoints are acknowledged and valued.” Perhaps there has never been a more important time for neighbors all around the world to stand together for the common good of one another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p35" pid="sn9Jp2ryjUyJ_oLqeEhWCw" hash="5Y1TkA">Just hours before He began the painful physical and spiritual processes of the Atonement, the Savior met with His Apostles to partake of the Feast of the Passover—His Last Supper—and to give them the final instructions He would give them in mortality. Among these teachings is the stirring, life-changing declaration: “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p36" pid="vOPRzYEMeE2Gi-1fvxtfhw" hash="Z6cxVQ">“By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.34-35" class="scriptureRef">John 13:34–35</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/doctrine-of-inclusion.p37" pid="aLtW2OQ0YkS9ASrq6MbIlA" hash="wHLSgg">That is what Jesus taught His disciples—including “a certain lawyer”—through the parable of the good Samaritan. And that is what He is teaching us today through living prophets and apostles. Love one another. Be kind to one another despite our deepest differences. Treat one another with respect and civility. I know and testify that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, and I know that He expects all of us to follow His admonition to be better neighbors, to which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I always feel so energized and enlightened during these marvelous days of teaching and testimony. I know that most of you feel the same way. Perhaps what we feel during conference is similar to the feeling experienced by the Savior’s earliest disciples as they followed Him from place to place to hear Him teach the good news of His gospel.</p>

Toiling under the domination of the Roman Empire, they yearned for freedom and peace. They awaited the Messiah; they were sure He would come to deliver them from physical and political oppression. And some responded to the Savior’s gospel of happiness and peace, although they did not yet fully appreciate all of its spiritual implications.</p>

Although they had only recently been called to the holy apostleship, they knew Him and they loved Him and believed in Him. They had left their work and their families to follow Him. In a relatively short period of time, they had heard Him teach incredible things, and they had seen Him perform mighty miracles. But this was beyond their comprehension, and the looks on their faces must have shown it.</p>

We sometimes fail to understand that the everlasting peace Jesus promises is an inner peace, born in faith, anchored by testimony, nurtured with love, and expressed through continual obedience and repentance. It is a peace of spirit that echoes through the heart and the soul. If one truly knows and experiences this inner peace, there is no fear from worldly disharmony or discord. One knows deep down inside that all is well as far as the things that really matter are concerned.</p>

There may be ease, popularity, fame, and even prosperity, but there is no peace. “Wickedness never was happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>). One cannot be at peace if one is living a life out of harmony with revealed truth. There is no peace in being mean-spirited or contentious. There is no peace in vulgarity, promiscuity, or permissiveness. There is no peace in addiction to drugs, alcohol, or pornography. There is no peace in being abusive to others in any way, whether it be emotionally, physically, or sexually, for those who are abusive will remain in mental and spiritual turmoil until they come to Christ in all humility and seek forgiveness through complete repentance.</p>

That peace for our troubled hearts only comes to us as we follow the Light of Christ, which is “given to every man, that he may know good from evil” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.16" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:16</a>), as it leads us to repent of sins and seek forgiveness. For all there is a hunger to know “the peaceable things of the kingdom” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/36.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 36:2</a>) and to taste “the fruit[s] of righteousness,” which are “sown in peace of them that make peace” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/3.18" class="scriptureRef">James 3:18</a>). In every home, neighborhood, and community, we ought to strive for peace and never be party to stirring up contention or division.</p>

The Psalmist wrote, “The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/29.11" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 29:11</a>). Isaiah referred to the Savior as “The Prince of Peace” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/9.6" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 9:6</a>). And Nephi foresaw the day among his descendants when “the Son of righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:9</a>).</p>

Certainly the historical record would suggest otherwise. Those original Apostles knew much of trial and persecution throughout the remainder of their lives, which is probably why the Lord added this insight to His promise: “Not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>).</p>

When that precious truth is discovered and gospel principles are understood and applied, great peace can distill in the hearts and souls of our Heavenly Father’s children. Said the Savior through Joseph Smith, “He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:23</a>).</p>

While I was presiding over the Canada Toronto Mission many years ago, our missionaries began teaching a family that was in spiritual darkness. They were poor, uneducated, and their personal appearance reflected a lack of appreciation or concern for normal hygiene and grooming. But they were good, honorable people—among the honest in heart that we always pray for our missionaries to find—and they responded spiritually as they felt for the first time in their lives the peace the gospel offers.</p>

Because he had been out of town for a period of time, the bishop had not yet met the newest members of his ward; so this first impression was, to say the least, unimpressive. As they walked away, I thought I could feel his knees begin to buckle.</p>

The father was wearing a clean white shirt. It was not large enough for him to fasten the top button at the neck, and he was wearing a tie that I could remember seeing on one of my elders. But his face radiated with happiness and peace. The mother and daughters looked like they had been transformed from the previous day. Their dresses were not fancy, but they were clean and lovely. They, too, had that special gospel glow. The little boys wore white shirts that were several sizes too large for them, even with the sleeves rolled up. And they were wearing ties that almost extended down to their knees. It was obvious that the missionaries had put their own white shirts and ties on these little boys so they could come to sacrament meeting appropriately dressed.</p>

Alma describes this as “[receiving God’s] image in your countenances” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>). I leaned over to the bishop again and said: “See, Bishop? We will make Saints out of them!”</p>

Through the instruction of the missionaries and the subsequent fellowshipping of their good bishop and the ward members, this entire family emerged from spiritual darkness into gospel light and truth. In that light the family was warmed, refreshed, and revitalized by the peace that comes from knowing the Lord Jesus Christ lives. The light of the gospel truths restored to earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith began to show this family the way to the temple, where one year later they received their eternal blessings.</p>

Rather, it is to be shared liberally with our families, our friends, and our communities. It is to be shared with the Church as well as those who are not members of our Church. While those around us may not choose to taste the sweetness and peace of the fulness of the restored gospel for themselves, surely they will be blessed by seeing it in our lives and feeling the peace of the gospel in our presence.

But “when they saw the danger, and the many afflictions … which the Nephites bore for them, they were moved with compassion and were desirous to take up arms in the defence of their country” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.13" class="scriptureRef">Alma 53:13</a>). Helaman and his brethren persuaded them to honor their covenant with the Lord.</p>

Although all 2,000 of the young men were wounded in battle at one time or another, not one was killed (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/57.25" class="scriptureRef">Alma 57:25</a>). Again quoting Helaman, “And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe—that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/57.26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 57:26</a>).</p>

Resolve to avoid pornography as you would avoid the most insidious disease, for that is precisely what it is. Resolve to completely abstain from tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs.

But tonight we call upon you, our young brethren of the Aaronic Priesthood, to rise up, to measure up, and to be fully prepared to serve the Lord.</p>

For those of you who are not, let tonight be the beginning of your preparation process. If you find yourself wanting in worthiness, resolve to make the appropriate changes—beginning right now. If you think you need to talk to your father and your bishop about any sins you may have committed, don’t wait; do it now. They will help you to repent and change so you can take your place as a member of the greatest generation of missionaries.</p>

The day of the “repent and go” missionary is over. You know what I’m talking about, don’t you, my young brothers? Some young men have the mistaken idea that they can be involved in sinful behavior and then repent when they’re 18 1/2 so they can go on their mission at 19. While it is true that you can repent of sins, you may or you may not qualify to serve. It is far better to keep yourselves clean and pure and valiant by doing such simple things as:</p>

We know that the most profound influence on helping young men prepare for the Melchizedek Priesthood, marriage, and fatherhood is the family. If your sons understand the basic doctrines required to become a faithful father, they will surely be ready to serve as a full-time missionary. Unfortunately, far too many fathers abdicate this eternal responsibility. You may assume that the bishop and the seminary, Sunday School, and Young Men teachers and leaders are in a better position to motivate and inspire your sons than you are. That simply is not the case. While ecclesiastical leaders are important to your son’s priesthood and missionary preparation, the Church exists as a resource to you. It is not a substitute for your inspired teaching, guidance, and correction.</p>

If we expect more of them, that means we expect more of you and your wife as well. Remember, Helaman’s 2,000 stripling warriors were faithful because “they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.21" class="scriptureRef">Alma 53:21</a>)—and that instruction came in their homes.</p>

They think that is the purview of the bishop alone. Fathers, not only do you have the right to know the worthiness of your children, you have the responsibility. It is your duty to know how your children are doing with regards to their spiritual well-being and progression. You need to monitor carefully the issues and concerns they share with you. Ask specific questions of your children regarding their worthiness, and refuse to settle for anything less than specific answers.</p>

That procedure should actually flow the other direction. Parents should be so intimately aware of what is going on in their children’s lives that they know about the problems before the bishop does. They should be counseling with their children and going with them to their bishops if that becomes necessary for complete repentance. As divinely appointed judges in Israel, the bishop and the stake president determine worthiness and resolve concerns on behalf of the Church; but, fathers, you have an eternal responsibility for the spiritual welfare of your children. Please assume your rightful place as counselor, adviser, and priesthood leader in preparing your sons to bear the Melchizedek Priesthood and to serve as missionaries.</p>

I realize there are many young men who don’t have a faithful father in their home. In these cases, use the resources of the Church to see that these Aaronic Priesthood holders are taught by Melchizedek Priesthood brethren who can help them to prepare for their future priesthood service. Upon you bishops and you stake presidents rests the responsibility to recommend only those young men and women whom you judge to be spiritually, physically, mentally, and emotionally prepared to face today’s realities of missionary work. Brethren, judge wisely and remember: not every young man needs to be called to serve away from his home; some may best serve under your direction as ward missionaries.</p>

Tonight is a good time for each of you to take a close look at your performance; and if you are not measuring up, your mission president will help you make the necessary changes to be an effective, dedicated servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

You spent two years as a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ. We expect you to always look and act like one of His disciples. Look the part. Act the part. Don’t follow worldly trends and fashions. You are better than that. If you have slipped, then do what is necessary to regain your spiritual balance. The rules for happiness and success after your mission are pretty much the same as they were during your mission: pray hard, work hard, and be obedient. Get busy now and find your eternal companion to enjoy life with. Serve the Lord together, and raise up the next great generation.</p>

I hope you can feel the love and the concern that emanates from the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and other Church leaders as we ask you to prepare now to join us in taking the blessings of the restored gospel to all the people on the earth. Each one of you is precious, and we want you to be successful and secure in the battle for the souls of our Heavenly Father’s children. May God bless you with the courage to be “true at all times” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.20" class="scriptureRef">Alma 53:20</a>) and with the vision to realize who you are and what the Lord has for you to do, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

That one moment in time changed everything forever. The Savior broke down every barrier that stood in the way of our return to a loving Heavenly Father. In return He asks that we “go … and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p>

On the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Jesus asked Peter three times, “Lovest thou me?” Each time Peter’s reply was the same: “Thou knowest that I love thee.” And each time the Savior instructed Peter: “Feed my lambs. … Feed my sheep. … Feed my sheep” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.15-17" class="scriptureRef">John 21:15–17</a>).</p>

Like Peter and his brethren of old, the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ today have the charge to take the gospel to all the world. This charge is seldom far from our minds. Every General Authority has the responsibility to be a missionary.</p>

He was also talking to every person who has been blessed to hear the gospel and is a member of His Church. In revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord puts it in very simple terms: “It becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.81" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:81</a>).</p>

We asked them to be worthy, qualified, spiritually energized missionaries. With the unsettled conditions that exist in the world today, they need to be “the greatest generation of missionaries in the history of the Church.” (See M. Russell Ballard, “The Greatest Generation of Missionaries,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2002, 46; <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Nov. 2002, 46.) We don’t expect them to be perfect, but they need to be anxious, willing, and committed to serve so they can reach new levels of spirituality as gospel teachers. They need to know the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and teach it with power in their own words under the guiding influence of the Holy Spirit.</p>

This worldwide effort has been referred to as “raising the bar” or “raising the standard.” We thank you parents, bishops, and stake presidents for your support in this effort. We also thank the faithful youth of the Church for your willingness to live up to the Lord’s standard. May our Heavenly Father continue to bless you as you prepare to serve Him in this troubled world.</p>

We need your help, brothers and sisters, to support and assist our missionaries in finding and baptizing many more of our Heavenly Father’s children. We need you to watch over, protect, and inspire the missionaries, who are servants of the Lord. If the standard is to be raised, it is raised for all of us. We must be more faithful. We must be more spiritually in tune. We must prepare ourselves to assist the missionaries in finding those of our Heavenly Father’s children who will embrace the message of the Restoration.</p>

We’re not selling anything. We’re not trying to impress anyone with our numbers or our growth.

Ask the Lord to open the way. Prayerfully set a date with your family to have someone in your home for the missionaries to teach. Remember, brothers and sisters, this is the Lord’s Church. Let Him guide you through constant prayer. With a prayer in your heart, talk to everyone you can. Don’t prejudge. Don’t withhold the good news from anyone. Talk to everyone, and trust in the promised power of the Spirit to give you the words you should say. Let them make the decision to accept or reject your invitation. Over time, the Lord will put into your path those who are seeking the truth. He is the Good Shepherd. He knows His sheep, and they will know His voice, spoken through you, and they will follow Him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.title" class="scriptureRef">John 10</a>).</p>

Hinckley said, “It will be a great day when our people not only pray for the missionaries throughout the world, but ask the Lord to help them to assist the missionaries who are laboring in their own ward” (“Missionary Service,” <span class="emphasis">First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</span> Jan. 2003, 19).</p>

He was a humble man, driving a milk delivery truck for a living. Through his fasting and earnest prayer, the Spirit taught him what he and the members of his branch needed to do to help the Church grow in their area. Through his great faith, constant prayer, and powerful example, he taught his members how to share the gospel. It’s a marvelous story, one of the great missionary stories of this dispensation. In just one year, there were 450 convert baptisms in the branch. The next year there were an additional 200 converts. President McLaughlin indicated: “My job as branch president was to teach [the new converts] how to be Mormons. I had to teach them how to give talks and lessons in church. I had to teach them how to teach the gospel to their children. I trained the new members to become strong members.” Pretty simple.</p>

Much of the leadership of that new stake came from those converts in the Farmingdale Branch. Now we might ask why there was such great success in those days, and the answer may be because of the urgent need to strengthen the Church. Let me assure you that that same urgency in all units of the Church is every bit as critical today as it was then.</p>

Stake presidents and bishops have the responsibility and accountability to help members find the pure in heart and prepare them for baptism and for a life of service within their wards and stakes. President Hinckley has also said, “I would like to suggest that every bishop in the Church give as a motto to his people, ‘Let’s all work to grow the ward’” (“Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1999, 106; <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> July 1999, 120).</p>

This is what he is doing. Through priesthood and auxiliary leaders, the ward council coordinates missionary work in the ward. Missionaries are invited to ward council meetings to discuss their work. Members are assigned to attend investigator visits with the missionaries. Members and missionaries also visit less-active and part-member families together. Last year this ward baptized and confirmed 46 new members, and retention of those members is very high. Those who come into the Church or who return to activity in this ward already have friends because the priesthood and auxiliaries are involved in the conversion process by direction of the bishop through the ward council (see “Ward Council Is Secret of Centralia Ward Success,” <span class="emphasis">Church News,</span> 1 Feb. 2003, 5).</p>

You will see that the Lord will bless you and your members with many more converts and many more who will return to full activity. Missionary work should not only be on the ward council agendas but also on elders quorum; Relief Society; and other quorum, group, and auxiliary agendas. Emphasis should be placed on baptizing and retaining in activity fathers and mothers along with their children. Thus the missionary work of priesthood and auxiliary leaders should be coordinated by the ward mission leader and the bishop through the ward council. And by doing so, converts will be fully active members in their wards.</p>

Invite your neighbors and friends to spend an evening with you during the Easter season, sharing together the life, ministry, and glorious Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. It may also be appropriate to have the missionaries attend with you and teach how the Lord has restored His Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>

It does require faith—real faith and trust in the Lord. It also requires genuine love. The first great commandment is to “love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. … The second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.37,39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:37, 39</a>).</p>

Most everyone wants to enjoy peace and happiness. That is a natural human desire. People want to find answers to the problems they face. This is increasingly true in the world we now live in.</p>

Happiness comes from understanding God and knowing that He has a plan for our eternal joy and peace. Happiness comes from knowing and loving the Savior and living our lives in accordance with His teachings. Happiness comes from strong family and Church relationships based on gospel values.</p>

How could anyone be offended when we say something like this: “I love the way my church helps me” and then add whatever the Spirit directs. It’s when we appear only to be fulfilling an assignment and we fail to express real interest and love that we offend others. Don’t ever forget, brothers and sisters, that you and I have in our possession the very points of doctrine that will bring people to the Lord. The restored gospel of Jesus Christ has within it the power to bring deep and abiding happiness to the human soul—something that will be valued and cherished for the rest of time and for all eternity. We are not just trying to get people to join our Church; we are sharing with them the fulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. But as powerful as our message is, it cannot be imposed or forced upon people. It can only be shared—heart to heart, soul to soul, spirit to spirit—by being good neighbors and by caring and showing love. We need to be watchful for one another and reach out to one another. And as we do so, we will radiate the gospel in our own lives, and it will radiate to the people the blessings the gospel has to offer.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p1" pid="AybSuKvWLUScRsed9VhiEQ" hash="LZz-Cg">The fall of the year is when television airs its season premieres and introduces its new shows. A friend told me that there are 37 new TV series being inaugurated this fall. As he has read the reviews, he has found few if any of them that he would want his children to watch. Most of the sitcoms, dramas, and reality shows contain immorality, violence, and subtle ridicule of traditional values and traditional families. Each year the new shows seem to get worse, pushing the envelope of what the public will accept. What comes out of Hollywood, off the Internet, and in much of today’s music creates a web of decadence that can trap our children and endanger all of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p2" pid="6bCJYsms2kWkqnDOpnYZ3Q" hash="gl8ZPA">Church leaders have the responsibility to speak out on moral issues and to counsel individuals and families. The family is the basic unit of society; it is the basic unit of eternity. Thus, when forces threaten the family, Church leaders must respond.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p3" pid="L6GuA0mvZkqb7VSOffhGmw" hash="aicWRw">The family is at the heart of Heavenly Father’s plan because we are all part of His family and because mortality is our opportunity to form our own families and to assume the role of parents. It is within our families that we learn unconditional love, which can come to us and draw us very close to God’s love. It is within families that values are taught and character is built. Father and mother are callings from which we will never be released, and there is no more important stewardship than the responsibility we have for God’s spirit children who come into our families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p4" pid="FpnYjJX4OUmXhrTuZ3mzeQ" hash="OPrAbA">Within this context of the preeminent importance of families and the threats families face today, it is not surprising that the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles used strong words in the proclamation to the world on families: “We warn that individuals … who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> One such prophet was Malachi, who admonished parents to turn their hearts to their children and children to their parents, lest the whole earth be cursed (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 4:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p5" pid="AlzDKehsaU2JetJxtCDOkw" hash="sOIdrg">To these warnings, ancient as the Old Testament and current as the proclamation on the family, I add my own voice of warning, specifically concerning today’s media and the powerful negative effect it can have on families and on family life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p6" pid="ezvEQ7-e3kuSTnU3jMgXBQ" hash="5DXcQg">Because of its sheer size, media today presents vast and sharply contrasting options. Opposite from its harmful and permissive side, media offers much that is positive and productive. Television offers history channels, discovery channels, education channels. One can still find movies and TV comedies and dramas that entertain and uplift and accurately depict the consequences of right and wrong. The Internet can be a fabulous tool of information and communication, and there is an unlimited supply of good music in the world. Thus our biggest challenge is to choose wisely what we listen to and what we watch.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p7" pid="7Xfx2TEbUkeOCBfPGgkK8A" hash="9ev30A">As the prophet Lehi said, because of Christ and His Atonement, we are “free forever, knowing good from evil,” able to act for ourselves rather than be acted upon, “free to choose liberty and eternal life … or to choose captivity and death” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.26-27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:26–27</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p8" pid="9BcWfEC260O942ypHzVrOA" hash="fCPZog">The choices we make in media can be symbolic of the choices we make in life. Choosing the trendy, the titillating, the tawdry in the TV programs or movies we watch can cause us to end up, if we’re not careful, choosing the same things in the lives we live.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p9" pid="WF5HPOi7i0uypn9u038BwA" hash="5rD4sA">If we do not make good choices, the media can devastate our families and pull our children away from the narrow gospel path. In the virtual reality and the perceived reality of large and small screens, family-destructive viewpoints and behavior are regularly portrayed as pleasurable, as stylish, as exciting, and as normal. Often media’s most devastating attacks on family are not direct or frontal or openly immoral. Intelligent evil is too cunning for that, knowing that most people still profess belief in family and in traditional values. Rather the attacks are subtle and <span class="emphasis">amoral</span>—issues of right and wrong don’t even come up. Immorality and sexual innuendo are everywhere, causing some to believe that because everyone is doing it, it must be all right. This pernicious evil is not out in the street somewhere; it is coming right into our homes, right into the heart of our families.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p13" pid="ieOTpYgwMESYipAo6c1Paw" hash="GMIsFw">The new morality preached from the media’s pulpit is nothing more than the old immorality. It attacks religion. It undermines the family. It turns virtue into vice and vice into virtue. It assaults the senses and batters the soul with messages and images that are neither virtuous, nor lovely, nor of good report, nor praiseworthy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p14" pid="XI8rOqpE4kqg3r5DQJX7gA" hash="KRVbKw">The time has come when members of the Church need to speak out and join with the many other concerned people in opposition to the offensive, destructive, and mean-spirited media influence that is sweeping over the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p15" pid="kB5kZiVT2E6HgsRV1riiGg" hash="OfVuOg">According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the percentage of television prime-time shows with sexual content jumped from 67 percent in 1998 to 75 percent in the year 2000.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Media with this kind of content has numerous negative effects. It fosters a callous attitude toward women, who are often portrayed as objects of abuse and not as precious daughters of God who are essential to His eternal plan. The long-cherished values of abstinence from intimate relationships before marriage and complete fidelity between husband and wife after marriage are denigrated and derided. Children and youth are confused and misled by the deviant behavior they see demonstrated by so-called stars they admire and want to emulate. In the moral confusion created by the media, enduring values are being abandoned.</p>

Some become so addicted to viewing Internet pornography and participating in dangerous online chat rooms that they ignore their marriage covenants and family obligations and often put their employment at risk. Many run afoul of the law. Others develop a tolerance to their perverted behavior, taking ever more risks to feed their immoral addiction. Marriages crumble and relationships fail, as addicts often lose everything of real, eternal value.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p17" pid="Vvr5K2qkQUyVYdOEv1adpg" hash="3n7Amw">According to one social observer: “Television … has replaced the family, the school, and the church—in that order—as the principal [instrument] for socialization and transmission of values. … Greed, debauchery, violence, unlimited self-gratification, absence of moral restraint … are the daily fare glamorously dished up to our children.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p18" pid="9Vmr5vVzfUeTClvc9Ke2qg" hash="RTL9aQ">We must be concerned with the violent and sexually charged lyrics of much of today’s popular music and the relatively new “art form” of the music video. According to industry observers, 40 percent of the music video audience is under the age of 18.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> One study reports that approximately three-fourths of all the music videos that tell a story utilize sexual imagery, and nearly half involve violence.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> And the fashion trends spawned in their images are about as far away from being “virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy” as you can get. Ours surely is a time when men “call evil good, and good evil” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/5.20" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 5:20</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p19" pid="k_03FlNQb0uBfH2-lgxT2w" hash="z6z8_A">Let me say again that the family is the main target of evil’s attack and must therefore be the main point of our protection and defense. As I said once before, when you stop and think about it from a diabolically tactical point of view, fighting the family makes sense to Satan. When he wants to disrupt the work of the Lord, he doesn’t poison the world’s peanut butter supply, thus bringing the Church’s missionary system to its collective knees. He doesn’t send a plague of laryngitis to afflict the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. He doesn’t legislate against green Jell-O and casseroles. When evil wants to strike out and disrupt the essence of God’s work, it attacks the family. It does so by attempting to disregard the law of chastity, to confuse gender, to desensitize violence, to make crude and blasphemous language the norm, and to make immoral and deviant behavior seem like the rule rather than the exception.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/let-our-voices-be-heard.p20" pid="lrAn4v29akyhdWbjPArV8Q" hash="qEiWng">We need to remember Edmund Burke’s statement: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> We need to raise our voices with other concerned citizens throughout the world in opposition to current trends. We need to tell the sponsors of offensive media that we have had enough. We need to support programs and products that are positive and uplifting. Joining together with neighbors and friends who share our concerns, we can send a clear message to those responsible. The Internet Web sites and their local affiliates will have their addresses. Letters and e-mails have more effect than most people realize, especially those like one sent by a Relief Society sister that stated, “I represent a group of over a hundred women that meets every week and often talks about the harm your program is doing to our children.”</p>

We should teach our family members to follow the First Presidency’s counsel to young people. From the <span class="emphasis">For the Strength of Youth</span> pamphlet, their instruction regarding entertainment and the media is very clear:</p>

Nathan had served in the Russian-speaking Baltic Mission. He loved the people and knew it was a privilege to serve the Lord. Three months after I officiated at his eternal marriage to his sweetheart, Jennifer, this accident took his life. Nathan’s being taken so suddenly from our mortal presence has turned each of our hearts and minds to the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Were it not for the plan of our Heavenly Father, established before the world began, in a very real sense, all mankind—past, present, and future—would have been left without the hope of eternal progression. As a result of Adam’s transgression, mortals were separated from God (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/6.23" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 6:23</a>) and would be forever unless a way was found to break the bands of death. This would not be easy, for it required the vicarious sacrifice of one who was sinless and who could therefore take upon Himself the sins of all mankind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/the-atonement-and-the-value-of-one-soul.p4" pid="nBb5PqX8Lk6ublMT56VqmA" hash="rhx0uA">Thankfully, Jesus Christ courageously fulfilled this sacrifice in ancient Jerusalem. There in the quiet isolation of the Garden of Gethsemane, He knelt among the gnarled olive trees, and in some incredible way that none of us can fully comprehend, the Savior took upon Himself the sins of the world. Even though His life was pure and free of sin, He paid the ultimate penalty for sin—yours, mine, and everyone who has ever lived. His mental, emotional, and spiritual anguish were so great they caused Him to bleed from every pore (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.44" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:44</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:18</a>). And yet Jesus suffered willingly so that we might all have the opportunity to be washed clean—through having faith in Him, repenting of our sins, being baptized by proper priesthood authority, receiving the purifying gift of the Holy Ghost by confirmation, and accepting all other essential ordinances. Without the Atonement of the Lord, none of these blessings would be available to us, and we could not become worthy and prepared to return to dwell in the presence of God.</p>

Recently, there has been a great deal of commentary about this, none of which has made clear the singular point that no one had the power to take the Savior’s life from Him. He gave it as a ransom for us all. As the Son of God, He had the power to alter the situation. Yet the scriptures clearly state that He yielded Himself to scourging, humiliation, suffering, and finally crucifixion because of His great love towards the children of men (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.9-10" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 19:9–10</a>).</p>

How grateful we should be that our Heavenly Father did not intercede but rather withheld His fatherly instinct to rescue His Beloved Son. Because of His eternal love for you and for me, He allowed Jesus to complete His foreordained mission to become our Redeemer. The gift of resurrection and immortality is given freely through the loving grace of Jesus Christ to all people of all ages, regardless of their good or evil acts. And to those who choose to love the Lord and who show their love and faith in Him by keeping His commandments and qualifying for the full blessings of the Atonement, He offers the additional promise of exaltation and eternal life, which is the blessing of living in the presence of God and His Beloved Son forever.</p>

Our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. This experience began the restoration of powerful doctrinal truths that had been lost for centuries. Among those truths that had been dimmed by the darkness of apostasy was the stirring reality that we are all the spirit sons and daughters of a loving God who is our Father. We are part of His family. He is not a father in some allegorical or poetic sense. He is literally the Father of our spirits. He cares for each one of us. Though this world has a way of diminishing and demeaning men and women, the reality is we are all of royal, divine lineage. In that unprecedented appearance of the Father and the Son in the Sacred Grove, the very first word spoken by the Father of us all was the personal name of Joseph. Such is our Father’s personal relationship with each of us. He knows our names and yearns for us to become worthy to return to live with Him.</p>

Surely many more senior couples and others whose health will permit would eagerly desire to serve the Lord as missionaries if they would ponder over the meaning of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.

One meeting was in a metropolitan area where we have approximately 14,000 Church members living within a population of nearly 21 million people. If that same ratio were applied to this meeting, in the Conference Center we would have only 13 members of the Church scattered among this congregation of over 20,000.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p2" pid="kinjcbHx1kCmPnApFzTHuw" hash="X9k39Q">This experience impressed upon me how deeply grateful we must all be to know that after ages of darkness and apostasy, Joseph Smith beheld a remarkable vision of the Father and the Son in the Sacred Grove. Clearly, in our world today it is a rare and precious thing to have a testimony that God our Heavenly Father lives; that His Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer; and that priesthood authority to administer the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored once again upon the earth. The profound blessing of having a testimony of these truths cannot be measured or ever taken for granted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p3" pid="qJ7bjxBLnE6Tcr_FkmaSRA" hash="Ub4PEg">Personal testimony is the foundation of our faith. It is the binding power that makes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints unique in the lives of its members, as compared with all other religious denominations of the world. The doctrine of the Restoration is glorious in and of itself, but the thing that makes it powerful and imbues it with great meaning is the personal testimonies of Church members worldwide who accept the Restoration of the gospel and strive to live its teachings every day of their lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p4" pid="AMZGP8XPrEiGrA2XaTelUA" hash="vgmxtA">A testimony is a witness or confirmation of eternal truth impressed upon individual hearts and souls through the Holy Ghost, whose primary ministry is to testify of truth, particularly as it relates to the Father and the Son. When one receives a testimony of truth through this divinely appointed process, it immediately begins to have impact on that person’s life. According to Alma the Younger, “it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves … the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:28</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p5" pid="jYTrKD5tOk6qgvHEY-_Y1w" hash="17SYTw">Simply stated, testimony—real testimony, born of the Spirit and confirmed by the Holy Ghost—changes lives. It changes how you think and what you do. It changes what you say. It affects every priority you set and every choice you make. To have a real and abiding testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to be “spiritually … born of God,” to “[receive] his image in your countenances,” and to experience a “mighty change in your hearts” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p6" pid="bYyA0O6TyE-78ijTzBE7ow" hash="r8lZGg">Like almost everything else in life, testimonies grow and develop through experience and service. We often hear some members, and especially children, bear their testimonies, listing things for which they are thankful: their love of family, the Church, their teachers, their friends. For them, the gospel is something that they are grateful for because it makes them feel happy and secure. This is a good beginning, but testimonies need to be much more. They need to be anchored very early to the first principles of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p7" pid="DyNYpIT6F0qIQsClbdaPkQ" hash="3bnUVw">A testimony of the reality of Heavenly Father’s love, of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, and of the effect of His Atonement on every son and daughter of God brings about the desire to repent and live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. It also brings a confirmation to our soul of the Restoration of the gospel in these latter days. Real testimony of these precious truths comes as a witness by the Holy Ghost after sincere and dedicated effort, including teaching in the home, prayer, scripture study, service to others, and diligent obedience to Heavenly Father’s commandments. To gain and forever hold on to a testimony of gospel truths is worth whatever price in spiritual preparation we may be required to pay.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p8" pid="WLgvoENXhUGWgsMmG4L0_w" hash="XtPyZg">My experience throughout the Church leads me to worry that too many of our members’ testimonies linger on “I am thankful” and “I love,” and too few are able to say with humble but sincere clarity, “I know.” As a result, our meetings sometimes lack the testimony-rich, spiritual underpinnings that stir the soul and have meaningful, positive impact on the lives of all those who hear them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p9" pid="OcCesVqi8UKBcVU_mjPKnw" hash="3C_Syg">Our testimony meetings need to be more centered on the Savior, the doctrines of the gospel, the blessings of the Restoration, and the teachings of the scriptures. We need to replace stories, travelogues, and lectures with pure testimonies. Those who are entrusted to speak and teach in our meetings need to do so with doctrinal power that will be both heard and felt, lifting the spirits and edifying our people. You will remember at the heart of King Benjamin’s powerful sermon to his people was his personal witness of the Savior, who at that time had yet to be born into mortality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p10" pid="WQX58FNWQkOM0GV0LETGKw" hash="1FRszA">At one point in the king’s sermon, when he had just borne witness to the people, “The Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy … because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.3" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p11" pid="qR5gLay8RU6wZG-vx5v9og" hash="quWPXQ">And that is because the Spirit cannot be restrained when pure testimony of Christ is borne. Thus, King Benjamin’s people were so inspired by his testimony that their lives were changed right there, on the spot; and they became as new people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p12" pid="agpv3o3vfEiNhfbcM4qIFQ" hash="U_VG5g">Remember also Abinadi and Alma. Abinadi infuriated wicked King Noah with his courageous testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. Eventually this great missionary offered the ultimate sacrifice for his witness and faith but not before his pure testimony touched one believing heart. Alma, one of King Noah’s priests, “repented of his sins … , [accepted Jesus as the Christ,] and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.1" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:1</a>). Many were converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ as a direct result of Abinadi’s powerfully borne testimony of the Savior, believed by one soul, Alma.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p13" pid="kALiQji54EGYEOZIa-DSOQ" hash="j5TA9g">The Apostle Paul also bore fervent testimony of Christ and converted many through his missionary labors. He did not shrink in bearing his testimony before King Agrippa. So mighty were his words that even this influential representative of the Roman Empire was moved to exclaim, “Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/26.28" class="scriptureRef">Acts 26:28</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p14" pid="Zywnc7EcpEGhfTitwqQazA" hash="6r3xqQ">The lesson, I believe, is clear: having a testimony alone is not enough. In fact, when we are truly converted, we cannot be restrained from testifying. And as it was with Apostles and faithful members of old, so is it also our privilege, our duty, and our solemn obligation to “declare the things which [we] know to be true” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/80.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 80:4</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p15" pid="gFwJ28WPLkCdZf2yo4BFHQ" hash="r1epdw">Again, please keep in mind that we are talking about sharing real testimony, not just speaking generally about the things we are thankful for. While it is always good to express love and gratitude, such expressions do not constitute the kind of testimony that will ignite a fire of belief in the lives of others. To bear testimony is “to bear witness by the power of the Holy Ghost; to make a solemn declaration of truth based on personal knowledge or belief” (Guide to the Scriptures, “Testify,” 241). Clear declaration of truth makes a difference in people’s lives. That is what changes hearts. That is what the Holy Ghost can confirm in the hearts of God’s children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p16" pid="kUheziT9hki8LudRqt1sOw" hash="UAu_Og">Although we can have testimonies of many things as members of the Church, there are basic truths we need to constantly teach one another and share with those not of our faith. Testify God is our Father and Jesus is the Christ. The plan of salvation is centered on the Savior’s Atonement. Joseph Smith restored the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ, and the Book of Mormon is evidence that our testimony is true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p17" pid="NZYkdt_BY0GLyfCQ-bkhnA" hash="1YaCfQ">Miraculous things happen when members join with missionaries and share pure testimony with those who are not members of the Church. For example, while many people were touched by Alma’s testimony in the land of Ammonihah, when Amulek stood and added his testimony to Alma’s, “the people began to be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who testified” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/10.12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 10:12</a>). The same thing can happen with us today. As we stand together the Lord will help us find many more of His sheep who will know His voice as we unitedly share our testimonies with them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p18" pid="oQXO3amaCESn_aQ86VusfA" hash="CJMoZg">Many years ago Brigham Young told of an early missionary in the Church who was asked to share his testimony with a large group of people. According to President Young, this particular elder “never had been able to say that he knew Joseph [Smith] was a Prophet.” He would have preferred to just say a prayer and leave, but the circumstances made that impossible. So he started to speak, and “as soon as he got ‘Joseph’ out, ‘is a Prophet,’ was … next; and from that, his tongue was loosened, and he continued talking until near sun-down.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p19" pid="tH6lgpt8Lki1Vy-_WMB7xg" hash="vjhZOw">President Young used this experience to teach that “the Lord pours out His Spirit upon a man, when he testifies that [which] the Lord gives him to testify of” (<span class="emphasis">Millennial Star,</span> supplement, 1853, 30).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p20" pid="lq3KBiqfGEKzICMUn6Hmsw" hash="pku3eA">The Prophet’s brother Hyrum understood this and testified fearlessly of divine truth as it had been revealed to his brother Joseph and confirmed in his own heart. His testimony blessed the lives of many, including Parley P. Pratt. When Parley first encountered the Book of Mormon, Hyrum took him into his own home and spent the night teaching and testifying to him. He bore witness of the prophetic mantle that rested upon Joseph and of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. Shortly thereafter Hyrum set aside his own needs and went with Parley to honor his request for baptism (see <span class="emphasis">Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt,</span> ed. Parley P. Pratt Jr. [1938], 35–42).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p21" pid="9qY5cApZx0KtNRLxXqAdsw" hash="uLbQ0g">We may never fully comprehend or be able to measure the far-reaching effects of Hyrum’s one-on-one testimony to Parley P. Pratt. In addition to Parley’s faithful posterity, his apostolic witness and missionary service drew countless souls into the kingdom of God. Interestingly, included among those who joined the Church as a direct result of his ministry in Canada were Joseph Fielding and his sisters, Mary and Mercy. After his first wife, Jerusha, died, Hyrum met and married Mary Fielding, and from their marriage came President Joseph F. Smith and countless other members and Church leaders. Now I realize that not all testimonies will return such a blessing as Hyrum’s did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p22" pid="SWcc8Q2UgUyDkie6VHC8wg" hash="BoBUJw">Joseph Kimber, a humble new convert in Thatcham, England, bore his simple testimony to a fellow farmhand. I believe Brother Kimber’s witness of Joseph Smith and the Restoration is what ignited the fire of belief in 17-year-old Henry Ballard’s heart and caused him to ask to be baptized. Generations of the Ballard family are the beneficiaries of that humble testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p23" pid="q7RZx62HFUu1TYsVbPfKJA" hash="_uWegQ">Members and missionaries in our day can have the experience of converting others by living our lives as best we can and being prepared “to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>). A friend recently told me about being on a 90-minute bus ride in Brazil. He felt impressed to go to the back of the bus to speak to the young people who had been serving as guides for his group of businessmen. An associate of his father followed him to the back of the bus and heard his testimony of the truthfulness of the restored gospel. This man later said, “When I heard your testimony, I had the distinct feeling go through my whole body that these things were true.” He and his wife will soon be baptized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p24" pid="wKb7EBynuUWdVMGQqAa6CQ" hash="3seC-A">The missionaries are now preparing to teach the lessons, not as memorized dialogue or a rote presentation; but rather, they will outline gospel principles in an organized way, calling upon the Spirit to direct how they communicate gospel truth to investigators, spirit to spirit and heart to heart. Brothers and sisters, join together with the missionaries in sharing your precious testimony every day, witnessing at every opportunity the glorious message of the Restoration. The fire of your testimony is all that you need in order to introduce the gospel to many more of our Father’s children. Trust in the Lord, and never underestimate the impact your testimony can have upon the lives of others as you bear it with the power of the Spirit. Doubt and fear are tools of Satan. The time has come for all of us to overcome any fear and boldly take every opportunity to share our testimonies of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/pure-testimony.p25" pid="oaOQgKVbXkOeJKJM9m8C1w" hash="U34wfw">May the Lord bless you as you continue to nurture your testimonies through your prayers, your personal gospel study, and your acts of service. With great joy I humbly testify our Heavenly Father loves us, Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith restored the fulness of the everlasting gospel, and the Book of Mormon testifies of these truths. We are led by a living prophet today. And I pray that the Lord may bless you, my dear brothers and sisters, as you teach and testify, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p1" pid="7aMYfk6b60Sqeeh6Hw2pTQ" hash="70kv9Q">Brothers and sisters, a few weeks ago Sister Ballard and I enjoyed speaking to the missionaries at the Provo Missionary Training Center. We were thrilled to see their radiant, eager faces and feel the presence of the Spirit of the Lord. These fine missionaries are well on their way to carrying the message of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world. We thank parents, bishops, stake presidents, and especially our young people for responding to the prophet’s call for more thorough spiritual preparation to serve the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p2" pid="mFJLsJhRbUCjFv45AXmihQ" hash="t7vZ1w">As we “raised the bar” for missionary service, President Gordon B. Hinckley said: “This work is rigorous. It demands strength and vitality. It demands mental sharpness and capacity. It demands faith, desire, and consecration. It demands clean hands and a pure heart.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p3" pid="8r5aZ6R9n0Sx8JDTSzKB1g" hash="ICj9Eg">He went on to say: “The time has come when we must raise the standards of those who are called … as ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ. … We simply cannot permit those who have not qualified themselves as to worthiness to go into the world to speak the glad tidings of the gospel” (“Missionary Service,” <span class="emphasis">Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</span> Jan. 11, 2003, 17).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p4" pid="8OIZejS60EKznIOGn3Sxyg" hash="a4dwvw">Today, we call for more qualified missionaries, young men who have prepared to serve by accepting the challenge of our prophet “to practice self-discipline, to live above the low standards of the world, to avoid transgression and take the high road in all their activities” (“Missionary Service,” 17).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p5" pid="rqYYzUpURkWmYWnwN1JwqQ" hash="EPM26Q">The work of the Lord in our 339 missions is expanding, so we must increase our efforts to see that every 12-year-old young man is worthily ordained a deacon; every 14-year-old, a teacher; every 16-year-old, a priest; and that every 18 to 19-year-old worthily receives the Melchizedek Priesthood. We can do this by filling the hearts of our young men with love for the Lord, understanding and appreciation of His Atonement, and a clear vision of the marvel of the Restoration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p6" pid="Krtqu5YP90WpMU1oRF3ADA" hash="xilkbA">When our youth understand the significance of the Restoration of the gospel and know for themselves that God is our Heavenly Father and He loves all of His children, that Jesus is the Christ, and that together They personally visited Joseph Smith to open this, the final dispensation of time, they will want to help carry this message to the world. When our youth see the Book of Mormon as tangible evidence that the message of the Restoration is true, they will be filled with a desire to do their part in teaching these truths to our Heavenly Father’s children.</p>
      <div class="figure" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.f2">
	<p pid="IcxfQmb1oEiOWwpm-qxC1w" hash="zaEOYA">We learned from the missionaries at the Missionary Training Center what would have helped them most to prepare for their mission. Above all else they wished they had:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p7" pid="-UqE16GqZkiG6UgMlwFcTw" hash="-n6dmg">Brothers and sisters, together we can teach the gospel of Jesus Christ, in its simplicity and power, to all of our youth in the Church. Working with parents, we can help them prepare for a mission and a lifetime of service. Let us go forward to search for every one of our precious youth, regardless of their activity level, illuminating the Light of Christ that is within them. President Boyd K. Packer said: “The Light of Christ is as universal as sunlight itself. Wherever there is human life, there is the Spirit of Christ. Every living soul is possessed of it. … It is the inspirer of everything that will bless and benefit mankind. It nourishes goodness itself” (“The Light of Christ,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Apr. 2005, 13).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p8" pid="ngx7ONSzOEi1jzECT_NC_A" hash="SYUHng">So we know that all have within them the Light of Christ. Our responsibility as parents, teachers, and leaders is to kindle that light in our youth until the flame of testimony burns deep within their hearts and souls and then to encourage each one of them to take that flame and use it to help kindle the Light of Christ in others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p9" pid="IDzntuFPCkqXblCWF4bJZA" hash="Sti0ug">Of course, the adversary knows this and is working overtime to influence some of our youth to disregard the teachings of the Church. That is why parents, leaders, and teachers need to counsel together and know every young man and young woman—every one. Whether they are active or not, we need to know them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p10" pid="9NtyvJQWgUWpO6AzwIBKuA" hash="QZAfCw">It is true that the bar has been raised for our missionaries. This means that the bar has been raised for parents and leaders as well. We will need to increase our faith and expand our efforts to give every young man the opportunity to serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p11" pid="sRjg7wRiakSUmTPel6o2CA" hash="AmcbZA">President Hinckley also expressed this concern: “We need more missionaries. The message to raise the bar on missionary qualifications was not a signal to send fewer missionaries but … a call for parents and leaders to work with young men earlier to better prepare them for missionary service and to keep them worthy of such service. All young men who are worthy and who are physically and emotionally able should prepare to serve in this most important work” (“To the Bishops of the Church,” <span class="emphasis">Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</span> June 19, 2004, 27).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p12" pid="T9cQP5fVKkCu6gQZS3Xvpw" hash="PCkOLQ">Similarly, with reference to young women, the President said: “There has been some misunderstanding of earlier counsel regarding single sisters serving as missionaries. We need some young women. They perform a remarkable work. They can get in homes where the elders cannot. But it should be kept in mind that young sisters are not under obligation to go on missions. They should not feel that they have a duty comparable to that of young men, but some will wish to go” (“To the Bishops of the Church,” 27).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p13" pid="02caVH22_UqZlzn9QcbqYQ" hash="q3Osyw">Brothers and sisters, there is an incredible amount of work that needs to be done. The Spirit of the Lord is brooding over many of the nations of the world. Doors previously locked are opening to us. We need more hardworking, testimony-enriched missionaries in order to reach more of our Heavenly Father’s children who are now at a place where we can reach them. These are our brothers and sisters, and we have the responsibility to teach them the message of the Restoration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p14" pid="MF0yWzEgX0K5o6TtnrkxHg" hash="L9pmXw">We know that great things happen in the lives of those who faithfully serve full-time missions. Missionary service is not easy, but it is infinitely worth it. Those who serve and return home with honor have established a pattern of living and serving that will bless their own lives and the lives of generations to follow. They return better prepared to be strong leaders and teachers in the organizations of the Church. They return better prepared to be righteous fathers and mothers and able to teach their children the gospel. Full-time missionary service is a blessing for those whom the missionaries find and teach as well as for the missionaries themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p15" pid="f0XOPLcft0e-vjPCL2o9Dw" hash="MUwO7g">Now we have a special request for you bishops and branch presidents. We are aware that you already know those who have cleared the bar and are preparing to accept mission calls during this year. What we are asking leaders in every unit to do is to counsel together with parents and pray to find at least <span class="emphasis">one more</span> young man, above those already committed, who can be called to serve. If the over 26,000 wards and branches in the Church will send all of those whom they are already planning to send into the mission field plus <span class="emphasis">one more,</span> the ranks of our full-time missionaries will swell and we will move much closer to our divine mandate to take the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. Of course, these missionaries need to be worthy, faithful, healthy, and fully committed. Perhaps this <span class="emphasis">one more</span> may not be ready right now. So we ask parents and stake and ward council members to rely upon the discerning power of the Holy Spirit to know whom you can help to be ready for a call this year.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p16" pid="vSfhO-AMoUywWYRwa8wS-g" hash="Jp5ATw">As you reach out to them, please remember the experience of a friend of mine. He had never owned a horse in his life until he married a wonderful woman who loves horses. Wanting to impress his new bride, he announced one evening that he was going to the pasture to teach a colt how to be led. He weighed more than the colt. He knew more than the colt. He assumed all he would need to do was pull on the lead rope and sooner or later the colt would follow. He was confident that the process would be short and simple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p17" pid="BI1e_qMhhE6iQbUcNbl0BA" hash="yUtpkQ">He attached the lead rope to the halter, got in front of the colt, and pulled. The colt resisted. My friend pulled harder, and the colt planted his legs more firmly. So he really pulled, and the colt fell over. The process was repeated several times until my friend made this assessment: in just four or five minutes he had successfully taught the colt to fall over. All he had to do was get in front of the colt, pick up the rope, and over it would go.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p18" pid="fwsRF2B0JUCeqDb5lY4bWw" hash="u-u1sw">His wife, watching this process, finally suggested that instead of getting in front of the colt and pulling, he might try wrapping the rope around the colt and simply walking alongside. To my friend’s chagrin, it worked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p19" pid="149saMH_nUuXdvh_NbfMPg" hash="ii5klg">There seems to be something inside each of us that resists being told or pushed or pulled. But if someone puts an arm around a young man and walks alongside him, he is likely to follow along with a desire to serve. Please remember this as you strengthen the testimony of <span class="emphasis">one more</span> who can serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p20" pid="VbSii0l2vUKXHvLCJsEufw" hash="6QZ0xw">May I make three suggestions for your consideration to help establish a rich tradition of missionary service in your family, stakes, wards, or branches?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p21" pid="SfgNYOUzO0qtxdZrXlIQqw" hash="lGzL5w">First, make sure all of our youth understand who they are. From their earliest days in Primary, our children sing “I Am a Child of God” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 301). Help them to know what it really means to be a child of God. Remind them that they are here at this particular time in the history of the world, with the fulness of the gospel at their fingertips, because they made valiant choices in the premortal existence. Our youth need to stand firm for righteousness and truth. They need the vision of the blessings that can be theirs as they demonstrate their love for Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ through their willingness to serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p22" pid="unu4o5feYUa0LZMaYwr9Ug" hash="IRGiYA">Second, teach the doctrine. While activities and social events have their appropriate place in our overall youth program, it is the doctrine that converts and commits. Our youth have a right to expect that their parents and Church leaders and teachers will see that they know and understand the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Holy Ghost will confirm the truth to their hearts and will ignite the Light of Christ in their souls. And then you will have <span class="emphasis">one more</span> fully prepared missionary. Yesterday, Elder Richard G. Scott suggested that <span class="emphasis">Preach My Gospel,</span> the new guide that our missionaries are now using to teach the gospel, can be a good resource to help you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p23" pid="7GB0_IzLOkKtSj_M86rb7A" hash="ECjisQ">Finally, we recognize that it may not be wise for some of our young men and young women to face the rigors and challenges of a full-time mission. If priesthood leaders excuse any of you from full-time missionary service, we ask you and your families to accept the decision and move forward. You can prepare to participate in the saving ordinances of the temple and find other ways to be of service. And we ask all of our members to be supportive and to show great love and understanding in assisting all of our faithful youth in their various Church callings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/one-more.p24" pid="_0d2QuWaTUuaf9xG0R30fg" hash="g9CbJQ">Brothers and sisters, I add my testimony of the divine mission of the Lord Jesus Christ and pray that He will bless all of us in our efforts to inspire and motivate more of our youth and couples to serve a full-time mission. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Their stories and situations are tragic and poignant in many ways, but in all that I heard, what touched me the most was the crying out for family: “Where is my mother?” “I can’t find my son.” “I’ve lost a sister.” These were hungry, frightened people who had lost everything and needed food, medical attention, and help of all kinds, but what they wanted and needed most was their families.</p>

In the routine of life, we often take our families—our parents and children and siblings—for granted. But in times of danger and need and change, there is no question that what we care about most is our families! It will be even more so when we leave this life and enter into the spirit world. Surely the first people we will seek to find there will be father, mother, spouse, children, and siblings.</p>

That is one of the reasons our Heavenly Father sent us here. Not everyone will find a companion and have a family in mortality, but everyone, regardless of individual circumstances, is a precious member of God’s family.</p>

It was then and is now a clarion call to protect and strengthen families and a stern warning in a world where declining values and misplaced priorities threaten to destroy society by undermining its basic unit.</p>

It warns against many of the very things that have threatened and undermined families during the last decade and calls for the priority and the emphasis families need if they are to survive in an environment that seems ever more toxic to traditional marriage and to parent-child relationships.</p>

And as Latter-day Saints know, the family will also be the basic unit in the celestial kingdom.</p>

We know of the sanctity of families in both directions of our eternal existence. We know that before this life we lived with our Heavenly Father as part of His family, and we know that family relationships can endure beyond death.</p>

It should give us enormous respect for our children, who truly are our spiritual siblings, and it should cause us to devote whatever time is necessary to strengthen our families. Indeed, nothing is more critically connected to happiness—both our own and that of our children—than how well we love and support one another within the family.</p>

Lee spoke of the Church as a crucial “scaffolding” that helps build the individual and the family (see Conference Report, Oct. 1967, 107). The Church is the kingdom of God on earth, but in the kingdom of heaven, families will be both the source of our eternal progress and joy and the order of our Heavenly Father. As we are often reminded, we will be released one day from our Church callings; but if we are worthy, we will never be released from our family relationships.</p>

Smith said: “There can be no genuine happiness separate and apart from the home, and every effort made to sanctify and preserve its influence is uplifting to those who toil and sacrifice for its establishment. Men and women often seek to substitute some other life for that of the home; they would make themselves believe that the home means restraint; that the highest liberty is the fullest opportunity to move about at will. There is no happiness without service, and there is no service greater than that which converts the home into a divine institution, and which promotes and preserves family life” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the </span><span class="emphasis">Church: Joseph F.

	<p pid="GBYMM9GDOEmOHnWDxzw6aQ" hash="z73pdw">Now, one may ask, How do we protect and preserve and strengthen our homes and families in a world pulling so hard in opposite directions? Let me make three simple suggestions:</p>
	<ol class="number">
	  <li pid="Ujm7zBva8UOVNViNjcrvXg" hash="EmexqQ">
          <span class="label">1.</span>
          <p pid="Ly3wmhOnHEKhRTxhblPfwA" hash="gy8DRQ">Be consistent in holding daily family prayer and weekly family home evenings. Both of these invite the Lord’s Spirit, which provides the help and power we need as parents and family leaders. The Church curriculum and magazines have many good ideas for family home evening. Also consider holding a family testimony meeting where parents and children can express their beliefs and feelings to each other in a private and personal setting.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="Vweu41PKFU-0GpPzqScXtA" hash="J4GoEA">
          <span class="label">2.</span>
          <p pid="7S3pDDahPU-cc3gqwdBD4g" hash="_wVjdA">Teach the gospel and basic values in your home. Establish a love for reading the scriptures together. Too many of our parents are abdicating this responsibility to the Church. While seminary, auxiliaries, and priesthood quorums are important as a supplement to parental gospel instruction, the main responsibility rests in the home. You might want to choose one gospel subject or a family value and then watch for opportunities to teach it. Be wise and do not involve children or yourselves in so many activities out of the home that you are so busy that the Spirit of the Lord cannot be recognized or felt in giving you the promised guidance for yourself and your family.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="e0EfhbZBw0OpLu_MxZsMkA" hash="O4IX_A">
          <span class="label">3.</span>
          <p pid="OXDFHWX5gkCpc_96DnuTqQ" hash="145Pjw">Create meaningful family bonds that give your children an identity stronger than what they can find with their peer group or at school or anyplace else. This can be done through family traditions for birthdays, for holidays, for dinnertime, and for Sundays. It can also be done through family policies and rules with natural and well-understood consequences. Have a simple family economy where children have specific chores or household duties and receive praise or other rewards commensurate to how well they do. Teach them the importance of avoiding debt and of earning, saving, and wisely spending money. Help them learn responsibility for their own temporal and spiritual self-reliance.</p>
        </li>

But their efforts may not be enough. Our most basic institution of family desperately needs help and support from the extended family and the public institutions that surround us. Brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, grandparents and cousins can make a powerful difference in the lives of children. Remember that the expression of love and encouragement from an extended family member will often provide the right influence and help a child at a critical time.</p>

I can assure you that those who lead the Church have great concern about the well-being of your families, and thus you will see increasing efforts to prioritize and to focus on family needs. But as your leaders, we call upon members of the Church everywhere to put family first and to identify specific ways to strengthen their individual families.</p>

We will find peace and happiness here and in the world to come. We should not need a hurricane or other crisis to remind us of what matters most. The gospel and the Lord’s plan of happiness and salvation should remind us. What matters most is what lasts longest, and our families are for eternity. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

So when I say that I am grateful to be able to stand before you today, it is no idle statement. During this recuperative period I have been reminded of how blessed we are to know of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am overwhelmed when I think about the pain and the suffering He went through for us in Gethsemane and on the cross. How He endured it I cannot comprehend. But I thank Him, and I love Him more profoundly than words can express.</p>

Because of Joseph Smith, we have been given much. Were it not for the Restoration we would not know the true nature of God, our Heavenly Father, or our own divine nature as His children. We would not understand the eternal nature of our existence or know that the family can be together forever.</p>

We are filled with love and gratitude. As the prophet Alma wrote, we feel “to sing the song of redeeming love” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:26</a>) to all who will hear it.</p>

Our love for the Lord and appreciation for the Restoration of the gospel are all the motivation we need to share what gives us much joy and happiness.

Many of them are entering the MTC with their own marked and well-studied copies of the missionary guide <span class="emphasis">Preach My Gospel.</span> I am pleased to report that with the use of <span class="emphasis">Preach My Gospel,</span> they are increasingly able to teach in their own words by the power of the Spirit and are better able to adjust their lessons to the needs of those whom they are teaching.

Experience has shown that the best teaching situations develop when our members participate in the finding and teaching process. This is nothing new—you’ve heard it before.

If you are truly motivated by love and testimony and gratitude, you will quite naturally do all that you can to assist the Lord in “[bringing] to pass the immortality and eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>) of our Father’s children.

Why do you suppose He did that? The scriptural record does not explain His reasoning, but I am confident that it had nothing to do with comfort or convenience. As always, He was teaching. And what better way to teach His followers than to invite them to visit with Him so they could see and experience His magnificent message firsthand.</p>

We can share the gospel without holding a formal discussion. Our families can be our lesson, and the spirit that emanates from our homes can be our message.</p>

By living in a gospel-sharing home, our testimonies become stronger and our understanding of the gospel improves. The Doctrine and Covenants teaches that we can be forgiven of our sins when we help someone else repent (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/62.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 62:3</a>). We find joy in helping others come unto Christ and feel the redemptive power of His love (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.14-16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:14–16</a>). Our families are blessed as the testimonies and faith of both parents and children increase.</p>

We pray for the people the missionaries are teaching, for our acquaintances, and for those not of our faith. In the gospel-sharing homes of Alma’s time, the people would “join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/6.6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 6:6</a>).</p>

And we’re not just talking about traditional homes with families consisting of two parents living with their children. College students can create a gospel-sharing home when they adorn the walls of their apartments with pictures that reflect spiritual pursuits instead of the things of the world. Older couples and single members exemplify a gospel-sharing home when they welcome new neighbors and invite them to attend church and visit them in their homes.</p>

Teenagers visiting a gospel-sharing home feel comfortable asking questions or participating with the family in prayer.</p>

They may not always be spotlessly clean nor the children perfectly behaved. But they are a place in which family members clearly love each other, and the Spirit of the Lord is felt by those who visit.</p>

It is a way of life. Creating a gospel-sharing home means inviting our friends and neighbors into the ongoing flow of family and Church activities. As we invite our friends to join us for these activities, they will also feel the Spirit.</p>

These friends will come naturally into our lives, and if we are open about our membership in the Church from the very beginning, we can easily bring gospel discussions into the relationship with very little risk of being misunderstood. Friends and acquaintances will accept that this is part of who we are, and they will feel free to ask questions.</p>

Our opportunity and responsibility are to care, to share, to testify, to invite, and then to allow individuals to decide for themselves. We are blessed when we have invited them to consider the Restoration, regardless of the outcome. At the very least, we have a rewarding relationship with someone from another faith, and we can continue to enjoy their friendship.</p>

We also pray for our own missionary experiences and opportunities and to be prepared to act on those impressions as they come our way. And I promise you, they <span class="emphasis">will</span> come.</p>

One way to show your faith in the Lord and His promises is to prayerfully set a date to have someone prepared to meet with the missionaries. I have received hundreds of letters from members who have exercised their faith in this simple way. Even though families had no one in mind with whom they could share the gospel, they set a date, prayed, and then talked to many more people. The Lord is the Good Shepherd, and He knows His sheep who have been prepared to hear His voice. He will guide us as we seek His divine help in sharing His gospel.</p>

She said, “I simply share my joy. I treat everyone as if they were already a member of the Church. If I’m standing by someone in line and strike up a conversation, I share with them how much I enjoyed my Church meetings on Sunday. When co-workers ask, ‘What did you do this weekend?’ I do not skip from Saturday night to Monday morning. I share with them that I went to church, what was said, and my experiences with the Saints. I talk about how I live, think, and feel.”</p>

One faithful family counseled together on the need for each family member to be an example. Later, the son’s high school coach, who was not a member, sent a donation to the Church. Why? Because this young man had impressed him with his courage in speaking up and telling his teammates to clean up their language. There are thousands of experiences that could be shared where people have joined the Church because of the spirit and attitude they observe in the lives of those who come from gospel-sharing homes.</p>

Invitations to hear a family member speak in sacrament meeting or to attend the baptismal service of a family member or to tour a meetinghouse have also been appreciated by those who are not members. From every indicator we have, there is nothing more effective that any of us can do for our friends than to say “come and see” by joining with us in sacrament meeting. Far too many do not know they are welcome to worship with us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/creating-a-gospel-sharing-home.p29" uuid="67995295-fde7-4b20-8699-ae21b41ff0d5" pid="LyxXzgTw9UOGpExvzeAsXw" hash="HXD_ZA">Of course, all of us support the ward leaders and assist in making the ward mission plan effective. Whatever our Church calling may be, we help priesthood and auxiliary leaders assist missionaries, welcome and involve visitors, and fellowship new members. You can ask the missionaries to show you their daily planners so you can see how you can best help them accomplish their goals. As we work together, the spirit of our gospel-sharing homes will overflow in our chapels, our classrooms, and our cultural halls.</p>

Our love for the Lord, our appreciation for His atoning sacrifice, and His mission to have all come unto Him should provide all the motivation we need to be successful in sharing the gospel.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="17"></span>Brothers and sisters, while I was studying the Book of Mormon recently, one of the teachings of the prophet Jacob caught my attention. As you remember, Jacob was one of Father Lehi’s two sons born in the wilderness after the family left Jerusalem. He was an eyewitness to miracles, and he also watched as his family was torn apart by disobedience and rebellion. Jacob knew and loved Laman and Lemuel as he knew and loved Nephi, and the dissension between them was intimate and personal. As far as Jacob was concerned, it wasn’t about ideology, philosophy, or even theology. It was about family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p2" pid="0Q27Ld2VaU2tY4SHEh7VvA" hash="AeOj4A">The tender anguish of Jacob’s soul is evident as he expresses grave concern that his people will “reject the words of the prophets” concerning Christ and “deny … the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, … and make a mock of the great plan of redemption” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6.8" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 6:8</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p3" pid="Z6HXp7yThEGRx1Pt1br3zQ" hash="niInHw">And then, just before he bids farewell, he speaks eight simple words that are the basic text of my message this morning. Jacob’s plea was “O be wise; what can I say more?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6.12" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 6:12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p4" pid="g0o5ghY9lU24c_76le29RQ" hash="iVFzFA">Those of you who are parents and grandparents have a sense of what Jacob must have been feeling at the time. He loved his people, partly because they were also his family. He had taught them as clearly as he could and with all the energy of his soul. He warned them in no uncertain terms what would happen if they chose not to “enter in at the strait gate, and continue in the way which is narrow” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6.11" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 6:11</a>). He couldn’t think of anything else to say to warn, to urge, to inspire, to motivate. And so he, simply and profoundly, said, “O be wise; what can I say more?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p5" pid="gUKQB3UH0ESsJ7F3yd9IxQ" hash="qEufuA">I have met with members of the Church in many nations of the world. I’m impressed with the spirit and energy of so many of our members. Hearts are being touched and lives are being blessed. The work is moving forward in dynamic ways, and for that I am profoundly grateful. But I see many ways that Church members must be so very wise in all that we do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p6" pid="ZlnZ88nDZUGpq2jTVy-p9w" hash="ladDMA">The Lord in His infinite wisdom has designed His Church to operate <span class="pageBreak" page-number="18"></span>with a lay ministry. That means we have been charged to watch over one another and to serve one another. We are to love one another as our Father in Heaven and the Lord Jesus Christ love us. Our callings and circumstances change from time to time, providing us with different and unique opportunities to serve and to grow. Most of the leaders and teachers in the Church are anxiously engaged in fulfilling their responsibilities. Some are less effective than others—it is true; but almost always there is sincere effort to provide meaningful gospel service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p7" pid="KFsgIDxh0kqAGWVHCEXjbg" hash="kcBr3g">Occasionally we find some who become so energetic in their Church service that their lives become unbalanced. They start believing that the programs they administer are more important than the people they serve. They complicate their service with needless frills and embellishments that occupy too much time, cost too much money, and sap too much energy. They refuse to delegate or to allow others to grow in their respective responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p8" pid="nX6BV9b-RkKkV4a7ja98xA" hash="z4_JvA">As a result of their focusing too much time and energy on their Church service, eternal family relationships can deteriorate. Employment performance can suffer. This is not healthy, spiritually or otherwise. While there may be times when our Church callings require more intense effort and unusual focus, we need to strive to keep things in proper balance. We should never allow our service to replace the attention needed by other important priorities in our lives. Remember King Benjamin’s counsel: “And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.27" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:27</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p9" pid="iRVPtIxwX0u2Dg3kvxX26g" hash="CkcdFQ">May I suggest six ways in which we can serve both wisely and well?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p10" pid="TT-Rtt_yd0CvnhCANZr0lg" hash="IR9Pqw">
        <span class="emphasis">First,</span> focus on people and principles—not on programs. One of the most important things we do through the gospel of Jesus Christ is to build people. Properly serving others requires effort to understand them as individuals—their personalities, their strengths, their concerns, their hopes and dreams—so that the correct help and support can be provided. Frankly, it’s much easier to just manage programs than it is to understand and truly serve people. The primary purpose of Church leadership meetings should be to discuss how to minister to people. Most routine information and coordination can now be handled through phone calls, e-mails, or regular mail so that agendas for council meetings and presidency meetings can focus on needs of the people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p11" pid="Rt7h7pPJzUWmHLx_8ki3Ow" hash="W9poyw">Our goal should always be to use the programs of the Church as a means to lift, encourage, assist, teach, love, and perfect people. “Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:10</a>). Programs are tools. Their management and staffing must not take priority over the needs of the people they are designed to bless and to serve.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Second,</span> be innovative. As we work to magnify our callings, we should seek the inspiration of the Spirit to solve problems in ways that will best help the people we serve. We have handbooks of instruction, and their guidelines should be followed. But within that framework are substantial opportunities to think, to be creative, and to make use of individual talents. The instruction to magnify our callings <span class="pageBreak" page-number="19"></span>is not a command to embellish and complicate them. To innovate does not necessarily mean to expand; very often it means to simplify.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p13" pid="QY76d0x8_U-R6MZCuaVEhg" hash="e6ttCA">Because the eternal principle of agency gives us the freedom to choose and think for ourselves, we should become increasingly able to solve problems. We may make the occasional mistake, but as long as we are following gospel principles and guidelines, we can learn from those mistakes and become more understanding of others and more effective in serving them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p14" pid="4PeHMY0N40qMf25t1ieoMA" hash="Drfnqw">Being innovative also means that we do not have to be told everything we should do. The Lord said, “It is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:26</a>). We trust you, brothers and sisters, to use inspiration. We trust that you will do so within the framework of Church policies and principles. We trust that you will be wise in counseling together to help build faith and testimony in the lives of those whom you serve.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Third,</span> divide the work and delegate responsibility. There is a difference between being responsible for getting the work done and doing the work yourself. For example, gone should be the days when the elders quorum president feels he needs to personally finish the home teaching visits that others have missed. The same is true for Relief Society presidents with respect to visiting teaching. Not only is this unwise; it isn’t home or visiting teaching. Home teaching isn’t about numbers or reporting visits to a home; visits and numbers are just a measuring stick. Home teaching is about love of people and service to and watchcare over our Heavenly Father’s children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p16" pid="Xv25HHgt70SpEs3YhD-KgQ" hash="nUQTWw">Assignments should be made, responsibilities should be delegated, and members should be allowed to fulfill their stewardship as best they can. Counsel, advise, persuade, motivate—but don’t do the work for them. Allow others to progress and grow, even if it means sometimes getting less-than-perfect results on the reports.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p17" pid="txS5i0-p5EuA-m0EMg6OQA" hash="ThTBLw">
        <span class="emphasis">Fourth,</span> eliminate guilt. I hope it goes without saying that guilt is not a proper motivational technique for leaders and teachers of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We must always motivate through love and sincere appreciation, not by creating guilt. I like the thought “Catch others doing something right.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p18" pid="sb_KlUBk7ka3g_rn5T2kDw" hash="oYmtzg">Still there are those who experience some feelings of guilt as a consequence of their service in the Church. These feelings can come when our time and attention are being torn between competing demands and priorities. As mortals, we simply cannot do everything at once. Therefore we must do all things “in wisdom and order” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.27" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:27</a>). Often that will mean temporarily postponing attention to one priority in order to take care of another. Sometimes family demands will require your full attention. Other times professional responsibilities will come first. And there will be times when Church callings will come first. Good balance comes in doing things in a timely way and in not procrastinating our preparation or waiting to fulfill our responsibilities until the last minute.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p19" pid="OVmtq7Wwt0yFdQlatM_Q-w" hash="21vESg">Beyond that we need to remember that Christ came to remove guilt by forgiving those who repent (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 24:10</a>). He came to bring peace to the troubled soul. “Peace I leave with you,” He said. “My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>). Through the miraculous Atonement He urges us to “take my yoke upon you, … and ye shall find rest unto your souls” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.29" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 11:29</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p20" pid="4dXLPFi1xEy2ao9_dvTOiQ" hash="pUGuQg">As the power of the Atonement begins to work in our lives, we come to understand that the Savior has already born the burden of our guilt. O that we may be wise enough to understand, to repent as necessary, and to let go of our guilt.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Fifth,</span> we need to thoughtfully allocate our resources of time, income, and energy. I would like to let you in on a little secret. Some of you have already learned it. If you haven’t, it’s time you knew. No matter what your family needs are or your responsibilities in the Church, there is no such thing as “done.” There will always be more we can do. There is always another family matter that needs attention, another lesson to prepare, another interview to conduct, another meeting to attend. We just need to be wise in protecting our health and in following the counsel that President Hinckley has given often to just do the best that we can.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p22" pid="EXD1aWBOWEC4rOiQmqsSHQ" hash="NQ_ZnQ">The key, it seems to me, is to know and understand your own capabilities and limitations and then to pace yourself, allocating and prioritizing your time, your attention, and your resources to wisely help others, including your family, in their quest for eternal life.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Sixth,</span> a word to you leaders about extending responsibilities to members and especially to recent converts. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="20"></span>President Hinckley said that every new member of the Church needs a responsibility. Whatever responsibility may be extended should not overwhelm new members but should give them ample opportunity to become comfortable in the Church by learning its doctrine and by rubbing shoulders with friendly members. It should anchor them to the restored gospel through increasing their testimony and giving meaningful service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p24" pid="7b3-EDlFgECBeWINYKtLTw" hash="vtJWWQ">Brothers and sisters, may we focus on the simple ways we can serve in the kingdom of God, always striving to change lives, including our own. What is most important in our Church responsibilities is not the statistics that are reported or the meetings that are held but whether or not individual people—ministered to one at a time just as the Savior did—have been lifted and encouraged and ultimately changed. Our task is to help others find the peace and the joy that only the gospel can give them. In seven words, Jesus summarized how we can accomplish this. He said, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.15" class="scriptureRef">John 14:15</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p25" pid="d4T_yVBXKUS7ce8SCxz74w" hash="zcM3Hg">Today is in many ways like Jacob’s day. My counsel is like unto his: “Repent, and come with full purpose of heart, and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6.5" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 6:5</a>). Brothers and sisters, be wise with your families. Be wise in fulfilling your Church callings. Be wise with your time. Be wise in balancing all of your responsibilities. O be wise, my beloved brothers and sisters. What can I say more?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/o-be-wise.p26" pid="px1qtieLJkGMDMlQgGKlVw" hash="71P-cg">May God bless us with wisdom to love His Son, Jesus Christ, and wisely help accomplish His work. I bear my witness and testimony that He lives. This is His Church. We are about His work. May the peace of the Lord be with us. And may we wisely carry on our responsibilities, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="80"></span>My brothers and sisters, the Holy Bible is a miracle! It is a miracle that the Bible’s 4,000 years of sacred and secular history were recorded and preserved by the prophets, apostles, and inspired churchmen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-miracle-of-the-holy-bible.p2" pid="YWj3-VCEn0iLGkg75AIKlw" hash="YjGPXw">It is a miracle that we have the Bible’s powerful doctrine, principles, poetry, and stories. But most of all, it is a wonderful miracle that we have the account of the life, ministry, and words of Jesus, which was protected through the Dark Ages and through the conflicts of countless generations so that we may have it today.</p>

It is holy because it teaches truth, holy because it warms us with its spirit, holy because it teaches us to know God and understand His dealings with men, and holy because it testifies throughout its pages of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

All the good the Saviour gave to the world was communicated through this book.

Righteous individuals were prompted by the Spirit to record both the sacred things they saw and the inspired words they heard and spoke. Other devoted people were prompted to protect and preserve these records. Men like John Wycliffe, the courageous William Tyndale, and Johannes Gutenberg were prompted against much opposition to translate the Bible into language people could understand and to publish it in books people could read. I believe even the scholars of King James had spiritual promptings in their translation work.</p>

They did not have the apostles or prophets, nor did they have access to the Bible. The clergy kept the scriptures secret and unavailable to the people. We owe much to the many brave martyrs and reformers like Martin Luther, John Calvin, and John Huss who demanded freedom to worship and common access to the holy books.</p>

He said, “The nature of God’s word is, that whosoever read it, or hear it reasoned and disputed before him, it will begin immediately to make him every day better and better, till he be grown into a perfect man” (in S. Michael Wilcox, <span class="emphasis">Fire in the Bones: William Tyndale—Martyr, Father of the English Bible</span> [2004], xv).</p>

This resulted in the organization of numerous Christian denominations. Roger Williams, an early champion of religious liberty, concluded that there was “no regularly-constituted Church on earth, nor any person authorized to administer any Church ordinance; nor could there be, until new apostles were sent by the great Head of the Church, for whose coming he was seeking” (see William Cullen Bryant, ed., <span class="emphasis">Picturesque America; or, the Land We Live In,</span> 2 vols.

One of those families, in the early 1800s in upstate New York, was the family of Joseph Smith Sr. One of his sons was Joseph Smith Jr., who searched the Bible, seeking to know which of the many denominations was the same as the Church that Jesus Christ organized. He was prompted by the words of the Bible to pray for further spiritual light and knowledge from God. Determined to seek the wisdom promised in the holy scriptures, Joseph knelt in humble prayer early in the spring of 1820. Oh, what marvelous light and truth were shed upon him that day as he beheld the glorious manifestation of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! Once again God called a prophet as He did in the days of Noah, Abraham, and Moses.</p>

In it we learn not only of the life and teachings and doctrines of Christ, we learn of His Church and of His priesthood and of the organization which He established and named the Church of Jesus Christ in those former days. We believe in that Church, and we believe that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that same Church, restored to earth, complete, with the same organization and the same priesthood.</p>

We do have additional sacred scripture, including the Book of Mormon, but it supports the Bible, never substituting for it.</p>

These words provide insight and inspiration to all who sincerely seek to know and understand the truth about Jesus Christ. The scriptures are rich in history, doctrine, stories, sermons, and testimonies, all of which ultimately focus on the eternal Christ and His physical and spiritual mission to Heavenly Father’s children.</p>

We love the Bible and other scriptures. That may be surprising to some who may not be aware of our belief in the Bible as the revealed word of God. It is one of the pillars of our faith, a powerful witness of the Savior and of Christ’s ongoing influence in the lives of those who worship and follow Him. The more we read and study the Bible and its teachings, the more clearly we see the doctrinal underpinnings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We tend to love the scriptures that we spend time with. We may need to balance our study in order to love and understand all scripture.</p>

It is the sacred, holy record of the Lord’s life. The Bible contains hundreds of pages more than all of our other scripture combined. It is the bedrock of all Christianity. We do not criticize or belittle anyone’s beliefs. Our great responsibility as Christians is to share all that God has revealed with all of His sons and daughters.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="25"></span>Brothers and sisters, since the sesquicentennial anniversary in 1997, there has been a dramatic increase worldwide in inquiries about the Church. This growing interest is fueled by our rapid growth, by events like the Winter Olympics here in Salt Lake City, and by the prominence in their chosen professions of many of our individual members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/faith-family-facts-and-fruits.p" pid="t7MRA9EpcEWVaMf9ERmo4w" hash="PrL5XA">I am sure that these questions come not only to the Church but to you as individual members. It is not easy to explain something as vast as the Church or as wonderful as the restored gospel to people who know little or nothing about us. Even questions on one specific aspect can be difficult to answer because every question seems to be connected to other questions. The most common request we hear is a fairly simple one that goes something like this: “Tell me a little about your Church.” The key word here is “little.” They are not saying, “Tell me everything you know and then send others to tell me everything else.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/faith-family-facts-and-fruits.p" pid="KrtNH73srUyvbIrmLEN0AQ" hash="UpkeQg">We, of course, welcome people’s interest, and many will want to be taught more about our doctrines and beliefs. This is why we have over 53,000 full-time missionaries serving at their own expense throughout the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/faith-family-facts-and-fruits.p" pid="mHKNOFbMek6CAiePDGdt0g" hash="Gwo33g">But we need to remember that there is a difference between interest and mere curiosity. Sometimes people just want to know what the Church is. Those who are curious in this general way deserve clear and accurate information that comes directly from those of us who are members so that they do not have to rely on the incomplete answers, half-truths, or false statements that may come from the media or other outside voices. The many misunderstandings and false information about the Church are somewhat our own fault for not clearly explaining who we are and what we believe.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/faith-family-facts-and-fruits.p" pid="QwNt8EtP4kWt4OW0v_1cYQ" hash="K1qurA">The Public Affairs Committee, on which I serve, has learned that there is a great need for clear, simple statements that present those who are curious with the basics about the Church as it is today. Let me share with you some of the things we have found to be helpful. You may want to prepare your own list of talking points that will assist you in explaining what we believe to your friends and acquaintances of other faiths. It may be helpful for you, as it is for me, to have on one page a few facts about the Church as it is today to give to them along with a copy of the Articles of Faith.</p>

Joseph Smith taught that Jesus Christ is the core of our belief, and everything else is an appendage to it (see <span class="emphasis">Elders’ Journal,</span> July 1838, 44).

But there are millions upon millions who are not acquainted with any members of our faith. I would hope that those who know very little about the Church would seek to learn more about us. I would hope they would get to know our members rather than judging us by the misinformation given by those who do not know and in some cases by those who would deliberately mislead or defame.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="108"></span>Brothers and sisters, recently my wife, Barbara, had back surgery and could not lift, twist, or bend. Consequently, I have done more lifting, twisting, and bending than ever before—and it has made me more appreciative of what women, and especially you mothers, do every day in our homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p2" pid="-C4TjJ_QR0SexTw25MKNJQ" hash="swBrTw">While women live in homes under many different circumstances—married, single, widowed, or divorced, some with children and some without—all are beloved of God, and He has a plan for His righteous daughters to receive the highest blessings of eternity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p3" pid="JSmGfj5Dn0aX51h0AqwwfA" hash="pTUphA">This afternoon I want to focus my remarks primarily on mothers, particularly on young mothers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p4" pid="kFHrtzqCKEyiJYkQXyt5vQ" hash="p3Hb0w">As a young father, I learned the demanding role of motherhood. I served as a counselor and then as bishop for a period of 10 years. During that time we were blessed with six of our seven children. Barbara was often worn-out by the time I got home Sunday evening. She tried to explain what it was like to sit on the back row in sacrament meeting with our young family. Then the day came that I was released. After sitting on the stand for 10 years, I was now sitting with my family on the back row.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p5" pid="yqNc9EbjHkSKk7x0ByEEdw" hash="aykOIg">The ward’s singing mothers’ chorus was providing the music, and I found myself sitting alone with our six children. I have never been so busy in my whole life. I had the hand puppets going on both hands, and that wasn’t working too well. The Cheerios got away from me, and that was embarrassing. The coloring books didn’t seem to entertain as well as they should.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p6" pid="0fcbVb9pnUCLIVFrQZVmmA" hash="bHxDow">As I struggled with the children through the meeting, I looked up at Barbara, and she was watching me and smiling. I learned for myself to more fully appreciate what all of you dear mothers do so well and so faithfully!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p7" pid="l0RO_xCtSk6z5lgANHDGpA" hash="duP4vg">A generation later, as a grandfather, I have watched the sacrifices my daughters have made in rearing their children. And now, still another generation later, I am watching with awe the pressures on my granddaughters as they guide their children in this busy and demanding world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p8" pid="3Odg5O5p3U2QRUV7zQIQiQ" hash="Xzp68g">After observing and empathizing with three generations of mothers and thinking of my own dear mother, I surely know that there is no role in life more essential and more eternal than that of motherhood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p9" pid="ElA95ImcWkyLqi7EaCNc2Q" hash="uN_srQ">There is <span class="emphasis">no</span> one perfect way to be a good mother. Each situation is unique. Each mother has different challenges, different skills and abilities, and certainly different children. The choice is different and unique for each mother and each family. Many are able to be “full-time moms,” at least during the most formative years of their children’s lives, and many others would like to be. Some may have to work part-or full-time; some may work at home; some may divide their lives into periods of home and family and work. What matters is that a mother loves her children deeply and, in keeping with the devotion she has for God and her husband, prioritizes them above all else.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p10" pid="PyP4qY9eIUWpefeehfoa4A" hash="BIKknA">I am impressed by countless mothers who have learned how important it is to focus on the things that can only be done in a particular season of life. If a child lives with parents for 18 or 19 years, that span is only one-fourth of a parent’s life. And the most formative time of all, the early years in a child’s life, represents less than one-tenth of a parent’s normal life. It is crucial to focus on our children for the short time we have them with us and to seek, with the help of the Lord, to teach them all we can before they leave our homes. This eternally important work falls to mothers and fathers as equal partners. I am grateful that today many fathers are more involved in the lives of their children. But I believe that the instincts and the intense nurturing involvement of mothers with their children will always be a major key to their well-being. In the words of the proclamation on the family, “Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="109"></span>World,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Oct. 2004, 49; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p11" pid="2IF8Ak_n206SS-DXudI2qg" hash="d8khcw">We need to remember that the full commitment of motherhood and of putting children first can be difficult. Through my own four-generation experience in our family, and through discussions with mothers of young children throughout the Church, I know something of a mother’s emotions that accompany her commitment to be at home with young children. There are moments of great joy and incredible fulfillment, but there are also moments of a sense of inadequacy, monotony, and frustration. Mothers may feel they receive little or no appreciation for the choice they have made. Sometimes even husbands seem to have no idea of the demands upon their wives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p12" pid="vkvRaqHriEuWBpy9a-H23w" hash="_YnOgg">As a Church, we have enormous respect and gratitude to you mothers of young children. We want you to be happy and successful in your families and to have the validation and support you need and deserve. So today, let me ask and briefly answer four questions. While my answers may seem extremely simple, if the simple things are being tended to, a mother’s life can be most rewarding.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p13" pid="0IKwnORPdEKAmTq_C2wapQ" hash="Z8r4xg">The first question: What can <span class="emphasis">you</span> do, as a young mother, to reduce the pressure and enjoy your family more?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p14" pid="GGKf3cHaoU642gg3lTHCsA" hash="-I5MlQ">First, recognize that the joy of motherhood comes in moments. There will be hard times and frustrating times. But amid the challenges, there are shining moments of joy and satisfaction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p15" pid="NvR_1zRdAkqdSOff00oazg" hash="cVlrbw">Author Anna Quindlen reminds us not to rush past the fleeting moments. She said: “The biggest mistake I made [as a parent] is the one that most of us make. … I did not live in the moment enough. This is particularly clear now that the moment is gone, captured only in photographs. There is one picture of [my three children] sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the swing set on a summer day, ages six, four, and one. And I wish I could remember what we ate, and what we talked about, and how they sounded, and how they looked when they slept that night. I wish I had not been in such a hurry to get on to the next thing: dinner, bath, book, bed. I wish I had treasured the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less” (<span class="emphasis">Loud and Clear</span> [2004], 10–11).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p16" pid="cz5GPxt87kGJVWeWJ133jw" hash="17c61w">Second, don’t overschedule yourselves or your children. We live in a world that is filled with options. If we are not careful, we will find every minute jammed with social events, classes, exercise time, book clubs, scrapbooking, Church callings, music, sports, the Internet, and our favorite TV shows. One mother told me of a time that her children had 29 scheduled commitments every week: music lessons, Scouts, dance, Little <span class="pageBreak" page-number="110"></span>League, day camps, soccer, art, and so forth. She felt like a taxi driver. Finally, she called a family meeting and announced, “Something has to go; we have no time to ourselves and no time for each other.” Families need unstructured time when relationships can deepen and real parenting can take place. Take time to listen, to laugh, and to play together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p17" pid="th1CeYxrZEaPXd6_EAkNeA" hash="HjuRSw">Third, even as you try to cut out the extra commitments, sisters, find some time for yourself to cultivate your gifts and interests. Pick one or two things that you would like to learn or do that will enrich your life, and make time for them. Water cannot be drawn from an empty well, and if you are not setting aside a little time for what replenishes you, you will have less and less to give to others, even to your children. Avoid any kind of substance abuse, mistakenly thinking that it will help you accomplish more. And don’t allow yourself to be caught up in the time-wasting, mind-numbing things like television soap operas or surfing the Internet. Turn to the Lord in faith, and you will know what to do and how to do it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p18" pid="hI36lbQKI0q7PcfV5IPehg" hash="_JpMsQ">Fourth, pray, study, and teach the gospel. Pray deeply about your children and about your role as a mother. Parents can offer a unique and wonderful kind of prayer because they are praying to the Eternal Parent of us all. There is great power in a prayer that essentially says, “We are steward-parents over Thy children, Father; please help us to raise them as Thou wouldst want them raised.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p19" pid="B7LFNL1j7Eqf8r8JcniKVg" hash="7GSxOw">The second question: What more can a husband do to support his wife, the mother of their children?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p20" pid="4M-2JkA6RE-Mvc2TAiU84g" hash="rHwKsg">First, show extra appreciation and give more validation for what your wife does every day. Notice things and say thank you—often. Schedule some evenings together, just the two of you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p21" pid="Cm6Vm6l860245k76ycnRmQ" hash="BhCR-w">Second, have a regular time to talk with your wife about each child’s needs and what you can do to help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p22" pid="DLTQjuHbC0CY7kWxvdg4SQ" hash="ad2N9g">Third, give your wife a “day away” now and then. Just take over the household and give your wife a break from her daily responsibilities. Taking over for a while will greatly enhance your appreciation of what your wife does. You may do a lot of lifting, twisting, and bending!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p23" pid="pjZRk-5kmEW0tomWJFO74g" hash="sfVB6g">Fourth, come home from work and take an active role with your family. Don’t put work, friends, or sports ahead of listening to, playing with, and teaching your children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p24" pid="VZI6M_vJHUeP3gWP_ckRYQ" hash="cEPQ2w">The third question: What can children, even young children, do? Now, you children, please listen to me because there are some simple things you can do to help your mother.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p25" pid="n-_Sz1H8_0S3QJewB7iMqg" hash="XnEcKA">You can pick up your toys when you are finished playing with them, and when you get a little older, you can make your bed, help with the dishes, and do other chores—without being asked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p26" pid="KtYRhfyP8kG0dfl3xNByuQ" hash="_NwFlQ">You can say thank you more often when you finish a nice meal, when a story is read to you at bedtime, or when clean clothes are put in your drawers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p27" pid="krMtWfTOxk6NdB2VqehGXQ" hash="N2QB3Q">Most of all, you can put your arms around your mother often and tell her you love her.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p28" pid="8frz8Hy0TUKNuvmgTfTxhw" hash="-2Jmtw">The last question: What can the Church do?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p29" pid="eiwpjplCAU-G_XjfGCnlmw" hash="TieVQQ">There are many things the Church offers to mothers and families, but for my purpose today may I suggest that the bishopric and the ward council members be especially watchful and considerate of the time and resource demands on young mothers and their families. Know them and be wise in what you ask them to do at this time in their lives. Alma’s counsel to his son Helaman applies to us today: “Behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p30" pid="0UvxJl82rk6tMnp6cfA7uQ" hash="vYAgkA">I hope all of you dear sisters, married or single, never wonder if you have worth in the sight of the Lord and to the leaders of the Church. We love you. We respect you and appreciate your influence in preserving the family and assisting with the growth and the spiritual vitality of the Church. Let us remember that “the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”). The scriptures and the teachings of the prophets and apostles help all family members to prepare together now to be together through all eternity. I pray that God will continually bless the women of the Church to find joy and happiness in their sacred roles as daughters of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/daughters-of-god.p31" pid="XjxsfKFs-EqNNRIhpm0xUA" hash="GSivpQ">Now, in closing, I want to add my witness of President Monson’s prophetic call. I have known him since he was 22 and I was 21. That’s 58 years. I have watched the hand of the Lord prepare him for this day to preside over the Church as the prophet and President. And I add my testimony, along with all of the other testimonies that have been borne through this conference, of his special calling as President of the Church, and add my testimony, along with all of the others, that Jesus is the Christ and this is His Church. We are doing His work, to which I testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="81"></span>My brothers and sisters, on July 19th of this year the Sons of Utah Pioneers placed at This Is the Place Heritage Park in Salt Lake City a statue of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his successor, President Brigham Young. This statue, entitled <span class="emphasis">Eyes Westward,</span> shows these two great prophets with a map of the western territories.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/the-truth-of-god-shall-go-forth.p2" pid="v8dkcf-Hw025VEpxF9by6Q" hash="JNvJqw">Many people, including Latter-day Saints, forget that Joseph Smith was very much aware that the Church would eventually be relocated to the great American West. In August of 1842 he prophesied “that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains, many would apostatize, others would be put to death by our persecutors or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or disease, and some [would] live to … build cities and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:85).</p>

But Joseph Smith knew that no enemy then present or in the future would have sufficient power to frustrate or stop the purposes of God. We are all familiar with his prophetic words: “The Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:540).</p>

Despite intense opposition, 597 missionaries were called during the 1830s, and over 15,000 converts were baptized into the Church. The United States, Canada, and Great Britain were opened to the preaching of the gospel.</p>

In the midst of these difficulties and despite the great challenges of travel, the restored gospel of Jesus Christ continued to cover more of the earth through the faithful service of 1,454 missionaries called during the 1840s, and Church membership grew to more than 48,000. On June 27, 1844, the persecution of Joseph Smith culminated when he and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob in the Carthage Jail.</p>

Hardship, affliction, death, and apostasy were ever present. Still, the work moved forward. In the 1850s some 705 missionaries were called to serve in areas including Scandinavia, France, Italy, Switzerland, and Hawaii. Missionary work also began in such diverse parts of the world as India, Hong Kong, Thailand, Burma, South Africa, and the West Indies.</p>

But it should be noted that during the 40-year period from 1890 to 1930, while the Church and its doctrine were still under public attack, Elder Reed Smoot was elected to the United States Congress and had to fight to be seated. A great deal was said of the Church and its teachings during that time—much of it hurtful and directed towards President Joseph F. Smith and other Church leaders. However, some newspaper articles began to speak of members of the Church as contributing citizens and good people.</p>

Before leaving the following July, he prophesied: “The work of the Lord will grow slowly for a time here just as an oak grows slowly from an acorn. It will not shoot up in a day as does the sunflower that grows quickly and then dies. But thousands will join the Church here. It will be divided into more than one mission and will be one of the strongest in the Church. The work here is the smallest that it will ever be” (in Melvin R.

By 1970 missionaries were serving in 43 nations and 9 territories. During this 40-year period, the South American nations of Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela were opened to missionary work.

We have seen it for ourselves, in decade after decade, from the time of the Prophet Joseph Smith to the time of President Thomas S. Monson. Persecutions have raged. Calumny and lies and misrepresentation have attempted to defame. But in every decade from the time of the Restoration forward, the truth of God has gone “forth boldly, nobly, and independent.” The little Church that started in 1830 with just a handful of members has now grown to more than 13 million Latter-day Saints in many different nations around the world, and we are well on our way to penetrating every continent, visiting every clime, sweeping every country, and sounding in every ear.</p>

Instead of extreme exposure and hardship, we face alcohol and drug abuse, pornography, all kinds of filth, sleaze, greed, dishonesty, and spiritual apathy. Instead of families being uprooted and torn from their homes, we see the institution of the family, including the divine institution of marriage, under attack as groups and individuals seek to define away the prominent and divine role of the family in society.</p>

They are just different. The Lord isn’t asking us to load up a handcart; He’s asking us to fortify our faith. He isn’t asking us to walk across a continent; He’s asking us to walk across the street to visit our neighbor. He isn’t asking us to give all of our worldly possessions to build a temple; He’s asking us to give of our means and our time despite the pressures of modern living to continue to build temples and then to attend regularly the temples already built. He isn’t asking us to die a martyr’s death; He’s asking us to live a disciple’s life.</p>

This is not a time for the spiritually faint of heart. We cannot afford to be superficially righteous. Our testimonies must run deep, with spiritual roots firmly embedded in the rock of revelation. And we must continue to move the work forward as a covenanted, consecrated people, with faith in every footstep, “till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.” That it may be so for us is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="31"></span>We live in a fascinating and sometimes bewildering time.

My father and I were in the automobile business, and the Ford Motor Company was looking for dealers to sell their new line of cars. Ford executives invited my father and me to a preview showing of what they thought would be a spectacularly successful product. When we saw the cars, my father, who had over 35 years experience in the business, cautioned me about becoming a dealer. However, the Ford sales personnel were very persuasive, and I chose to become Salt Lake City’s first—and actually last—Edsel dealer. And if you don’t know what an Edsel is, ask your grandpa. He will tell you that the Edsel was a spectacular failure.</p>

When you are willing to listen and learn, some of life’s most meaningful teachings come from those who have gone before you. They have walked where you are walking and have experienced many of the things you are experiencing. If you listen and respond to their counsel, they can help guide you toward choices that will be for your benefit and blessing and steer you away from decisions that can destroy you. As you look to your parents and others who have gone before you, you will find examples of faith, commitment, hard work, dedication, and sacrifice that you should strive to duplicate.</p>

Many professions require internships, during which aspiring professionals shadow seasoned veterans to learn from their years of experience and accumulated wisdom. Rookies in professional sports are often expected to sit on the bench and learn by watching experienced players. New missionaries are assigned to work with a senior companion whose experience helps the new missionary learn the right way to effectively serve the Lord.</p>

The fact that these words come largely from older men, past and present, doesn’t make them any less relevant. In fact, it makes their words even more valuable to you because they come from those who have learned much through years of devout living.</p>

You’ve probably <span class="pageBreak" page-number="32"></span>heard it: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” (in John Bartlett, comp., <span class="emphasis">Familiar Quotations,</span> 15th ed. [1980], 703). There are, in fact, several different variations of this quote, including “Those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it.” Regardless of the exact language, the sentiment is profound. There are great lessons to be learned from the past, and you ought to learn them so that you don’t exhaust your spiritual strength repeating past mistakes and bad choices.</p>

Time and again we see the cycle of righteousness followed by wickedness. Similarly, the Book of Mormon records that ancient civilizations of this continent followed exactly the same pattern: righteousness followed by prosperity, followed by material comforts, followed by greed, followed by pride, followed by wickedness and a collapse of morality until the people brought calamities upon themselves sufficient to stir them up to humility, repentance, and change.</p>

This time the people turned against Christ and His Apostles. The collapse was so great we have come to know it as the Great Apostasy, which led to the centuries of spiritual stagnation and ignorance called the Dark Ages.</p>

Our Heavenly Father loves all of His children, and He wants them all to have the blessings of the gospel in their lives. Spiritual light is not lost because God turns His back on His children. Rather, spiritual darkness results when His children turn their collective backs on Him. It is a natural consequence of bad choices made by individuals, communities, countries, and entire civilizations. This has been proven again and again throughout the course of time. One of the great lessons of this historical pattern is that our choices, both individually and collectively, do result in spiritual consequences for ourselves and for our posterity.</p>

The Restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith in the early 1800s is only the most recent example. Similar restorations were accomplished in earlier times through such prophets as Noah, Abraham, Moses, and, of course, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.</p>

Never in recorded history has there been a period of such remarkable progress in terms of science and technology. These advances have helped to facilitate gospel growth and expansion throughout the world. But they have also contributed to the rise of materialism and self-indulgence and to the decline of morality.</p>

The commandments of God have taken a beating in the vacillating marketplace of ideas that absolutely rejects the notion of right and wrong. Certain factions of society seem generally mistrustful of anyone who chooses to live according to religious belief. And when people of faith attempt to warn others of the possible consequences of their sinful choices, they are scoffed at and ridiculed, and their most sacred rites and cherished values are publicly mocked.</p>

Do you see the historical pattern emerging again—the pattern of righteousness followed by prosperity, followed by material comforts, followed by greed, followed by pride, followed by wickedness and a collapse of morality—the same pattern we’ve seen again and again within the pages of the Old and New Testaments and the Book of Mormon? More importantly, what impact will the lessons of the past have on the personal choices you make right now and for the rest of your lives?</p>

Each one of you has to decide for yourself if you are going to ignore the past and suffer the painful mistakes and tragic pitfalls that have befallen previous generations, experiencing for yourself the devastating consequences of bad choices. How much better your life will be if you will follow the noble example of the faithful followers of Christ such as the sons of Helaman, Moroni, Joseph Smith, and the stalwart pioneers—and choose, as they did, to remain faithful to your Heavenly Father’s commandments.</p>

You don’t have to spend time as a Laman or a Lemuel in order to know that it’s much better to be a Nephi or a Jacob. You don’t have to follow the path of Cain or Gadianton in order to realize that “wickedness never was happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>). And you don’t have to allow your community to become like Sodom or Gomorrah in order to understand that it isn’t a good place to raise a family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/learning-the-lessons-of-the-past.p18" pid="TvtshmvjYkuqP2XtDWZjrw" hash="-5zrAw">Learning the lessons of the past allows you to walk boldly in the light without running the risk of stumbling in the darkness. This is the way it’s supposed to work. This is God’s plan: father and mother, grandfather and grandmother teaching their children; children learning from them and then becoming a more righteous generation <span class="pageBreak" page-number="34"></span>through their own personal experiences and opportunities. Learning the lessons of the past allows you to build personal testimony on a solid bedrock of obedience, faith, and the witness of the Spirit.</p>

Learning the names and dates and sequence of events from the printed page won’t help you very much unless the meaning and the message are written in your hearts. Nourished by testimony and watered with faith, the lessons of the past can take root in your hearts and become a vibrant part of who you are.</p>

That is the difference-maker, my young brothers and sisters. That is how you know. That is how you avoid the mistakes of the past and take your spirituality to the next level. If you are open and receptive to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit in your lives, you will understand the lessons of the past, and they will be burned into your souls by the power of your testimonies.</p>

Well, there’s no new technology for that, nor will there ever be. You cannot do a Google search to gain a testimony. You can’t text message faith. You gain a vibrant, life-changing testimony today the same way it has always been done. The process hasn’t been changed. It comes through desire, study, prayer, obedience, and service. That is why the teachings of prophets and apostles, past and present, are as relevant to your life today as they ever have been.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="47"></span>It is a wonderful sight to see all of you fathers sitting shoulder to shoulder with your sons to listen to the teachings of the Lord and receive counsel from the General Authorities of the Church. It is always a joy to be united with men and young men of the priesthood, but there is something special about seeing fathers and sons here together. It is a visual reminder of two of the most powerful elements of our theology: priesthood and family. The priesthood is the divine power through which families are sealed together forever. Everything in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, including the ordinances of the holy temple, is focused on the possibilities of families becoming part of the eternal family of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p2" pid="B7VTafQ_fkeXfbo5xb2KVA" hash="0qG6DA">Tonight I want to talk to you fathers and sons about how you talk to each other. There is no other relationship quite like that which can and should exist between a boy and his dad. It can be one of the most nurturing, joyful relationships in life, one that can have a profound impact on who boys become and also on who dads become. Now, I understand that some of you young men do not have fathers with whom you can have these kinds of conversations. And some of you men do not have sons or have lost your sons to accident or illness. But much of what I say tonight will apply to uncles and grandfathers and priesthood leaders and other mentors who sometimes fill the gaps for these significant father-son relationships.</p>

Dads are a little further down the road, but none of us has yet arrived at our final destination. We are all in the process of becoming who we will one day be. Fathers and sons can play a critical role in helping each other become the best that they can be.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">First,</span> trust your father. He is not perfect, but he loves you and would never do anything he didn’t think was in your best interest. So talk to him. Share your thoughts and feelings, your dreams and your fears. The more he knows about your life, the better chance he has to understand your concerns and to give you good counsel. When you put your trust in your dad, he will feel the responsibility of that trust and try harder than ever to understand and to help. As your father, he is entitled to inspiration on your behalf. His advice to you will be the heartfelt expressions of someone who knows and loves you. Your dad wants more than anything for you to be happy and successful, so why would you not want to trust someone like that? Boys, trust your dad.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p10" pid="xuKcDsCSYE-QqM6Yvv0mEA" hash="XgrKYA">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="48"></span>
        <span class="emphasis">Second,</span> take an interest in your father’s life. Ask about his job, his interests, his goals. How did he decide to do the work that he does? What was he like when he was your age? How did he meet your mother? And as you learn more about him, you may find that his experiences help you to better understand why he responds the way that he does. Watch your dad. Watch how he treats your mother. Watch how he performs his Church callings. Watch how he interacts with other people. You will be surprised what you learn about him just by watching him and listening to him. Think about what you don’t know about him and find out. Your love, admiration, and understanding will increase by what you learn. Boys, be interested in your dad’s life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p11" pid="ssx5189SNUa39jTGuPQ4Og" hash="KiR5Qg">And <span class="emphasis">third,</span> ask your father for advice. Let’s be honest: he is probably going to give you his advice whether you ask for it or not, but it just works so much better when you ask! Ask for his advice on Church activity, on classes, on friends, on school, on dating, on sports or other hobbies. Ask for his counsel on your Church assignments, on preparing for your mission, on decisions or choices you have to make. Nothing shows respect for another person as much as asking for his advice, because what you are really saying when you ask for advice is, “I appreciate what you know and the experiences you have had, and I value your ideas and suggestions.” Those are nice things for a father to hear from his son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p12" pid="__ChbfDWP06zYFGHwkhRLw" hash="OYOK9w">In my experience, fathers who are asked for advice try harder to give good, sound, useful counsel. By asking your father for advice, you not only receive the benefit of his input, but you also provide him with a little extra motivation to strive to be a better father and a better man. He will think more carefully about whatever it is that he advises, and he will work harder to “walk the talk.” Young men, ask your dad for advice!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p13" pid="2awJiMMt8EGiTJhLqDlMtQ" hash="pzk9Mw">OK, fathers, now it’s your turn. Let’s talk about some things you can do to enhance your relationship with your sons. You will notice that there is some linkage between the three suggestions I am going to give you and the suggestions I just gave your sons. That isn’t coincidental.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p14" pid="vVd_9dQG20yJ0Nq9mMqV3g" hash="uMorWA">
        <span class="emphasis">First,</span> fathers, listen to your sons—really listen to them. Ask the right kind of questions, and listen to what your sons have to say each time you have a few minutes together. You need to know—not to guess but to know—what is going on in your son’s life. Don’t assume that you know how he feels just because you were young once. Your sons live in a very different world from the one in which you grew up. As they share with you what’s going on, you will have to listen very carefully and without being judgmental in order to understand what they are thinking and experiencing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p15" pid="FZgdIuNKwEq_F-behLOXLQ" hash="HJIUSw">Find your own best way to connect. Some fathers like to take their sons fishing or to a sporting event. Others like to go on a quiet drive or work side by side in the yard. Some <span class="pageBreak" page-number="49"></span>find their sons enjoy conversations at night just before going to bed. Do whatever works best for you. A one-on-one relationship should be a routine part of your stewardship with your sons. Every father needs at least one focused, quality conversation with his sons every month during which they talk about specific things such as school, friends, feelings, video games, text messaging, worthiness, faith, and testimony. Where or when this happens isn’t nearly as important as the fact that it happens.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p16" pid="Yx3-KDu09EiBudWrfs0BAQ" hash="oK04Gg">And oh, how fathers need to listen. Remember, conversation where you do 90 percent of the talking is not a conversation. Use the word “feel” as often as you comfortably can in your discussions with your sons. Ask: “How do you feel about what you’re learning in that class?” “How do you feel about what your friend said?” “How do you feel about your priesthood and the Church?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p17" pid="WfyCcYfA70SBFbNGRo8ZgQ" hash="j_gD7g">Don’t think you have to try to fix everything or solve everything during these visits. Most of the time, the best thing you can do is just listen. Fathers who listen more than they talk find that their sons share more about what is really going on in their lives. Dads, listen to your sons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p18" pid="QWLyJ7AwnE6IF-PUha_9xA" hash="GZyZqg">
        <span class="emphasis">Second,</span> pray with and for your sons. Give them priesthood blessings. A son who is worried about a big exam or a special event will surely benefit from a father’s priesthood blessing. Occasions like the start of a new school year, a birthday, or as he begins to date may be opportune times to call upon the Lord to bless your son. One-on-one prayer and the sharing of testimonies can draw you closer to each other as well as closer to the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p19" pid="oRG9QsHTWEacYCgiC6jXiA" hash="jgwQcg">I am mindful that many of you fathers suffer heartache over sons who have strayed and are being captured by the world, just as Alma and Mosiah worried about their sons. Continue to do all you can to maintain strong family relationships. Never give up, even when fervent prayer in their behalf is all you can do. These precious sons of yours are your sons forever! Fathers, pray with and bless your sons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p20" pid="JI8xNv6um0GwlvvjUpRTsw" hash="NFQP6Q">
        <span class="emphasis">Third,</span> dare to have the “big talks” with your sons. You know what I mean: talks about drugs and drinking, about the dangers of today’s media—the Internet, cyber technologies, and pornography—and about priesthood worthiness, respect for girls, and moral cleanliness. While these should not be the only subjects you talk about with your sons, please don’t shy away from them. Your boys need your counsel, guidance, and input on these subjects. As you talk about these very important matters, you will find that the trust between you will flourish.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p21" pid="CjdOJnrhSUqHQ50sV4sxXg" hash="hcK6og">I am especially concerned that we communicate openly and clearly with our sons about sexual matters. Your sons are growing up in a world that openly embraces and flaunts early, casual, and thoughtless promiscuity. Your sons simply cannot avoid the blatant sexual imagery, messages, and enticements that are all around them. Fathers and Church leaders need to have open and frequent discussions that teach and clarify how young men of the priesthood handle this issue. Be positive about how wonderful and beautiful physical intimacy can be when it happens within the bounds the Lord has set, including temple covenants and commitments of eternal marriage. Studies show that the biggest deterrent to casual sexual activity is a wholesome attitude that connects such personal relationships with genuine commitment and mature love. Fathers, if you have not <span class="pageBreak" page-number="50"></span>had this “big talk” with your sons, please do so, and do it soon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p22" pid="A4v90eenOkK3d97dLIMYXw" hash="u3ZrIA">Now, in closing, I want to talk to all of you returned missionaries. Everything that I have said tonight also applies to you. Trust your father. You can be closer to him now than ever before regardless of what your relationship was like before your mission. During the next few years, you will make the most important decisions of your life. Along with prayer to your Heavenly Father, advice from your earthly father can help you make those decisions concerning your education, career choice, and marriage. The most important decision you will make in this life is the decision to marry the right girl in the temple! While no one should rush this significant decision, all returned missionaries should be working on it. Be where you can meet the right kind of friends. And go on dates. Hanging out is not the way, nor is it enough! Courting seems to be a lost art. Rediscover it. It really works! Ask your fathers—they know! Do not drift to the ways of the world. Rather, maintain the dignity and the Spirit you enjoyed on your mission. The Church will need your leadership in the future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p23" pid="fXfi3e_8A0iQ7wJOjcchFA" hash="NY_8Tg">And fathers, the three suggestions I made to you moments ago absolutely apply to your relationships with your returned missionary sons. Listen to them, and connect with them in regular, focused conversation. Talk with them in depth about their feelings and desires. Pray with them, and give them blessings as they face the important decisions in their future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/fathers-and-sons-a-remarkable-relationship.p24" pid="eH-YcuDd4UiJyGwX9feAEw" hash="uekLdA">I’m grateful for my sons and my sons-in-law, who have taught me so much, and I pray now that our Heavenly Father will bless all of us as fathers and sons that we will honor our priesthood and that we will love one another by making relationships with each other one of the great, eternal priorities of our lives. I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

As you might expect, my 5 daughters, 24 granddaughters, and ever-increasing number of great-granddaughters have been asking for equal time.

And many of you women do not presently have daughters in your lives. But because <span class="emphasis">all</span> women have within their divine nature both the inherent talent and the stewardship to mother, most of what I will say applies equally to grandmothers, aunts, sisters, stepmothers, mothers-in-law, leaders, and other mentors who sometimes fill the gaps for these significant mother-daughter relationships.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p8" pid="HEnidYSs2EOWDg0Atvohjg" hash="fyOXnA">It is, unfortunately, all too easy to illustrate the confusion and distortion of womanhood in contemporary society. Immodest, immoral, intemperate women jam the airwaves, monopolize magazines, and slink across movie screens—all while being celebrated by the world. The Apostle Paul spoke prophetically of “perilous times” that will come in the last days and specifically referenced something that may have seemed particularly perilous to him: “silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.1,6" class="scriptureRef">2 Timothy 3:1, 6</a>). Popular culture today often makes women look silly, inconsequential, mindless, and powerless. It objectifies them and disrespects them and then suggests that they are able to leave their mark on mankind only by seduction—easily the most pervasively dangerous message the adversary sends to women about themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p9" pid="dBV3u2QRq0qvaLWpwCe9oQ" hash="sAv_Qw">And so, my dear young women, with all my heart I urge you not to look to contemporary culture for your role models and mentors. Please look to your faithful mothers for a pattern to follow. Model yourselves after <span class="emphasis">them,</span> not after celebrities whose standards are not the Lord’s standards and whose values may not reflect an eternal perspective. Look to your mother. Learn from her strengths, her courage, and her faithfulness. Listen to her. She may not be a whiz at texting; she may not even have a Facebook page. But when it comes to matters of the heart and the things of the Lord, she has a wealth of knowledge. As you approach the time for marriage and young motherhood, she will be your greatest source of wisdom. No other person on earth loves you in the same way or is willing to sacrifice as much to encourage you and help you find happiness—in this life and forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p10" pid="-XBrKxyfck2uyJVtIWgBMA" hash="Fq3yTw">Love your mother, my young sisters. Respect her. Listen to her. Trust her. She has your best interests at heart. She cares about your eternal safety and happiness. So be kind to her. Be patient with her imperfections, for she has them. We all do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p11" pid="hsEeNL7BV0yjwGDOo8BkvA" hash="FT2JaQ">Now may I share a few thoughts with you mothers about the special role you play in your daughters’ lives. We have a family friend who travels often with members of her extended family. Her primary observation after each trip is how much the young women behave like their mothers. If the mothers are thrifty, so are their daughters. If the mothers are modest, so are the girls. If the mothers wear flip-flops and other casual clothing to sacrament meeting, so do their daughters. Mothers, your example is extremely important to your daughters—even if they don’t acknowledge it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p12" pid="UDbsR2y-3Ean2d02ZGzO_g" hash="eBCE9g">Throughout the history of the world, women have always been teachers of moral values. That instruction begins in the cradle and continues throughout the lives of their children. Today our society is bombarded with messages about womanhood and <span class="pageBreak" page-number="20"></span>motherhood that are dangerously and wickedly wrong. Following these messages can put your daughters on the path to sin and self-destruction. Your daughters may not understand that unless you tell them or, better, unless you show them how to make good choices. As mothers in Israel, you are your daughters’ first line of defense against the wiles of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p13" pid="HC-6ftfvW0yB1tDGShq5Gg" hash="S9qj5g">Now, mothers, I understand that it sometimes appears that our children aren’t paying attention to the lessons we’re trying to teach them. Believe me—I’ve seen that glazed-over look that comes to the eyes of teenagers just when you’re coming to what you think is the best part of your instruction. Let me assure you that even when you think your daughter is not listening to a thing you say, she is still learning from you as she watches you to see if your actions match your words. As Ralph Waldo Emerson is believed to have said, “What you do speaks so loud that I cannot hear what you say” (see Ralph Keyes, <span class="emphasis">The Quote Verifier</span> [2006], 56).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p14" pid="NiMGbW709UK3DTSmoGZQxQ" hash="xi-w8A">Teach your daughters to find joy in nurturing children. This is where their love and talents can have the greatest eternal significance. Consider in this context President Harold B. Lee’s injunction that “the most important … work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Harold B. Lee</span> [2000], 134). This is true for all of us, of course, but it is especially powerful when considering the relationship of mothers and daughters.</p>

In a sermon to the Relief Society of Nauvoo, the Prophet Joseph counseled, “The tongue is an unruly member—hold your tongues about things of no moment” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</span> [2007], 455).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p16" pid="IXe2_YMUGUm5OhNAj7Tf0g" hash="DIRm1g">In recent years there has been a rash of articles, books, and films written about women and girls who gossip and who are “mean.” Satan is always attempting to undermine the most precious element of a woman’s divine nature—the nature to nurture.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p17" pid="pqlShavIxkGJJowsGRdI9g" hash="A_1ZAw">A mother-daughter relationship is where a daughter learns how to nurture by being nurtured. She is loved. She is taught and experiences firsthand what it feels like to have someone care about her enough to correct her while continuing to encourage and believe in her at the same time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p18" pid="SfdHGbcUE0SWpL8S7T2h5Q" hash="spnRPA">Remember, sisters, God is the source of all moral and spiritual power. We gain access to that power by entering into covenants with Him and keeping those covenants. Mothers, teach your daughters the importance of making covenants, and then show them how to keep those covenants in such a way that they will desire to live worthy to go to the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p19" pid="O0AmVRD-mE2jOItmfB1g8g" hash="CZnv0w">In today’s world this means talking to your daughters about sexual matters. Your daughters as well as your sons are coming of age in a world that openly embraces early, casual, and thoughtless promiscuity. Immodest, unchaste women are glamorized and all too often celebrated and emulated. While there are steps that we can take in our homes and families to minimize our exposure to these unsavory elements of contemporary living, your daughters cannot entirely avoid the blatant sexual messages and enticements that surround them. You need to have frequent, open discussions during which you teach your daughters the truth about these issues.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p20" pid="Vi0RvA5AvUqGu0q_06zjoA" hash="6Jrtlg">For example, they need to understand that when they wear clothing that is too tight, too short, or too low cut, they not only can send the wrong message to young men with whom they associate, but they also perpetuate in their own minds the fallacy that a woman’s value is dependent solely upon her sensual appeal. This never has been nor will it ever be within the righteous definition of a faithful daughter of God. They need to hear this—clearly and repeatedly—from your lips, and they need to see it modeled correctly and consistently in your own personal standards of dress, grooming, and modest living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p21" pid="WeBCTALWUU-V4hMIfZNwHg" hash="L97Hfw">All youth will be more likely to make and keep covenants if they learn how to recognize the presence and <span class="pageBreak" page-number="21"></span>the voice of the Spirit. Teach your daughters about things of the Spirit. Point them to the scriptures. Give them experiences that will help them cherish the blessing of priesthood power in their lives. Through keeping covenants they will learn to hear the voice of the Lord and receive personal revelation. God will truly hear and answer their prayers. The Mutual theme for 2010 applies to our youth as well as to all of us: “Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/1.9" class="scriptureRef">Joshua 1:9</a>).

Last April I encouraged the youth to “learn the lessons of the past.” From that talk I quote: “When you are willing to listen and learn, some of life’s most meaningful teachings come from those who have gone before you. … How much better your life will be if you will follow the noble example of the faithful followers of Christ” (“Learning the Lessons of the Past,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 2009, 31, 33).</p>

In each case my message has been different but similar. I hope you are listening and see a pattern and hear a steady, consistent message that in these last days it is essential—even critical—that parents and children listen to and learn from one another. These are not just ethereal concepts about which I have been speaking. They are the essence, the center, of God’s plan for our eternal happiness and peace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/mothers-and-daughters.p25" pid="KOO3mYFTYEGHoB7uDapQLA" hash="km7lJw">The Church will help wherever we can. We are there to support and sustain you as parents and as children. But the home is the most important place to prepare the youth of today to lead the families and the Church of tomorrow. It rests upon each one of us as mothers and fathers to do all we can to prepare our youth to be faithful, righteous men and women. It is in the home where we must teach the gospel by precept and by example.</p>

Smith: “Our [family] associations are not exclusively intended for this life, for time, as we distinguish it from eternity. We live for time and for eternity. We form associations and relations for time and all eternity. … Who are there besides the Latter-day Saints who contemplate the thought that beyond the grave we will continue in the family organization? the father, the mother, the children recognizing each other … ? this family organization being a unit in the great and perfect organization of God’s work, and all destined to continue throughout time and eternity?” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings: Joseph F.

During the fall all nature is in a state of transition, preparing for the cold, austere beauty of winter.</p>

The adept fisherman studies trout behavior, weather, the water current, and the types of insects trout eat and when those insects hatch. He will often craft by hand the lures he uses. He knows these artificial insects embedded with tiny hooks need to be a perfect deception because the trout will identify even the slightest flaw and reject the fly.</p>

And unlike a fly fisherman who catches and releases the fish unharmed back into the water, Lucifer will not voluntarily let go. His goal is to make his victims as miserable as he is.</p>

One of the main methods he uses against us is his ability to lie and deceive to convince us that evil is good and good is evil. Right from the very beginning in the great Council in Heaven, Satan “sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him. …</p>

Satan and his minions have their lures all around us, hoping that we will falter and take his flies so he can reel us in with counterfeit means. He uses addiction to steal away agency. According to the dictionary, addiction of any kind means to surrender to something, thus relinquishing agency and becoming dependent on some life-destroying substance or behavior.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Unfortunately, too many in our communities today, including some of our own members, become addicted to and then abuse prescription medications. Lucifer, the father of all lies, knows this and uses his influence to steal away one’s agency and capture the abuser with his awful chains (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.22" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 28:22</a>).</p>

Her doctor prescribed a medication to relieve the almost unbearable pain. She thought she needed something more, so she forged prescriptions and finally resorted to buying heroin. This led to her arrest and incarceration. Her obsession with drugs caused her marriage to fail. Her husband divorced her and retained custody of the children. She told me that besides helping to dull her pain, the drugs also provided a short-term but heightened sense of euphoria and well-being. But each dosage of drugs lasted only a few hours, and with each use the duration of relief seemed to lessen. She began to take more and more of the drugs and got caught up in the vicious cycle of addiction. Drugs became her life. The night before I talked with her, she tried to commit suicide. She said she could no longer deal with the physical, emotional, and spiritual pain. She felt trapped with no way out—with no hope.</p>

Even one sniff of something or one pill or one drink of alcohol can lead to addiction. A recovering alcoholic told me that just one drink is the difference between addiction and sobriety. Satan knows this. Do not let him hook you with his artificial lures that can quickly turn into addiction.</p>

I’m not questioning prescription medications for those suffering with treatable illness or great physical pain. They are indeed a blessing. What I am saying is that we need to carefully follow the doses prescribed by doctors. And we need to keep such medications in a safe place where youngsters or anyone else cannot gain access to them.</p>

Remember, brothers and sisters, any kind of addiction is to surrender to something, thus relinquishing agency and becoming dependent. Thus, video-gaming and texting on cell phones need to be added to the list. Some gamers claim to spend up to 18 hours a day going through level after level of video games, neglecting all other aspects of their lives. Texting on cell phones can become an addiction, causing the important interpersonal human communication to become lost. Not long ago a bishop told me two of his youth were standing side by side texting one another rather than talking to each other.</p>

But no matter what addictive cycle one is caught in, there is always hope. The prophet Lehi taught his sons this eternal truth: “Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 2:27</a>).</p>

It begins with prayer—sincere, fervent, and constant communication with the Creator of our spirits and bodies, our Heavenly Father. It is the same principle in breaking a bad habit or repenting from sin of any kind. The formula for having our heart, our body, our mind, and our spirit transformed is found in the scriptures.</p>

Heavenly Father loves all of His children, so thank Him and express sincere faith in Him. Ask Him for the strength to overcome the addiction you are experiencing. Set aside all pride and turn your life and your heart to Him. Ask to be filled with the power of Christ’s pure love. You may have to do this many times, but I testify to you that your body, mind, and spirit can be transformed, cleansed, and made whole, and you will be freed. Jesus said, “I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.12" class="scriptureRef">John 8:12</a>).</p>

Our love for our Father in Heaven and the Lord Jesus Christ needs to be reflected in our daily choices and actions. They have promised peace, joy, and happiness to those who keep Their commandments.</p>

The Lord is our Shepherd, and we shall not want as we trust in the power of the Atonement. I know the Lord can and will free the addicted from their bondage, for as the Apostle Paul proclaimed, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Philippians 4:13</a>). I pray, my brothers and sisters, that this may be so with those who may be struggling with this challenge at this time in their lives, and do so humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The single most important principle that should govern every home is to practice the Golden Rule—the Lord’s admonition that “all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.12" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 7:12</a>). Take a moment and imagine how you would feel if you were on the receiving end of thoughtless words or actions. By our example, let us teach our family members to have love one for another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/finding-joy-through-loving-service.p28" pid="8sJC4BSCwUiHCbpsSCsQ7A" hash="MT5JlQ">Another place where we have ample opportunity to serve is in the Church. Our wards and branches should be places where the Golden Rule always guides our words and actions toward each other. By treating each other kindly, speaking words of support and encouragement, and being sensitive to each other’s needs, we can create loving unity among ward members. Where charity exists, there is no place for gossip or unkind words.</p>

Just two weeks ago, the President of the South America Northwest Area, Elder Marcus B. Nash of the Seventy, reported that by assigning “the strong in spirit to those that are weak,” they are rescuing hundreds of less-active adults and youth. Through love and service, “one by one” they are coming back. These acts of kindness create a strong and lasting bond among everyone involved—both the helpers and the helpees. So many precious memories are centered around such service.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/finding-joy-through-loving-service.p31" pid="zyOVZHbST0iA57l5XuHyUQ" hash="SkCv4w">For example, I remember as a bishop working alongside several active members of my ward as we cleaned out the silage pit at the stake welfare farm. This was not a pleasant assignment! A less-active brother who had not been to church for many years was invited to join with us. Because of the love and fellowship he felt with us as we worked and talked in that smelly silage pit, he came back to church and was later sealed in the temple to his wife and his children. Our fellowship through service has blessed his children, grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren. Many of them have served missions, have married in the temple, and are raising an eternal family—a great work wrought by a simple act, a small fleck of gold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/finding-joy-through-loving-service.p32" pid="MMi_BSY1GkC2OwvGSyupig" hash="sANXuA">A third area where we can serve is in our communities. As a pure expression of our love and concern, we can reach out to those who have need of our help. Many of you have put on Helping Hands T-shirts and worked tirelessly to relieve suffering and improve your communities. Young single adults in the Sendai Japan Stake recently provided invaluable service in searching for members in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake and tsunami. There are countless ways to serve.</p>

The future growth of the Church will not happen through just knocking on strangers’ doors. It will happen when the members, along with our missionaries, filled with the love of God and Christ discern needs and respond to those needs in the spirit of charitable service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/finding-joy-through-loving-service.p36" pid="HTofqwHa2USqfSABoi-0OQ" hash="PL8q3w">When we do this, brothers and sisters, the honest in heart will feel our sincerity and our love. Many will want to know more about us. Then and only then will the Church expand to fill all of the earth. This cannot be accomplished by missionaries alone but requires the interest and service of every member.</p>

In these past few months, several great-grandchildren have come into our family. Although they seem to come faster than I can keep up with, each child is a welcome addition to our family. Each has received a special name chosen by his or her parents, a name to be known by throughout his or her lifetime, distinguishing him or her from anyone else. This is true in every family, and it is also true among the religions of the world.</p>

We believe that Jesus Christ is the Savior and the Redeemer of the world. He atoned for all who would repent of their sins, and He broke the bands of death and provided the resurrection from the dead. We follow Jesus Christ. And as King Benjamin said to his people, so I reaffirm to all of us today: “Ye should remember to retain [His] name written always in your hearts” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:12</a>).</p>

This means that we must be willing to let others know whom we follow and to whose Church we belong: the Church of Jesus Christ. We certainly want to do this in the spirit of love and testimony. We want to follow the Savior by simply and clearly, yet humbly, declaring that we are members of His Church. We follow Him by being Latter-day Saints—latter-day disciples.</p>

Others may try to use the word <span class="emphasis">Mormon</span> more broadly to include and refer to those who have left the Church and formed various splinter groups. Such use only leads to confusion. We are grateful for the efforts of the media to refrain from using the word <span class="emphasis">Mormon</span> in a way that may cause the public to confuse the Church with polygamists or other fundamentalist groups. Let me state clearly that no polygamist group, including those calling themselves fundamentalist Mormons or other derivatives of our name, has any affiliation whatsoever with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

We do not need to stop using the name <span class="emphasis">Mormon</span> when appropriate, but we should continue to give emphasis to the full and correct name of the Church itself. In other words, we should avoid and discourage the term “Mormon Church.”</p>

My response has been, “I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ. Because we believe in the Book of Mormon, which is named after an ancient American prophet-leader and is another testament of Jesus Christ, we are sometimes called Mormons.” In every instance this response has been well received and in fact has opened up opportunities for me to explain the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel in these latter days.</p>

And if you cannot immediately use the full name, at least say, “I belong to the Church of Jesus Christ” and later explain “of Latter-day Saints.”</p>

As I said, referring collectively to members as <span class="emphasis">Mormons</span> is sometimes appropriate. As a practical matter, those outside of our faith come looking for us searching for that term. But once you open up Mormon.org, the proper name of the Church is explained on the home page, and it appears on each additional page on the site. It is impractical to expect people to type the full name of the Church when seeking to find us or when logging on to our website.</p>

Let us develop the habit within our families and our Church activities and our daily interactions of making it clear that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the name by which the Lord Himself has directed that we be known.</p>

				<span class="pageBreak" page-number="82"></span>A recent opinion poll indicated that far too many people still do not understand correctly that <span class="emphasis">Mormon</span> refers to members of our Church. And a majority of people are still not sure that Mormons are Christian. Even when they read of our Helping Hands work throughout the world in response to hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and famines, they do not associate our humanitarian efforts with us as a Christian organization. Surely it would be easier for them to understand that we believe in and follow the Savior if we referred to ourselves as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In this way those who hear the name <span class="emphasis">Mormon</span> will come to associate that word with our revealed name and with people who follow Jesus Christ.</p>

Accordingly, we ask that when we refer to the Church we use its full name wherever possible.”</p>

In this worldwide Church we know that it is the latter. When people make family and religious commitments to gospel principles, they begin to do better spiritually and often temporally as well.</p>

Commitments to family and values are the basic <span class="emphasis">cause.</span> Nearly everything else is <span class="emphasis">effect.</span> When couples marry and make commitments to each other, they greatly increase their chances of economic well-being. When children are born in wedlock and have both a mom and a dad, their opportunities and their likelihood of occupational success skyrocket. And when families work and play together, neighborhoods and communities flourish, economies improve, and less government and fewer costly safety nets are required.</p>

But the good news is that, like any cause and effect, those ills can be reversed if what is causing them is changed. Inequities are resolved by living correct principles and values. Brothers and sisters, the most important <span class="emphasis">cause</span> of our lifetime is our families. If we will devote ourselves to this cause, we will improve every other aspect of our lives and will become, as a people and as a church, an example and a beacon for all peoples of the earth.</p>

The health in our families is better, and we live several years longer than the population average. We contribute more financial resources and more service per capita to those in need, and we are more likely to seek higher education. I point out these things not to boast but to testify that life is better (and much happier) as hearts turn toward family and as families live in the light of the gospel of Christ.</p>

Young men, remember something else that President Joseph F.

The license of the age leads them from paths of duty and responsibility. … Their sisters are the victims … [and] would marry if they could, and would accept cheerfully the responsibilities of family life” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 5th ed.

No one owns a spouse or children; God is the Father of us all and has extended to us the privilege of our own family, which was previously only His, to help us become more like Him. As His children we should learn at home to love God and to know that we can ask Him for the help we need. Everyone, married or single, can be happy and supportive within whatever family you may have.</p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="29"></span>Elder Perry, I think you must be the youngest 90-year-old in the whole Church. You noticed how he jumped out of his chair.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p6" pid="-WIFmqqlY0SGBtYWU948rg" hash="Efz01Q">My beloved brothers and sisters, each time I enjoy a fresh, vine-ripened tomato or eat a juicy peach right off the tree, my thoughts go back 60 years to when my father owned a small peach orchard in Holladay, Utah. He kept beehives there to pollinate the peach blossoms that would eventually grow into very large, delicious peaches.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p7" pid="_xgVMkw_206JwyjurovblQ" hash="acp6eQ">Father loved his gentle honeybees and marveled at the way thousands of them working together transformed the nectar gathered from his peach blossoms into sweet, golden honey—one of nature’s most beneficial foods. In fact, nutritionists tell us it is one of the foods that includes all the substances—enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and water—necessary to sustain life.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p8" pid="pXAVcP37NUe0RmzyUC4W9g" hash="vZjUpQ">My father always tried to involve me in his work with his hives, but I was very happy to let him tend to his bees. However, since those days, I have learned more about the highly organized beehive—a colony of about 60,000 bees.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p9" pid="knlR9p9pI0O4VQJMbrYlyQ" hash="7VSNjQ">Honeybees are driven to pollinate, gather nectar, and condense the nectar into honey. It is their magnificent obsession imprinted into their genetic makeup by our Creator. It is estimated that to produce just one pound (0.45 kg) of honey, the average hive of 20,000 to 60,000 bees must collectively visit millions of flowers and travel the equivalent of two times around the world. Over its short lifetime of just a few weeks to four months, a single honeybee’s contribution of honey to its hive is a mere one-twelfth of one teaspoon.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p10" pid="6gVsmyDKzUG1ch07JViIaQ" hash="UtAlxw">Though seemingly insignificant when compared to the total, each bee’s one-twelfth of a teaspoon of honey is vital to the life of the hive. The bees depend on each other. Work that would be overwhelming for a few bees to do becomes lighter because all of the bees faithfully do their part.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p11" pid="TTWw2dHwfU6ORacbKubNTA" hash="4LYULw">The beehive has always been an important symbol in our Church history. We learn in the Book of Mormon that the Jaredites carried honeybees with them (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.3" class="scriptureRef">Ether 2:3</a>) when they journeyed to the Americas thousands of years ago. Brigham Young chose the beehive as a symbol to encourage and inspire the cooperative energy necessary among the pioneers to transform the barren desert wasteland surrounding the Great Salt Lake into the fertile valleys we have today. We are the beneficiaries of their collective vision and industry.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p12" pid="A5cBUm-wtUamRURnuoqzgw" hash="YpK-oA">The beehive symbol is found in both the interiors and exteriors of many of our temples. This podium where I stand is made from the wood of a walnut tree grown in President Gordon B. Hinckley’s backyard and is adorned with carved beehive images.</p>

Imagine what the millions of Latter-day Saints could accomplish in the world if we functioned like a beehive in our focused, concentrated commitment to the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

These much-needed and much-appreciated emergency responses should certainly continue as a way of bearing one another’s burdens. But what about our everyday lives? What would be the cumulative effect of millions of small, compassionate acts performed daily by us because of our heartfelt Christian love for others? Over time this would have a transformative effect upon all of our Heavenly Father’s children through the extension of His love to them through us. Our troubled world needs this love of Christ today more than ever, and it will need it even more in the years ahead.</p>

Many of us are dutiful in attending our Church meetings. We work hard in our callings and especially on Sundays. That is surely to be commended. But are our minds and our hearts just as anxiously engaged in good things during the rest of the week? Do we just go through the motions, or are we truly converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ? How do we take the seed of faith that has been nurtured in our minds and plant it deep in the fertile soil of our souls? How do we make the mighty change of heart that Alma says is essential for our eternal happiness and peace? (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.12-21" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:12–21</a>).</p>

And the doctrine and gospel of Christ is the only way to obtain eternal life. Only when our testimony transcends what is in our mind and burrows deep into our heart will our motivation to love and to serve become like unto the Savior’s. It is then, and only then, that we become deeply converted disciples of Christ empowered by the Spirit to reach the hearts of our fellowmen.</p>

Then go throughout the day with your heart full of faith and love, looking for someone to help. Stay focused, just like the honeybees focus on the flowers from which to gather nectar and pollen. If you do this, your spiritual sensitivities will be enlarged and you will discover opportunities to serve that you never before realized were possible.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p35" pid="2pDBhWssRUqEk5Cct9lBvw" hash="IBmLSA">President Thomas S. Monson has taught that in many instances Heavenly Father answers another person’s prayers through us—through you and me—through our kind words and deeds, through our simple acts of service and love.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p36" pid="cCDrarVGkkO0BhSyEfGMNQ" hash="mJn8CQ">And President Spencer W. Kimball said: “God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball</span> [2006], 82).</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p37" pid="rXbEJhQGb02ixAJBIgyWLg" hash="F4JGYw">I know that if you do this—at home, at school, at work, and at church—the Spirit will guide you, and you will be able to discern those in need of a particular service that only you may be able to give. You will be prompted by the Spirit and magnificently motivated to help pollinate the world with the pure love of Christ and His gospel.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p38" pid="N_LKmEdV_EavFzIQKaiIpA" hash="rez52g">And remember, like the little honeybee’s one-twelfth teaspoon of honey provided to the hive, if we multiply our efforts by tens of thousands, even millions of prayerful efforts to share God’s love for His children through Christian service, there will be a compounding effect of good that will bring the Light of Christ to this ever-darkening world. Bound together, we will bring love and compassion to our own family and to the lonely, the poor, the broken, and to those of our Heavenly Father’s children who are searching for truth and peace.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p39" pid="JKJjW9kRtUaYltYSbqG2VQ" hash="RebqJA">It is my humble prayer, brothers and sisters, that we will ask in our daily prayers for the inspiration to find someone for whom we can provide some meaningful service, including the service of sharing the gospel truths and our testimonies. At the end of each day, may we be able to say yes to the questions: “Have I done any good in the world today? Have I helped anyone in need?” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 223).</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/be-anxiously-engaged.p40" pid="-BJad3e9-kGZsM9THUPK9g" hash="3nZmWg">This is God’s work. May we be about it as faithfully as the dedicated little honeybees go about theirs, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

What a wonderful instruction he gave to us.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/this-is-my-work-and-glory.p6" pid="gSFs5yDx1EioMw9wKUqJgw" hash="H4rQKw">A few weeks ago, on a cold, dark winter’s night, my wife, Barbara, and I looked in awe up at the sky. The millions of stars seemed exceptionally bright and beautiful. I then turned to the Pearl of Great Price and read again with wonder what the Lord God said to Moses: “And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.33" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:33</a>).</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/this-is-my-work-and-glory.p7" pid="T_I20EHPFEGc-N8CM3iSzA" hash="E--ScA">In our day the Hubble deep-space telescope has confirmed the magnitude of what Moses saw. Hubble scientists say the Milky Way galaxy, of which our earth and sun are just a tiny part, is estimated to be only one of over 200 billion similar galaxies. For me it is difficult to comprehend, impossible to fathom, so large and so vast are God’s creations.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/this-is-my-work-and-glory.p8" pid="BRSB2nJY9EC0FfBA4VjrOw" hash="gVRm6A">Brothers and sisters, the power by which the heavens and earth were and are created is the priesthood. Those of us who are members of the Church know that the source of this priesthood power is God Almighty and His Son, Jesus Christ. Not only is the priesthood the power by which the heavens and the earth were created, but it is also the power the Savior used in His mortal ministry to perform miracles, to bless and heal the sick, to bring the dead to life, and, as our Father’s Only Begotten Son, to endure the unbearable pain of Gethsemane and Calvary—thus fulfilling the laws of justice with mercy and providing an infinite Atonement and overcoming physical death through the Resurrection.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/this-is-my-work-and-glory.p9" pid="4emI83R6UEuWhd97yJ6rWw" hash="HYhhqQ">It is the keys of this priesthood authority and resultant power that He gave to Peter, James, and John and His other Apostles to bless others and to bind in heaven that which is bound on earth.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/this-is-my-work-and-glory.p10" pid="eZrEjc8U3kWFh7ZjPsBpKg" hash="tekKlQ">The power of the priesthood is a sacred and essential gift of God. It is different from priesthood authority, which is the authorization to act in God’s name. The authorization or ordination is given by the laying on of hands. The power of the priesthood comes only when those <span class="pageBreak" page-number="19"></span>who exercise it are worthy and acting in accordance with God’s will. As President Spencer W. Kimball declared, “The Lord has given to all of us, as holders of the priesthood, certain of his authority, but we can only tap the powers of heaven on the basis of our personal righteousness” (“Boys Need Heroes Close By,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1976, 45).</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/this-is-my-work-and-glory.p11" pid="-KD7QOqKQU2IySCKaqFUrQ" hash="04sXng">During the glorious days of the Restoration and the reestablishment of the Church of Jesus Christ in the world today, John the Baptist; Peter, James, and John; Moses; Elias; and Elijah came to the earth and restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith all of the keys and authority of the priesthood for the work of God in these latter days.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/this-is-my-work-and-glory.p12" pid="LGWzZw3zvUaqfJObpGr_0w" hash="sTdaow">It is by these keys, this authority, and this power that the Church of Jesus Christ is organized today, with Christ at the head directing His living prophet, Thomas S. Monson, and assisted by duly called and ordained Apostles.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/this-is-my-work-and-glory.p13" pid="a8d4rVEwJ0S3_wvUU7ZUTg" hash="6fQB-w">In our Heavenly Father’s great priesthood-endowed plan, men have the unique responsibility to administer the priesthood, but they are not the priesthood. Men and women have different but equally valued roles. Just as a woman cannot conceive a child without a man, so a man cannot fully exercise the power of the priesthood to establish an eternal family without a woman. In other words, in the eternal perspective, both the procreative power and the priesthood power are shared by husband and wife. And as husband and wife, a man and a woman should strive to follow our Heavenly Father. The Christian virtues of love, humility, and patience should be their focus as they seek the blessings of the priesthood in their lives and for their family.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/this-is-my-work-and-glory.p14" pid="IJntUYgpwUOTPb7RxGSRAw" hash="6GGnBw">It is crucial for us to understand that Heavenly Father has provided a way for all of His sons and His daughters to have access to the blessings of and be strengthened by the power of the priesthood. Central to God’s plan for His spirit children is His own declaration: “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>).</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/this-is-my-work-and-glory.p15" pid="82DewKuWA0KK3W07w48Mwg" hash="aOVGRA">In the revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in section 81 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord explains that the power of the priesthood is to be used to “succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/81.5" class="scriptureRef">verse 5</a>).</p>

There we had the privilege of meeting with many of our missionaries, perhaps some of your sons and your daughters. Since President Thomas S. Monson’s announcement of the lowering of the age for our young men and our young women to serve, I have had the privilege of meeting with over 3,000 of them. The Light of Christ radiates in their faces, and they are eager to move the work forward—to find and teach, to baptize, to activate, and to strengthen and to build the kingdom of God.

				<span class="pageBreak" page-number="78"></span>Sixty-four years ago this September, I returned home from my mission in England. Three days after returning, I attended a Hello Day dance at the University of Utah with a friend of mine. He told me about a beautiful sophomore named Barbara Bowen, whom he thought I ought to meet. He brought her over and introduced us, and we started to dance.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/following-up.p6" pid="Md6xMtahOkKnkoebfwWa5g" hash="vCNMYw">Unfortunately, this was what we used to call a “tag dance,” which meant that you got to dance with the girl only until somebody else tagged you out. Barbara was vivacious and popular, so I got to dance with her for less than a minute before another young man tagged me out.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/following-up.p7" pid="tmbooni-kkyG0S-7gRtNvg" hash="Ubf-pA">That was just not acceptable to me. Having learned the importance of follow-up on my mission, I got her telephone number and called her the very next day to ask her out, but she was busy with school and social commitments. Thankfully, my mission taught me to be persistent even in the face of discouragement, and I was eventually able to make a date. And that date led to others. Somehow during those dates I was able to convince her that I was the only true and living returned missionary—at least as far as she should be concerned. Now, 64 years later, there are seven children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren who stand as evidence of the significant truth that no matter how good your message is, you may not get a chance to deliver it without consistent, persistent follow-up.</p>

I have seen the unspeakable joy that accompanies testimony-driven inviting and faithful follow-up among members of the Church the world over. While in Argentina recently, I encouraged members to invite someone to church before this general conference. An eight-year-old by the name of Joshua listened and invited his best friend and his friend’s family to an open house at their ward in Buenos Aires. Let me read from a letter I just received that explained Joshua’s invitation and his faithful follow-up:</p>

They are here!’ I looked up to see an entire family approaching the church. Joshua ran out to greet them and hugged his friend. They all came in and seemed to enjoy the open house very much. They took some pamphlets and spent lots of time getting acquainted with some new friends. It was great to see the faith of this little boy and to know that Primary children can be missionaries too.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span>

Most of us experience periods in our lives where the tranquil waters of life are appreciated. At other times, we encounter white-water rapids that are metaphorically comparable to those found in the 14-mile stretch through Cataract Canyon—challenges that may include physical and mental health issues, the death of a loved one, dashed dreams and hopes, and—for some—even a crisis of faith when faced with life’s problems, questions, and doubts.</p>

Our young men and young women have many more distractions to sidetrack them in their preparations for both a mission and a future happy life.

These days you are interviewed to serve as missionaries by your bishops and stake presidents, and most of you will go through your entire lives without being interviewed by a General Authority. That is simply a reflection of the reality in a worldwide church of more than 15 million members. I know I speak for my brethren when I tell you that we wish it were possible for us to know all of you personally and to be able to tell you that we love you and that we support you.</p>

If you find yourself lacking in any of these simple principles, then I urge you to courageously repent and bring your life back in line with gospel standards of righteous discipleship.</p>

As a returned missionary, you “should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of [your] own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults.p32" pid="QVIpYTRWLUuj4ws0m74IMw" hash="g5YrCg">Please use the skills you learned on your mission to bless the lives of people around you every day. Do not shift your focus from serving others to focusing exclusively on school, work, or social activities. Instead, balance your life with spiritual experiences that remind and prepare you for continued, daily ministering to others.</p>

I would hope that all of our young adults, whether or not you served full-time missions, understand the importance of visiting with people who are lonely, sick, or discouraged—not only as an assignment but also because of the genuine love you have for Heavenly Father and His children.</p>

You young adults should enroll in an institute of religion.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> If you are attending a Church school, consistently include a class each semester in religious education. During this important season of preparation for a mission, eternal marriage, and life as an adult, you must continue to find ways to learn and grow and receive inspiration and guidance through the Holy Ghost. A careful, prayerful study of the gospel through seminary, institute, or religious education classes can assist you in that goal.</p>

Seminary, institute, or religion classes will provide balance to your life and add to your secular education by giving you another opportunity to spend time studying the scriptures and the teachings of the prophets and apostles. There are four outstanding new courses that I would encourage every young adult to look into and to attend.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Brethren, if you will set aside your cell phone and actually look around a little, you may even find your future companion at the institute.</p>

Please stop delaying! I know some of you fear family formation. However, if you marry the right person at the right time and in the right place, you need not fear. In fact, many problems you encounter will be avoided if you are “anxiously engaged” in righteous dating, courting, and marriage. Don’t text her! Use your own voice to introduce yourself to the righteous daughters of God who are all around you. To actually hear a human voice will shock her—perhaps into saying yes.</p>

If the people will have implicit confidence in their God, never forsake their covenants nor their God, He will guide us right.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p6" pid="Idk33G459kS7EAdXLq4KbQ" hash="jqxYtw">Clearly, our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ have outfitted the Old Ship Zion with clear and simple eternal truths that will help us stay the course through the troubled waters of mortal life. Here are just a few.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p7" pid="DwbtIWQ1Z0CNRUQ_ZV2UZg" hash="q0CK6w">The Church of Jesus Christ has always been led by living prophets and apostles. Though mortal and subject to human imperfection, the Lord’s servants are inspired to help us avoid obstacles that are spiritually life threatening and to help us pass safely through mortality to our final, ultimate, heavenly destination.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p8" pid="hpDhOkadDEuHqmGGBjfrAg" hash="nn2f_A">During my nearly 40 years of close association, I have been a personal witness as both quiet inspiration and profound revelation have moved to action the prophets and apostles, the other General Authorities, and the auxiliary leaders. While neither perfect nor infallible, these good men and women have been perfectly dedicated to leading the work of the Lord forward as He has directed.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p9" pid="7ee1tFFfP0meePXiaB84cA" hash="ZqFLTw">And make no mistake about it: the Lord directs His Church through living prophets and apostles. This is the way He has always done His work. Indeed, the Savior taught, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> We cannot separate Christ from His servants. Without His first Apostles, we would not have an eyewitness account of many of His teachings, His ministry, His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, and His death on the cross. Without their testimonies, we would not have an apostolic witness of the empty tomb and the Resurrection.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p14" pid="Vmi5E4J0CUivmASxPF7NPw" hash="0V25cA">It has always been a challenge for the world to accept living prophets and apostles, but it is so essential to do so in order to fully understand the Atonement and the teachings of Jesus Christ and to receive a fulness of the blessings of the priesthood that are given to those He has called.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p15" pid="7JAzFEAA7Uqhz8L49gGaiw" hash="2V36SA">Too many people think Church leaders and members should be perfect or nearly perfect. They forget that the Lord’s grace is sufficient to accomplish His work through mortals. Our leaders have the best intentions, but sometimes we make mistakes. This is not unique to Church relationships, as the same thing occurs in our relationships among friends, neighbors, and workplace associates and even between spouses and in families.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p16" pid="dbfvqI3dMEaiPpJzrxXX4A" hash="mk5P4g">Looking for human weakness in others is rather easy. However, we make a serious mistake by noticing only the human nature of one another and then failing to see God’s hand working through those He has called.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p18" pid="H1vC4EMNaU-SHf6oPJ4WVg" hash="WWHV1Q">A second truth is the doctrine of the plan of salvation. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, God gave the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and many additional teachings to the Church. These include a knowledge of the plan of salvation, which is a map of where we came from, our purpose here on earth, and where we are going when we die. The plan also provides us with a unique, eternal perspective that we are God’s spirit children. By understanding who our Heavenly Father is and our relationship to Him and to His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, we will accept Their commandments and make covenants with Them that will lead us back into Their eternal presence.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p19" pid="5bEzbqpVCEa3Pi-Y65IR1Q" hash="V8aURw">Every time I hold a newborn child, I find myself wondering: “Who are you, little one? What will you become through the Atonement of Christ?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p20" pid="wSGA9x2B6U-xnqNt8DeXEA" hash="k09uMA">We ask similarly reflective questions when someone we love dies: “Where are they? What are they seeing and experiencing? Does life continue? What will be the nature of our most cherished relationships in the great world of the spirits of the dead?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p21" pid="s3aF6Xz3R0-2sI6q8jXKjw" hash="ah6qog">In that world, our family has two granddaughters, Sara and Emily, and a grandson, Nathan. With each grandchild’s passing, we as a family held on to the gospel truths with both hands. Our questions were answered with comfort and assurance through the Atonement of the Savior. Although we miss our grandchildren, we know they live, and we know we will see them again. How grateful we are for this spiritual understanding in times of personal and familial turbulence.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p22" pid="76h1MlJbdkuGF1U6bZ8-Lg" hash="EyF3UA">Another key truth in the Church is that Heavenly Father created Adam and Eve for a lofty purpose. It was their charge—and, subsequently, the charge of their posterity—to create mortal bodies for God’s spirit children so they could experience mortality. By this process, Heavenly Father sends His spirit children to earth to learn and grow through the experiences of earth life. Because He loves His children, God sends heavenly messengers and Apostles to teach them about Jesus Christ’s central role as our Savior.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p23" pid="ctrBqqW24EWbln9X7weA8g" hash="lhQ3LQ">Through the centuries, prophets have fulfilled their duty when they have warned people of the dangers before them. The Lord’s Apostles are duty bound to watch, warn, and reach out to help those seeking answers to life’s questions.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p24" pid="zoTYcqC_nEyitrixhe6Dvw" hash="JVC4yA">Twenty years ago, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued “The Family: A Proclamation to the World.” In that inspired document, we concluded with the following: “We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p25" pid="NoXsL9CvM0ein-ThcYnBfQ" hash="GfTXhQ">As Apostles, we reaffirm this solemn warning again today. Please remember that commandments and covenants are priceless truths and doctrines found in the Old Ship Zion, where God is at the helm.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p26" pid="LtpYW6qGn0mYpnbTTOBCPw" hash="C7oIbQ">Another important doctrine that we should cling to is to observe the Sabbath day. This helps us remain unspotted from the world, provides us with physical rest, and gives each of us the spiritual refreshment of worshipping the Father and the Son every Sunday.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> When we delight in the Sabbath day, it is a sign of our love for Them.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p27" pid="PHCH0SNBDEaVxfEo80gn_Q" hash="v-t9RQ">As part of our efforts to make the Sabbath a delight, we have asked local leaders and Church members to remember that sacrament meeting is the Lord’s and should be rooted and grounded in His teachings. The presentation of the ordinance of the sacrament is when we renew our covenants and reconfirm our love for the Savior and remember His sacrifice and His Atonement.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p28" pid="YE6Ql557YUqr-gJOwPakTA" hash="L6ifJA">This same spirit of worship should permeate our monthly fast and testimony meetings. This sacrament meeting is for members to briefly express gratitude, love, and appreciation for our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the restored gospel and to bear personal witness of these things. Fast and testimony meeting is a time to share brief inspirational thoughts and bear solemn testimony. It is not a time to give a speech.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p29" pid="HcA2HzEP10CBC4b4sMI88g" hash="_Fj39A">Young children should practice sharing their testimonies in Primary and with their parents in family home evening gatherings until they understand the important meaning of a testimony.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p30" pid="pR7t0ACXY0umwQPzWeRh1Q" hash="Oq2dBw">The recent emphasis of making the Sabbath a delight is a direct result of inspiration from the Lord through the leaders of the Church. Ward council members should assist the bishopric several weeks in advance by reviewing music and topics that have been recommended for each sacrament meeting.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p31" pid="YBGp5yrExE2zfblhFfqnSQ" hash="X0t6Vg">All of us are blessed when the Sabbath is filled with love for the Lord at home and at church. When our children are taught in the ways of the Lord, they learn to feel and to respond to His Spirit. We will all desire to attend each Sunday to partake of the sacrament when we feel the Spirit of the Lord. And all, young and old, who are carrying heavy burdens will feel the spiritual uplift and comfort that comes from a Sabbath day of devoted contemplation of our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/god-is-at-the-helm.p32" pid="P-BQ7kw_PkqQ03SkLVJO1g" hash="pjAXRA">Thankfully, Christ is always near, waiting and willing to help us when we pray for help and are willing to repent and come unto Him.</p>

		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p5" pid="3JroItWyVkuVpwyS65dVag" hash="o-2hPQ"&gt;My brothers and sisters, the irony of being parents is that we tend to get good at it after our children are grown. I will share with you this afternoon something I wish I had understood better when Barbara and I began to raise our precious children.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p6" pid="W75ffiFA6EWuVK94QeEXxw" hash="unDoJA"&gt;During my apostolic ministry, I have frequently emphasized the power and importance of Church councils, including mission, stake, ward, and auxiliary councils.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p7" pid="PU8h1o480EKh1JfiCboReg" hash="jdykcw"&gt;I believe councils are the most effective way to get real results. Additionally, I know councils are the Lord’s way and that He created all things in the universe through a heavenly council, as mentioned in the holy scripture.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p8" pid="Kl4PMhHiukiX5cKsPerb8w" hash="MokEKQ"&gt;Until now, however, I have never talked in general conference about the most basic and fundamental—and perhaps the most important—of all councils: the family council.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p9" pid="DroJeR9MOEqGqGquOgc8KQ" hash="AqxJdg"&gt;Family councils have always been needed. They are, in fact, eternal. We belonged to a family council in the premortal existence, when we lived with our heavenly parents as their spirit children.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p10" pid="VcJtsF764UaBjo_xQXIjSA" hash="dzAmRQ"&gt;A family council, when conducted with love and with Christlike attributes, will counter the impact of modern technology that often distracts us from spending quality time with each other and also tends to bring evil right into our homes.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p11" pid="I5zhmmWKCEeC9r5XG6rlQQ" hash="ns_JWg"&gt;Please remember that family councils are different from family home evening held on Mondays. Home evenings focus primarily on gospel instruction and family activities. Family councils, on the other hand, can be held on any day of the week, and they are primarily a meeting at which parents listen—to each other and to their children.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p12" pid="Ge1SbPnGvUSDnwD1_au04w" hash="6FTE2Q"&gt;I believe there are at least four types of family councils:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p13" pid="beQr0S4uk0iNln5kVPFFEg" hash="AwEp6g"&gt;First, a general family council consisting of the entire family.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p14" pid="_CjXjDX6pkSwTHQkztpboQ" hash="EwtzCg"&gt;Second, an executive family council consisting of a mother and father.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p15" pid="j2jg6JFJH0C-LX8r7CsWlw" hash="befZUQ"&gt;Third, a limited family council consisting of parents and one child.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p16" pid="f6YdkgNwXkqvpmQiuw_aaw" hash="-lR-cw"&gt;Fourth, a one-on-one family council consisting of one parent and one child.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p17" pid="Dyb_YCpgq0a69mr_2wx9Ew" hash="3Y8SsA"&gt;In all of these family council settings, electronic devices need to be turned off so everyone can look at and listen to each other. During family councils and at other appropriate times, you may want to have a basket for the electronic devices so when the family gathers, everyone—including Mom and Dad—can deposit his or her phones, tablets, and MP3 players in the basket. Thereafter, they can counsel together without being tempted to respond to a poke on Facebook, to a text, to Instagram, to Snapchat, or to email alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p18" pid="rmmb6_NAd0KswIFYm8g1YA" hash="AaV1Eg"&gt;Let me briefly share with you how each of these types of family councils can work.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p19" pid="YgHuLT2GKUewXu8yhvvWxw" hash="1mC6ug"&gt;&lt;span class="strong"&gt;First, the full family council &lt;/span&gt;includes all family members.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p20" pid="StazD1Qk3EOPnjGXFQp3ZQ" hash="MGz5Xg"&gt;The Church pamphlet entitled &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;Our Family&lt;/span&gt; states, “This council can meet to discuss family problems, work out finances, make plans, support and strengthen [each other], and pray for one another and for the family unit.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p21" pid="gK8OTnOrkkKGsCNF-nyi5w" hash="GxiXzg"&gt;This council should meet at a predesignated time and is normally more formal than any other type of family council.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p22" pid="--XDcRUaZECcdQrtuMnV-Q" hash="zw2ZxA"&gt;It should start with a prayer, or it may simply be a natural extension of conversations already started in other settings. Please note that a family council may not always have a formal beginning or ending.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p23" pid="zoaOFQJaDkeHeMVZ0Szgxg" hash="dDvQPA"&gt;When parents are prepared and children listen and participate in the discussion, the family council is truly working!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p24" pid="pORQbI2yEU6VdsVwnn2_cQ" hash="lIUE0Q"&gt;No matter what our particular family situation is, it is critical that we understand the unique circumstances of each family member. Though we may share DNA, there may be situations and circumstances among us that may make us vastly different from each other and which may require the compassionate collaboration of the family council.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p25" pid="ETcEZz4RokiTg36uj9eUoQ" hash="ul-EDw"&gt;For example, all the talking and sharing and loving in the world may not solve a medical problem or an emotional challenge that one or more family members may be facing. At such times, the family council becomes a place of unity, loyalty, and loving support as outside help is enlisted in the search for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p26" pid="Mnpp0ZVhOkaEoHWYSkv1HA" hash="Pd-exg"&gt;Siblings, especially the older ones, can be powerful mentors to young children if parents will use the family council to enlist their help and support during times of difficulty and duress.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p27" pid="bq_mtoiVKk6S5IrdZSlp6A" hash="PVT-ow"&gt;In this way, a family is much like a ward. When the bishop involves ward council members, he can solve problems and accomplish a lot of good in ways he never could do without their help. In a similar fashion, parents need to involve all family members in dealing with challenges and adversity. That way, the power of the family council is put to work. When council members feel they are part of a decision, they become supporters and specific positive results can be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p28" pid="LSah8RHUKUiXwJTZfFFCtw" hash="9vRnnw"&gt;Not every family council consists of two parents and children. Your family council may look very different than our family council looked when we were raising our seven children. Today our family council consists only of Barbara and me, unless we hold an extended family council that includes our adult children, their spouses, and sometimes our grandchildren and great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p29" pid="PF6n7j7dTUmzCfIWR_E2Gg" hash="m9JVmw"&gt;Those who are single and even students living away from home can follow the divine council pattern by gathering with friends and roommates to counsel together.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p30" pid="IBZvbhqt20G_WReAaWC1aA" hash="gJ3_Sg"&gt;Consider how the atmosphere in an apartment would change if roommates gathered regularly to pray, listen, discuss, and plan things together.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p31" pid="HMO6WhaElEG5_O_iS07-4Q" hash="N42JnA"&gt;Everyone can adapt a family council to take advantage of this divine pattern established by our loving Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p32" pid="HFmzLkoHM0qzOHA_WkAmwQ" hash="QQrRDA"&gt;As noted previously, from time to time an expanded family council may be helpful. An expanded family council can be composed of grandparents and adult children who are not living at home. Even if grandparents or adult children live far away, they can participate in family councils via the telephone, Skype, or FaceTime.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p33" pid="UAizNZ-P-UiJL50MmwNAbA" hash="xj5Ppw"&gt;You may want to consider holding the general family council on Sunday, which is the first day of the week; families can review the past week and plan for the coming week. This may be exactly what your family needs to help make the Sabbath a delightful experience.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p34" pid="ETZLj2gS30eE1Fgo0X3XRg" hash="lhUAXQ"&gt;&lt;span class="strong"&gt;The second type of family council&lt;/span&gt; is an executive family council that involves only the parents. During this time together, parents can review each child’s physical, emotional, and spiritual needs and his or her progress.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p35" pid="-9UWBaoCsEO3nhU9RRkP6Q" hash="FE22KA"&gt;The executive family council is also a good time for wives and husbands to talk about their personal relationships with each other. When Elder Harold B. Lee performed our sealing, he taught us a principle that I believe all couples will find helpful. He said, “Never retire without kneeling together, holding hands, and saying your prayers. Such prayers invite Heavenly Father to counsel us by the power of the Spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p36" pid="Jxf6KKAg5E60S3m7K8b7IA" hash="hDk_Ww"&gt;&lt;span class="strong"&gt;The third type of family council&lt;/span&gt; is a limited family council. Here, both parents spend time with an individual child in a formal or an informal setting. This is an opportunity for a discussion on &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;making decisions in advance &lt;/span&gt;about such things as what he or she will and will not do in the future. When such decisions are made, he or she may want to record them for future reference if needed. If your son or daughter sees you as a staunch supporter, this council meeting can establish goals and objectives for the future. This is also a time to carefully listen to serious concerns and challenges that a child may have faced with such things as lack of confidence, abuse, bullying, or fear.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p37" pid="YiBKG1TYXkKupWLSrPhbNg" hash="-_lo0w"&gt;&lt;span class="strong"&gt;The fourth type of family council&lt;/span&gt; is a one-on-one family council involving one parent and one child. This type of family council generally just happens. For example, the parent and child can take advantage of informal opportunities while traveling in the car or working around the house. An outing with one child with either father or mother can provide a special spiritual and emotional bonding time. Calendar these in advance so children can anticipate and look forward to a special time alone with Mom or Dad.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p38" pid="oGCoxQXq7U6VYYh5yZZqrw" hash="YWpnKQ"&gt;Now, brothers and sisters, there was a time when the walls of our homes provided all the defense we needed against outside intrusions and influences. We locked the doors, closed the windows; we shut the gates; and we felt safe, secure, and protected in our own little refuge from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p39" pid="rmkcv242z0-lo1ndcSYemw" hash="dWHiUw"&gt;Those days are now gone. The physical walls, doors, fences, and gates of our homes cannot prevent unseen invasion from the Internet, the Wi-Fi, the mobile phones, the networks. They can penetrate our homes with just a few clicks and keystrokes.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p40" pid="Yx2uVkXzv02Nz1xeqJ0YZA" hash="3lop4g"&gt;Fortunately, the Lord has provided a way to counter the invasion of negative technology that can distract us from spending quality time with each other. He has done this by providing the council system to strengthen, protect, safeguard, and nurture our most precious relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p41" pid="oIFETTN5uU6srIuS856xoA" hash="8VS3xg"&gt;Children desperately need parents willing to listen to them, and the family council can provide a time during which family members can learn to understand and love one another.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p42" pid="6_0JhKowGkycscdMA_RvGg" hash="F2H85Q"&gt;Alma taught, “Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; Inviting the Lord to be part of our family council through prayer will improve our relationships with each other. We can, with Heavenly Father and our Savior’s help, become more patient, thoughtful, helpful, forgiving, and understanding as we pray for help. With Their help, we can make our homes a little bit of heaven here on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p43" pid="FHzMgpOs80So5Yjom7zDHw" hash="kDrd8Q"&gt;A family council that is patterned after the councils in heaven, filled with Christlike love, and guided by the Lord’s Spirit will help us to protect our family from distractions that can steal our precious time together and protect us from the evils of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p44" pid="2LFAbmri6UG9_m6tpaWE6A" hash="tl1D9w"&gt;Combined with prayer, a family council will invite the presence of the Savior, as He promised: “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; Inviting the Spirit of the Lord to be part of your family council brings blessings beyond description.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/family-councils.p45" pid="mC-jYAWBQku-dkJyjuO2Mg" hash="4ML9Tw"&gt;Finally, please remember that a family council held regularly will help us spot family problems early and nip them in the bud; councils will give each family member a feeling of worth and importance; and most of all they will assist us to be more successful and happy in our precious relationships, within the walls of our homes. May our Heavenly Father bless all of our families as we counsel together is my humble prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2016/10/to-whom-shall-we-go?lang=eng</link>

For some, Christ’s invitation to believe and remain continues to be hard—or difficult to accept. Some disciples struggle to understand a specific Church policy or teaching.

What will you do? The decision to “walk no more” with Church members and the Lord’s chosen leaders will have a long-term impact that cannot always be seen right now. There may be some doctrine, some policy, some bit of history that puts you at odds with your faith, and you may feel that the only way to resolve that inner turmoil right now is to “walk no more” with the Saints. If you live as long as I have, you will come to know that things have a way of resolving themselves. An inspired insight or revelation may shed new light on an issue.

It has always been thus, and it ever will be. Life can be like hikers ascending a steep and arduous trail. It is a natural and normal thing to occasionally pause on the path to catch our breath, to recalculate our bearings, and to reconsider our pace. Not everyone needs to pause on the path, but there is nothing wrong with doing so when your circumstances require. In fact, it can be a positive thing for those who take full advantage of the opportunity to refresh themselves with the living water of the gospel of Christ.</p>

Knowing where you are going and how you expect to get there can bring meaning, purpose, and accomplishment to life.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive.p7" pid="thSwxLpYekCC2Lro6xJNrA" hash="a2AgGw">Some have difficulty differentiating between a goal and a plan until they learn that a goal is a destination or an <span class="emphasis">end,</span> while a plan is the route by which you get there. For example, we can have a goal to drive to a certain unfamiliar location, and as some of you dear sisters know, we men often think we know how to get there—often resulting in our saying, “I know it must be just around the next corner.” My wife must be smiling. The goal was clear, but there wasn’t a good plan in place to reach the destination.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive.p8" pid="3NsEFSB7lk-sAv_6cWewVw" hash="LA2pVQ">Goal setting is essentially beginning with the end in mind.

A key to happiness lies in understanding what destinations truly matter—and then spending our time, effort, and attention on the things that constitute a sure way to arrive there.</p>

Clothing our eternal spirits in physical bodies; living by the teachings and commandments of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ; and forming eternal families allows us, through the Savior’s Atonement, to fulfill God’s goal of immortality and eternal life for His children with Him in His celestial kingdom.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive.p11" pid="iAAT5DTpyki1wkut0sa0og" hash="8Z72_Q">Wise goal setting includes the understanding that short-term goals are only effective if they lead to clearly understood longer-term goals. I believe that one important key to happiness is to learn how to set our own goals and establish our own plans within the framework of our Heavenly Father’s eternal plan. If we focus on this eternal path, we will inevitably qualify to return to His presence.</p>

When we can reduce a goal to one clear image or one or two powerful and symbolic words, that goal can then become part of us and guide virtually everything we think and do.

Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Alma’s questions are a reminder of what our goals and plans ought to include in order to <span class="emphasis">return</span> and<span class="emphasis"> receive</span>.</p>

If you need to repent and change, then consider doing so now. Take the time to prayerfully think about what adjustments are needed to help you keep your “eye single to the glory of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive.p27" pid="6soctxphSkSEGsth9uGsSA" hash="g3jUuQ">We must keep the doctrine and gospel of Jesus Christ at the center of our goals and plans.
