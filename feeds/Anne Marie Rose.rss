      <description>I believe in sustaining our living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, by listening to and following his counsel.</description>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/facing-trials-with-optimism.p1" pid="_NlZ2osETku7ahY2y073GQ" hash="n0oSAg">I believe in sustaining our living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, by listening to and following his counsel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/facing-trials-with-optimism.p2" pid="rEN7FpOCI0OlSvXd1MffUQ" hash="qO0qlg">In general conference last fall, I listened to President Hinckley tell of the emigration of thousands of European Saints who faced their trials “with optimism and enthusiasm” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 72). He counseled us to do the same.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/facing-trials-with-optimism.p3" pid="DKQNblUKZEOSyMZGiERIrA" hash="Fexgqg">It was hard advice to hear. At the time I was unhappy, frustrated, and busy feeling sorry for myself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/facing-trials-with-optimism.p4" pid="DZtRQCRIeEOoji1PPFJJRA" hash="IYldDg">For months over the summer, I trained to become a member of the varsity volleyball team. I ran, lifted weights, did endless drills. I put in my time. The work paid off. I made the team. My dream was coming true, or so I expected.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/facing-trials-with-optimism.p5" pid="CNPAZMHuw0ujbvuxEuylIw" hash="enochg">Then the dream started to tarnish. Others played better than I did. Much of the time, I warmed the bench, cheering my teammates, yearning to play more, trying to deal with the disappointment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/facing-trials-with-optimism.p6" pid="7Q93jAqVpEe0ylt5th_n6A" hash="2WtONQ">Life wasn’t being fair. My attitude affected my relationship with the other girls on the team. And it affected how I felt about myself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/facing-trials-with-optimism.p7" pid="u_bcJC734UeU68d9P2QkSg" hash="JmvvSQ">Why would Heavenly Father let me work so hard and come so far to end up so disappointed? Finally, after wrestling with my choices and praying for direction, I decided to leave the team. I needed to get back to my studies and my life away from volleyball.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/facing-trials-with-optimism.p8" pid="m9OBFHB_HEu7RxjNnKmopw" hash="C62p9g">But I couldn’t seem to let go of my disappointment and resentment. Then general conference came. It is a time of year I love because the Spirit is abundant in our home. Conference can be heard in every room.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/facing-trials-with-optimism.p9" pid="lxItP_JZd0WrPwSn8d4dOw" hash="9lbzxg">President Hinckley’s address offered the counsel I needed to put things into perspective. By having an “overpowering spirit of optimism” and enthusiasm (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 72), I could <span class="emphasis">decide</span> to let go of my volleyball experience. I could <span class="emphasis">decide</span> to be positive and optimistic about the many good things in my life: my friendships, my studies, my family. I could play volleyball for <span class="emphasis">fun</span> rather than competition. Suddenly the dilemma that had seemed so overwhelming began to fade. I started to feel better about myself. I read the scriptures more. I prayed more. I liked other people more. I felt the Spirit reenter my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/facing-trials-with-optimism.p10" pid="huhM3fOyd0aEJLDRCug8oQ" hash="AidNNw">I am grateful for a living prophet who taught me to let go of feeling sorry for myself. He quoted <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.35" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:35</a>, which teaches us there never was a people “that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began.” I realize now that I have so much to be grateful for, so many reasons to rejoice. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
