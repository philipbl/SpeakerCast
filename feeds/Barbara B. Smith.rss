We see the importance of the basic unit of society, the family. Within the family stands the father, the priesthood bearer, who is the governing head of the family and its presiding officer. He outlines a blueprint for family action, a design jointly and cooperatively developed and planned to be a blessing for the entire family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/relief-societys-role-in-welfare-services.p2" pid="FBW0KR5vkkCz7xnpwuvdjw" hash="FIdDXg">I am pleased to represent the feminine half of the Church family in this meeting to enthusiastically reaffirm the wisdom of the plan of the priesthood and to pledge the continued support and the effort of the women of the Church to facilitate and to help carry out the great Welfare Services program.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/relief-societys-role-in-welfare-services.p3" pid="0TNXWwBH7kCShGYrPjrdXw" hash="hcOL_w">The Relief Society plays a very important role in Welfare Services. By mandate of the Lord through his prophets, the Relief Society has been given an assignment to assist in planning and implementing the Welfare Services program. To fulfill our welfare stewardship, the Relief Society works with the priesthood at every level in the Church. The general presidency of the Relief Society works with the Presiding Bishopric; a called stake Relief Society president works with the area and region priesthood Welfare Services leaders; the stake Relief Society presidency works with the stake presidency; and the ward Relief Society presidency works with the ward bishopric.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/relief-societys-role-in-welfare-services.p4" pid="ddFo8y1xT0u-q5UxukS0vA" hash="r02fcw">In a Relief Society conference held in 1946, Harold B. Lee, then of the Council of the Twelve, told of a survey conducted in the early days of the welfare plan among those needing welfare assistance. It was found in the families of those surveyed that most of the fathers were <span class="emphasis">not</span> highly skilled workmen and their wives <span class="emphasis">did not</span> possess many of the homemaking and home managerial proficiencies that could help them take care of the resources available to families. Few had learned the skills that would help them be independent. (See <span class="emphasis">Relief Society Magazine,</span> Dec. 1946, pp. 809–17.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/relief-societys-role-in-welfare-services.p5" pid="8HemVZuur0uyxTl_YsVMJQ" hash="Lt8xQQ">If we are to succeed in carrying out the Welfare Services program of family preparedness, it is necessary for women to develop the qualities of industry, thrift, independence, work, and prudence—qualities which, if applied, will help to fortify individuals and families with a secure feeling of self-reliance against the day of need.</p>

There was no immediate response to their knock, but, feeling impressed to try again, the visiting teachers knocked a second time and a third.</p>

The visiting teachers were reluctantly invited into the icy-cold house. In answer to their questions, framed with understanding and care, the woman tearfully revealed the family situation.</p>

By gentle, loving persuasion the young wife finally gave permission for a call to be made to the Relief Society president.</p>

Soon fuel was delivered, the furnace was started, warm food was provided, and a food list was prepared. Then the bishop visited the husband in the hospital where encouragement was given to the sick man that his family was well taken care of. An administration followed in which the young man was reassured concerning his own condition. From that point on, he began to improve. The Relief Society education counselor who was assigned to personal welfare gave the wife suggestions of ways she could better manage the family’s limited resources and give service for commodities received.</p>

Brown, quoted from the Doctrine and Covenants, section 78, verses 13 and 14, in which the Lord says he is preparing us to withstand the tribulations that shall come upon us so that “the church may stand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:14</a>.)</p>

Obedience brings security and self-sufficiency. It breeds confidence and a peaceful attitude.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/teach-lds-women-self-sufficiency.p3" pid="YMcA723tcUeAFNQo3fOdUw" hash="Q_N2mA">Relief Society officers are in a position to materially assist the women of the Church to respond obediently to the advice of our leaders regarding home production and storage, that each family may be prepared to take care of its basic needs for a minimum of one year. Latter-day Saint women should be busily engaged in growing, producing, and conserving food, within their capabilities to do so. Relief Society should help them be provident in the use of the resources available to hem, however great or small these resources may be. By <span class="emphasis">provident,</span> I mean wise, frugal, prudent, making provision for the future while attending to immediate needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/teach-lds-women-self-sufficiency.p4" pid="wOeKZfaic0qoQQPpFFOTvw" hash="JAX5Sg">Relief Society can help give direction to women by providing them with expert instruction and learning experiences. The best place for this teaching is in the ward homemaking meeting, in lessons and in miniclasses. Instruction could also be given in homemaking fairs, seminars, and workshops sponsored by stake and district Relief Societies. Home storage could be a topic for summer visiting teaching messages and could be a suggested theme for talks in ward and stake meetings. Stake and district Relief Society teachers could make this matter a subject of active planning and enlist the cooperation of ward Relief Societies in implementing it.</p>

	<p pid="UCnCL9qFF0OarjlzrxTGkQ" hash="8mwK4g">Each ward or branch Relief Society presidency should make an assessment of the general circumstances of the sisters living within their area and prepare a one-year plan for homemaking meeting instruction to be given on subjects relating to home production and storage, according to the needs and conditions of the women.

When the father recovered, he had to look for work in another community. While he was gone, there was a breakdown in the town water system. The family had gallons of water stored which were used for several days before the water line was repaired. Throughout this experience there was no panic, no sense of being overwhelmed. They were prepared for the emergency. Adequate advance provision had been made, including money saved.

Plans for storage may vary according to the circumstances of individuals or families. But always the guidelines will be helpful that are set forth in the Church Welfare Services Department bulletin, <span class="emphasis">Essentials of Home Storage,</span> available through Church Distribution.

Many could be active participants in the actual work of production projects and canneries. Others might do telephoning and scheduling. Babysitting might be provided to enable young mothers to work on projects or in canneries, or several young mothers could do babysitting for each other. Families might go together to work on a production project, thus strengthening the bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood among them. Women should encourage their families and arrange home activities and schedules so that the family will want to participate. A woman’s attitude and response will set the tone for the entire family and for others. Her enthusiasm can be contagious, and filling such assignments provides her with a golden opportunity to teach gospel principles of love and service, of work and self-reliance, of stewardship and consecration.</p>

She will give a good pattern for her children to follow. She and her family will be blessed physically and socially. Furthermore, the Relief Society sisters of today will discover, as the founding sisters of Nauvoo realized, that there is a special blessing in working with the priesthood brethren of the Church. In so doing, they will be reliving and strengthening the companion pattern that began with Adam and Eve.</p>

Their wise Relief Society president felt that even those who were homebound could serve, and so she gave each of the seventy sisters either a visiting teaching assignment or a compassionate service assignment. Even a sister stricken with a terminal disease was assigned to write a monthly letter to each of three sisters who were homebound. Some sisters were assigned to call other sisters each day to make sure they were all right.</p>

These assignments are for specific tasks, but they do not appoint one to a continuing position in the Church. Official assignments would usually be for a shorter duration than a calling, and might be a one-time task or duty.</p>

Almost every woman can find appropriate ways of serving in good causes.

I’d challenge almost anyone to keep up with her. There seems to be no end to what she finds to do. She attends civic meetings. She studies her Church lesson assignments and makes appropriate contributions to classroom discussions. In a time of need, she is the first one to render compassionate service. I’ve heard many people say that the bowl of hot soup she brought was just what they needed. Was it the food or the loving concern which was special?</p>

Besides the traditional assignments for the elderly, we suggest substitute-grandparenting; teaching in mini-classes such skills as knitting, crocheting, gardening, breadmaking, and quilting, or other skills which younger women often need to learn. They might read to the visually handicapped, compile family and ward histories, write letters for those who need such help, or teach those who wish to learn to read or write.</p>

Some are partially bedridden; others are senile or physically incapacitated. These older people must not be neglected. Some may be adequately cared for in their own homes with the aid of such services as meals brought in to them each day, housekeeping, shopping, out-patient medical services, and a daily telephone check, while other older people need twenty-four-hour care and attention. Often, even though families give this loving care to the elderly, they and the elderly need supportive services from others.</p>

We have missed the sweet spirit of sisterhood found in gathering together and the blessing of peace and comfort which comes when we meet as sisters, by appointment in his name.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p2" pid="E7BWgZwh4E-GyvlasBYFaw" hash="uixSug">It has been an eventful three year period—in the history of the world and the history of the Church. And, in some very particular ways, it has been a challenging three years. Never before has so much been said and written about woman’s role and her place in society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p3" pid="FtJ85G7sWUe4s07LtKcHvA" hash="8Z4T0A">I have had the blessing of meeting with many of you during these three years, and I know that you are prayerfully seeking to understand what the Lord requires of you in this swiftly changing world. The new convert who came up to me after a meeting put it this way: “What <span class="emphasis">is </span>a Mormon woman?” From Japan came the inquiry: “Now that we have forsaken the pattern of our parents and have increased the number of children in our family, how do we raise them?” From women who head their own families come the pleas for direction: “How can I be independent and self-supporting and also stay at home with my children, when there is no support from other sources?” From the single woman: “How can I fit into a Church that is family oriented when there is no husband in my life? Is there work for me to do in the kingdom of God?” The answer is yes. The work of women is essential in the kingdom, whether as wife, mother, sister, or all three.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p4" pid="QEV_FgP8dUSth86-AmLpnQ" hash="QpWjhg">As sisters in Relief Society, we have a noble heritage, a present challenge, and a vision of greatness to be. With the organization of the Relief Society came the Lord’s program for his daughters. The cornerstone of that work was to become deeply engaged in relieving suffering among his children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p5" pid="hkAbEtvP60WLLHpqk9ECqw" hash="0FPtSQ">The Prophet also instructed the sisters that their Society “is not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls.” That challenge is much with us today.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p7" pid="uuJlmpDcxUOZzoIYVMXnxA" hash="3_qnEw">It is important to the spread of the gospel message that we approach the current problems with thoughtful analysis and with the spirit of love. As the Prophet Joseph pointed out in Nauvoo to those earliest Relief Society sisters, we do have a responsibility for the moral climate of the communities in which we live. We cannot abdicate our responsibility as citizens.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p8" pid="sQ_qbV11vE28Z0E5P5-idA" hash="VEsyiA">In the early days of the Church here in this valley, the leaders of the Relief Society, other stalwart women of the community, and the presiding Brethren of the Church worked together to establish suffrage for women among the Saints. It was not expedient. It was not even judicious, in the light of the desperate struggle for statehood, and yet the right of women to vote was unanimously agreed upon and written into their constitution by the first legislators of Utah territory because it was a righteous principle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p9" pid="xrv_rzj63UKCB39aTYpmWQ" hash="fh4BFA">Today, Latter-day Saint women with more opportunity for education, with the right of voting, must step forward to be part of the solution of society’s problems.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p14" pid="eMtaDomes02ZYzahX0vE5Q" hash="3BB2Lw">First, prayer. Let us pray constantly that we may not be deceived, and live close to the Lord, obeying his laws. Then we shall find the light and the truth we need for that particular set of problems with which we grapple individually.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p15" pid="AK-j2t-Nl0CF6BzPSPbjgg" hash="epi3mA">Second, scriptures. Study the scriptures, for what he has said to one he has said to all. Study the life of the Savior; he is the example for each one of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p16" pid="GebwwZsYzE6iCvrqE_oIrA" hash="BY_Fkg">Third, listen to the prophet who leads us today. One of the great messages of the Restoration is that the heavens are open and God leads us through his anointed prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p17" pid="qd95dCip50K6OWduI1eVqg" hash="8TqxdQ">On political matters President Kimball has encouraged us to study the issues and use our agency. He has counseled us to select leaders and programs consistent with the principles of truth. He has urged us to act independently.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p18" pid="x4zfxodXp0WDv_FGkfz6uQ" hash="aJOSlQ">On matters of morality he has given more specific counsel. On such issues as abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, homosexuality, and pornography—current issues sometimes categorized as women’s issues—he has given direct counsel. Mormon women know that they have the right to accept or reject the counsel; but in keeping with fundamental doctrine, they must also realize that to reject it is a heavy responsibility. It is the calling of a prophet to see to the very heart of a moral issue, to envision its future course, and to warn the people of its consequences. Sometimes those who do not agree with what he says may refuse to heed the warning. Only later, sadly, is the truth of his words made obvious to all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p19" pid="pdVtAvJWOEqFbt9wi1QANw" hash="U8SZGA">Sometimes the people do heed the prophet’s warning. When Jonah was sent to Nineveh to prophesy the destruction of that great, wicked city, “the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jonah/3.5" class="scriptureRef">Jonah 3:5</a>). They turned from their evil ways in repentance, and God spared their city.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p20" pid="4qMo53vQi0iRYG6OYdN01Q" hash="ODKnDg">In the production <span class="emphasis">Because of Elizabeth </span>presented in Nauvoo this summer at the dedication of the Monument to Women, Elizabeth concludes that she will not be able to solve all the problems she sees nor to meet every challenge. But she recognizes that what she does not get done, others will try to do. And as the play ends, one is struck with the great influence one woman has had in the lives of the thousands who are her direct descendants. And beyond those thousands are thousands more who have heard the gospel because of her missionary sons and grandsons and great-grandsons and great-granddaughters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p21" pid="C85qNQLTTEOpgcbGOtgDyQ" hash="hXHGVA">This is the great, traditional, ongoing, irreplaceable contribution women have made over the past decades. And we believe it is important to continue and value this work of women. Women should see the magnitude of that calling clearly. Beyond that central theme there are many other problems to solve, and women have a responsibility to be part of the solutions. We must use our talents in every way we can, because it will take the best that is in each of us to make headway in solving the problems of the world today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p22" pid="LrtVN8PVJUa1D3WwwfMGfg" hash="HBdUIw">And perhaps more important for us, it will take all our heart, might, mind, and strength to do the work the Lord has given us—that is to live so that we, and those we can influence, will gain exaltation in the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/womens-greatest-challenge.p23" pid="qmfXVmJFxk-Xefg3pAAkng" hash="5Hx4SQ">We are the people raised up to do this work; we, the women of the Church, hand-in-hand with the men—our husbands, our sons, our brothers in the priesthood.</p>

      <description>Robert Browning’s joyful line, “God’s in his heaven—all’s right with the world!” ( part 2, lines 227–28), is more easily expressed when our body is functioning at its optimum—a blessing we all earnestly desire.</description>

      <description>I am grateful to this choir that has stated so beautifully in music one of the most important questions a latter-day woman can ask: “Oh, God, who gave me a woman’s heart, a woman’s mind, a woman’s soul, what wouldst thou desire of me?”</description>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/women-for-the-latter-day.p2" pid="Kkas9-OxVk2jppISKHm8VA" hash="bBbckg">It is a simple question asked tonight with the pleading of four hundred voices, yet repeated silently by each of us who also in prayerful supplication say, “What wouldst thou have me do?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/women-for-the-latter-day.p3" pid="GssJNrXR4UKz0JnYtYlg_Q" hash="gevRyw">The scriptures reveal one woman’s response to the very same question. The woman: Queen Esther. Her questioning moment was a hard and very lonely one when her uncle, Mordecai, sent her word that she should go into the king and plead for him to spare her people from the planned destruction. Esther, though queen, had no right to go to the king unless he called for her. The king had absolute power. She had no right of appeal. But she really was the only one with possible entrance to the throne of his power. Her uncle reminded her, “Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/esth/4.14" class="scriptureRef">Esth. 4:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/women-for-the-latter-day.p4" pid="rCy-16FsCE-Na4pUTSW41g" hash="13b_Kw">Esther had the strength born of good teaching. It enabled her to determine to ask all of the Jews of the kingdom to fast and pray with her. It was then she made personal preparation by looking her most beautiful, as she went in to see the king.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/women-for-the-latter-day.p5" pid="-QK_Ul2GRUSqHxgcxt1BGA" hash="O25_EA">With every step she must have wondered, “Will he hold out the royal sceptre?” “Will he condemn me to death?” “Will he drop me into poverty and oblivion?” She stood before him, young, beautiful, calm—knowing that she was totally vulnerable. She also knew that she had appealed to God for help and that there was a great moral wrong about to be committed. She had to be responsible to God who made her, no matter what the mortal consequences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/women-for-the-latter-day.p6" pid="4cCzSnPhO0G115L-nL98Yw" hash="KxorBw">Each woman in today’s world has responsibilities akin to those which Esther faced. The circumstances of each life are significantly different, yet each woman faces the challenge of being true to the principles of the gospel if she would improve the quality of her mortal life and make herself worthy of the opportunity of eternal progression. She should begin by understanding who she is and that she has a magnificent potential as a daughter of God. Her goal then should be lofty. The scriptures say: “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:48</a>). Quickly I caution that this is not an obtainable goal in one step or one day or one year. It takes a lifetime of conscious effort, of striving and learning and living, to become an holy woman.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/women-for-the-latter-day.p7" pid="aYbMoKkPJU6NhWaFcGsjkg" hash="zBChwg">It was in 1874 that Eliza R. Snow said, “Paul the apostle anciently spoke of holy women. It is the duty of each one of us to be a holy woman. We shall have elevated aims, if we are holy women. We shall feel that we are called to perform important duties. No one is exempt from them. There is no sister so isolated, and her sphere so narrow but what she can do a great deal towards establishing the Kingdom of God upon the earth” (<span class="emphasis">Woman’s Exponent,</span> 15 Sept. 1873, p. 62).</p>

Set realistic, achievable goals so that you can feel the joy of a victory over yourself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/women-for-the-latter-day.p9" pid="yhpU5Lkb_02HjFhjBGu8ow" hash="1nxIXA">Such a victory is being won by my friend with a large family of twelve children who, although having days of discouragement, generally speaking is (1) out of bed early to exercise. She hates to exercise so she hurries to get it out of the way. (2) She reads the scriptures. She enjoys that so much she has to make herself stop at her determined one-half hour. (3) She prays, sharing her gratitude and her concerns, and in this way she feels the Lord’s guidance and direction even when things don’t work out the way she had planned. (4) She has a positive, happy attitude as she greets her children.</p>

She certainly hasn’t obtained perfection in her home, but she does realize that even though her children don’t practice the piano every day, if they continue to practice they will at least develop the recognition necessary to love music and enrich their lives through it. She knows the challenge of living within her husband’s paycheck, but she also knows the importance of loving him and their children and laughing with them. She may not know that C. S. Lewis has wisely said that homemaking “is surely in reality the most important work in the world. What do ships, railways, mines, cars, and governments, etc. exist for except that people may be fed, warmed, and safe in their own homes? … We wage war in order to have peace, we work in order to have leisure, we produce food in order to eat it. So your job is the one for which all others exist” (<span class="emphasis">Letters of C. S. Lewis, </span>Warren H. Lewis, ed., London: Geoffrey Bles Ltd., 1956, p. 62).</p>

They should be commended, because it is not an easy role but one that is vitally important. I hope their prayers are raised to the Lord for his affirmation of their decision to accept employment away from their small children only when necessary. When employment away from the home is secured for the right reasons, a woman should feel confident and serve happily.</p>

I heard the branch Relief Society president commend them for their commitment to the work of the Lord and to each other during the perilous times they faced each day. She said, “You never know when you step outside your door whether you will be attacked by terrorists, yet you do your visiting teaching and attend all of your church meetings. You are courageous women who do a mighty work quietly in such a time as this.”</p>

Charity, or the pure love of Christ, is not synonymous with good deeds or benevolence. But kind, thoughtful, loving acts are the way Jesus has directed us to express our love—both our love for him and our love for others. If we have the sustenance, he says we are to give to those in want. If we are thoughtful, warm, and caring to those who are sick, those who mourn, those who are fatherless, those we love, <span class="emphasis">and</span> those who despitefully use us, then we have charity, for we are moved to act with compassion.</p>

As we serve with the single desire to nurture all life, we come to know what charity means.</p>

She was just a young woman when her husband died and left her alone without child.

But more than what she gleaned from the fields were the experiences that came as she worked to thresh out the wheat from the chaff.

We too must glean from life’s circumstances and experiences that which will give us growth and faith and peace of mind.</p>

Colorful fresh vegetables are added to make a complete and satisfying meal. Occasionally she prepares chicken from which she makes delicious chicken dumplings, chicken salad, or chicken sandwiches. This homemaker uses necks, backs, and other less meaty parts that many discard to provide a base for the aromatic broth from which soups are made for the days ahead.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p6" pid="ZQZiw_InIUOfc2gzSe7xNw" hash="0AW4ow">She determined to make friends with her neighbors, the Indians. She admired their artful weaving and pottery work and asked them to teach her. As soon as they sensed her interest was genuine, they were most willing. She became fascinated with their culture, their history—everything about them. The desert changed from a desolate, forbidding place to a world of wondrous beauty.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p7" pid="UMPphhD5xk2Q5zoF48Kkdg" hash="CylTOQ">What had changed? Not the desert, not her environment; her own attitude transformed a miserable experience into a highly rewarding one. (From <span class="emphasis">Bits and Pieces,</span> Vol. C no. 5, pp. 21–23.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p8" pid="cz7u-U2_A0uLrZ7GsIKZaw" hash="KkzZFg">How might Relief Society enable a woman to look to the stars—stars to steer by? How might Relief Society enable a woman to create an environment of optimism and adventure, while at the same time helping her stretch her dollars and resources by implementing sound economic principles in the home?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p9" pid="qT9JQSBMC0u3rR4HFmf6Eg" hash="wZNT6w">Let me point out a few minicourses each Relief Society unit might hold to help women meet this challenge:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p10" pid="_hAocU9MwEiGuW0MMSLRkQ" hash="1V1Rsg">First, home and money management. Wise home and money management instruction should help each sister learn how to bring all expenditures within the family income. It has been thoughtfully said that we should set our scale of living one degree below our means. No longer can we ignore the imperative of this principle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p11" pid="t_mBEBiHCk6UmSu4zOcVlg" hash="dH7s8A">The first hard rule of fixing our scale of living below our means is to budget, planning first for basic needs and then for other desired items.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p12" pid="pIhhLjfurkGOt9TKbGts3A" hash="IUEH0Q">We should help all women enjoy the peace of mind that comes from making and following a plan for spending. Their lives will begin to have an aura of serenity when their expenses stay within their income.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p13" pid="PB1DLxqcD02aJ8V5z3vaDQ" hash="o1Hz8A">Women must learn to budget and to help their children learn to budget also. Women and children should know that, no matter how important or how worthwhile an item might seem to be, if they cannot afford it, it is an unwise expenditure. Such expenditures lead to debt; and unwise debt leads to economic insecurity, which most often causes stress in the family. You can make it easier for your children if you do as Elder Marvin J. Ashton suggests: “‘Save your money’ is a hollow pronouncement from a parent to a child. ‘Save your money for a mission, a bicycle, a doll house, a trousseau, or a car’ makes understandable sense.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> July 1975, p. 73.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p14" pid="KePbZrbwOES1tpR8w7xGLw" hash="KVbDsQ">Living on a budget is not a chore. It need not even be a deprivation. Budgeting should be a great learning experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p15" pid="LxImoL_GdkesRf_dPOy4Mg" hash="8uXIIg">A recently married daughter of a friend wrote her mother, describing how she and her husband were managing to save money on their meager income. She excitedly explained: “I’ve discovered that often prepared foods are too costly for our budget, so I make most things from ‘scratch.’ The other night at Relief Society I even learned how to make milk, buttermilk, condensed milk, cottage cheese, yogurt, and creamed cheese from the powdered milk we had stored. It’s fun to see how much I can save by doing things myself.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p16" pid="ueWV5JSA80udhbCCm7m1ig" hash="-xsUPw">We can teach women to be realistic in money management and still maintain a spirit of resourcefulness and optimism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p17" pid="1t2cIC_9v0S5uicAq8Kijw" hash="dwEDcQ">Next, a resource management minicourse might be planned. It could enable the sisters to share ways to save energy. For example, car pool or walk whenever possible, wear sweaters, turn down the thermostat a degree or two, open shades when the sun shines and close them at night, turn off the heat or air conditioner when not at home, turn off the lights, and run the dishwasher only with a full load.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p18" pid="EmTvb66aikqAd5jQanDaPQ" hash="eo2dVA">Resource management includes wise stewardship of possessions and an appreciation of the value that still remains in some used goods. One stake Relief Society president reported a homemaking meeting where their best seamstress was available to help each woman draft patterns for reusable fabric. This helped the sisters save many dollars and at the same time enjoy lovely additional clothing items.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p19" pid="CBKRhZjkUEmcEDgBupEtHw" hash="o85mjg">Other miniclasses on resource management might focus on ways to take better care of clothes—how best to repair, clean, and alter them for longer wear. A miniclass on laundering tips could also add to a woman’s understanding of how to add life to fabric. Classes could teach the art of clothing coordination, how to add variety and versatility to everyone’s wardrobe so there is less need to purchase complete outfits. In these and other ways Relief Society could teach women to care better for their belongings, thus extending life and serviceability while at the same time bringing satisfaction and pleasure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p20" pid="0EunlckzEkCVhS_iU2lM4g" hash="CEHHCw">If we “make do” creatively, we don’t have to do without. We can enrich the lives of our family members at very little cost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p21" pid="jGkQGVJ7IkSWBRF5Tx5bsQ" hash="45K6Ow">A third minicourse might be on healthful living. Plan ways to help the sisters save money by attaining the best health of which they are capable. Relief Society should provide training to promote physical well-being as the least expensive medical treatment. It doesn’t even cost you the price of aspirin. The illness you avoid costs nothing. Good health habits save money. To promote good health, women need to plan nutritious meals. Most of us could have smaller portions of food and still be healthy, but all of us should eat regular, well-balanced meals each day. Relief Society instruction should be designed to help sisters understand and practice the fundamentals of good nutrition. We should learn to prepare economical food that will be both nourishing and appealing. And in keeping with the all-Church effort to reduce cost, we would like to suggest that, although the homemaking meeting continue to be held monthly, the homemaking luncheon be served only six times per year, unless the circumstances of the sisters indicate a special need. We ask each Relief Society president to realize that this is not a time for cookies and punch, but for a social experience that will promote provident living, and that the emphasis be on an economical, nourishing food graciously served that can be easily duplicated in the homes of the sisters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p22" pid="Y1x5k9QjVEOMIpGyjjLULQ" hash="oVDStg">One basic concept of the welfare system of the Church is to prepare for a time of emergency by careful planning. Relief Society has the capability of helping sisters further this effort by making their homes models of provident living that can meet present need and possible emergencies.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p23" pid="1IJ0BgEkaUyQ_kxAwdWiRA" hash="FJx-Pw">I have thought about the emergency preparation necessary when Noah’s ark was made ready. Noah must have achieved the most effective welfare planning in the history of mankind when he very carefully followed the Lord’s counsel and built the ark. His wife and their sons undoubtedly worked and planned with him so that the blessings of the Lord might be theirs. Just think of preparing a year’s supply for those multitudes of animals which were brought into the ark. Noah and his family must have been able to plan and provide in such a way that they could find pleasure in their efforts (selecting just the right two of each animal), adventure in their voyage (surely there were new little furry creatures almost weekly), and joy as the splendor of the very first rainbow filled the sky, and the Lord’s promise was fulfilled.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p24" pid="q9bKpFiG_kKyiJ2HOZHjNw" hash="Mf-N8Q">Could we be as diligent today? Can we as women be accountable and help meet the great challenge of economic stress by our wise stewardship over that with which the Lord has blessed us?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/reach-for-the-stars.p25" pid="OUr4h9BjsEW-UQ44L9FT_g" hash="1bYYwQ">May we look for the stars and find satisfaction, even joy, in living according to the directions of these prophets and Apostles, whom the Lord has chosen to lead us in our day, is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

As we approached our darkened house, a young neighbor boy observed us returning home in the darkness and ran over to offer his lantern. “We have another one at our house,” he said. “You can keep this one as long as you need it.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/relief-society-in-times-of-transition.p2" pid="uheZVwKE1Eu7RV7na_u3RQ" hash="DHQS1w">I was impressed by the concern of that little boy.

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/relief-society-in-times-of-transition.p3" pid="fFhXQwCMzku6mNiv4tyCeA" hash="lFejqA">I thought a great deal about that little boy in the days which followed. He was so helpful, so happy, and so willing to share his light.</p>

He and his family had a light on hand to help them pierce the darkness when their primary source of light was temporarily withdrawn.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/relief-society-in-times-of-transition.p9" pid="LwRCCsJ_vkGFwB3qtFDmSw" hash="_AUyAw">We should have the wisdom to personally prepare by understanding truth and living it with integrity so that we might be worthy disciples of Christ. Then, with him as the center of our lives, we can develop those Christlike qualities which will make us worthy of exaltation. We will gain added strength and a greater capacity for love. We will improve the skills of giving our love in such a way that we are prepared in the time of need.</p>

She told us that she is losing her eyesight. She expressed gratitude for those who had been reading to her, driving her to appointments, and for another sister who was teaching her to play the piano. Relief Society sisters through their acts of kindness had offered her their light and helped to lessen the fear of this very difficult time of her transition into a world of darkness.</p>

They will be different for each of us. Serious illness or permanent malady is but one. Others may be the death of a loved one, a child or a husband; the realization that one may never marry in this life; divorce; returning home from a mission; a marriage without children; marriage of the last child; civilian life after living under military discipline; the change from Young Women to Relief Society; the change from high school to college; a move to a new location; and on and on.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/relief-society-in-times-of-transition.p17" pid="__BSxkieoUKLBrNQDFXUAg" hash="n0OZsg">Each of these circumstances necessitates a particular mode of adaptation and requires the development of new and different ways to adjust to an altered life-style that may be challenging or painful. It is the very nature of such turning points that makes old patterns of behavior no longer adequate or appropriate.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/relief-society-in-times-of-transition.p18" pid="QwHJhppaOUq9URda3DB9JQ" hash="21IPIQ">We should constantly prepare ourselves to meet new challenges and to helpfully, willingly, and happily reach out to others in their time of need. The Relief Society should be a light for sisters in times of transition. Officers and teachers and members should systematically concern themselves with the stresses and the distresses of transition which our sisters face.</p>

She wisely made herself do it because she said it may prove helpful to someone else. She also had enough faith to know that she could do for someone else when she was self-sufficient again.</p>

				<p pid="E4qumQEjaUS2bN6mRPLXQA" hash="tsYIcg">Can we really appreciate what another suffers? Probably not, but we have learned some important things about hard transitions that may help us to better understand ourselves or someone else in those difficult periods of change:</p>

						<span class="label">1.</span>
						<p pid="4qC0hipX4Ees7PROFoww7A" hash="IKWE0A">A transition may prove an opportunity for spiritual, physical, intellectual and psychological development—or it can become a time of serious deterioration. The way is new and often difficult. It takes a great deal of courage and sometimes support from others to make a transition a time of growth.</p>

						<span class="label">2.</span>
						<p pid="w6HfmNhyn0S5joQMHaJn2w" hash="bqN4jw">In a time of transition, it is less the traumas of childhood that shape our ability to adjust to the change. It is more often the quality of sustained relationships with other people that makes the difference. Positive, supportive, ongoing relationships are a valuable resource in times of major change in one’s life.</p>

						<span class="label">3.</span>
						<p pid="aL3gLaQjYUiz0uG5O5sCeQ" hash="UsrFJA">It is not the transition itself that is of primary importance in seeking adjustment, but rather how the transition fits an individual’s circumstance at the time it occurs. Each person’s adjustment will be different because people are different, even though the crisis may seem to be the same.</p>

We must have a program, and we do. Relief Society is designed for this very purpose. During one of the first meetings of the Nauvoo Relief Society, Lucy Mack Smith stated: “This institution is a good one. … We must cherish one another, watch over one another, comfort one another, and gain instruction.” (Minutes of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo, March 17, 1842, in <span class="emphasis">History of Relief Society 1842–1966,</span> pub. by The General Board of Relief Society, 1966, p. 20.)</p>

She had already sent the cards, but she did not write the personal note. After debating with herself for some time she finally determined to send another card, this one with a personal note.</p>

When she entered the room, she could see that all evidences of Christmas had been put away—except for one card standing alone on a small table. It was the card with the note in it. The sister explained that she had left the card out to show her nonmember friends that members of her church go the second mile. She said that she had told them this before, but now she had some tangible evidence they could see.</p>

She can learn how to care, perhaps while she is helping another make that difficult transition from inactivity to full participation. Every position in Relief Society should help a sister not only to serve, but to grow—to progress toward the goals that she has set for her life, to strengthen herself, her family, and her social relationships as she develops the attributes of godliness. Every lesson attended in Relief Society should help her understand a principle of the gospel—what it is, how it can find expression in her life, and how she is better able to serve others because of it.</p>

As you in leadership positions serve these young Relief Society sisters, do not underestimate their capacity, their ability, their desire, and their willingness to share in the involvement of Relief Society responsibilities. Their physical maturity is often surpassed by their spiritual readiness and the vitality and freshness of their intellectual perceptions. Include them. Teach them. Learn from them.</p>

We should be happy and willing to assist our older sisters. Their loneliness can be as debilitating as disease, and their isolation a prison from which there seems to be no escape. For many, their constant companion is a feeling of worthlessness or inconvenience. We have the responsibility to include them, and the greater opportunity to learn from them.</p>

It reads: <span class="emphasis">“The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her.”</span> [<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/31.11" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 31:11</a>] This memorable line discloses, first, that the husband has entrusted his heart to his wife, and second, that she safeguards it. They seem to understand an important truth, that every man and woman who covenant to establish a family must create a safe place for their love.</p>

We hear it in the words of a poem by William Butler Yeats: the man has just laid the wishes of his heart at the feet of his beloved, and then he pleads, “Tread softly, because you tread on my dreams.” (“He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,” <span class="emphasis">The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations,</span> 3d ed., New York: Oxford University Press, p. 585.)</p>

To provide a safe place for love, there must be this kind of commitment. Notice in the line from Proverbs the man has given his heart—not conditionally, not a half of it or any part—but all.</p>

When a man and woman make marriage covenants in the holy temple, they begin a new, eternal family unit with all of the blessings promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Such a union is dedicated to the sacred purposes of the Lord—“to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>.)</p>

The husband whose future plans are centered in his own success has a flawed vision of the responsibilities he must assume in a celestial family.</p>

          <p pid="zGJarOZuu06Z_UOAh0J_mA" hash="f7s8Rw">Both husband and wife are committed to helping the other achieve the fullest possible development. How inspiring it is, for example, to hear Elder David B. Haight tell of times he has cooked the dinner so that his wife could attend her Spanish class. Growth can come for both partners when husband and wife develop the kind of love that allows the other to turn potential into perfection and talent into testimony. A strong marriage takes strong individuals equally committed to calling forth the best in themselves as well as in their eternal partner. A husband must give his support if a wife is to adequately use the gifts God has given her. A wife must give her support if her husband is to lead the family.</p>
        </li>

          <span class="label">2.</span>
          <p pid="HBlCgTHv5kK6FCQEI5hNlA" hash="KID7IA">A marriage made safe by both love and consecration can allow for a variety of opinions.</p>
          <p pid="a-iowN1uWU2FP7cS0sUMQA" hash="qag1jA">For a man and wife to become one there are many differences, large and small, that must be accommodated or resolved. In a marriage relationship that is secure, differences need not lead to discord. They can be openly considered until a satisfactory solution is reached because the premises are agreed upon: both the husband and wife are committed to love one another, to build the kingdom of God, and to establish an eternal family unit. All considerations are made in light of these three basic commitments—these are the “givens.” When they are held inviolate, the marriage remains intact, even though the process of resolution may involve considerable discussion.</p>
          <p pid="-KyKU4c93ESThGy8PyYERw" hash="O87zbw">While visiting in the home of her younger sister, a woman observed one such discussion. A difference of opinion was resolved in a kindly, open exchange between the husband and wife. The woman later confided that such a discussion could not have occurred in her home “because,” she said, “we cannot afford to have differences aired, for even a small problem challenges our relationship.”</p>
          <p pid="K2a6uBRDPE2BY2-eZ1QCSA" hash="_FXDcQ">Some marriage relationships are little more than an amicable truce; but if such couples were to lay the foundation stones of commitment and trust, of consecration and love, they could build a safe place where individuals can be heard, and where love can grow and can encompass and integrate differing points of view.</p>

          <p pid="kgdzcIZbmUSeeQNaajMb3A" hash="702zFA">When children are treated fairly, there is no cause for jealousy because there is no partiality. Reading the Book of Mormon, we find that whenever the people were truly committed to the Lord and had the Holy Ghost in their midst, the conditions described were similar. We read of such an example in 4 Nephi when “every man did deal justly one with another.</p>
          <p pid="NOCZKCp-80WNZulmkF2qLA" hash="8QVtKg">“And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, … but they were all … partakers of the heavenly gift” of love. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.2-3" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:2–3</a>.)</p>

It is easy for a family to grow accustomed to the pleasant circumstances of a home and fail to remember the management necessary or the energy and skills required to keep a house running smoothly.</p>

Perhaps in addition to a recognition of what she does accomplish, an assessment of what might be required to achieve the desired results would bring about a realization that other members of the family must help—either with specific duties or with a change in their living habits to make the housework easier.</p>

But the achievement and maintenance of order, while the primary responsibility of the mother, should be the concern of the whole family. When a mother is required to work outside the home, the cooperation of the family, of the whole household, is often critical.</p>

Because he is gone from the home and the family does not see him at his work, they may not acknowledge the full significance of his contribution. A family home evening could be devoted to learning about a father’s employment, giving him opportunity to explain all that he does. It may provide not only knowledge but also a clearer understanding of his efforts. The wages earned by a man are necessary, but his family’s pride in his work is often more valued by him.</p>

The home is a safe place for children to learn how to work because mistakes can be corrected before they become serious, and they can be forgiven. It is the fortunate child whose parent teaches him the value of doing a job well.</p>

Under the direction of loving parents, an apprenticeship can be served by them in learning responsibility for tools and equipment, following instructions, and working thoughtfully and cheerfully, and keeping at the assignment until it is successfully completed. These fulfill the prerequisites for most vocational training programs.</p>

As my friend went to see if she might be of assistance, there was another woman there already. Her manner of helping was quiet and quick, knowing just what to do, and it reminded my friend so much of her neighbor that she finally asked if, by chance, she knew her neighbor, only to find that they were sisters. In that family they had learned the meaning of service. By its selfless nature, service within a family increases spirituality and strengthens bonds of love.</p>

Responsibility brings system to the workings of a family and order to a marriage. Defining responsibilities and planning a method of reporting back fosters freedom from family discord and is also a meaningful stage in developing personal discipline.</p>

Family home evening discussions of projects planned and accomplished can give each family member a feeling of belonging and being needed. There is no better way to prepare family members for service in the Church, or in the world of work, and, most importantly, in their relationships with our Father in Heaven than to be accountable in meaningful responsibilities.</p>

Through them, the home becomes a stronghold, a protection against society’s offenses, a haven in time of storm. A family begins with individuals—with two people who become one, and as children are added, in the spiritual arithmetic of family unity, they will still be one. Parents can provide a protecting shelter, a safe place, and children are made strong by the bonds of their love.</p>

We have the foundation of the gospel principles, and I am going to do all I can to make this the happiest time of our lives together.”</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/hearts-so-similar.p3" pid="JASrtnFpJkyrcuAvjPspEw" hash="jPK2hQ">After the children left, the sun broke through the clouds overhead, illuminating not only the afternoon sky, but casting a reflective glow on the events of the day. That evening Heidi recorded in her journal, “I was overwhelmed by the exceptional beauty I could see from that little adobe house on the hill. … I could hardly contain the light that streamed through the wavy glass window into my soul bringing feelings that were both very warm and very bright!”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/hearts-so-similar.p4" pid="Hd1Eo0p6RkCBinN39zaMkA" hash="T4mp_g">She told about the contrast she felt between the small home in which she stood with its meager appointments and her own lovely house on another hill not far away. She wrote, “I hope my home is my family’s place of strength, of faith, and of refuge, a place where truth is confirmed and testimony is strengthened, as Mary’s little home had been for her family so long ago.” She continued, “Despite life-styles so different, I was overcome by hearts so similar. My soul pleads to make the similarities count for my family, as they had for hers.”</p>

To stay in Nauvoo would put her in the position of constant conflict with the dissidents and the mobs. To go would mean leaving her home unsold and, alone, shouldering the hardships and the unknown challenges of a long and wearisome trek by ox team.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/hearts-so-similar.p7" pid="RUjmlIGPyUSe7Fute9iFmA" hash="DGdm-g">To stay would mean giving up association with the Saints and the gospel she loved.

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/hearts-so-similar.p8" pid="iyALLOQdLEGmbZF203wYvA" hash="dq0lsg">The bonds of the gospel that led Mary Fielding Smith to face immense hardships and travel west with the Saints transcend time and trial, uniting sisters now as then in a oneness of faith.</p>

I am nothing.” But the missionaries persisted. She accepted the gospel, and it brought hope and love to her life; it brought learning and growth and progress. In time she became a Relief Society president, and through her devoted concern she could give that same hope and love to others.</p>

Snow observed so many years ago. (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 139.) The gospel, correctly understood, embraces all that is virtuous, lovely, of good report and praiseworthy. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:13</a>.) The gospel is heaven-sent. It is the light by which we find our way through darkness and difficult times. The light of truth discloses our eternal nature. If we work hard enough and long enough, and pray diligently enough, the excellence that is our divine potential is possible to each one of us.</p>

One beautiful Oriental sister came to the United States and for the first time in her life she encountered blonde-haired, blue-eyed persons. The blue eyes seemed so unusual to her, she later confided, that although she now thinks them lovely, she had at first wondered if people could actually see out of them.</p>

Diversities abound and through them come much of the fulness and beauty we experience in life. To the sister from the Orient it was the color of eyes that seemed strange at first, but for all of us there are differences we can come to appreciate more fully. Learning to value variety in others, we can also see and appreciate our own uniqueness more clearly.</p>

The gospel brings this kind of confidence within the reach of each one. When we are filled with love for the Lord, with all our hearts, souls, and minds, the result is that we <span class="emphasis">can</span> feel and understand and be secure in his love. We <span class="emphasis">will</span> keep his commandments. We <span class="emphasis">do</span> love our neighbor as ourselves. This is the way he planned it to be for us, coming together in love and faith, with hearts so similar.</p>

There are times, however, under unusual circumstances, when, in order to help provide for even the basic needs of her family, a mother may be required to accept employment outside her home. As President Ezra Taft Benson has stated, “Many of you often find yourselves in circumstances that are not always ideal … who, because of necessity, must work and leave your children with others.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Nov. 1981, p. 105.)</p>

We urge also that Relief Society leaders make certain that they include those mothers in Relief Society callings and that lessons and programs address their needs. We hope that husbands, home teachers, and visiting teachers will give them encouragement and positive reinforcement in the demanding role that is theirs, for we know that in spite of their added working role they still must provide the emotional support that children need. In addition to the obvious physical needs of children, there are other aspects of a child’s life that should not be neglected even though a mother has employment outside the home.</p>

First, she must find someone to give good care to her child. Next, she has to decide what to do in an emergency situation when there is an accident or sickness. She must rely on the help of an understanding employer, a relative, a neighbor, a schoolteacher, or someone else to help in those times of crisis.</p>

They realize the importance of having meals that provide essential nutrients and the warmth of gracious family dining—even though fast-food establishments appeal to and even cater to the working-outside-the-home mother as an easier alternative.</p>

These challenges come in being able to sense the unexpressed needs of children and those of which young people, in their immaturity, may not themselves be aware. A mother may not always be on hand when her child’s needs seem most acute. But we find that many working mothers take every opportunity to be with their children—to work with them in accomplishing household duties; when it is appropriate, to shop, plan, and play together; and sometimes just to be in the same room so that they have the sense of being with someone who loves them.</p>

But many are aware of the danger this poses in giving them a distorted picture of life by using all their time together in recreation. It is important for children to see the balance that is necessary between work and play. They need to know that special events are more meaningful when daily routines are established and when assigned duties are completed.</p>

A mother who strives to know success can help her children learn the <span class="emphasis">price</span> of success by working with them, when necessary, to help them reach a degree of excellence. A mother can make the difference in a child’s achievement. She can give support by monitoring the completion and accuracy of assignments.

And finally she was able to teach them to look above the clouds that bring shadows of darkness into this life, to see the glory of God. Knowing how to find their Heavenly Father through the darkness and living by the light of his glory, her children could walk alone.

Her husband spent three days of each week traveling out of town because of his work. This left her home alone to manage their house and two small children. She was just nineteen when they were married. She had almost no experience in caring for young children, and certainly felt no confidence in handling her own. She often found their demands and the pressing household duties overwhelming. In her frustration, she grew increasingly harsh with them until her abusive behavior became frightening, even to herself. Feeling alone, ashamed, and inadequate, she was often in the depths of despair. What light did the gospel offer to her?</p>

But what difference did that make when the children were crying, the laundry piled higher and higher, the letter from her mother remained unanswered, and the dress she was to make this week for her husband’s company party lay unfinished on the sewing machine? All these frustrations spoke so loudly the discouragement of the present. They made the blessings of the gospel seem very far away.</p>

Her visiting teachers, responding to her anxiety over her children, brought a special toy for each child. They had carefully selected playthings that an adult could use with a child in a delightful but problem-solving way. They took time to show the mother how to relate to her children through activity. She was surprised to find how happy and responsive the children were. They began to look forward to a playtime association with their mother. She realized that she was providing for their needs through play, and that they were becoming more relaxed with her.</p>

This, in turn, helped her have more time to organize her other responsibilities. She learned to be considerate of her children and sensitive to their concerns. She has continued giving the children this special attention each day. Love in this home is now more than a concept; it is the way they respond to each other’s needs.</p>

We have to live by every word. We speak often in our worldwide Church about translation. Computers are being employed to assist, and hundreds of language specialists are engaged in this important work. But the translation for which we each bear personal responsibility is converting the words of the gospel into actions, attitudes, and habits.</p>

When these words are translated into a determined effort to change a behavior that brings hurt or embarrassment or sorrow to one who loves you, it becomes a key to solving a family problem. These few lines, written by a wife to her husband, underscore the need to make a principle more than a word:</p>

Some problems develop silently, almost imperceptibly, as we are involved in taxing schedules and multiple demands. Consider the couple who had spent all their married years in devotion to Church and children. The children were now grown and had left home; church callings were less demanding; and unexpectedly, they who had spent years helping others resolve difficulties, faced problems of their own. Preoccupied with serving their children, they had forgotten to serve each other. Quick to lavish affection on those about them, they had neglected sharing simple expressions of love and concern with one another. Now, in the time when they might enjoy the richness of their experiences together, they found their relationship strained. Each felt a sense of falling short which easily led to criticism and complaint. Their years of church activity, however, had taught them a better way. They had experienced the light of the gospel and longed for it now.</p>

They realized that expressing their affection in those mellowing years together brought a sweetness and satisfaction that was especially rewarding. They selected some projects on which they worked together around their home; they found meaningful church activity, prepared family records and histories, and learned how to preserve other valuable documents. Already, in the gospel, they had the principles they needed, and found them more than adequate as they brought them to bear on their own problems.</p>

Chesterton in an essay entitled “A Piece of Chalk” wrote of going into the countryside in the south of England to draw with his colored chalks—only to find, ruefully, that he was missing the color white. Being too far from a store to remedy the situation, he felt his expedition ruined until he suddenly realized that the rock upon which he sat was, in fact, white chalk. (In Robert K. Thomas, ed., <span class="emphasis">The Joy of Reading,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1978, pp. 35–40).</p>

Many times the solutions to our problems await only our discovery that we already have the key to the answer. The need is for us to learn to use it effectively.</p>

One example was the woman who had little money to spend but wanted to share a Christmas treat with her neighbors. She didn’t feel that she could buy even inexpensive containers, but she was quite self-reliant. With what she had on hand, she made charming remembrances using brown lunch-size paper bags decorated with a white paper roof, a door and windows, and the words “Merry Christmas, Neighbor!” These brown-bag houses, filled with her home-dried apple slices, were welcome gifts.</p>

In each case, work, service, love, and self-reliance were the keys that opened the way for solving problems and fulfilling needs.</p>

They cause fear and guilt and heartache. Often, the difference in people’s finding their way or discovering solutions is the kindly, understanding friendship we can provide for them in our priesthood and Relief Society meetings or other Church settings. Many times it is the sympathetic arm around the shoulder and the encouraging smile that give to the distressed hope and to the downtrodden courage to try again. We can help them know that others wrestle with problems, too; but strength of family and of character, developed through living gospel principles, has enabled them to rise above life’s difficulties.</p>

It was a traumatic time with a difficult divorce, but the courageous mother was full of faith and determined that she would do everything she could to succeed as a single parent.</p>

Difficulties that could lead to dependency can be resolved and bring, instead, strength and happiness.</p>

There were back payments due on the house, current bills of every sort, and no income. They <span class="emphasis">could</span> turn to others for help; but if they were willing to work together as a family, she thought they could keep their house and make it, once more, a happy home. They were willing. Every child who was old enough found a way to help earn some money. They cut lawns, delivered papers, tended babies, collected aluminum cans, did housework. One of the older children took the responsibility for the gas bill, another for the lights; the mother put her earnings toward the house payments. They limited other spending to bare necessities.</p>

They were able to meet their other obligations and actually invest in some small, inexpensive properties they could fix up to generate income. This enabled the mother to be at home. With these ends achieved, the children no longer needed to contribute all their earnings to the family’s physical requirements. With freedom from financial threat, the mother now suggested to her children that if they wanted to continue to work they could attend college, go on missions, and even travel and see the world together. The children did continue to earn and save their money. They learned the value of work and of family, and they have accompanied their mother to places others only dream of.</p>

They are quick to testify that the greatest reward they have received from the experiences of the past few years has been their spiritual growth. Putting such principles as <span class="emphasis">love, work, service, self-reliance,</span> and <span class="emphasis">consecration</span> into practice has brought to this family the dignity of accomplishment, a unity of purpose, and a closeness to one another and to the Lord that is immediately apparent when one is in their company.</p>

There are, however, desirable strengths we develop by striving against difficulties. It is often when struggling to the very extremity of our power that we come to know that our Father in Heaven is close.</p>

We are not told of the trials she may have experienced; but going on foot, living in tents, and cooking over an open fire could have been devastating after their comfortable life in Jerusalem. We do read of her anguished waiting when she feared her beloved sons had perished in their return to obtain the plates. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.2" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 5:2</a>.) But in spite of troubles, she did love and serve her family. With the return of her sons, she knew of a certainty that the Lord had commanded her husband to flee into the wilderness, and in their safe return she found the assurance that the Lord was with them. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5.8" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 5:8</a>.) Their circumstances did not change; they still slept in tents. But she had joy and comfort in the knowledge that the Lord was guiding them. In that light she could carry on and meet further difficulties as they came.</p>

But learning is just the beginning. The fulness of blessings comes as we adopt the principles and live our lives by them. When we make them our way, when we live the principles, we are promised that they will be a light unto us. As we come to know that light, it will lead us through the midst of darkness, and as we begin to bring that light into our homes, it can become a beacon to our children, and to their children, and to theirs.</p>

Although our ages, and stages in life, and circumstances create different challenges, the scriptural words of the beautiful hymn the choir has just sung should be the statement for all of us—young and older—“The Lord is the strength of my life.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/27.1" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 27:1</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/a-season-for-strength.p2" pid="KqltMan0CUSIJ38Tk5d9Pw" hash="wdhETQ">I hope that through this message we will have manifested and affirmed in our hearts the reality that the principles of the gospel are timeless and timely and that eternal truths supply precise answers for our present need. Such needs are notable in their diversity and demanding in their urgency, but in groping for answers we sometimes overlook the evident. For good solutions often lie not so much in the undiscovered as in the unused.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/a-season-for-strength.p3" pid="YBbcP5HyBEqNncSqJ5cDVQ" hash="B5U2vA">When the Lord restored the gospel to the earth in its fulness and purity, he also organized the Church as a means to turn precepts into living principles, to help believers become Saints. And become Saints they did when, as converts, they were drawn by their compelling faith to put precept to the test; and in the strength of the Lord they saw goals achieved, hopes realized, and their own strength grow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/a-season-for-strength.p4" pid="kaQVwxaygUKERNntY-WIxw" hash="2O9jgA">In a gripping account of the Martin Handcart Company, caught by early winter snows in the trek from Iowa City to the Salt Lake Valley, we read of Margaret Dalglish, “a stout Scottish girl worn down to skin and bones, but still keeping up.” After wading through rivers of slush ice and suffering blizzards, hunger, and loss of loved ones, she was among those who were still “hauling their battered carts, still walking defiantly on their own legs” as they entered the valley at last.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/a-season-for-strength.p6" pid="CTr2p06ItEeAnJ8OdkmS0Q" hash="IYoumw">We are in a time when the swift changes of our social structure are thrusting enormous challenges upon us. We must remember that the work of women is important and still must be done. The spirit children of God must have the experience of mortality, and that means babies must be wanted, nurtured, loved, and cared for. The Lord has given women a primary responsibility in the establishment of good homes and well-cared-for families. No matter what the challenges are, we must find ways to accomplish this life-giving and eternal work. “Good family life is never an accident; it is always an achievement.” It was so for the women of the past, and it is so for us today. Our lives require discipline, coping without compromise, conversion of precepts into living principles that will make us saintly. We can see examples about us today.</p>

As the president left that home, she promised the sister that if she would attend her Relief Society meetings she would be included. The president and her entire board learned to sign. Gratitude, satisfaction, and personal enrichment came as the sisters employed this new skill to respond to the need of that one individual.</p>

Upon taking stock of her circumstances, personal resources, and talents, the courageous wife worked out a plan whereby she could complete her education and provide financial sustenance for the family during the hours the children were in school. Through the application of thrift, discipline, and reliance on the Lord, the needs of the family were met. Kind, loving care was given to the sister’s aged parents as well.</p>

That strength comes when we prepare for his blessings, recognize them, and use his gifts to make his ways our ways.</p>

Snow celebrates in words the continuity of family relationships beyond death and reminds us of a glorious reunion with our heavenly parents. Written as solace to a dear friend, Zina Huntington, who had lost her mother and father in tragic deaths, the well-known lines of this hymn give poetic statement to a great truth revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>

These are available to every woman and can give us the power to triumph over the most difficult circumstances and move forward in strength.</p>

The answer he received provides a sure foundation of fundamental truths upon which we should structure our lives. He also demonstrated that through personal prayer eternal truths answer individual needs. Heavenly power can help us understand and relate the timeless to our immediate concerns.</p>

And he counsels, “Behold, I come quickly.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/3.11" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 3:11</a>.) We must live with constant anticipation of his coming. Being ready to receive him is the position of our greatest strength. Let this be our bulwark against temptation or slothfulness. Let it cause us to read the Savior’s words, to search our hearts, and to try to live every principle of righteousness he taught. This will require us to love as he loves.

In his mind he rationalized, “It’s just another birthday like all the others.” But as he stood to acknowledge the occasion, his words revealed a love of life, a love of his work and of his fellowmen.
