      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p1" pid="tlqxwvZIUUKnLr2fRKf3ig" hash="7fNJPQ">I would like to tell you about a little bird that was lying on the parking lot pavement. During the night it had been blown from its nest by the high winds in the storm. Apparently hatched just a few days earlier, it had few feathers, but enough to identify it as just a common sparrow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p2" pid="mZAKM5x7pkuj2O-Pp_EcPQ" hash="RFN8ig">As it lay there awaiting whatever fate would come, a young woman walking to her car in the parking lot saw the little sparrow and picked it up. Feeling sympathy for the helpless little bird she took it home to care for it. She prepared a nest in a basket with soft tissues, which were changed often to keep a clean and comfortable bed for the little bird.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p3" pid="sfW5sUJYkUKGO6D3bd5_Kg" hash="9nY_Pw">She fed it often each day, watching it gain strength, and within a few days it opened its eyes and could see for the first time. It saw the girl who fed it and the family who lived in the home. It heard and became accustomed to the sounds around it, and it was not afraid.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p4" pid="1q6hj0RTDU2m0jjpviFyRw" hash="l_P36Q">As the days passed, it was able to hop about, and it was taken from the basket and put into a clean birdcage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p5" pid="DptH3qGlIkqETDfH_UAIpg" hash="HUyn1A">It trusted the girl and the family, and when it wanted food, it would chirp and flutter its growing wings rapidly, and when the cage door was opened it would hop out onto the girl’s hand and sit there patiently while she fed it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p6" pid="hUEJCUs-J02rsHKbArFZww" hash="Thi7aw">It would sit on her hand as she walked through the house and even when she went outside. To help it become accustomed to the outside world where it soon would have to live, she would take it out on the lawn where she and her sister would sit under the tree and visit while the bird would look and observe all around it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p7" pid="UEQn8RzvSE-ugH5OMQv6Pg" hash="LvY7cQ">It came time for the girl and her sister to go to girls’ camp, so the bird went with them and spent the week on Cedar Mountain with the girls. It was there that it tried to fly for the first time, flying from the girl’s hand to the low branches in a nearby tree.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p8" pid="5MmPpJuqgkatGhWi7k3OxQ" hash="whIJDw">It was glad to come back to the familiar hand and security of the girl’s love, and although it was learning to fly it did not leave. When the girls’ camp was over the bird came home with the girls and continued its flying lessons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p9" pid="y9GUrRLr2kGCFdukUBRcOA" hash="OHyhIw">The girl, realizing the bird must soon join its own kind, took it out on the front lawn and encouraged it to fly away. It flew across the lawn to a small pine tree, where it perched and looked around. The girl left it there, assuming it would now join the other birds, and she returned into the home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p10" pid="TBlIpXK9VU-cubyeQ6dMHQ" hash="D5w-tQ">It wasn’t long before a chirping could be heard outside in front of the home, and when the girl went out to see what the bird was chirping about, it flew out of the tree and landed back on her hand, and she fed it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p11" pid="UcEfayN-2UGx_HqWsrNE_Q" hash="E6FvhQ">For the first few nights the bird would come back to the house and want to come in with the family for the night. Soon, however, it began to stay out with newly found friends living in the trees close by the home. When the girl would go outside and whistle, it would respond and return and land on her hand, and my daughter, Trinilee, would feed it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p12" pid="Y8kxDAkchE2LuG9fbSxABw" hash="-IHEIA">That little bird and my daughter taught me a great lesson in faith and trust. Although it was just a fraction of the size of its human friend and could be in great danger for its life amongst humans, it trusted her and had faith it would not be harmed and would be fed by her—and it responded to her beckoning call.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p13" pid="DT_Mwf5ZUku2Akx-kTPOPQ" hash="GehDWw">Have you ever wondered about our faith, brethren? Do we have that kind of trust and faith in the Lord? Do we respond to His beckoning call to serve and be fed at His hand?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p14" pid="x_S4IJuPR0q9XVm3eltOJA" hash="fBC7wg">We should strive to be in His presence and to respond to His call, yet many of us lack the faith and the trust to come unto the Lord when He calls. He is calling us today to be faithful and to trust Him, that He might feed us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p15" pid="UywzkxzERkm5oKRgo0uGlQ" hash="rvhuvA">“And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.33" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:33</a>).</p>

There are many wonderful young men and women, senior sisters, and couples who have been called to serve and who have responded and are faithfully serving a mission for the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/the-faith-of-a-sparrow-faith-and-trust-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p18" pid="euBPJNosf0GlLCOs5ZMSdw" hash="3ruNZg">There is a great need for many more missionaries, including couples, as President Hinckley in his February 21, 1998, satellite broadcast said: “With concerted effort, with recognition of the duty that falls upon each of us as members of the Church, and with sincere prayer to the Lord for help, we could double the number” of convert baptisms.</p>

Amen” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/15.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 15:6</a>).</p>

As a young nine-year-old boy, I asked my mother if I could take my Christmas gift, a new bow and arrow set, and go up on the hill behind our home to hunt for rabbits. It was late in the afternoon, and Mother was reluctant, but with my coaxing she agreed to let me go, but only if I was back home before dark.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p2" uuid="91c6a33e-ca83-48cf-8347-d8defb94e277" pid="HsIoyxHIzEyrVxwiYQgfgg" hash="U1ICXA">As I reached the top of the hill, I put an arrow on the bow and started walking quietly through the sage and chaparral bushes, hoping to see a rabbit feeding at the base of the brush where the tender grass was still green.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p3" uuid="83cafd3a-9a68-441e-b550-a9b5881e9d78" pid="KWA3oteN0UueCh7PMwLc0w" hash="3fLQjg">I was startled by a large jackrabbit that jumped out from a sage bush right in front of me. I pulled back on the bow, taking a quick aim, and let the arrow fly at the fleeing, darting rabbit. The arrow missed, and the rabbit disappeared through the brush ahead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p4" uuid="39f42c85-c872-46ca-a57d-dca2ff4619dc" pid="iFCIQ0KwXUeW2SETrmXomg" hash="eH0Mug">I went to where I thought the arrow had hit the ground to retrieve it. Only three arrows came with the bow, and I didn’t want to lose this one. I looked where the arrow was supposed to be, but it wasn’t there. I looked all around the area where I was sure it landed, but I couldn’t find it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p5" uuid="250cc995-df42-45a4-9b09-c083d629f62d" pid="IszQqW0gx0CLhrX5LpLMPg" hash="col5vA">The sun was setting in the west; I knew that it would be dark in about 30 minutes, and I didn’t want to be late getting home. I searched again the area where the arrow should have been, looking carefully under every bush, but it was not to be found.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p6" uuid="a2c2580c-757b-4b78-847d-addc1a96fb58" pid="X-QTm_M8gUSJJzzTnRiYHw" hash="XXPO2w">Time was running out, and I needed to start for home to get there before dark. I decided to pray and ask Heavenly Father to help me find the arrow. I dropped to my knees, closed my eyes, and prayed to my Father in Heaven. I told Him I didn’t want to lose my new arrow, and I asked Him to show me where to find it.</p>

I grabbed the arrow and began to run for home, arriving there just before dark.</p>

The windswept Chatham Islands are located in the South Pacific Ocean about 500 miles east of Christchurch. A hardy and resourceful 650 people lived there, isolated in the lonely, harsh environment of those days; and a young, inexperienced, and newly qualified doctor was responsible for their medical care.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p19" uuid="7a553e23-768d-4f37-9e7e-438aed8b7fe8" pid="7ZPrCu_NBk-WOskb1s3W2A" hash="zDWTng">An eight-year-old boy, Shane, had sustained a serious head injury 40 miles away on the far side of the island. He was being rushed in across the swamps and along the beaches on the backseat of an old, rusty car to the four-bed cottage hospital. He was unconscious.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/prayer-faith-and-family-stepping-stones-to-eternal-happiness.p20" uuid="17d1b59f-fc4f-4ec9-b745-33d8414cc5e3" pid="rhkr54cBrUiMqfYE_guKpQ" hash="DntyAA">The young doctor was unprepared to handle such a case, with little experience and having only the most basic of surgical instruments. Shane was in a critical condition. There was obvious bleeding inside his fractured skull—and blood clotting could fatally compress his brain. The doctor had never even seen a brain operation, but he knew he had to perform the delicate surgery immediately—or watch a little boy die.</p>

The antique X-ray machine had broken down, so no helpful X-rays could be taken.</p>

More calls to the neurosurgeon for direction and reassurance were made, and his advice was followed in every exact detail. After six hours of anxiety and pressure, the surgery was completed, the hemorrhage of blood into the brain cavity ceased, and a successful outcome was achieved. Serenity replaced chaos. It was around midnight.</p>

He thought about his family and the blessings they enjoyed. He was grateful for the many tender mercies of the Lord in his life and especially for the presence of the Comforter during the last 12 hours. He was grateful for the presence of an unseen expert who imparted of His far-greater knowledge freely in his time of need.</p>

He is such a nice chap, and I can’t help pondering on how thin the veil is between this life and the next.”</p>
