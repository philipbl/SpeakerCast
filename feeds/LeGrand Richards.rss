I do testify to you today that I know that Christ lives, that he is the Redeemer of the world, and that he has given us his church through restoration in this dispensation through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and a pattern of life to live by through his gospel that will bring us joy and happiness in this life and exaltation through the worlds to come.</p>

Hanks, who, as you know, is such a wonderful storyteller, as we witnessed again this morning, gave this illustration in talking to the brethren. He said that the old leaves have to fall from the trees to make room for the new leaves to come. I applied that to myself. I am one of the old leaves in this church. I am one of the oldest men. I think I can truthfully say that there is no other living man on the face of the earth today who has stood at this pulpit as many times as I have in a general conference of this church except President Joseph Fielding Smith. If I figure correctly, this is the seventy-fourth general conference in which I have been privileged to speak. As I listen to the testimonies of my brethren, there come to me the words of the song that we sing:</p>

Then I think of the statement in the Articles of Faith, given to us by the Prophet Joseph Smith, when he said: “We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.8" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:8</a>.)</p>

That I believe with all my heart.</p>

Many of them have found their fulfillment in this the dispensation of the fulness of times, and others await their fulfillment.</p>

What a statement! Then following his resurrection, as he walked along the way by two of his disciples to Emmaus, and we are told that their eyes were holden, that they did not recognize him, when he heard what they had to say about him and his ministry and his crucifixion, he realized that they did not comprehend what he had been trying to teach them, so he said, “O fools, and slow of heart, to believe all that the prophets have spoken” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.25" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:25</a>), and commencing with Moses and the prophets, he showed them how that in all things the prophets had testified of him. There isn’t time to consider those promises and prophecies this afternoon, but they prophesied even of the casting of lots for his clothing at the time of his crucifixion.</p>

I believe what Jesus said: “Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.18" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:18</a>.)</p>

In the time allotted to me, I can only mention briefly some of them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p17" guid="69d7b70b-8cd3-4e88-905c-43218a61b870" pid="njzUkc16M0q9k6g-JYtTbA" hash="m_ca5w">Isaiah saw our day. He saw the wilderness made to blossom as the rose. He saw the rivers flow in the desert where we have built these great irrigation canals under the inspiration of the Almighty, after our pioneers were led here to these valleys of the mountains, a wasteland, and nothing but their hands with which to labor, far away from transportation or commodities of any kind. He saw the waters flow down from the high places where it had been reservoired in these mountain fastnesses. He saw the daughters of Zion come up and sing in the heights of Zion. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/35.title" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 35</a>.) Where can you find anything in the history of this whole world to fulfill that like the singing of our Tabernacle Choir, singing now for over forty-two years without a break? Now with the Telstar, it is singing to the entire world. No wonder President Nixon said in his visit here last November that it was the greatest choir in all the world.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p19" guid="d846b31a-58e1-4feb-9859-c67e3b9f4888" pid="kwGSPQlI7kOz-19nEiyPgA" hash="l3NQKw">How literally that has been fulfilled, in my way of thinking, in this very house of the God of Jacob right here on this block! This temple, more than any other building of which we have any record, has brought people from every land to learn of his ways and walk in his paths.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p20" guid="fa4463e9-eab4-40ea-ab4a-216c24f7c222" pid="XEfUM_E8ZES-w-4fl02djQ" hash="f2tpJQ">I could tell you many stories about the great sacrifices our early pioneers and converts have made, when they would sell everything they had in this world and leave behind their loved ones and their friends and their occupations to come to a faraway land and learn a strange language. What brought them here? The house of the God of Jacob, that they might learn of his ways and walk in his paths.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p21" guid="1f4389a6-adf4-42e6-ab6f-4d50193595a5" pid="NT7nH00bskGOpPVktsTwSA" hash="ky4UFw">Jeremiah saw the day when it should no longer be said:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p22" guid="fc2a0a37-fcaf-4242-84a9-6709ecdd1f0a" pid="WWDfGQJdJEmDk2EOEPJ9Ow" hash="RPTddw">“The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p24" guid="5a3205f5-bb15-4eec-8ddf-03782df9eb10" pid="0gTrqGycWUu82kAMTnqhOw" hash="uEJy-g">Just contemplate that statement for a few moments. Think how the Jews and the Christians all through these past centuries have praised the Lord for his great hand of deliverance under the hands of Moses when he led Israel out of captivity, and yet here comes Jeremiah with this word of the holy prophet, telling us that in the latter days they shall no more remember that, but how God has gathered scattered Israel from the lands whither he had driven them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p25" guid="ddf33d99-8b0b-4fd4-b020-1181df4618cd" pid="Wh-NYCvIV0aGTysq_yHiyg" hash="KQpCAw">And Jeremiah saw the day when the Lord would do this very thing, when he would call for many fishers and many hunters, “and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/16.16" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 16:16</a>.) Where do you find those fishers and hunters that we read about in this great prophecy of Jeremiah? They are these 14,000 missionaries of this church, and those who have preceded them from the time that the Prophet Joseph Smith received the truth and sent the messengers out to share it with the world. Thus have they gone out, fishing and hunting, and gathering them from the hills and the mountains, and the holes in the rocks. I think that is more literal than some of us think!</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p26" guid="d5e02853-5a46-4849-8575-eeb1d525307d" pid="Rq11CNAdHkODyjS99RlbyA" hash="VEdbzg">When I was president of the Southern States Mission, I remember going to a conference down in west Florida. It seemed to me as if we traveled a hundred miles and never saw a house, and when we arrived at one of those little chapels, there it was filled with 250 people, and I said, “If you didn’t come out of the holes in the rocks, I don’t know where you came from. The Lord may know, but I don’t!” Well, that was literal, and we see that being fulfilled right before our very eyes.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p27" guid="65a70e74-8044-47aa-9b84-e47d9844bb67" pid="sB_vCDriNUGv6tC5vf2DTw" hash="5PnxeQ">Malachi saw before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord when the Lord said he would send Elijah the prophet to “turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 4:6</a>.) Just think of that statement. The Jews are still waiting for his coming.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p28" guid="313c008f-d9b1-4dc3-8e65-e8661d8dc78e" pid="iSMQfZCOfEKD6uk3K4f_Yw" hash="tt4_QQ">When I was in Israel, a year ago last July, in one tour we visited three synagogues, and there hanging on the wall was a big armchair. I asked the rabbi why it was there. He said, “So we can lower it if Elijah should come, that he might sit in it.” And then I thought how they remain in darkness, and here we know that Elijah has come. It is hardly within the capacity of an ordinary man to comprehend and understand what has happened in this world because of Elijah’s coming: this great genealogical work; this library that can’t be equaled anywhere in the world; these great vaults out here in the bowels of these mountains, where millions of records are being kept.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p29" guid="c97e769e-9f6d-45f5-9178-73dfb3d90485" pid="nbStRysObUepQJx6f4zyvQ" hash="ouI6Cw">No wonder Isaiah called it a marvelous work and a wonder, when the people would draw near to him with their mouths, and honor him with their lips, but their hearts would be far removed from him; and they would teach for doctrine the precepts of men. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.13-14" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:13–14</a>.) These are some of the things, and many, many more have transpired in our day in fulfillment of the words of the prophets. No wonder the prophet said: “We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p30" guid="b9f99729-8f03-43f7-a47b-8f99f26e6fd9" pid="BtLXIwu1a0mwT3-nvYZ-7A" hash="sqrSTg">There isn’t time to go into the details, but Jeremiah described the gathering of our people here in these valleys of the mountains in just as definite terms as our historians have written it—how they should travel along the rivers of water. They traveled along the Platte River for over five hundred miles. Then he adds that they should come with their multitudes, “both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness. …” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/31.title" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 31: 13–14</a>.) And that is why our people will respond to every call that comes to them, because the God of heaven created the feelings of the human breast, and like Nephi of old said, the Lord “hath filled me with his love, even to the consuming of my flesh.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:21</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p31" guid="c248b31b-25da-4043-aca6-9f1dc42fb796" pid="MbWjRLz0GU22fU7b1MP_mg" hash="8UG_5A">There are many other things that are yet to be fulfilled. I will just mention a couple of them. The Lord put it in my heart as a young man to have a love for the Jewish people, and someday they are going to be one of the great movements of this church. In the Book of Mormon we read in the preface that that book was preserved for the convincing of Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the very eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations. And how can that book do that to the Jews unless we take it to them? And so, in his own due time and way the Lord will inspire our leaders to send messengers to that people.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/in-the-mountain-of-the-lords-house.p32" guid="09fb17d8-6efc-4fbb-8743-a93d04aed317" pid="CRfwdmAV6k6u3BbHlM74OA" hash="NvH6HQ">We read in the Book of Mormon that we should turn our hearts to them. There isn’t time to read that prophecy to you. He said many of the Gentiles would say: “A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.” And then the Lord said, “… what thank they the Jews for the Bible? …” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.3-4" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 29:3–4</a>.)</p>

Trust not the wisdom of men. That is the wisdom of God, the Eternal Father, as he gave it to the Prophet Joseph in this day.</p>

I am sure that those of us who have been privileged to attend the last three sessions of this conference have felt a realization that we have truly been fed the bread of life eternal. We have had some wonderful counsel and inspiration given to us by the servants of the Lord.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/laying-a-foundation-for-the-millennium.p3" guid="081f50af-6331-40cb-8e49-3d661682b53d" pid="FVXEApg-QUCV7rvt_XMkKA" hash="nsOHYQ">Bread will keep the body alive, but it takes more than that to keep the spirit alive. The music has been wonderful, and I would like to compliment these singers from Ricks College. I was there just a few weeks ago at their devotional, and we can’t help but thank the Lord for all the institutions of his church and what these institutions and educational opportunities are doing for our young people.</p>

I think of the time the beautiful temple here on this block was erected, over a hundred years ago. When the foundation was being laid, we are told that it was sixteen feet wide, and at one time President Brigham Young came and saw the workmen throwing in chipped granite. He made them take it out and put in those great granite blocks with this explanation: “We are building this temple to stand through the millennium.” Isn’t that a good thought? Each one of us ought to want to build our lives and help our families to build their lives so that we can stand through the millennium.</p>

He saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works—not just their faith, not just what they say with their mouths, but by their works. And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to his works. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/20.12-14" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 20:12–14</a>.)</p>

But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. … Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/20.4-6" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 20:4–6</a>.)</p>

And if it takes a sixteen-foot foundation to hold that temple for the millennium, then it takes a lot of obedience on our part to prepare ourselves for that glorious event.</p>

I read from Brother Rulon S. Howells’ book <span class="emphasis">Do Men Believe What Their Church Prescribes? </span>(Deseret Book Co., 1932.) He has a chart there where he lists all the major churches and then their statement and attitude toward the major doctrinal principles, including this one about the eternal duration of the marriage covenant, and not one believes this.</p>

What a flimsy concept! Why don’t they go back to the time when God had finished the creation of this earth, and looked upon it and found it good, and placed Adam here, at which time he said: “It is not good that the man should be alone. …” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/2.18" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 2:18</a>.) He made a helpmeet for him, saying, “… and they shall be one flesh.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/2.24" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 2:24</a>.) Now what God joins together and makes one flesh, you couldn’t separate without having two halves instead of two wholes. Jesus repeated that statement when he said:</p>

I said, “Did I misquote you here tonight?” “No, Mr. Richards,” he said; “it is just like you say. We don’t all believe all the things that our churches teach.” And I said, “And you don’t believe them either. Why don’t you go back and teach your people the truth? They will take it from you and they are not ready to take it from the Mormon elders yet.” He said, “I’ll see you again,” and that is all I could get from him that night.</p>

As I walked up to that little church, there stood that Baptist minister waiting for me. As we shook hands I said, “I would certainly be interested to know what you thought of my last sermon here.” He said, “Mr. Richards, I have been thinking about it ever since. I believe every word you said.” Then he said, “But I would like to hear the rest of it.” How could any man who has a true love for his wife and his children not want to believe that principle?</p>

I would just as soon believe that death is a complete annihilation of both body and spirit as to think that when death came it would separate me from my wife and from my children and that we would not know each other. I tell you, there wouldn’t be very much to look forward to. How could you want to live on and on forever without a continuation of the love ties that bind you together here?</p>

I remember years ago, I think it was in 1932, when Colonel Lindbergh’s little boy was kidnapped and a note was left asking for $50,000. He would gladly have paid what they asked if he could have gotten his boy back again. And yet here we come along with the knowledge of life eternal. Brother Marion G. Romney quoted this morning the revelation of the Lord where he said that in the resurrection children would come forth and grow up without sin unto salvation. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.58" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:58</a>.)</p>

A little daughter was born to us over in Holland while I was president of the mission there, and we kept her until she was three and a half years old. My wife has said time and time again that she knew the angels brought that spirit to her because she felt their presence, and yet we laid her away in the grave. If we had to feel that that was the end, we would have given anything in this world to have her back again. And then we come to this great knowledge that we have in the restoration of the gospel, that she will be ours in the eternal world and we will have the joy of seeing her grow up without sin, unto salvation. Sometimes I have thought that probably some of these choice spirits did not need the experience here in mortality like other children, and that is why the Lord has seen fit to call them home.</p>

We were sent to California to preside over a stake down there, and our boy went out with a member of the high council and his boys, and he lost his life in an accident. That is the greatest sorrow that ever came to us, but now we are getting up on the top of the ladder, so to speak, and we look forward, knowing that these love ties are intended by God, our Eternal Father, to endure throughout the eternities. It takes the sting away from death to know that we are going to meet those who are so dear and sacred to us. Thank God for this knowledge! I want to see our foundation here so laid that we will be worthy to stand with our loved ones and with the sanctified and the redeemed of our Father’s children.</p>

We are blessed in the privilege of living upon the earth when the gospel has been restored and having a knowledge of its truth. We are blessed to have a foundation upon which to build our faith, which makes every day a happy day as we associate with our loved ones. No wonder President McKay so often said that no success in life can compensate for failure in the home. And the nearer men and women live unto God in keeping his commandments, the greater is the love in the home and the greater appreciation of the knowledge that that love can continue throughout the eternities that are to come.</p>

She went to her minister and said, “Why can’t our church have something like this?” The minister could not give her any satisfactory explanation, and so she wrote a letter to the Bureau of Information here in Salt Lake City. They sent her literature, they sent us her name, the missionaries called on her, and she joined the Church.</p>

I am sure, as we have listened to the messages of our brethren during these various sessions, we can’t help but feel a deep appreciation in our hearts that the Lord saw fit to institute in his restored church the practice of holding conferences.</p>

It has taught us how to treat our neighbors and friends, and in all that has been said here today, we have learned of the responsibilities that are ours in the political affairs in which we should participate in our own communities.</p>

In President Smith’s opening address he said, “The Lord’s work shall triumph. No power on earth can prevent the spread of truth and the preaching of the gospel in every nation.”</p>

There is no message in this world today that could be told that would be as valuable to our neighbors and our friends who are not members of this church as to bear witness of this great event, about which the choir has just sung.</p>

Of course, we take the Bible as our guide to help us in our search for the truth. I have always been greatly impressed by the experience that Elder Orson F. Whitney had. He was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, and he related this in one of our conferences. I would like to read it to you. He said:</p>

I became well-acquainted with him, and we conversed freely and frankly. A great scholar, with perhaps a dozen languages at his tongue’s end, he seemed to know all about theology, law, literature, science and philosophy. One day he said to me: ‘You Mormons are all ignoramuses. You don’t even know the strength of your own position. It is so strong that there is only one other tenable in the whole Christian world, and that is the position of the Catholic Church. The issue is between Catholicism and Mormonism. If we are right, you are wrong; if you are right, we are wrong; and that’s all there is to it. The Protestants haven’t a leg to stand on. For, if we are wrong, they are wrong with us, since they were a part of us and went out from us; while if we are right, they are apostates whom we cut off long ago. If we have the apostolic succession from St. Peter, as we claim, there is no need of Joseph Smith and Mormonism; but if we have not that succession, then such a man as Joseph Smith was necessary, and Mormonism’s attitude is the only consistent one. It is either the perpetuation of the gospel from ancient times, or the restoration of the gospel in latter days.’” (LeGrand Richards, <span class="emphasis">A Marvelous Work and a Wonder </span>[Deseret Book Co., 1950], pp. 3–4.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/13.7" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 13:7</a>.)

There is a great difference between remodeling an old house and building a new one.

They worshiped an essence everywhere present. They described him as being without body, parts, or passions, who sits on the top of a topless throne, and that is about the best explanation of nothing as a person could write. If he doesn’t have a body, how could he speak? How could he hear? How could he understand and talk?</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/4.29" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 4:29</a>.) And Joseph Smith, answering that admonition in James, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a>), went and sought after him, as Moses advised, and he found the true and the living God.

Not only that, but hundreds of thousands who have already gone to their rest, such as my father and his father. My grandfather spent ten of the first fourteen years of his married life bearing witness of this message here and in the lands of Europe.</p>

My testimony and witness to you here today is that there is not an honest man or an honest woman in this world who really loves the Lord, and would like to serve him as he would like to be served, who would not join this church if they would just take time to find out the marvelous things the Lord has done in restoring his work to the earth in this day and time.</p>

Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the world could understand that?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/strange-creeds-of-christendom.p6" guid="2c019c54-5ea3-4a2f-b8bb-351d4e0ae6c4" pid="Q1sGbYOPhk6C17hOSACcyA" hash="-D8QsQ">When the astronauts landed on the moon, the newspapers all over the world gave a front-page report of it, but that would not be anything to consider like the Creator of the heaven and the earth returning to this earth, for we are told that Jesus created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them are. Then naturally they would want to know, if the Father and the Son considered it important enough to visit this earth, what kind of a message they would want to leave or why they would come.</p>

And how does he try to destroy people? By taking a little truth and mixing it with a lot of error to deceive the hearts of the people.</p>

For he is the man who made the earth to tremble, who did shake kingdoms, and thus deceived the nations. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/14.16" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 14:16</a>.) That is what Jesus came to tell us, that “their creeds were an abomination in his sight” because Satan has deceived the nations.</p>

We hear constantly that all we have to do is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and we will be saved. The advocates of this doctrine take for their justification the statement of Jesus to the malefactor on the cross when he said, “To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.43" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:43</a>.) (The Prophet Joseph Smith indicates that the word <span class="emphasis">paradise </span>as it appears in the Bible should have been translated as “the world of spirits.”) They think that they can all be saved just by acknowledging Jesus as the Christ. If they only understood the scriptures!</p>

The apostle Paul tells us that there are three heavens above the world of spirits, and Jesus said: “In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you … that where I am, there ye may be also.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.2-3" class="scriptureRef">John 14:2–3</a>.)</p>

Why did he take him to paradise (the world of spirits)? It was a great gift and recognition at his hand because of what the malefactor had said on the cross.</p>

Peter tells us that “for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/4.6" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 4:6</a>.) And that is where the malefactor went with the Savior that day, but there are three heavens above that to which Jesus did not take him.</p>

Then he said, “Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.17" class="scriptureRef">John 20:17</a>.)</p>

No wonder Jesus said to the Sadducees, “Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.29" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:29</a>.) So that man went with Jesus that day where he could be taught the gospel, but Jesus had not yet ascended to his Father in heaven.</p>

You have got to do the works and be judged according to your works. All we need to do is to read the parable of the talents to know how the one who received the five talents won other five, and the one who received two won other two, and received the plaudit, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.”</p>

At the time that Joseph Smith had that marvelous vision and saw that glorified Christ, he saw the same Jesus that came out of the tomb. He was the same one who appeared unto his apostles and had them feel the prints in his hands and the wound in his side. He was the same one who ascended into heaven in the presence of five hundred of the brethren at that time. This same Jesus appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith when the whole Christian world was worshiping an essence.</p>

He has no ears; he cannot hear your prayers. He has no voice; he cannot speak a word to the prophets. Some of them even say “he sits on the top of a topless throne.” How absurd! To me it seems that their description of the god that they believe in is about the best description of nothing that can be written.</p>

But Moses did not leave it at that. He said that in the latter days if they should seek after him, they would surely find him.

And I want to bear my witness as one of his representatives, an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, that I know that he has visited this earth and we have his revealed truth. We have that of which Peter spoke when he said, following the day of Pentecost, that the heavens must receive the Christ “until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:21</a>.) We are the only church in the world that claims such a restitution, and there is a great difference between a <span class="emphasis">restitution </span>and a <span class="emphasis">reformation.</span> We are not Catholics. We are not Protestants. We believe in a recommitment to this earth of God’s eternal truth.</p>

I witnessed one of the religious crusades on the television here just recently. The man in charge said it would cost them a million and a quarter dollars to present it. I think of the words in the scripture that they should make merchandise out of the souls of men. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/2.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 2:3</a>.)

He did not tell them to come up and confess. He said: “Repent, and be baptized … and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.37-39" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:37–39</a>.)</p>

When John the Baptist was sent to prepare the way for the Savior in the meridian of time, the Savior bore testimony that there was no greater prophet in Israel than John the Baptist.

And if you will just stop to think, at the time that Joseph Smith had that marvelous vision of the Father and the Son, he saw that they were two glorified personages, that they were not three in one, without body, parts, or passions. There wasn’t a church in the world at that time, so far as we know, that was worshiping the true and the living God; so when the angel was to come with the everlasting gospel, he was also to bring men back to the worship of the true and living God who made the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</p>

We had the plans prepared for the Los Angeles Temple. One day we took them and showed them to the First Presidency, but we didn’t have the electrical or plumbing plans completed. We had 84 pages about 4 feet long and 2 1/2 feet wide, and I imagine you have all seen blueprints. I said, “Now you could take those blueprints and try to fit them to every building in this world, but there is only one building they will fit, and that is the Mormon temple down in Los Angeles.” Then I said, “Of course you can find buildings that have material in them such as cement, lumber, electrical wiring, plumbing, and so forth, but you can’t find any building that they will fit.”</p>

I said, “Here is the Lord’s blueprint. Isaiah said the Lord had declared the end from the beginning. It is all here. Now,” I said, “you could take this, the Lord’s blueprint, and try to fit it to every church in this world, but there is only one church that it will fit, and that is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Now,” I said, “I will proceed to illustrate to you what I mean.”</p>

Now I take it that that marvelous work and a wonder was to correct the precepts of men, because Isaiah indicated that it was for that reason that He would do a marvelous work and a wonder.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/revealed-truths-of-the-gospel.p4" guid="a7837b3c-3d95-4228-a732-99741479cbc4" pid="jGorYvTq4kGxZVCAMkHqbg" hash="wG9jYg">There isn’t time to discuss all of the wonderful corrections that have come through the restoration of the gospel, this marvelous work and a wonder. However, the first and great correction, I think, was the knowledge that came through the vision of the Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that President Marion G. Romney so beautifully described this morning. Instead of being a God which is an essence everywhere present, without body, parts, or passions (and this means he has no eyes, he cannot see; no ears, he cannot hear; no voice, he cannot speak), they were two glorified beings, as we will be following the resurrection. What a marvelous thing to have this commitment and to know that we are his children—the children of God the Eternal Father—and that we will be able to live in his presence and know who he is, and his Son Jesus Christ, who arose from the dead, and who atoned for the sins of the world.</p>

Just think of the priesthood in this Church, and all of the auxiliary organizations, reference to which has been made here in this meeting as we have sustained the directing officers thereof. President Lee pointed out that the priesthood meeting tonight would be broadcast in 850 different buildings.</p>

Thus they lay away treasures in heaven, where moth and rust doth not corrupt and where thieves cannot break through and steal (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:19</a>), and where they can develop their gifts and talents, because the kingdom is here for that very express purpose.</p>

It seems incredible that, as plainly as that principle is taught in the holy scriptures, we should be the only church that so believes. Here a few years ago, one of our brethren wrote a book called <span class="emphasis">Do Men Believe What Their Churches Prescribe</span>? (Rulon S. Howells, Deseret Book Co., 1932.) In that book he had a chart prepared showing various doctrinal principles. He had inquired and obtained first-hand comments from the major churches (ten of them, including our own church) and there wasn’t one of those other nine churches that believed in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. They indicated that marriage was “until death do you part,” which in substance is a bill of divorcement. If it is to last only until death parts us, then what are we going to do from that time on? Where are the ties that bind us together, particularly in this church where we brethren work in the priesthood all the time, leaving our wives to raise our families for us, and all of that just to be parted when death comes along?</p>

A man came up and introduced himself to me as a Baptist minister, and I said: “Did I misquote you here tonight?”</p>

Why don’t you go back and teach your people the truth? They will take it from you, and they are not ready to take it from the Mormon elders yet.”</p>

As we shook hands I said, “I would certainly be interested to know what you thought of my last sermon here.” He said, “Mr. Richards, I have been thinking about it ever since. I believe every word you said, only I would like to have heard the rest of it.” You know we never get talked out when we start talking about these beautiful principles that the Lord has given us through the restoration of the gospel, through the bringing forth of this marvelous work and a wonder.</p>

He was the pastor of the Presbyterian Church there and we spent an hour or two together. When he died he was the chaplain of the United States Senate. You may have read his book, <span class="emphasis">A Man Called Peter,</span> or may have seen the movie depicting his life. Many of the things he stood for he learned from us down in Atlanta. He used to send over to the mission office to get the MIA books and other Church material for his young people because he felt we were stealing them all away from him.</p>

He said, “Well, Mr. Richards, we are not allowed to teach that in our church, but in my mind I have some stubborn objections.” He went on, “When you take the kitten away from the cat, in a few days the cat has forgotten all about the kitten; when you take a calf away from the cow, in a few days the cow has forgotten all about the calf; but when you take the child away from its mother’s bosom, though she live to be a hundred years old, she never forgets the child of her bosom.” He added, “I find it difficult to believe that God created love like that to perish in the grave.” Thank God we know that he didn’t create love like that to perish in the grave. Love is eternal.</p>

For instance, Anderson M. Baten said this in a little verse he wrote to his wife Beulah on the mysteries of life:</p>

He said that “it was not good that the man should be alone;” and he made a help meet for him, and he said “they shall be one flesh,” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.18,24" class="scriptureRef">Moses 3:18, 24</a>), not two halves but one flesh, because he couldn’t have peopled this earth without the man and the woman, and it took two to make a complete person in that sense. Then I say this: if it wasn’t good for man to be alone <span class="emphasis">before </span>death came into the world, it certainly won’t be good for man to be alone <span class="emphasis">after </span>we are resurrected from the dead and restored to the condition that Adam was in before the fall.</p>

If it wasn’t good to be without a wife before the fall, it certainly won’t be good to be without a companion after the resurrection, and anyone who repudiates that actually repudiates the great atonement, because in that event the Savior would only have atoned in part for the loss that came through the fall of Adam and Eve.</p>

What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.7-9" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:7–9</a>.) It couldn’t be written much plainer than that, could it? What did he really mean when he said that they should be one flesh and never be put asunder if it wasn’t that the marriage tie should project itself beyond the grave?</p>

Now what does it mean “being heirs together of the grace of life”? What life? They already had their lives here in mortality, but they are to become heirs together of the blessings of eternal life. How could it be written any plainer than that?</p>

Personally I would just as soon believe that death was a complete annihilation of both body and spirit as to think that I would have to live on forever and forever without a continuation of the love ties that bind my wife and me together, and our family and our loved ones here in this life. Heaven will only be a projection of our life here.</p>

President Lee has emphasized the same thing by saying that our greatest responsibility is within the walls of our own home, not just because those homes should be good until death parts us, but because we are building a foundation of a kingdom over which we will be privileged to preside throughout the eternities that are to come, if we are true and faithful. And that is one of the glorious principles of the gospel that has come through the restoration here in our day and in our time.</p>

Yet through the new and everlasting covenant and the sealing ordinances of the holy priesthood in God’s holy temples, we can have our children throughout the countless ages of eternity. The Lord has indicated through the Prophet Joseph that they should come forth in the morning of the first resurrection and “grow up without sin unto salvation.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.58" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:58</a>.) To those of us who have laid away children in their infancy, just think of the joy and happiness that comes from this, compared with feeling that there would be no family relationship in the eternal world.</p>

That is only just a beginning. And to this great audience here today, and all that are listening in over the radio and those who will listen in tonight, and those in whose hearts God has planted a witness and a testimony of the divinity of this work, I bear you my witness. I know that it is the marvelous work and a wonder that our Father promised through his great prophet that he would send to us, and I leave you my love and blessing and witness, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

I think of the words of Nephi of old. He saw our day; he saw the coming forth of the Book of Mormon; he saw the Saints of God gathered upon the face of the whole earth and the power of God resting upon them in great glory.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p2" pid="0AbfapyFKU2ecUW0lF-9xA" hash="r33KOA">Is there anything else like this in all the world as we have gathered here in this building, full to overflowing, and the adjoining buildings? And our priesthood meeting last night was broadcast all over the world. The power of God is in this work; it is his kingdom established in the earth for the last time, never to be thrown down nor given to another people. We have his decree that it shall roll forth until it shall become as a great mountain and fill the whole earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p3" pid="WqN8tgnTHUmLkQfasJtMTQ" hash="HM7dcQ">I thank the Lord for the testimonies of these, my associates, to whom we have listened, and I am sure that each one of us who is living in tune with the Spirit has received a witness in our soul to the effect that they are true servants of our Father in heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p4" pid="PrVs8a0IVk62v5xMbkLU1Q" hash="HD4SrA">Brother Benson referred to a statement made by President Kimball in our meeting with the Regional Representatives of the Twelve last Thursday. I thought President Kimball did a magnificent job in reminding us of the commandments of the Lord through His servants, and the responsibility that is ours to share this gospel with every nation under heaven. Sometimes I think we get a little too satisfied with our own membership and our own surroundings, and we are not as eager to share with others as we ought to be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p5" pid="A8IPIHrzikmPjNso_VtjRA" hash="eC5qGQ">Then we have had presented to us in this conference the ministry of the Master. I particularly enjoyed Elder Hunter’s narration of His life and labors, and then Elder Ashton followed, reminding us of the parable of the five wise and five foolish virgins, and called attention to the fact that we should not be among the foolish ones but that we should be prepared when the Master comes to meet him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p6" pid="i_EOKIhnGkWpXhhsGNBsoA" hash="Dt5wlw">Then I had this thought that I would like to say a few words to you about today, and that is that I am a great believer in the prophecies. I thank the Lord for the holy scriptures. What would we know about our Father in heaven and his great plan for us, his children here upon this earth, and what awaits us after we have finished our life’s work here in mortality if we didn’t have the scriptures?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p7" pid="FF1P1Rqh_061UWWo2Qiwbg" hash="Xvyg5A">Jesus said, “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.39" class="scriptureRef">John 5:39</a>.) We have had testimony here in this conference of how they did testify of him, even to the minutest detail of casting lots for his clothing at the time of his crucifixion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p8" pid="CgWpSMqJ_UC5GQmfF7CpZA" hash="S-J22Q">Following his resurrection, as he walked along the way by two of his disciples as they were on their way to Emmaus, we are told that “their eyes were holden that they should not know him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.16" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:16</a>), and when he heard what they had to say about him and his ministry and his resurrection, he realized that they didn’t understand what he had been trying to teach them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p9" pid="3Wue9eLgRUiUNvf2NuAMDg" hash="Rt2Q8Q">And he said: “… O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.25" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:25</a>.) Then, commencing with Moses and the prophets, he showed them how that in all things the prophets had testified of him. Then Peter tells us that he opened their understandings (that is, the understandings of his disciples with whom he was traveling) that they might understand the scriptures. We have thousands of different churches in the world today because they do not understand the scriptures and they are teaching for doctrine the precepts of men, and therefore it was necessary for a restoration to take place.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p10" pid="VmjINgK0mU-S4bvg6KO21Q" hash="_97XGA">I like the words of the apostle Peter. He said:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p14" pid="Ghq5I9f-wE2OZUunyDWUsg" hash="gBiVLw">That being true, we have a more sure word of prophecy that makes the Bible to me like a blueprint where the Lord has outlined everything from the war in heaven up till the final winding-up scenes when we will have a new heaven and a new earth. I think that is what Isaiah meant when he said that the Lord has declared the end from the beginning. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/46.10" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 46:10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p15" pid="rDBDeN78vkKPPXciCd_86A" hash="u6m4uA">Peter must have also had in his mind the glorious experience that he had just previously had with the other apostles when the Savior ascended into heaven and two men in white apparel stood and said: “… Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/1.11" class="scriptureRef">Acts 1:11</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p17" pid="ANYJHmA_4EqKWiOKWU0AlA" hash="28cYZw">I give you the words of Peter following the day of Pentecost when he spoke to those who had put to death the Christ. He said:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p21" pid="m7JOOSJ2AUCcSBefRCZaBw" hash="Q5KUBg">I don’t know where you can go anywhere in this world, outside of this Church, and find a declaration of a restitution of all things and not just a reformation. Until there is that restitution of all things spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, we just can’t believe that Peter was a prophet of God and look for the coming of the Savior. It makes one wonder why the world doesn’t understand and why they are not willing to listen when we declare a restitution of all things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p22" pid="_ZOr0yFgP0ancFDhg3JLXA" hash="8JDW6w">I like the statement in Malachi. It seems to me that Malachi’s whole book was written almost entirely regarding our day and time: about the law of tithing that Elder Taylor just mentioned; about the coming of Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers. In the third chapter, he starts out by saying,</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p25" pid="57S4ToRRek-DPqjT5clm_Q" hash="3-EgPA">Now I don’t think that was referring to his first coming. He didn’t come swiftly to his temple, and all men were able to abide the day of his first coming; and he didn’t come cleansing and purifying as refiner’s fire and fullers’ soap, but we are told that when he comes in the latter days that the wicked shall cry out to the mountains, and rocks “fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/6.16" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 6:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p26" pid="iZPOrGSod0icW9kRLugirA" hash="pKei5w">Then I say to you, and to all the world, where is that messenger that the Lord, speaking through Malachi, said he would send to prepare the way for his coming (and I refer to his second coming)? To us Latter-day Saints, we know that messenger was none other than the Prophet Joseph Smith. He didn’t choose himself. He went out into the woods after reading the words of James, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a>.) He didn’t know which church to join, and when he prayed, the heavens were opened unto him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p27" pid="7ey5sOlQv0m9775YpZ43zg" hash="HxAS_w">President Kimball has outlined in one of his talks in this conference how the Lord communed with the prophets of old. God isn’t dead. He reigns in the heavens above and in the earth beneath. This is his work and his glory. This is the dispensation when, as Paul said, “… he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth. …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 1:10</a>.) In other words, it is the time when he shall finish his work upon this earth preparatory to his second coming. And so if he was to send a messenger to prepare the way for his coming, where in all the world can you find that messenger?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p28" pid="7WErmOUNCU6fkY0Wyd7NNA" hash="hpW_zA">I remind you that messengers sent of God are never self-sent. Paul said: “… faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/10.17" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 10:17</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p31" pid="3kaysGoIf06AX18iRBxVyA" hash="3f5jug">And so the call of Joseph Smith as the Lord’s promised messenger was the natural first step the Lord would take to prepare the way for his second coming.

That is what Amos said: “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>.) And so when he called this messenger, he would be a prophet.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p34" pid="w7vxVEc9w0KfxzXV6UcFUg" hash="KJRXHw">As far as my experience goes in studying the scriptures, Joseph Smith has given us more revealed truth than any prophet who has ever lived upon the face of this earth except the Savior of the world. I thank the Lord for this marvelous truth. This helps us to understand the words of Isaiah when he said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p35" pid="l_QHFivmKkm4BcxPBdGDlg" hash="KPT69A">“Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.13" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:13</a>.) And where do you find those precepts of men? In all these thousands of churches all over this world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p36" pid="EX05WLCIP0eT8kL_w7hIxQ" hash="sRg94g">“Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder. …” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.14" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:14</a>.) And anything that is marvelous and wonderful in the eyes of the Lord must be something that every lover of truth would like to know about and like to clasp to his bosom. Then he added that it would cause that “the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.14" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:14</a>.) That is what we have. I have talked to ministers for hours and only received one question from them, because I was explaining things to them out of God’s holy book, the Bible, that they had never understood before in their lives. I tell you, brothers and sisters, we have that marvelous work and a wonder!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p37" pid="77xH3ux3NEOtgtwAPnf47g" hash="RFgK0w">You would think that if the Lord raised up a prophet and a messenger to prepare the way for his coming, the first thing he would want that messenger to do would be to correct the false impressions in the world with regard to the personality of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. For at that time all churches taught that they were three in one, without body, without parts, and without passions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p38" pid="1vEskzbqMEyijlJUAhxkzA" hash="HmuZyQ">Moses knew that such a condition would prevail, for when he led the children of Israel into the promised land, he told them that “there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/4.28" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 4:28</a>.) Just think how literally the very words of Moses spoken over 3,000 years ago are fulfilled in the doctrine that was proclaimed in all the Christian churches all over this world at the time that Joseph Smith had his marvelous vision. But Moses didn’t leave it at that. He said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p39" pid="vZ_vBGZOJEmuqk1gwG6lkA" hash="ny4vfA">“But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p40" pid="909YkF2VJkaNSVv4ZpFYHA" hash="MwyC6w">“When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/4.29-30" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 4:29–30</a>.) And we live in the latter days. Thank God we have found him through the raising up of this prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p41" pid="0qqBjge-CkK-7cy6p85dDg" hash="LN95SA">When the Father and his Son Jesus Christ revealed themselves unto him so that he understood what the Godhead really was, the next question that Joseph had was to know which of all the churches he should join. And who in the heavens above and on the earth beneath had a better right to pronounce judgment upon the churches of the world than the Savior of the world? He answered him that he should join none of them for they all taught for doctrine the precepts of men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p42" pid="Lkl04B0GS0aJIDwVwquSFA" hash="jIZWDg">There isn’t going to be time to outline very much more, but just think of Moroni’s coming, think of the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. Where in all the world does anybody know about that other record that the Lord commanded Ezekiel should be written, that the Lord would bring forth and put with the record of Judah and make them one in his hand? We are the only people in the world that know where that record is. Just think what it contains of the knowledge that the Lord preserved for the convincing of the Jew and the gentile that Jesus is the Christ. The Jew today doesn’t need to search any further than the Book of Mormon because that book gives the signs of his birth and of his crucifixion, and then of his visit to this land of America, and then the vision given to Nephi when he saw Mary with child, and saw that child grow to manhood, and saw him crucified for the sins of the world. All we need to do is to look to the blueprint that the Lord has prepared through his prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p43" pid="SuwH_yxsDEiZ9giXGzuahg" hash="EzQ-eg">Then if you take the next step—the coming of John the Baptist with the Aaronic Priesthood, the power to baptize by immersion for the remission of sins—there wasn’t anybody in this world holding that power when John the Baptist restored it to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and taught them how to baptize each other. Then Peter, James, and John brought the Melchizedek Priesthood, the power of the holy apostleship, the power to organize the church and kingdom of God on the earth for the last time, never to be thrown down nor given to another people. Then the coming of Moses that caused the gathering of Latter-day Israel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p44" pid="-64h0qQS5Uiwp3MSjPylfw" hash="N9NzZA">I like the statement of Jeremiah. He said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p45" pid="7SoiabYRxUeqHW0YmyWeNA" hash="FrF4Qg">“Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p46" pid="v4PUsQ0vH0uyviKpjPyZug" hash="t4S95g">“And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/3.14-15" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 3:14–15</a>.) Where could you go in all the world and listen to pastors after His own heart like you have heard here in this conference? They are called of God and ordained by God. They are the pastors that he spoke of.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p47" pid="4-YG6xT7rk6pZT548XUyaA" hash="7cKB3Q">Through Jeremiah the Lord said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p48" pid="4cum8d_OTEGPCdKL1dQHVw" hash="ddOiag">“Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/16.16" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 16:16</a>.) That is what we have been doing. He saw the day when “it shall no more be said, The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p49" pid="1LXk3ewWVU6OePa_EdkEag" hash="AI901w">“But, The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them …” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/16.14-15" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 16:14–15</a>), and, as he said, “… one of a city, and two of a family. …” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/3.14" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 3:14</a>.) That accounts for many of you being at this great conference that is being held here today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/prophecy.p50" pid="9DXJqnLN5EGfhLervdVKbw" hash="62PjHw">God bless you, brothers and sisters. I don’t know why we should hesitate to raise our voices in testimony. To me it is the marvelous work and a wonder spoken of, it is the greatest movement in all this world. When everything else passes away like the dream of a night’s vision, this church, this kingdom, will go on to its decreed destiny, and that is my witness and testimony to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p1" pid="YIOGd0o1BkmnyfS4DvNtew" hash="0SrBsQ">I am very happy, brothers and sisters, to be privileged to share this wonderful conference with you and I have enjoyed the music immensely at all sessions and the talks of my brethren. In your presence this day I would like to humbly express my love for my Father in heaven and for his Son, Jesus Christ, who gave his life as an atoning sacrifice for us, and also for his restored gospel which gives us such a wonderful pattern of life to live by and such hope for the eternities that are to come when our work here upon this earth is completed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p2" pid="nFRfZ9v_7ECzjEHnd1cRIw" hash="FU8vfQ">I would like to express my love for the Saints as I travel through the Church and in the missions and see those at the Mission Home, and as I feel the faith of the people. We thank God for the great outpouring of his Spirit that is causing the great growth and development of the Church throughout the world today. I thank him for our noble leadership, for President Kimball and his counselors. I love them, and the people love them because they are truly our Father’s servants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p3" pid="KWLzWnR4oUy7PRCw7uP1HA" hash="Wl0XyQ">I thought today that I would like to direct what I have to say to those parents who have lost children in death before they reached maturity and could enter into the covenant of marriage and have their own children here upon this earth. I reckon that there aren’t many families who haven’t had that experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p4" pid="QOKYO4xtN0iDa9_sonmTSw" hash="Gvv-Hg">I think of the thousands of our boys who have lost their lives on the battlefields of their various countries. I think of our boys who have died in the mission field. While I was president of the Netherlands Mission, I held one of those wonderful missionaries in my arms as he passed on to eternal glory.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p5" pid="2S4M_k4FWEOMSSSzN7Ggbg" hash="bh8zGw">I think of the many wonderful, faithful women who never have an opportunity to marry here in mortality because they are not willing to throw their lives away on men who are not worthy to take them to the celestial kingdom. Many of them have filled missions and work diligently for the upbuilding of our Father’s kingdom, for the raising of the youth of Zion, and they are wonderful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p6" pid="-5poojXvDk6Tjcmeub-MoA" hash="vahv-A">I would like to use my own family as an illustration of what I have in mind. Mother and I were filling a mission together over in Holland when we had a little girl born to us, and after we had been home a few years she passed away. When she was born, my wife has told me over and over again that she felt she saw an angel bring that spirit to her. And yet she is gone. Then I think of her four sisters. You voted here today to sustain one of them as a counselor in the general presidency of the Relief Society. Her other three sisters are just as noble and wonderful, although their talents may be just a little different.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p7" pid="c-tv804sr0CAfzpgNh74Vg" hash="yRCL1g">When I think of this little one that we laid away when she was three-and-a-half years old, I thank God I have the faith to believe that God reigns in the heavens above and in the earth beneath and that this little one will ultimately enter into her glory and be equal to any of her four sisters who have tarried here upon this earth and raised their families. I thank God for the statement of the apostle Paul when he said that “If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:19</a>.) In this brief period of mortality, it would not be possible for God to accomplish for all of his children all that he has in mind for them, the ones that are true and faithful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p8" pid="GrrN1XKVe0eHapfmCIeq3A" hash="aNr5Pw">I think of the statement of Moses as recorded in the Pearl of Great Price: “For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>.) I wonder sometimes if we ever stop to analyze that statement. I think we can understand what “to bring to pass immortality” is, that we will never die after we come forth in the resurrection, as President Romney pointed out this morning. But what about eternal life? As I interpret this, I find in it the feeling that all that God has ultimately planned for his children who are faithful and true shall come to them in his own due time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p9" pid="7-MOtjUOeE2FeD0GOErYJg" hash="saFqGQ">We read in the Book of Mormon that we are not all born at the same time (and that doesn’t matter) and that we don’t all die at the same time. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.8" class="scriptureRef">Alma 40:8</a>.) I think of the words of Abraham when he saw the placing of the spirits here upon this earth, that the Lord would prove them to see if they would do all things whatsoever he had commanded them. Then he adds: “And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.26" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:26</a>.) That was in the spirit life before we came to mortality. “They who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.26" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:26</a>.) This little girl of ours kept her second estate as far as she could at her age.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p10" pid="0q24-0jlnUuoC2VVxmRnfQ" hash="6uzaLw">Then I think of the statement of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith when he said: “The works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 3:1</a>.) In other words, no one can stand in the way of God achieving what he has decreed for his children. Then a further statement in the Doctrine &amp; Covenants where the Lord said: “His purposes fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand. From eternity to eternity he is the same.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.3-4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:3–4</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p11" pid="E3YAlxTpI06Kmg1qy129Vg" hash="Mijmyg">Then there are the words of the Lord to the prophet Nephi when he said: “For my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 29:9</a>.) Now that should enable us to comprehend and realize that there will never be a time when God will cease to do his work to bring to pass, as we read in the Pearl of Great Price, the glory that will be added upon their heads forever and ever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p12" pid="j_bzcgNkeUiA4zFrMzU2Zg" hash="6Jo6dg">Coming back to our family, we had four daughters before we got a boy and he grew into beautiful young manhood; we lost him in an accident down at the beach in California while I was the president of the stake there. He was just turning 16 and he stood as tall as his father, and to think now of his own brothers who are here: they have their families, and one of them has just been serving as one of the Regional Representatives of the Twelve. I can’t believe that boy will come out any less exalted in the eternities that are to come than his brothers who have lived here in mortality. When he died, the principal of the high school came to our home (and he was not a member of the Church) and told Sister Richards that our son was the best boy he had ever had in his school, and we felt that, too, as he grew into manhood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p13" pid="cKEFz4TM6k2TGABCvfSOeg" hash="kvuk-g">Then I think of our little granddaughter who died at the same age; her father and mother are here today and her brothers and sisters. After just a few days of sickness, she passed away at the age of 16, a beautiful little woman. To think that God’s plan would not ultimately bring to her everything our other children received who tarried here in mortality would lessen my appreciation of my Father in heaven and the perfectness of his plan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p14" pid="_j1DxlDz00aZec11UT6AXA" hash="l7cx2Q">I think of the parable Jesus gave when he said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p15" pid="fdEeyko6TUyqTqPQJJJcgA" hash="egnHIA">“For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p16" pid="RyU6FU1j6EC_AP8GJRvIOw" hash="5_jhQw">“Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/14.28-29" class="scriptureRef">Luke 14:28–29</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p17" pid="WhSXyuGfkUuWXngzeqProw" hash="fLb7aA">If God started to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man and did not provide an opportunity to complete the program, he would be like the builder who starts to build and then is not able to finish.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p18" pid="52MPA6utIke2m0fyd_Vshg" hash="8c2Quw">Coming back, then, to the family, I think of my wife’s sister who died here a short time ago. She filled a mission for the Church; she worked in the auxiliaries and she was a noble character. But she never married, and I can’t believe that the Lord’s plan is imperfect, that she will not ultimately enjoy all that her sister (my wife) with our wonderful family has enjoyed. “His purposes fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p19" pid="T_AQkfilo0Kq7N_dcVOswA" hash="UXzrkg">So I thank God for the thousand years of the millennial reign. My, what a lot of work needs to be done during that period! I can’t take time to tell you much about that, but I think of the words of Isaiah. He had a glimpse of it. He saw the day when we would have a new heaven and a new earth, when the wolf and the lion would lie down together, and the lion would eat straw like the ox. His people should build houses and inhabit them, and should plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. They should not build and another inhabit. They should not plant and another eat, for every man would enjoy the work of his own hands. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/65.17-25" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 65:17–25</a> and <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/11.6-9" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 11:6–9</a>.) Then he adds: “For they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/65.23" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 65:23</a>.) That sounds like a continuation of the family, doesn’t it?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/what-after-death.p20" pid="pyohprvLUU21T7j6GmTMLw" hash="pYb7_A">Then I thank God for the statement of the apostle Paul when he said: “Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 11:11</a>.) That being true, the Lord must have a plan so that these children can ultimately enjoy that great blessing.</p>

He has indicated that we must lengthen our stride and that he wants us to double the number of missionaries that we have. I think I have been a missionary all my life—ever since I was a small boy. I remember one of the first books that I read as a boy that impressed me was the <span class="emphasis">Life of the Prophet Joseph Smith</span> by George Q. Cannon. That book made such an impression upon my mind and caused me in my heart to have such a love for the Prophet Joseph and such a testimony of the truth of his story that I have felt I wanted to tell it to all the world ever since that time.</p>

Then I said to myself: Why not? We have the greatest message in all this world. The message we have for the world today is just as important in the sight of the Lord for all of his children as the message was that Peter delivered on the day of Pentecost, when the multitudes were pricked in their hearts and they cried out: “Men and brethren, what shall we do?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.37" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:37</a>.) You remember Peter’s answer:</p>

Now we have that message and that is why the people of the world can’t adequately and properly find their way back into the presence of the Lord unless they are willing to heed the message that we have.</p>

The apostle Paul said there is “one Lord, one faith, one baptism.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.5" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:5</a>.) Then I thought, I wonder what Paul would say if he were here today and knew how many churches there are.</p>

If Paul were here, to which church would he go, for he said there is “one Lord, one faith, one baptism.” And so we have to look for divine guidance to know where to go to find that true church if there is only to be one church, and that is our testimony.</p>

Paul said, “But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/1.8" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 1:8</a>.) Now that is quite a statement, but Paul was not at all backward in indicating what he thought of those who didn’t teach the truth that had come to them through the Savior and his teachings.</p>

Of course, we couldn’t have that without the great redemption work that he wrought. But Paul saw “that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 1:10</a>.) We are the only church in the world that has that and that is the finishing touch. We are in the dispensation of the fulness of times.</p>

Now if the world believes that, then they should be waiting with open arms for the prophet of God to come and declare that this has had its fulfillment.</p>

In other words, if he were to establish his work in the earth in the latter days, in that dispensation of the fulness of times, in order to bring together in one in Christ all that which is in heaven above and that which is in the earth beneath, he would have to have a prophet.</p>

We sing in our song, “We thank thee, O God, for a prophet To guide us in these latter days” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 196), for we have living prophets; we don’t have to depend on the dead prophets alone. We have the living prophets to guide and direct us.</p>

He said: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:21</a>.)

He said: “And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/15.14" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 15:14</a>.) He didn’t say that, just because they were blind, they would arrive at their destination. And so we have to be sure and prepare ourselves and know that we have found that one and only true church that Paul spoke about. In order to do that, we have to turn to the words of the holy prophets.</p>

And this is by studying the scriptures. Then he said to two of his apostles as they were on their way to Emmaus following his resurrection, “O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.25" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:25</a>.) And commencing with Moses and the prophets, he showed them how that in all things the prophets had testified of him. And then Luke tells us he opened their understandings that they might understand the scriptures.</p>

Could any other message go out to the world that could be compared with this? How could the people of the world, if they love the Lord, hear such a message and then not want to know whether it is true or not?</p>

I had a call last week from a minister who lives in Los Angeles, who served, as he told me, for 20 years as a Baptist minister. Then he met the Mormon elders and they taught him the gospel as it has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and he gave up his ministry and became a member of the Church. He is now working in the temple there, and he called me to thank me for writing the missionary book that helped him to understand what the Lord has done in restoring his truth to the earth in this dispensation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p25" pid="9GcU5c_XN0uVAAfAf0ULag" hash="gDWkzg">Just a few years ago, we converted a minister from up in the Northwest. He sat in my office and he said: “Brother Richards, when I think of how little I had to offer my people as a Methodist minister compared with what I now have in the fulness of the gospel as it has been restored, I want to go back and tell all my friends what I have found. Now,” he said, “they won’t listen to me; I am an apostate from their church.” But he gave up his ministry and ran the elevator here in our capitol building so that he could support himself and join the Church. He sat in my office and said: “I can’t wait until I can go into that temple with my wife,” and I have since met him in the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p26" pid="hYn5NWUN6EKZaqyWXrfcnA" hash="9uSv6w">He also said: “When I joined the Church, I didn’t feel that I could say that I <span class="emphasis">knew</span> that Joseph Smith was a prophet, but I <span class="emphasis">believed</span> that he was a prophet.” Then he added: “But when Brother Burrows [and I know Brother Burrows] laid his hands on my head, and ordained me to the priesthood, something went through my being such as I had never felt before in all my life, and I knew that no man could do that for me. It had to come from the Lord.” That is what we find when people are open-minded enough to be willing to listen and understand what the Lord has really done in restoring his truth to the earth.</p>

It is taken from a pamphlet entitled <span class="emphasis">The Strength of the ‘Mormon’ Position</span> (Orson F. Whitney, Independence, Mo.: Zion’s Printing and Publishing Co., 1917). The late Elder Orson F. Whitney of the Council of the Twelve Apostles related the following incident under the heading, “A Catholic Utterance”:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p28" pid="AbeMzYfk-kqnNyLZ1RAMzw" hash="I8S5-w">“Many years ago a learned man, a member of the Roman Catholic Church, came to Utah and spoke from the stand of the Salt Lake Tabernacle. I became well acquainted with him, and we conversed freely and frankly. A great scholar, with perhaps a dozen languages at his tongue’s end, he seemed to know all about theology, law, literature, science and philosophy. One day he said to me: ‘You Mormons are all ignoramuses. You don’t even know the strength of your own position. It is so strong that there is only one other tenable in the whole Christian world, and that is the position of the Catholic Church. The issue is between Catholicism and Mormonism. If we are right, you are wrong; if you are right, we are wrong; and that’s all there is to it. The Protestants haven’t a leg to stand on. For if we are wrong, they are wrong with us, since they were a part of us and went out from us; while if we are right, they are apostates whom we cut off long ago. If we have the apostolic succession from St. Peter, as we claim, there is no need of Joseph Smith and Mormonism; but if we have not that succession, then such a man as Joseph Smith was necessary, and Mormonism’s attitude is the only consistent one. It is either the perpetuation of the gospel from ancient times, or the restoration of the gospel in latter days.’” (<span class="emphasis">A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,</span> LeGrand Richards, Deseret Book Co., 1958, pp. 3–4.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p29" pid="dBZGtdfEGUyW7SgCriChFQ" hash="rqqPMA">Now if the members of these 697 different churches could realize the consistency of that statement, they would want to know by what authority their ministers are performing the ordinances in their churches, because if the statement of this prelate is true, they either must be Catholics or Mormons. Then I always add that the Catholics and the Bible can’t both be right because the Bible definitely proclaims an apostasy from the original church and a restoration in the latter days.</p>

This was 30 years after the death of the Savior. The angel showed John the power that would be given to Satan “to make war with the saints [and the saints were the followers of Jesus] and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/13.7" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 13:7</a>.) That doesn’t leave anybody out. That is a definite statement of a complete apostasy from the original church.</p>

He then showed John another angel flying “in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/14.6" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 14:6</a>.) Now obviously no angel would need to come from heaven with the everlasting gospel if that everlasting gospel had remained upon the earth. The everlasting gospel is the only gospel that can save men. And so that is our message to the world, that we have that everlasting gospel.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p2" pid="UctZz9C1jk20nuWhOeK6ww" hash="VUvT7w">I thought today that I would like to say a few words about the importance of prophecy and prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p3" pid="7iznfAj5FUyvzoOcbDXgiQ" hash="dS3wFA">After the resurrection of the Savior, as he walked along the way to Emmaus with two of his disciples, we are told that “their eyes were holden” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.16" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:16</a>) that they did not recognize him. When he heard what they had to say, he realized that they didn’t understand what he had tried to teach them, and so he said: “O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.25" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:25</a>); and, commencing with Moses and the prophets, he showed them how in all things the prophets had testified of him. Now as you study the scriptures, you will know that the prophets foretold his life and ministry down to the minutest details, even to the casting of lots for his clothing at the time of his crucifixion. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/22.18" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 22:18</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p4" pid="9LzYcnaafUKD8EOWbd95Rw" hash="n_koug">Peter said, “We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p5" pid="VhlXdr3BYk6kNuspRdqxMA" hash="PhqvTg">“Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. [That is an important thing.]</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p6" pid="lQF1bUQXzkGvxqAaFM1aOQ" hash="sP3scg">“For prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.19-21" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 1:19–21</a>.) If we have that same power, then we ought to be able to understand prophecy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p7" pid="rhD1Vnr0-UaOpy34ihpQYA" hash="YgI05w">Just as the holy prophets foretold the coming of the Savior in the meridian of time, they have foretold many of the important events that were to transpire to prepare the way for his second coming. I would like to refer to some of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p8" pid="TzvPR2sRhEyilKN188dS4w" hash="toqNiQ">The prophet Amos said, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>.) Now if we understand that, no one can look for a work here upon this earth that isn’t headed by a prophet. The Lord has never done a work that he has recognized without a prophet at its head. Thank God for our prophets, from the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith down to our present prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p9" pid="rHviVL-GtkiWknabJJQvcg" hash="TbWqdg">I have known President Kimball intimately for thirty-seven years, and I don’t think there is a more Christlike man in this world than he; and if the Lord can’t talk through a man like President Kimball, he couldn’t find anyone on this earth more worthy. I thank Him for living prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p10" pid="fCg3ilJvdkCYanLJpvImEw" hash="4xVb2A">Now if we understand the words of Peter when he said, “We have also a more sure word of prophecy” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.19" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 1:19</a>), then in other words, there isn’t any other way in this world that we can know the mind and the will of the Lord as intelligently and assuredly as we can know it through the holy prophets. Then coming back to Amos, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p11" pid="3NtQ6SFRjUyaQI72tv5R5w" hash="UpYQzQ">Any seeker after truth who believes in these words and the importance that Jesus attaches to prophecy cannot look for a church in the midst of the some 700 there are in this land of ours today without it being a church with a prophet at its head unto whom God can reveal his mind and his will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p12" pid="r_lNdKQzBE-AMqNxr3RhZQ" hash="PkykYA">Now there were many things that needed to be done. Peter, in speaking to those who had put to death the Christ, following the day of Pentecost, said, “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p13" pid="OqZuwFvSpUSw05stX8GtOA" hash="SmcXwQ">“And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p14" pid="Jlp_T4Pp6UySeJ76pVb2Ew" hash="wlBhIw">“Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.19-21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:19–21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p15" pid="j3qrxLrI2U6xHluN7HdqHg" hash="gmASIw">Thus, one looking for truth would look for a restitution and not a reformation, and not a continuation, because if Peter was a prophet of God, we have to have a restitution of all things spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets before the Savior would come, because he said the heavens were to receive the Christ “until the times of restitution of all things.” There couldn’t be a restitution unless there were a living prophet upon the earth unto whom these holy prophets could come to restore the things that had been lost, whereby the churches were teaching the commandments of men, as Isaiah said. And so we have a living prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p16" pid="5UrJNiaa4k-xt4spAaQ4Fg" hash="kzoilw">The Lord raised up the Prophet Joseph Smith, as has been testified in this conference, and we have more revealed truth through him than any prophet that has ever lived upon the face of this earth as far as our records show. He has brought us things from those dead prophets who were to come to restore all things before the Savior could come again. There are many things that he has restored.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p17" pid="BkvsCwFn2kGFbQYwAQPAvA" hash="zufkoA">You take, for instance, the dream of Nebuchadnezzar (to which reference has already been made) and Daniel’s interpretation of that dream. You remember that Nebuchadnezzar had forgotten the dream, and he called for the wise men and the astrologers, and none of them could tell him his dream. Then he heard of this man Daniel in Israel, and Daniel said, “But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/2.28" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 2:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p18" pid="HGsDZpBdSEWc1B5eE97oRw" hash="VIu5HA">Then he told him about the rise and fall of the kingdoms of this world until the latter days (and we live in the latter days), when the God of heaven would “set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/2.44" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 2:44</a>.) How could God set up such a kingdom as that which would endure forever without a prophet through whom he could work to establish his kingdom?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p19" pid="BkNrcF3LNk6uQXwV3-qP6A" hash="M0w7Ig">Then he said it would be as a stone, cut without hands—in other words, it would have a small beginning, and this kingdom started with six men and has grown, as Daniel said it would, to become a great mountain and fill the whole earth. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/2.35" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 2:35</a>.) No other group of religious worshipers is growing by leaps and bounds as is this church today, because the God of heaven has established it according to his promise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p20" pid="Tcxo_Sv3MEecTOPXIPavfw" hash="JN-d3Q">When I was president of the Southern States Mission, one of our missionaries preached on that dream of Nebuchadnezzar in one of our meetings where we had some investigators, and I stood at the door to greet them as they went out. A man came up and introduced himself as a minister, and he said, “You don’t mean to tell me that you think that the Mormon Church is that kingdom, do you?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p21" pid="tCvShCHBx0e0xIoQ7aiRyA" hash="d-SwyA">And I said, “Yes, sir, why not?”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p25" pid="EClrFW9Bu0uLY7nv860shQ" hash="p_NcKg">“Oh,” I said, “my friend, you didn’t read far enough. You just read the seventh chapter of Daniel, where Daniel saw one like the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven, ‘and there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him.’ (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/7.14" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 7:14</a>.)</p>

Where in all the world can you go and find the message of the return of Elijah according to this promise? He has come. He appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple on the third day of April 1836 and brought the keys of this great assignment and work to unite the heavens with the earth that has caused the building of our temples.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p29" pid="qQvFjjt1hkOy4rRxiBgiPw" hash="swk-cg">And that brings us also to what Isaiah saw when he said, “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, … and all nations shall flow unto it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p30" pid="AYPpDT-L3USFGVsUiJHKsA" hash="eanmPg">“And many people shall … say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/2.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 2:2–3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p31" pid="X1y_A5_CBUaOju6hAaqxVQ" hash="rAJgjA">This temple on this temple block is that house of the God of Jacob that our pioneer fathers started to build when they were a thousand miles from transportation, and it took them forty years to build it. Isn’t it a glorious thing, one of the most beautiful buildings in the world? Those of us who filled missions in the early days know how literally every convert, as soon as they joined the Church, would want to sell everything they had, saving their money, as I saw in little Holland, by the nickels and the dimes, until they could find enough to come to this land because of the drawing power of that temple, so that they could learn of his ways and walk in his paths.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p32" pid="uBdVfnL2jk-NmEol0pgSMA" hash="QAMJlA">Now there are many other prophecies, but I would just like to refer to the fact that Isaiah also saw and pronounced “that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p33" pid="ugBIbPUWXEahfm119tO9YQ" hash="s1f4SA">“And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/11.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 11:11–12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p34" pid="sZGulzPCfE67-7XKK4FVhA" hash="bDet7w">The angel Moroni repeated that passage to the Prophet Joseph when Joseph was only eighteen years old, when Moroni visited him three times during the night and again the next morning, indicating that that work was to be established. Just think of the assignment to the Prophet Joseph at that time. He has set up an ensign to the nations. No other church in the world is accomplishing what this Church is doing for its members, and developing its members, and that is an ensign unto the world. People come to us to learn how we are accomplishing these things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p35" pid="ag3WLoo-HkGbpgSOAXweVw" hash="Qi56oA">Isaiah saw many other things in connection with this gathering. He saw that the Lord would gather Israel quickly and with speed, that they would not even have time to loosen the shoe latchets of their shoes, or to slumber or sleep. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/5.27" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 5:27</a>.) Imagine a statement like that way back in the days of Isaiah, thousands of years ago, with their means of transportation at that time!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p36" pid="ucw1KN1wE0enNv57a9CN6A" hash="tmMLNA">You Saints of God that are making the sacrifices that you are of your time and your talents and your means and your youth to promote the great missionary program of the Church and to pay your tithes and offerings—there is nothing else like it in all this world today because God is working through his prophets. Like Paul of old said, speaking to the church of his day, “and [ye] are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.20" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:20</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p37" pid="T_tQPTSdhUaEYyIlglnk2Q" hash="cRH7OQ">So one seeking truth should look for a church that is built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, and I bear you my witness that this is the church of Jesus Christ, built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, with Christ the Lord still directing his Church through his living prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p38" pid="LqHLlE3EM0uvN8KbdWYTbw" hash="5XdA1A">We have many other prophecies. The apostle Paul said that the Lord had revealed unto him the mystery of his will. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.9" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 1:9</a>.) Now that is quite a statement, isn’t it—the mystery of the Lord’s will? “That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 1:10</a>.) No other church in this world has any such program to unite the heavens with that which is upon the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p39" pid="TJRN4KfFZUWJG9LdyESOGg" hash="Jvaabw">And we read in the prophets about how the Lord’s people would come up as saviors upon Mount Zion. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/obad/1.21" class="scriptureRef">Obad. 1:21</a>.) We read the word of Jesus when he said, “The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.25" class="scriptureRef">John 5:25</a>), because all the multitudes who have gone beyond have to hear the gospel. We are told that every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/14.11" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 14:11</a>.) That gives us to understand in just a little way the meaning of the words of the apostle Paul when he said, “Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.29" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:29</a>.)</p>

Obviously that had no reference to his first coming. He didn’t come swiftly to his temple. All men could abide the day of his coming. But we are told that when he comes in the latter days, the wicked will cry out to the rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/6.16" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 6:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p41" pid="6fHbhizTMEuIAdWig2_otw" hash="je1HgA">Well, we have that program which leads into the use of our temples and ties into the further statement of Malachi when he said, “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prophets-and-prophecy.p42" pid="MVvbChARU0WcpjTWlzaY8A" hash="uXCLDA">Just to illustrate the fulfillment of that—when President McKay went to Scotland to help organize the first stake in his bonnie Scotland, on his return, in reporting to us Brethren of the Twelve in the temple, he said he left London at 2:00 in the afternoon, and he spent a little time with the brethren in Chicago, and he was in his own bed that night. He didn’t have time to loosen the shoe latchets of his shoes or to slumber or sleep. Then he compared that with when his people came to Zion in the early days, when they were forty-three days on the water and then weeks getting across the plains. Just think of the gathering! I wish there were time to go further into the prophecies of how our people were to be brought here and travel along the river banks, and so forth—and this our pioneers did—and that the Lord would turn their sorrows into rejoicing. Then Jeremiah said the day would come “that it shall no more be said, The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/16.16" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 16:16</a>.) Any of you who have been out in the mission field in scattered areas will know how our missionaries, over 21,000 of them, are going from door to door and hamlet to hamlet, gathering the people, as the prophet said, out of the holes of the rocks and the hills.

Without a knowledge of those things, we would be like a ship upon the ocean without a rudder or sail or anything to guide it. We might keep afloat, but we would never come into port.</p>

Now for instance, this prophecy of Isaiah has always appealed to me. When Babylon was the greatest city in all the world, Isaiah prophesied that Babylon would be destroyed, that it would become the abode of reptiles and wild animals, that the Arabs would no more pitch their tents there. Then he said that Babylon would never be rebuilt. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/13.title" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 13</a>.) Now can you imagine anyone today declaring that one of our great cities would be destroyed and never be rebuilt? And yet, Babylon has never yet to this day been rebuilt.</p>

As I understand that chapter, there wasn’t anybody in this world who could have understood the prophecies of Isaiah at the time that this Church was organized, until the Book of Mormon came forth. Through that we have an understanding of those scriptures that no one else in the world has.</p>

That is all he had to say about the destruction of Jerusalem, but you remember what Jesus said to his twelve. He told them the temple would be destroyed, there wouldn’t be one stone left upon another, and it would be ploughed as an acre. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/21.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Luke 21:5–6</a>.)</p>

In other words, he saw the destruction of another great center like the destruction of Jerusalem. No one in this world could have told where that other center was until the Book of Mormon came forth. Then Isaiah goes forth with what he saw with respect to this other group of people. He said, “And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.</p>

When Professor Anthon had given a certificate to say that the translation was correct, he wanted Martin Harris to bring the plates and let him translate them. Martin Harris said, “They are sealed.” The professor repeated the very words that Isaiah spoke thousands of years ago: “I cannot read a sealed book.” That is what I mean when I say that if the prophecies, as Peter indicated, are not of private interpretation, then no one else in the world can interpret these prophecies of Isaiah in his twenty-ninth chapter.</p>

McKay, assisted by his counselors and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve, laid his hands upon my head twenty-four years ago last April in the holy temple and ordained me an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

And my, the joy I have had in these 24 1/2 years trying to respond and be obedient to the charge that President McKay gave me upon that occasion. I have had great joy and happiness therein.</p>

Think of that! Their minds were confused and corrupted or else they would have followed the simple teachings of the scriptures and there would have been no need of their spending four weeks in debate to decide that question. Thank the Lord that, through the restoration of the gospel, those simple truths are a part of us and of our great work, and our minds are not corrupted.</p>

When I was doing missionary work back in Massachusetts some years ago, and it was near Easter time, I had a conversation in the home of a retired minister. I asked him if he would explain to me his concept of the Deity. He told of the universal feeling and the teachings of the churches, that he believed that the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost were one God, but a spiritual God—not a physical God—that there was an influence that permeated the earth, the life of the flowers and the trees and so forth.</p>

He is not here, but is risen’ (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.title" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24: 5–6</a>)?

(See <a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/4.28" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 4:28</a>.) Now isn’t that the god of the Christian world today?

How could He stand on His right side or right hand if He had no body? How could He stand if He had no feet? Then compare this also with the marvelous vision of the Prophet Joseph in this dispensation when a light descended from heaven, according to his testimony, brighter than the noonday sun. In the midst of that glorious light were two heavenly messengers: the Father and the Son. The Father, pointing to the Son, said: “This is My Beloved Son.

According to the corrupted ideas of the Christian world today, what would they hope to see when they see Him if He is just a spirit everywhere present? Would they see the flowers and the plants and the trees? Not so with the Latter-day Saints. We look forward to the day when we will see Him come in power and great glory, and it doesn’t make sense to think that He discarded that body that He could be everywhere present, that He and the Father could be the same person.</p>

Like Paul said, the Church is “built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.20" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:20</a>.) I have a witness that He is at the head of this church, that He is guiding it and directing it, and I don’t see how any sane person could study what the Church has accomplished since the days that He appeared with the Father, and then think that it is the work of man.</p>

A few years ago when Brother John A. Widtsoe was alive, he gave a series of lectures on the Doctrine and Covenants in the Barrett Hall, and Sister Richards and I attended those lectures. He had Sister Inez Witbeck there—she could read beautifully—and he would say, “Sister Witbeck, read section so-and-so,” and then request certain verses from another section. Then he would stand up and say: “Now you college students, you college professors, could you write anything like that?” Then he would add: “I wish I could.” And he had been president of two universities and written textbooks that had been used all over the land. This church has produced many great leaders in finance, industry, and education, but none of them have attempted to contribute what the Prophet Joseph gave although he had scarcely seen the inside of a schoolroom.</p>

Some of them thought that they could write revelations better than the Prophet Joseph did. So the Lord gave them a test. He told the prophet to choose the wisest among them and let him write a revelation equal to the least of those that the Lord had given through the Prophet Joseph, and if he was successful in so doing he would be under no condemnation if he failed to bear witness of the truth of the revelations He had given through the prophet. But none of them could do it. As I say, smart as our leaders are and have been, none of them can hope to approximate what the Prophet Joseph gave.</p>

We read in the Bible that Paul (although he didn’t say it was himself) knew a man in Christ Jesus who was caught up into the third heaven—and there can’t be a third heaven without a first and a second—and such an one was caught up into paradise (and then we have a place below that!). But Paul was not permitted to write what he saw, how we should live or how the Lord would judge those that would go to the heaven that he likened to the sun, and the one like unto the moon, and the one like unto the stars, as Brother Sill mentioned here today. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.2-4" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 12:2–4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.40-42" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:40–42</a>.)</p>

When the prophet received that revelation, he said: “[It was] a transcript from the records of the eternal world.” (<span class="emphasis">History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</span> 1:252.) Many of our scriptures were written long before man was upon the earth. That is why we read of Christ, the Lamb slain before the foundation of this earth. Not that He was literally slain, but in the Lord’s great eternal plan, He had offered Himself and He was to give His life.</p>

How could any sane person, a lover of truth, read that testimony and then not want to know whether that book is true, and then read the promise in the latter part of it, that if any man would read it and ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, having faith that the Lord would manifest the truth of it unto him by the power of the Holy Ghost.

(<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.16" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:16</a>.) When He heard what they had to say about Him and His life and crucifixion, He realized that they didn’t comprehend what He had tried to teach them, and so He said to them: “O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.25" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:25</a>.)</p>

It goes like this: “God moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform.” I would like to refer today to a few of the wonders that the Lord has performed and is performing in order to prepare for that glorious coming of His Only Begotten Son as the prophets have foretold. I may repeat some of the things that have been said in this conference.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.1-2" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:1–2</a>.) Now obviously that had no reference to His first coming, when He was born as a humble babe in Bethlehem, for He didn’t come to His temple swiftly, and He didn’t come cleansing or purifying. But we are told that when He comes in the latter days the wicked will cry out to the rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us … from the wrath of the Lamb.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/6.16" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 6:16</a>.)</p>

If we could realize how this world has changed in the past 200 years because of the coming of the Father and the Son to usher in this dispensation as compared with the centuries preceding—why didn’t it happen 500 years ago or a thousand years ago?</p>

He said that the Lord has revealed the mystery of His will, “That in the dispensation of the fulness of times [<span class="emphasis">and we live in that dispensation</span>] he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 1:10</a>.) Isn’t that something to think about, when you hear that the Lord will reveal the mystery of His will? And that the mystery of His will has been revealed to His modern prophets of this day?</p>

Well, they are just some of the little things that need to be done. Now there are many other prophecies foretelling His second coming.</p>

That He has done through the gathering of the Latter-day Saints to these valleys of the mountains as a witness that He has gathered scattered Israel. And now Judah is being gathered back to her native land after centuries—two thousand years of wandering and persecution—and now Israel has a nation of her own. All of this is but fulfillment of the prophecies that were to precede the coming of the Savior in the latter days.</p>

(It seems to me that he almost lived more in our day than the time when he was here upon the earth, because he saw so much of what would transpire.) He saw in the last days (and he names the <span class="emphasis">last days</span>) that the mountain of the Lord’s house would be established in the top of the mountains (and we are here) and that all nations would flow unto it. “And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/2.3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 2:3</a>.)</p>

Just imagine the Saints starting to build an edifice like that when they had nothing but their hands with which to build it, and were a thousand miles from transportation. One of the first things that President Brigham Young did when they entered into this valley, a wilderness, was to put his cane on the spot where this temple was to be built. Well, Isaiah saw all of that thousands of years ago, and that is another of the preparatory things that the prophets have foreseen that were to precede His second coming.</p>

There are unseen powers that operate in this world on the hearts and minds of men that are as real as the sunshine is to the plants and the trees to help them grow, and the seeds to sprout, and so forth. Elijah did come; on the third day of April 1836 he appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple and brought back the keys of the turning of the hearts of the fathers who have passed away to their children here upon this earth, and the hearts of the children here to their fathers, and that in itself is one of the great miracles of all ages.</p>

At that time there were no genealogical societies in the world, and now they are all over the world; and not only that but I had a newspaper that came to me from Indianapolis the other day and the whole front page of the paper was about the gathering of genealogy. It told about our Genealogical Department out here, and I checked with Brother Burton, and we have over 600 employees in that department, 80 men that are microfilming the records all over this land and in Europe.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p2" pid="WXslNUs3MUexJpFDMkVq1A" hash="XSihSQ">I thought today I would like to refer to the fact that a week ago the entire Christian world celebrated one of the greatest, if not the greatest, events that has transpired in this world since the foundations thereof were laid, and that is the resurrection of Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God. No wonder that after the apostles had seen him crucified and laid away in the tomb and the women brought the report that he had arisen from the dead, the apostles felt as if it were an idle tale. As Jesus walked along the road with two of his disciples on the way to Emmaus following his resurrection (and we are told that “their eyes were holden” that they didn’t recognize him [<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.16" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:16</a>]), he heard what they had to say about him and his life and crucifixion. He realized that they didn’t understand all that the prophets had said concerning him, and so he said: “O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.25" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:25</a>.) Then commencing with Moses and the prophets he showed them how in all things the prophets had testified of him, and that they did even to the minutest details, even to the casting of lots for his clothing at the time of his crucifixion.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p5" pid="zJe7EYy5GUeU8Jx0V1voVQ" hash="xvLGXg">“Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p6" pid="E5flDjIjYk-LYx_g-FCoAQ" hash="DgJKOg">“For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.19-21" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 1:19–21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p7" pid="FX399kEBLUuEYZMECxU0wg" hash="gEdlzg">Well, if prophecy is the most sure way of knowing what is to happen—and Isaiah said that the Lord had declared the end from the beginning (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/46.10" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 46:10</a>)—it’s all there when we understand it. And so I think that if Jesus pronounced such judgment upon those who failed to understand the scriptures relating to his first coming, how would he feel toward us and the world if we fail to recognize the value of the words of the holy prophets relating to his second coming? And so I thought I would like to just mention one or two of the things that the prophets have foretold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p8" pid="Mk18toSptEGPvRcPFGtBOA" hash="0wGyDg">First, I think of the words of Peter following the day of Pentecost as he talked to those who had put to death the Christ. He said:</p>

Other churches believe in a reformation, but that is only man’s wisdom. Restitution comes from God the Eternal Father. And so we can’t look forward to the second coming of the Savior without there being a restitution of all things, and that’s the message of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p13" pid="Yhg2c4GJSEquUBDy8fCfbg" hash="Hny0gQ">I would like to refer now to the prophecies of just one of the holy prophets—there isn’t time to discuss more than that—and I choose for the text of my talk today the signs that are to precede his second coming according to the words of Malachi the prophet, the last prophet recorded in the Old Testament.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p14" pid="WlZSfGv9d0aK43zFV9Du6Q" hash="bI3rPw">The Lord, speaking through Malachi, said that he would send his messenger to prepare the way for his coming, and he would come swiftly to his temple. But who could abide the day of his coming, because he would be as refiner’s fire and fullers’ soap? (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.1-2" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:1–2</a>.) Now obviously that had no reference to his first coming. But we are told that when he comes in power and great glory, with all the holy angels, the wicked shall cry out to the rocks: “Fall on us, and hide us [from his presence].” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/6.16" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 6:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p15" pid="mL6hGGtakUuhTl0M_LzZaA" hash="rpmo0A">And you will remember when Jesus told his disciples that the temple should be broken down and that there should not be one stone left upon another. They inquired: “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming [that would be his second coming], and of the end of the world?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.3" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:3</a>.) Jesus told them of the wars, and rumors of wars, and pestilence, and earthquakes, and famines, and that nation should rise against nation, “and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.14" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p16" pid="25gd3rLHZkG0W9ZJST9Egg" hash="lSYoxg">Then he told them that as the days of Noah were, so should be the days of the coming of the Son of Man. They should be eating and drinking and making merry and would say that the Lord delayeth his coming, and then he would come as a thief in the night. And he said there would be two men upon the land; one would be taken and the other would be left. Two women would be grinding at the mill; one would be taken and the other would be left. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.37-41" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:37–41</a>.) All of that was what the Savior said to identify the signs that would precede his second coming.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p17" pid="zQTcAHKM80iczmhIUQlNUw" hash="MVo7kg">Malachi saw the messenger that was to be sent—and incidentally, when the Lord sends a messenger, that messenger can be none other than a prophet. Jesus bore witness of John the Baptist, who was sent as a messenger to prepare the way for his coming in the meridian of time. He said that there was no prophet in Israel greater than John the Baptist. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/7.28" class="scriptureRef">Luke 7:28</a>.) The prophet Amos said: “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>.) How, then, could all things be restored, as Peter said, from all the holy prophets since the world began, unless there was a prophet to receive such restitution? And that prophet was none other than Joseph Smith, who, under the direction, divine guidance, and authority of the Father and the Son, organized this great church—The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p18" pid="JEf2_Po330yKMNU6uRarvA" hash="Bn3PTA">The second thing that Malachi said relating to the preparation for the coming of the Savior in the latter days was that the whole house of Israel had departed from Him, and they wanted to know how. He indicated that it was in the paying of their tithes and offerings. He said: “Ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.” Then he said: “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, … if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.8-10" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:8–10</a>.) What an invitation! The Lord extended to Israel in the latter days, as preparation for his coming, an invitation to return to him in the payment of their tithes and their offerings! Then he went a little further and said that he would rebuke the devourer for their sakes, that their crops should not fall before their time, and that all men should call them blessed. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:11–12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/the-second-coming-of-christ.p19" pid="CZkDuZs0vUiF6HAE50Q9PA" hash="9hjpeA">We are a blessed people. The Lord has blessed us. After our pioneers were driven a thousand miles from civilization and transportation, they landed here in this wilderness. Isaiah saw that the Lord would cause the wilderness to blossom as the rose. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/35.1" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 35:1</a>.) He saw the rivers flow in the desert and flow down from the high places to make this land productive. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/41.18" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 41:18</a>.) And why? So that the Saints, when they were gathered here, could fulfill his promises. For if this gospel that Jesus referred to was to be preached in all the world, it had to be done by his children. And hundreds of thousands of Latter-day Saint missionaries since that time have been all over the world—some 25,000 of them at the present time—to declare the restoration of the gospel as one of the steps in the preparation for the return of the Savior, for he so indicated that it must be preached in all the world.</p>

All of this because the Lord has truly blessed his people. And then the building of holy temples, including those that are now on the drawing boards, which will make, I think, a total of twenty. We are the only temple-building people in this whole world—and if the world were to build them, they wouldn’t know what to do with them!</p>

What a consequence if it were not for his coming, for the Lord said that the whole earth would be utterly wasted. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/2.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 2:3</a>.) Nobody in this world, I am sure, outside of this church, could tell you what the message of Elijah was. We wouldn’t know either, except that Elijah came and appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on the third day of April 1836 in the Kirtland Temple. As a result of that, and of the keys of the dispensation that Elijah brought, we have built all these holy temples. We understand the value of genealogical research, so we have built here in this city a genealogical library and these great vaults out in the mountains, a miracle in and of themselves. There is nothing else like them in the entire world. And all of that has been done to fulfill the mission of Elijah, lest the Lord come and smite the whole earth with a curse.</p>

Having had the privilege of serving as the Presiding Bishop of the Church for fourteen years, and thus, the president of the Aaronic Priesthood, I am thrilled to see all of the boys of the Aaronic Priesthood here tonight, and I imagine that will be true in the other buildings where the priesthood are listening in. We are all thrilled as we go through the Church to find the wonderful attitude that the Saints have toward President Kimball and, particularly, toward the emphasis that he is giving to missionary work. You know that he has indicated that every boy should be a missionary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p2" pid="3VYb2q8hikKLlyfg5e16RA" hash="VRGqbw">I think of when I was a young man, before I was even ordained a deacon, I went to one of our ward meetings in the little country town where I was raised, and two missionaries reported their missions down in the Southern States. In those days they traveled without purse or scrip, and they had to sleep out many nights when they couldn’t get entertainment. I don’t know whether they said anything unusual that night or not; but if they didn’t, the Lord did something unusual for me, because when I left that meeting, I felt like I could have walked to any mission field in the world, if I just had a call. And I went home, went into my little bedroom, and got down on my knees, and asked the Lord to help me to live worthy so that when I was old enough I could go on a mission. And when the train finally left the station here in Salt Lake and I was headed for the little land of Holland, the last thing I said to my loved ones was, “This is the happiest day of my life.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p3" pid="589KVD2hqE6Bhl38kOIsTA" hash="xEJbwg">Before I left on that mission, President Anthon H. Lund, who was then a counselor in the First Presidency of the Church, talked to us missionaries, and he said, among other things, “The people will love you. Now,” he said, “don’t get lifted up in the pride of your hearts and think that they love you because you are better than other people. They will love you because of what you bring to them.” I did not understand that then, but before I left the little land of Holland, where I spent nearly three years, I knew what President Lund meant. I went around saying good-bye to the Saints and the converts who I had brought into the Church, and I shed a thousand tears, as compared to what I shed when I told my loved ones good-bye.</p>

Then I thought I could understand what President Lund meant when he said, “They will love you.”</p>

He stood erect in the uniform of his country. He got down on his knees and took my hand in his and hugged it and kissed it and bathed it with his tears. And then I thought I could understand what President Lund meant when he said, “They will love you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p6" pid="4BMEqA1LPUW_PH061CBO7w" hash="C3CDWA">Now I like a little story that President Grant used to tell about the love that converts have for their missionaries. He told about a couple who came here from one of the Scandinavian countries. They hadn’t been taught much about the gospel. All they knew was that it was true. And so the bishop went to this couple and taught them the law of tithing. They paid their tithing. Then later the bishop went to them and taught them about the fast offering. They paid their fast offering. And then the bishop went to them again to get a donation to help build a ward meetinghouse. They thought that ought to come out of the tithing, but before the bishop got through with them, they paid their donation on the meetinghouse.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p7" pid="fvtln3ekO06wqt9_zoNp_Q" hash="oWravg">Then the bishop went to the father to get his son to go on a mission. Now I can hear President Grant standing here, saying, “That was the straw that broke the camel’s back.” The man said, “He’s our only child. His mother will miss him. We can’t let him go.” Then the bishop countered, “Brother So-and-So, who do you love in this world more than anyone else outside of your own relatives?” And he thought for a few minutes. He said, “I guess I love that young man who came up to the land of the midnight sun and taught me the gospel of Jesus Christ.” Then the bishop countered, “Brother So-and-So, how would you like someone to love your boy just like that?” The man said, “Bishop, you win again; take him. I’ll pay for his mission.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p8" pid="G8rQKtGr6ESz4Zbi_OCPVQ" hash="Z4kZJw">Now you fathers, how would you like someone to love your boys just like that man loved that boy who came up to the land of the midnight sun and taught him the gospel? I heard a missionary up in Oregon giving the report of his mission. He himself was a convert to the Church, and he came down with his fist on the pulpit, and he said, “I wouldn’t take a check tonight for a million dollars for the experience of my mission.” I sat back of him, and I said to myself, “Would you take a million dollars for your first mission in the little land of Holland?” And I began counting the families that I’d been instrumental in bringing into the Church. What kind of a man would I be if I were to sell them out of the Church for a million dollars? I wouldn’t do that for all the money in the world!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p9" pid="1mFV5MjzNUWjo1L1uXd9GA" hash="HtujOA">The other night I sat in my little study in my apartment and began reminiscing, and I counted ten families that I’d been instrumental in bringing into the Church, and I’ve lived long enough to see their sons go on missions. I checked with just one of those families here just a few years back when I had to give a talk at a Brigham Young University banquet for the Indians. At that time there were 153 direct descendants of that one family alone. Thirty-five of them had filled full-term missions, and four had done stake missionary work. If you gave them two years apiece, that would be seventy years of missionary service out of that one family, without counting all the converts that their converts had made. And then one family kept two Indian children in their home—one boy they kept for eight years; he was then in the mission field, and they were paying for his mission. When my companion and I brought that family into the Church, we couldn’t look ahead seventy years and see what would become of them.</p>

They couldn’t give me details, but they said that when their grandfather died, there were 150 direct descendants in the Church at that time, and five of them were serving as bishops.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p14" pid="Pwv4fsjUx0O-M7naK5R-Cg" hash="_kPPaQ">What do you suppose I could have done during those few years of my young manhood that would lay away treasures in heaven like the years I spent over there among those Dutch people? Some of them have already passed on, and I love them almost like my own family. I look forward to being able to meet them again when my time comes to join that innumerable group.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p15" pid="MZ96NvXxJkKpkzpU1ZabAg" hash="MyqJpg">Now I have labored so much with the missionaries. I have been on four missions, and presided over two, and I have toured many missions, and love to hear those young men bear their testimonies. For instance, another young man in Oregon in our testimony meeting said that there wasn’t a company in this world that could pay him a large enough salary to get him to leave his missionary work. And he had been in the armed forces and away from home for several years and then out into the mission field. I had a letter here just last week from a missionary from up in Idaho, and I copied a little paragraph from it. I’d like to read it to you. He said this:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p16" pid="gAPOVY2k0EicJnIiPA8Zwg" hash="hfu4mg">“There is no greater work than that of missionary work. My mission has been the most rewarding undertaking in my entire twenty-seven years of life. My life is dedicated to serving the Lord. My heart is overflowing as are the tears of joy that are now coming from my eyes. There is nothing so wonderful—nothing—as tasting the joy and success of missionary labors.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p17" pid="0ILTOhDtr0C6U-GNvD3oBg" hash="CL9GZw">I had a young missionary come in to visit with me as he returned from the Argentine. I knew his people back in Washington, and he had been kept over to help train some of the other missionaries, until he had been away from home for three years. And I said, “Craig, do you feel like it was a waste of time to be in the mission field, that you ought to have been home getting your education and getting ready to settle down?” He said, “Now listen, bishop, if the Brethren want to make me happy, just let them load me on the plane in the morning and let them send me back to the Argentine.” You can’t put that kind of feeling in the hearts of young people with money. The Lord who creates the feelings of the human breast is the only one who can put that kind of faith into the hearts of his people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-joy-of-serving-a-mission.p18" pid="0eYNnMGSsU-_op-Zw4dLdw" hash="jNMMZw">Brethren, after all the missionary service I have had, I wouldn’t want to raise a boy and not have him go on a mission, for <span class="emphasis">his</span> good and because I think we owe it to the world to share with them the truths of the gospel. And one way to make sure that your boys will go on missions is to start a missionary fund for them and let them keep adding to it, and they will be on their missions from the time that they are young boys. For instance, down in California I went to a ward, and the bishop has a program of giving to each boy when he’s ordained a deacon fifteen dollars out of the missionary fund. Then they ask the father to match it, and then every time the boy is interviewed—for instance, when he’s ordained a teacher—they check on his missionary fund. I figured, on a percentage basis, if every ward in the Church had as many missionaries in the field as that ward, we would have 55,500 missionaries. So I provided in my family that every male child who has not been on a mission has a missionary fund so he will know that he is on his mission from the time he is a boy.</p>

Amen.</p>

The President asked the Prophet what difference there was between the Prophet’s church and the other churches of the world. The Prophet answered: “We have the correct mode of baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.” Then he said: “We considered that all other considerations were contained in the gift of the Holy Ghost” (see <span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:42).</p>

You take them away, and the plants would die. You take the Holy Ghost out of this Church, and this Church would not be any different than any other church. And it is manifest in so many ways in the lives and the devotion of the members of the Church.</p>

You take the General Authorities here on the stand. When they were called to be General Authorities, there was nothing said to them about whether they would receive an allowance to live on. I remember when I was back in Washington, just after President Benson was called to be a member of the Twelve and he had not yet been out West to be ordained and set apart. I was then the Presiding Bishop and attended his stake conference. And he said: “Bishop, will there be any provision that we will have a living while we are serving as General Authorities of the Church?” And I said: “Well, there will be a little allowance. But,” I said, “you will have to live differently than you have done back here unless you have got a little bit tucked away!” I happen to know of an offer that was made to him while he was in the Department of Agriculture that, in those days, was a tremendous offer; and he passed that by to come back here to be a member of the Quorum without any assurance that he would have an allowance given to him.</p>

President McKay told us that he was in line to become the prime minister of Canada and that he was at the head of several great industrial organizations in Canada. I am sure that if he were to stand here now, he would tell you that when President McKay asked him to be one of the General Authorities, he did not discuss with him anything about an allowance that he would receive.</p>

Because they had received the gift of the Holy Ghost that made it possible for them to do what Jesus advised: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.33" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:33</a>).</p>

He was then at the head of a large insurance business that he owned and operated. And when President George Albert Smith asked him if he was willing to serve as my counselor, he said: “Yes, but I would like to go back East and arrange with my company to appoint a manager, because you know in the insurance business so much depends on renewals. But,” he said, “if they won’t let me do it, I’ll tell them to take the business.” I happen to know that the tithing he had been paying was just about the equivalent of what his allowance was when he became a counselor in the Bishopric! And not only that, for the first six months after he received his allowance, he turned it back to the Church. He said: “I’ve never been on a mission, so it is about time I did something.”</p>

For instance, I had a business with ten men and two girls working for me, and the President of the Church sent my father over to see how I would like to go to California and preside over the Hollywood Stake. I won’t take time to tell you all the details. In sixty days I’d sold my business, I’d sold my beautiful home, and moved my family down to California with no allowance to live on. I had to start all over again.</p>

Grant called for a thousand short-term missionaries, he said: “Bishops and stake presidents are not exempt.” I was then a bishop. I landed back in New England—left my wife and seven kiddies and my business in the hands of my brother-in-law. You don’t do things like that with normal men! It takes men inspired by the Holy Spirit.</p>

You don’t pay them; you make them pay their way to their field of labor, maintain themselves while they are there, and all the Church does for them is to pay their return fare when they come back.” He said: “Now in our church, we have a missionary fund. But,” he said, “we offer to pay our men to the field of labor, to maintain them while they are there, and then to return them after they are released—and we can’t get anybody to go!”</p>

No wonder Peter said: “Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people [we are peculiar to the world]; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 2:9</a>).</p>

Then when Jesus was taken prisoner and Peter sat in the outer room, two different women came up to him and said: “Thou also wast with Jesus” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.69" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:69</a>); and he denied it emphatically. Then a man came, and he even denied it with curses. And when he was through, he heard the cock crow, “and he went out and wept” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.75" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:75</a>).

We were told that in our meeting Friday with the Regional Representatives of the Twelve. Brother Hinckley told us at our last conference to read the Book of Mormon, and he has had over a thousand letters back from Saints, advising that they have read it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p2" pid="smQgCpFKwke84bE4GTtlBg" hash="ynLngQ">The Savior of the world advised us to read the scriptures. He said: “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.39" class="scriptureRef">John 5:39</a>). Is there anything worth seeking more than eternal life?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p3" pid="_EPjhLsTxE2AGVKAaYbr-A" hash="WMXjnw">As I read the scriptures—and I have read the Book of Mormon during the past six months and most of the Bible—I always find something therein that I did not remember was there when I read it before. And I would like to use as a sort of a text for what I say here today a verse that I took from the book of Nahum, chapter 2, in the Bible, which reads as follows: “The chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p4" pid="X5Xe4Of38EGcpgK_mvhdcg" hash="05b8kA">“The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/nahum/2.3-4" class="scriptureRef">Nahum 2:3–4</a>).</p>

Certainly they travel like the lightning, and they look like torches—especially in the evening when the lights are on—and they jostle against each other. If you want a demonstration of that, just go to one of the body repair shops and see how many of them come in all bruised!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p6" pid="CY6HEKPsOU6SWbpTDdOKEQ" hash="Owqc2w">The thing that I liked about that particular passage of scripture is that it describes the day of the Lord’s preparation. We live in that day. Five hundred years ago this prophecy could not have come true, but today there is no other answer for that prophecy than an automobile. The importance of the prophecy is that it describes the day of his preparation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p7" pid="XU0VGDM2kEGZ5cli_lMBWg" hash="m5dgYg">I like to think of the many passages of scripture that designate the time of his preparation. I quote you from the book of Malachi, where the Lord, speaking through Malachi, said that he would send his messenger to prepare the way for his coming. And he would come swiftly to his temple, and who could abide the day of his coming, because he would be as refiner’s fire and fullers’ soap (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.1-2" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:1–2</a>). Now, obviously that had no reference to his first coming. He did not come swiftly to his temple at that time. He did not come cleansing and purifying as refiner’s fire and fullers’ soap. We are told that when he comes in the latter days, the wicked will cry out to the rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from his presence” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/6.16" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 6:16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p8" pid="mqJ8HOtrLEm7CQVPqn1Jmg" hash="76SF3Q">When the Lord sends a messenger to prepare the way for his coming, that messenger can be none other than a prophet. When the Savior came in the meridian of time, John the Baptist was sent to prepare the way for his coming, and Jesus testified of him that there was no greater prophet in Israel (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/7.28" class="scriptureRef">Luke 7:28</a>). And the prophet Amos tells us: “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p9" pid="puy5IpzdakK-FHcjGdJ7ig" hash="9E9OcA">Therefore, when the time of preparation comes, as I have read to you here today, the Lord could not prepare for his coming without a prophet. And the prophet of this dispensation was none other than the Prophet Joseph Smith. And what he has brought forth is a fulfillment of so many of the prophecies of holy scripture that cannot be found anywhere else in all this world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p10" pid="2Ef77_-8Oki4nfbxUlrFyQ" hash="IxM6aA">I like the statement of Peter of old, following the day of Pentecost, when he talked to those who had put to death the Christ. He said the heavens were to receive the Christ until “the times of restitution of all things … spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.20-21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:20–21</a>). Search this world over and you cannot find a church that claims a restitution of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets except The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We believe Peter was a prophet; and if the world does, then they cannot look for the Savior’s second coming until there is such a restitution of all things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p11" pid="_XHuyfNxQUC2Q0w5oL1lcw" hash="GaQ4Cw">There is not time to discuss that restitution today, but just think of the coming of the Father and the Son to teach the real personality of the Godhead; the coming of Moroni with the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated; the coming of John the Baptist (as Brother Monson testified this morning) with the Aaronic priesthood, the power to baptize by immersion for the remission of sins; the coming of Peter, James, and John who held the keys of the holy apostleship, with power to organize the church and kingdom of God in the earth for the last time, in fulfillment of the promise made by Daniel in his interpretation of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.</p>

Then Daniel told him about the rise and fall of the kingdoms of this world until the latter days, when the God of heaven would set up a kingdom that should never be destroyed or given to another people. But like a little stone cut out of the mountains without hands, it would roll forth until it should become as a great mountain and fill the whole earth (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/2.44-45" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 2:44–45</a>).</p>

A voice from heaven said: “Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/4.1" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 4:1</a>). This was thirty years after the death of the Savior. And the angel showed John the power that would be given to the evil one, the devil, to make war with the Saints (and the Saints were the followers of Jesus) and to overcome them and to reign over all kindreds, tongues, and nations (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/13.7" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 13:7</a>). That is one of the positive declarations in the holy scriptures of a complete apostasy from the church that Jesus established. But the angel did not leave it there. He then showed John another angel flying in the midst of heaven, “having the everlasting gospel [and that is the only gospel that can save men] to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/14.6" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 14:6</a>).</p>

This is the restitution of all things that Peter had in mind when he said that the heavens were to receive the Christ “until the restitution of all things … spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began.” And then the angel showed him an angel bringing the everlasting gospel to be preached to every nation, “saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/14.7" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 14:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p24" pid="dCafklemhk26SWM_6YoVMQ" hash="ZihoMg">We live in the day of his judgments. In the period of my lifetime there have been more judgments and destructions and wars and contentions in this world than in all the history of the world combined before that time. This is the time of the judgments that the angel saw, when that everlasting gospel should be restored. And then he adds: “Worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/14.7" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 14:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p25" pid="w2yP5MZ9ckymE-AcfRPR8w" hash="bcnFSg">When Joseph Smith had his marvelous vision and saw the Father and the Son, there was not a church in this world that worshipped the God that made the heavens and the earth and the sea and the fountains of water. They worshipped an essence everywhere present, a god without body, parts, or passions. And if he has no body, that means he has no eyes—he cannot see; he has no ears—he cannot hear; he has no voice—he cannot speak. What is there left to worship when you take all of those qualities away? And then think of the two glorious personages who appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith in a pillar of light brighter than anything in this world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p26" pid="hGjmxBk3Jk-61p4zj3WDpA" hash="lBHtuQ">Now there are many more wonderful things that the holy prophets were permitted to see with respect to this preparation for his coming in the day when the chariots should jostle against each other, when their lights should be like torches, and when they should travel like the lightning, but that is as far as my time permits. I love this work. I know it is true. There is no one else—no other people in the world—that have fulfilled the words of the prophets as has the restoration of the gospel in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-scriptures-speak.p27" pid="4ce4nJzf6064SfIrGGmlsA" hash="QJP8Ww">I pray God to bless you all, and bear you my witness of the divinity of this work, in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

My testimony of the divinity of this Church is that treasure dearer to me than life itself, and I have given it away to many, many people whose lives have been enriched by virtue of the same.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p2" pid="2TvQE5I5jEKVkgEKBwJ-wg" hash="XeMrxA">I have had the privilege of bearing testimony in ninety-eight general conferences of the Church from this pulpit and I have written a book that is being used almost all over the world containing my testimony, and that testimony I obtained in my youth through the Holy Ghost whom I received by the laying on of hands by those who had authority to convey it upon me. And it made such an impression upon me as a boy that it has been a guiding star to me all my life, and I could hardly wait until I was old enough to go on a mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p3" pid="awwqpSC4O06EP8gYnzE-Qw" hash="1anbBQ">When I went on my first mission back in 1905, my cousin and I traveled together to Liverpool; he was sent up into Norway and I was sent to Holland. After we had been in the mission field a few months, I received a letter from him, addressing me by name, and he said: “I met a man the other day who knows more about religion than I ever dreamed of. I told him that if he had something better than I had, I would join his church.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p4" pid="o8Tm9kZjIkWXmLYaIPvuEg" hash="U8PlWQ">I wrote him back, addressing him by name, and I said: “You told him just the right thing. If he has something better than you have, you ought to join his church.” Then I quoted some of the experiences that Brother Fyans related to us this morning. I said: “Does he have something better than a personal visitation of God the Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, in a pillar of light, after centuries of spiritual darkness, to open the dispensation of the fulness of times and to reveal the true personality of the Godhead—that they are glorified personages?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p5" pid="-ECxVjk2_k-EXTe0-0ziOQ" hash="VgCPjA">I said: “Does he have something better than the coming of Moroni with the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated? Does he have something better than the coming of John the Baptist with the Aaronic Priesthood, the power and authority to baptize by immersion for the remission of sins? Does he have something better than the coming of Peter, James, and John—Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ—with the holy Melchizedek Priesthood, the holy Apostleship, the authority to organize the church and kingdom of God for the last time to prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man and to convey the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p6" pid="Z10Wo2HVhU-BUGVAyZ8tbw" hash="uiJC6g">“Does he have something better than the coming of Moses with the keys of the latter-day gathering of Israel that has brought us here into these valleys of the mountains? Does he have something better than the coming of Elijah of whose coming Malachi bore testimony that if it were not for his coming, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming? Think of the consequences. Now,” I said, “if he has something better than that, you join his church.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p8" pid="jg7ZzJpxv0-c_f30MrHd7A" hash="4Ondjw">I like the words of the Apostle Peter.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p15" pid="2Q3SCDbOg02slHD2q656lQ" hash="jipglg">No man can believe that Peter was a prophet of the living God and look for the coming of the Lord except there be a restitution of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began. And a restitution is not a reformation. All the churches of the world today have attempted to correct the mistakes of history until there are hundreds of churches because they can’t agree. And if they had the truth, they would all be alike; and so there had to be a restitution. That means that those holy prophets had to come back to this earth, and that is what you have been told here in this conference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p16" pid="8C1yE5CswUGKk_Cqvi83QA" hash="VtHxbg">And if they came back to this earth, they had to come to somebody, and that somebody could be none other than a prophet of God. Like Amos said, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>). And that prophet was Joseph Smith.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p18" pid="eaJp-VAMZEmiqtMfhtQ8rw" hash="b2SzBA">I like the prophecies of the scriptures. Jesus walked along the way toward Emmaus with two of his disciples following his resurrection, and when he heard what they had to say regarding him and his crucifixion, he knew that they did not understand and comprehend what the prophets had said; so he said, “O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.25" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:25</a>), and commencing with Moses and the prophets, He showed them how that in all things the prophets had testified of him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p19" pid="ZIHDFkttnEKHqtbkmxXBBw" hash="ws5eJA">I love the prophecies of Isaiah. It seems to me that he almost lived more in our day than when he was actually upon the earth. He saw so much of what would transpire in our day. He saw us settled here in these valleys of the mountains. He saw this desert, where we were once a thousand miles from transportation and supplies, made to blossom as a rose (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/35.1" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 35:1</a>). He saw the rivers flow in the desert where we have built these great irrigation canals (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/43.19" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 43:19</a>). He saw the water flow down from the high places where we have reservoired it in these mountain fastnesses for summer’s use (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/41.18" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 41:18</a>). He saw the redeemed of the Lord come up and sing in the heights of Zion (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/51.11" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 51:11</a>). And where do you find anything in the world to fulfill that like the singing of the Tabernacle Choir for over fifty years without a break?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p20" pid="VtnnLzeu3EWgGrnB6DjL4Q" hash="x6cPEQ">He saw the mountain of the Lord’s house established in the top of the mountains in the latter days when all nations would flow unto it, and they would say, “Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/2.3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 2:3</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p26" pid="DlnB3Bmvk0GE3tL--8EQ7A" hash="vrYM4A">He said that he would send for many fishers and many hunters and they would fish them and hunt them from the hills and the mountains and the holes in the rocks (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/16.16" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 16:16</a>). They are the thirty-one thousand Mormon missionaries scattered all over the world gathering in the seed of Israel and bringing them to Zion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p27" pid="fgzLcqEbskmEGqS-y4EWEQ" hash="a31v-A">He saw how they would be gathered one of a city and two of a family, and the Lord would bring them to Zion, and he would give them pastors after his own heart who should feed them with knowledge and with understanding (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/3.14-15" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 3:14–15</a>). Could anybody sit through sessions of this conference and listen to these prophets of the living God and not realize that Jeremiah saw this day when we would come here, gathered one of a city and two of a family, and that He would give us pastors after His own heart?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p28" pid="iSEV7jof1UmlNB-S3M8ERA" hash="vM-0RA">I love the prophecies of Isaiah. I like the twenty-ninth chapter where he said: “Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p29" pid="iK-cFHZ84UyeQMz84CJ6Mw" hash="RKpokA">“Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.13-14" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:13–14</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p31" pid="Nvhg1crMhEi28pWyZNNDzw" hash="q6lC6Q">And then Isaiah in that very same twenty-ninth chapter starts out like this: He said, “Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt [that was Jerusalem—that is where David dwelt]! add ye year to year [meaning coming generations]; let them kill sacrifices. And it shall be camped about and it shall be unto me as Ariel” (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.1-3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:1–3</a>). In other words, not only did Isaiah see the destruction of the great city of Jerusalem, but he also saw the destruction of another great center here in America eleven hundred years after he made that prophecy. We read of that destruction in 2 Nephi 26 and 27, [<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.title" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26–27</a>] just like when he described the destruction of Babylon a hundred and seventy years before it was destroyed when he said it should never be rebuilt (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/50.9-13" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 50:9–13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/a-testimony.p32" pid="ZHxRpIG0V06zAQ-Tcd-ybQ" hash="l0RRPw">Now he said in that chapter that the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. There are so many things that have transpired in this day that the wise men of this world cannot understand. I haven’t time here today to enumerate any more to you, but my heart is full of gratitude to my Heavenly Father and full of testimony by the Holy Spirit of the divinity of this work, and I bear that testimony to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/call-of-the-prophets.p1" pid="eePHnSqPQEy8kNIrDFkhwA" hash="AOnbrw">I have had the privilege of filling four missions for this church and that has provided me an opportunity to compare the teachings of this church, as we have received them through the restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith, with the teachings of many other churches. My, how grateful I am to be a member of this church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/call-of-the-prophets.p2" pid="Q2ECVykQfkePASMkm_Rs0A" hash="ZTRQew">Now, just to mention one or two teachings. Just think what we learn from the visit of the Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph—a realization that the Father and the Son are two separate individuals and that they are real personages like Jesus was when he came forth from the tomb. There wasn’t a church in the world that believed in that kind of God at the time the Prophet Joseph received that wonderful vision.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/call-of-the-prophets.p3" pid="GNn97dHEe0KxiePAM-D2GA" hash="Hq7TpQ">Then we learn that marriage can be eternal, that this is the plan of the Lord. How grateful I am for this principle, because it gives me the assurance that someday I will be reunited with that sweet companion of mine who has already preceded me into the eternal worlds. As I have said before, I would just as soon believe that death was a complete annihilation of both body and spirit as to think that I had to live on throughout the eternities that are to come without a continuation of the love ties that bind me and my wife together with the wonderful family that the Lord has given to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/call-of-the-prophets.p4" pid="MGQ3OT146kmTEC94dy-8rQ" hash="9iQyaw">One of the other great truths that we learn through the Restoration is the fact that infants should not be baptized. The idea that young children need baptism is a mistake of men. That isn’t to be found anywhere in the Lord’s teachings, for Jesus took little children in his arms and blessed them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/call-of-the-prophets.p5" pid="-X6aM2-amUGcPSxSFdllzQ" hash="sGKusQ">When I have discussed some of our beautiful philosophies with people of other churches, many of them have said, “We could accept your teachings, but we can’t believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet.” I have thought a lot about that. I suppose that it would be almost impossible to believe that God was naive enough to choose a fourteen-year-old boy to usher in the dispensation of the fulness of times, as Paul said, in which dispensation he would “gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 1:10</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/call-of-the-prophets.p7" pid="Kw4n-xTeMU20NsCLvwV8UA" hash="AcXt5w">The Apostle Paul said that the Lord “hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/17.26" class="scriptureRef">Acts 17:26</a>.) And he said: “We have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.9" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:9</a>.) I like the thought that he is my father. When Jesus prayed, he didn’t pray, “<span class="emphasis">My</span> Father which art in heaven”; he prayed, “<span class="emphasis">Our</span> Father which art in heaven” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:9</a>), and that is a wonderful thing. That is why our Primary children sing “I am a child of God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/call-of-the-prophets.p8" pid="lWALFqHyfE2ORg9whYKdiQ" hash="VO64dQ">The Lord has his own way of calling prophets. He knew them before they were ever born here in mortality. We read in the Book of Abraham that the Lord stood in the midst of the spirits, and among them there were noble and great ones—and they couldn’t be noble and great if they hadn’t done something to make them noble and great. The Lord said of them: “These I will make my rulers; … Abraham, thou art one of them; thou was chosen before thou wast born.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.22-23" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:22–23</a>.)

He couldn’t understand it, and the Lord said: “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/1.5" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 1:5</a>.) The Lord couldn’t have ordained him if he didn’t exist, and he wouldn’t have ordained him before he was born if he hadn’t done something in that spiritual life to prepare him to become one of the Lord’s mouthpieces here upon this earth. The same thing is true with the Prophet Joseph. I will come back to that.</p>

And that is what he has been doing. He drew a third of the host of heaven with him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/12.4" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 12:4</a>), and when they were cast out, that third of the host of heaven brought with them the knowledge that they had in the spirit world, while our knowledge was temporarily taken from us through our birth into mortality.</p>

When Moses was born, the devil put it into the heart of Pharaoh to have all the male children in Israel put to death.

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.6-9" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 3:6–9</a>.) And we are told in holy writ that there was no prophet in Israel like unto Moses because he walked and talked with God. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/34.10" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 34:10</a>.) This is the kind of prophet that, three thousand years before Joseph Smith was born, the Lord promised Joseph of Egypt He would raise up through his loins. He said his name should be Joseph, and his father’s name should be Joseph; and he said: “Unto him will I give power to bring forth my word.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.11,15" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 3:11, 15</a>.)</p>

What did he mean by that? That in the midst of these hundreds of churches of men—the result of men’s interpretations of the scriptures because they can’t agree, and these churches keep multiplying—that the Lord would give to this new prophet the ability to comprehend the scriptures that had already been sent forth among them.</p>

Then he adds, “And I will make him great in mine eyes.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.8" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 3:8</a>.)

They gave me an hour and a half to discuss universal salvation, which includes our work for the dead, preaching in the spirit world, and baptism of the living for the dead. I just gave them chapter and verse and let them read the passages in their own Bibles. Then when I was through, I closed my Bible and waited for comments.</p>

The angel of the Lord showed John many wonderful things. He showed him the coming of a new heaven and a new earth when there would be no more sickness and no more pain, no more sorrow and no more death; when we would no more need the sun by day nor the moon by night, for the glory of God would be upon the earth; when no man would say, “know ye the Lord,” for every man would walk in the light of the Lord his God. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/21.1,4,23-24" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 21:1, 4, 23–24</a>.)</p>

And the angel said, “See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/22.8-9" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 22:8–9</a>.)</p>

Death and hell delivered up the dead that were in them. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/20.12-13" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 20:12–13</a>.) Then the angel said, “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God … and shall reign with him a thousand years.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/20.6" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 20:6</a>.)

He said, “But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/20.5" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 20:5</a>.) Is there any clear thinking man who would want to gamble on being left in his grave a thousand years when the Son of Man shall come in the clouds of heaven with all the holy angels, and those who have died in him shall be brought forth from the grave, and those who are living in him shall be caught up in the air and changed in the twinkling of an eye? I like the statement of the philosopher Cicero. He said he was much more interested in the long hereafter than he was in the brief present.</p>

If it is worth spending twelve to twenty years to prepare for a life of seventy-five to a hundred years, what is it worth to prepare for a life that never ends?</p>

He said, “When you cut it, there is a beginning and there is an end, but as long as you don’t cut it, there is no beginning and there is no end.”) Then I said, “Now, Mother, if you believe that, you and I ought to be pretty well acquainted with each other in thirty-five million years from today.”</p>

You remember the parable about the man who went on a far journey and gave to his servants his talents. To one he gave five; and to another two; and to another one. And after a time he returned to hold an accounting with those servants. And the one who had been given five talents said, “Lord, thou deliverest unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.” And he gave him the ten talents. And the Master said: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou has been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.” (Wouldn’t that be wonderful, to be made a ruler over many things?) “Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.20-21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:20–21</a>.)</p>

You remember that five of them took oil in their lamps, and five of them had no oil. When the call came, “The bridegroom cometh,” the five with oil went to meet him; the others wanted to borrow, but there was not enough to share, so they went to purchase oil. The ones with oil went into the wedding feast; and the others, when they returned, found the doors were already closed. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.1-13" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:1–13</a>.)

And the cry went out: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth … for the devil is come down unto you,” and he “walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/12.12" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 12:12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/5.8" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 5:8</a>.) And so the fact that I kept my first estate entitled me to all the beauties and the joys of this world that have been mentioned here in this meeting today. And it gave me the right to have this body—and maybe I can’t appreciate as much what that ought to mean to me as I do by reading the scriptures.</p>

And he asked his name, and he said: “Legion,” because legions had entered into the man. And so eager were those devils to get a body that they asked permission to take possession of the bodies of the swine that were feeding in the field. And Jesus permitted it, and they ran off into the sea and were drowned, as I remember about two thousand of them. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/5.1-17" class="scriptureRef">Mark 5:1–17</a>.) Just think how eager those spirits were to get a body, and because we kept our first estate we are now in our second estate.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.5" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:5</a>.) I think by the keeping of His commandments—doing all things, as the Lord said, that the Lord God had commanded (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/12.32" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 12:32</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.20" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:20</a>)—that we can get an assurance that comes through the Holy Spirit that our labors are acceptable to the Lord and that we have pleased him.</p>

This principle of eternal marriage—I just can’t imagine living on forever and forever after I pass out of this life without the companionship of my sweet wife and my children.

I feel that that is nearer to becoming a god than anything else I can do here in mortality. And from the days of my youth and young manhood, I have tried to live before those children and descendants of mine so that if they walked in my footsteps they would be honoring their second estate and preparing themselves to have glory added upon their heads forever and forever.</p>

When I first became a missionary, I never met anybody who believed in a personal God. My, what a joy to realize that Christ gave his life for us, and took upon him the sins of the world—as Paul said: “As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:22</a>)—and to know that his Father is as real as my father, and that they have revealed themselves as two glorified personages in this dispensation, after centuries of darkness, unto the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Lord had him in waiting thousands of years ago, according to the Book of Mormon, for his day and time to come, to bring men to a knowledge of the truth and to bring forth his truth among the people of this world. These are great truths, and many more can be taught.</p>

The message of this great church is that marvelous work and a wonder that Isaiah saw would come forth when men would teach for doctrine the precepts of men.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p21" pid="it0vhLLUXESwIuEPVxZfNA" hash="qOyC5w">As I finished my first mission over in Amsterdam, over seventy-five years ago, I was invited into the home of one of the Saints to talk to her neighbor. When my companion and I arrived, the neighbor was there but she had her minister with her. We had a little difference of opinion on priesthood, and right there he challenged me to a debate in his church the next Saturday night.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p22" pid="VNs5mWzT4U2do-osIZMppQ" hash="BgL32Q">When we arrived, the church was full; all of his people were there, and all of our people. How our people found it out, I don’t know; I didn’t tell them!</p>

Is that agreeable with you, Mr. Richards?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p24" pid="N0yPNSfteEi8yOjPrv8FcA" hash="7ZEF2g">I said, “Very much.” I didn’t tell him, but I would have given him the shirt off my back for the privilege of opening that debate, and he just handed it to me on a silver platter! I didn’t know whether the Lord had anything to do with it or not, but I thought He did!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p25" pid="m-fWDY1GFkOLEswh_aSkWQ" hash="d1ie4w">Then I stood up and I said, “The last time I talked with my friend, we had a difference of opinion on priesthood. Tonight I have come prepared to discuss that subject, but I don’t propose to start at that point. (This was one of my strong points in my mission.) If you are going to build a house, you don’t try to put a roof on it before you get the foundation in.” They agreed with that, so I said, “I propose to lay the foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ,” and I chose for my text the sixth chapter of Hebrews where Paul said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p26" pid="UlARS29gtEW131dnZwqiug" hash="tem3Nw">“Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</p>

And they didn’t believe that. I never found a church that did believe it outside of our Church—they think the Holy Ghost comes just like the breezes that blow over the head. I quoted them the passage saying that when the Apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God through the preaching of Philip, they sent Peter and John. And when they came, they prayed for them, they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost. And when Simon the sorcerer saw that the Holy Ghost was conveyed by the laying on of the Apostles’ hands, he offered them money, saying: “Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p32" pid="x3Qn9ZOLuUGToJZpjNAUag" hash="Qac8mw">The minister stood up and talked for twenty minutes, and he never once mentioned a word I had said. He started on the Mountain Meadows Massacre and the “Mormon Bible,” and stated that Joseph Smith had admitted he had made many mistakes; and then in a most courteous manner, he said: “Now if Mr. Richards will enlighten us on these matters, I am sure this audience will be most appreciative.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p33" pid="iEBTCoHl-0SDunDSfh6AMg" hash="9SEDCQ">I was on my feet just like that. (My companion later said, “How did you think so fast?” I said, “What have you been praying for all week?”) I said, “In the days of the Savior, his enemies tried to trick him with cunning and craftiness. I don’t suppose there’s anybody here tonight that would like to see us resort to those old tactics.” I said, “If I understand a debate, it is the presentation of argument and the answering of those presentations. Has this man answered any of my arguments?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p34" pid="ImhShd55TEun-SFUCHOQtw" hash="uvAxzA">Everybody said, “No.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p37" pid="P4IbyMRWI0aONt5kk9ssLQ" hash="SxKOXQ">But he couldn’t do it, and I said to my companion, “Stand up and give me my coat and hat.” I said, “One more chance. I am willing to remain here until ten o’clock tomorrow morning, when we have to be in our own church, provided this debate can go forward on the basis that you set it up. If not, I am going to leave and ask my companion to leave and ask our members to leave, and we will leave it with you to settle with your people for what has transpired here tonight.”</p>

Now that is what Isaiah meant when he said they would teach for doctrines the precepts of men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p39" pid="dwr2ZA2tGEeTt8xX4OgvGw" hash="vj_uqg">Now I will give you one more. Down in Quitman, Georgia, while I was a mission president, I preached a sermon on the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. I had a chart there that listed the churches and what their beliefs were on major things, and those were official statements from the leaders of those different churches. And not one of them believed that the family unit or the marriage covenant would endure beyond the grave. I stood at the door when the meeting was over and a man came up and introduced himself as a Baptist minister, and I said, “Did I misquote you here tonight?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p40" pid="hk5Q1L3jx0qfPmMw2AWbVg" hash="n4tbXA">He said, “No, Mr. Richards, it’s just like you say. We don’t all believe all the things our churches teach.”</p>

Why don’t you go back and teach your people the truth? They will take it from you; they are not ready to take it from the Mormon elders yet.”</p>

As we shook hands I said, “I would certainly be happy to know what you thought of my last sermon here.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p44" pid="109GIUaZKEqXO1n4vtbA3g" hash="QV-nxQ">He said, “Mr. Richards, I have been thinking about it ever since, and I believe every word you said, only I would like to have heard the rest.” (We never get talked out; that’s why I’ve asked Brother Benson to tap me on the leg when my time is up!)</p>

Over in Utrecht, Holland, they had a seminary where they trained ministers, and the young men who were studying for the ministry used to come and stand outside our meetings and listen. And then when the meeting was over, they would come in and argue with us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p46" pid="oAo-wyThxEOTWNzT_VSJsQ" hash="ai4M8Q">I convinced one of those young men that baptism was to be by immersion for the remission of sins, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost—he hadn’t been taught that and he didn’t believe it. He said: “Mr. Richards, do you think the Lord will hold us responsible if we teach things that we know are not in full accord with the Holy Scriptures?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/what-the-gospel-teaches.p47" pid="geGxSU5TGEqsWbc34AqXhw" hash="oTRfhg">I said, “My friend, I’d rather let the Apostle Paul answer that question. He said, ‘Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.’ (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/1.8" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 1:8</a>.)” We didn’t have any more arguments then.</p>
