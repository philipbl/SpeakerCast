This statement might have startled Peter. Certainly it pricked him, for he said, “Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.” Then the Lord told Peter that “the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.32-34" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:32–34</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p2" guid="91065517-7dbc-4c17-a5ce-109748f7c270" pid="v9GxIOWockq7IeOvtGwwcw" hash="0zyTWg">Mark records that Peter’s vehement declaration of devotion was echoed by the remainder of the apostles in these words: “Likewise also said they all.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/14.31" class="scriptureRef">Mark 14:31</a>.) Yet when the moment came and a maid accused Peter of being a disciple, he denied the acquaintance. The remaining ten, likewise, despite their own declarations, did not do as they had declared they would do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p3" guid="b1a3b95c-6125-449b-aa9a-b41c2f332813" pid="mPTurJHzckKYEzS3JLiBVg" hash="MtJiow">Peter had been in the whole service of the Lord for three years. He had seen but did not seem to realize what the Lord meant by “when thou art converted.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p4" guid="926fe87e-ff2b-473d-b6eb-8d0b8c0dc43e" pid="JHXrzt7h8kCdaEeZKE6pVQ" hash="5Ep6KA">From now on things were to be different. There would be a crucifixion, one of the most painful methods of execution ever devised by men and one which also tore at the vital emotions of any who witnessed such a death. There would be a resurrection—the first ever to occur on this earth—and from it a resurgence of joy and hope. The Lord would depart. He would leave his work in the hands of the eleven who had been constantly with him—men who had listened for three years to him, had not quite understood what he meant, had seen him executed, and had touched with their hands his risen body, and even yet they would not know what it was to be converted until the Holy Ghost visited them and touched their souls with living fire.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p5" guid="e4d15532-a3cc-425a-b92d-7969af0336c2" pid="mMiKrn7BXU-cgT3D2-38-A" hash="QreA4w">We see what it means to be converted in the inspired acts of Peter on the day of Pentecost, as compared to his wavering denials on the night of the arrest of the Lord. The man who stood forth on Pentecost was not the same man who had fearfully protested he “knew not the man.” The Paul who after his baptism and reception of the Holy Ghost boldly declared the truth to Agrippa was a completely changed man from the man who was going toward Damascus, seeking out Christians to destroy them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p6" guid="16ca7aaa-c159-41ca-84b3-2a19bf815640" pid="Sge_rGU3-UumlICbs_8sKA" hash="ty9WUQ">Peter believed and denied. Peter was converted and became a rock against which the power of Satan was impotent. He became determined, fearless, pushed by an inward power strong and true. Paul persecuted because of disbelief, thinking that he did God’s service. Paul was converted and became like Peter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p7" guid="b39633aa-7a8b-4485-ac04-51e7ff0ef103" pid="kGvYN9-1-kCvWArP9D_PtA" hash="93QIYg">Conversion brings strength, determination to defend the work of the Lord on earth and to expand it. This conversion comes when one receives the baptism of fire, the witness of the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p8" guid="1bff8164-a627-482b-8b84-5de65c0971c2" pid="SYqf_1kYKEqT1SIRzItYhA" hash="JzNndw">And now the keys of it all, given to Peter before, would have for him their true meaning. From now he would bear the burden, the full responsibility, to carry forth the work of the Lord to all the world. He would have to direct the others of the Twelve and the work of the ministry both to the gentiles and in the organized branches.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p9" guid="5f5ec88b-4665-4577-92f4-8c871ed498dd" pid="4O1lUKdaekS7U1yeS-waQg" hash="qldDgg">All eleven had been given the Comforter—which up until now they had not yet experienced—by which they were to teach all things, by which all things would be revealed, and without which they should not teach. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p10" guid="9e4fb24d-3916-43df-b0b1-b0f3440778bb" pid="hwfxkwUrWkGcKYgU8bWRyw" hash="xV31pA">The burden of teaching the world was theirs! What did they know about the world? its extent? its bounds? They knew of Rome, but only in name. They had heard of Athens and Alexandria. They had better knowledge of Damascus and Tyre, of Ephesus and Sidon. But surely the world of India or of China or of Indonesia, the immensity of the African continent or even of Europe were not even imagined. They knew Ethiopia by legend. By and large “the world” was nebulous in their minds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p11" guid="2cb50fb3-282b-42ee-8e37-6260f6d770e9" pid="u9k_RJu1Skm1evZ3zZsk-g" hash="wcsRNA">Yet bravely they set forth. The Spirit whispered, and each one, newly attuned, felt to go to a place, be it Athens, Ephesus, or Rome. From there the whispering directed each one to still another place. And to another—until they must have encompassed most of the known world of their day. We know of Paul’s travels because someone wrote of them and because fourteen of his letters have been preserved. But where the others went is mostly tradition.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p12" guid="da1afbf6-be99-4448-b6c4-14f3f4910fff" pid="xZ5cuzkoVEecFBmRKUBVWg" hash="2r6D0w">Today things are different. These are the last days. Today we know the field. We know the location of every nation on earth. We know the means by which we may reach each land. We know what to expect from climate and from other natural forces, and we have the means to go to each place.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p13" guid="42136a04-a548-4533-9b4d-40270a2c5516" pid="2DyH1lRbg0Cwm4DPFtiv3g" hash="R3RqeQ">The eleven apostles witnessed that they saw the Lord ascend; Joseph Smith witnessed that he saw the Lord descend, and more, for he saw the Father standing with his beloved and exalted Son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p14" guid="1cd69e39-ed7d-48c9-b346-984073160897" pid="JdDV4HfkCUOpLy1c4cqoOw" hash="yT3hJA">Yesteryear we read of the visit of an angel to John on Patmos, but today we read of the visits of many angels—of Moroni, of John the Baptist, of Peter and James and John, and of Moses and Elias and Elijah—each one declaring his keys and passing them to Joseph Smith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p15" guid="2688b0f8-59d5-480c-bda8-02a7d3db269c" pid="X2VKJ--gtkuJ5FDJ2wVUHw" hash="il_Wwg">We see with our own eyes the <span class="emphasis">beginning </span>of the fulfillment of many ancient prophecies and the complete fulfillment of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p16" guid="60887efd-24d1-47d5-8f79-f38b70f65fb0" pid="u3jsAFXtVEusdfaOwjupNA" hash="v07GFQ">We know how to go out to teach. We know how to find people and how to cultivate their interest. We know how to apply sound teaching methods. All we need to do now is for each of us to become converted, to arise and go forth in the power of our knowledge and by the Spirit. Truly the admonition of the Lord to Peter, “and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren,” is happening today. As the Holy Ghost descended upon Peter and his associates at Pentecost, so has this divine gift been given freely to us. We have had, ever since 1830, the power of the Holy Ghost guiding and strengthening our leaders and loyal members. The gospel has been carried through the fervent witness of untiring missionaries and members until we now have organized units of the Church in more than two-thirds of the countries throughout the world, but there are uncounted millions yet to hear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p17" guid="ce94243e-63ad-4aac-b31f-c7e15ae1ac2f" pid="3wuUUws0TkCHD2VJylBNUQ" hash="w7uT4g">From 1830 to 1846 whole families were involved in the work. They warned their neighbors; they were all involved. A father left home every spare minute and went out teaching and preaching. The children at home were a part of it, for they had to work hard to make up for their father’s absence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p18" guid="f1d4ba55-b4d9-4b91-b1f7-47a03fccbbcb" pid="Gyr5ClNlR0GTGw2PEyr71Q" hash="8xGeGw">After 1846, when the Saints moved to the mountain valleys of Utah, families were not so much engaged. While fathers sometimes went, more often the sons went, until in the twentieth century the sons were carrying the actual travel burden. During the same time families began to feel that their part was to support a missionary, not to go out to teach or proselyte or make friends.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p19" guid="36a3e3e2-038a-481b-9b89-2e78f1966143" pid="h1iCGadjNkaSYFASurtiUA" hash="06wrlw">Now with correlation established, we have returned to the original premise. Families are involved. Father, mother, and children unite in the grand and noble effort to seek out those who may be persuaded to listen. And with their effort will come the strengthening by which Peter was admonished to perform. As they seek those to whom they preach, they themselves will be strengthened and in their turn will convert and strengthen other brethren until the happy day that all men see the glory of the Son of God and witness the fulfillment of his word that the gospel should roll forth until it has filled all the earth. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 65:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p20" guid="633d6494-1e10-42a6-abfd-fd78343e7063" pid="3Z6b7bMaFE6Tgww81A5aXA" hash="1fgtYA">The seventies of the Church are called by revelation to this work, and the detail of that work is by appointment so that the work may be orderly. In each ward the seventies mission leader is to plan the work and supervise its execution under the bishop’s direction. The home teachers bear a most important responsibility to persuade every family of Latter-day Saints to make friends with their nonmember neighbors and to persuade these to accept the missionaries. The methods are many, but the gospel is to save the souls of men. Become converted, my brethren; go perform. You have the spirit; do it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p21" guid="f9384459-4741-4de9-b7c9-01dc4b281239" pid="ApfX9vQ8qUmjdxzwMrxTFg" hash="F75eXg">I look at the First Presidency and the Twelve, who direct us. I see in their actions the result of their conversion, and witness to you that they stand in their places as did Peter, filled and inspired by the Holy Ghost. They are the leaders appointed by the Lord in this day. Let us follow their guidance and by our own conversion in our turn strengthen our brethren.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/when-thou-art-converted.p22" guid="007ff6e1-b8ba-4adf-9d6e-75093c743a82" pid="DpovK3iCGECgqG8nqu7qBg" hash="J00IoA">I know, too, that Jesus Christ the Lord leads this latter-day work and that he lives. This is his restored gospel; I testify to it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

The wards and branches of the Church have been organized to give activity to a large number of the members, the great majority actually. Yet there are many with no official position or no specific responsibility that calls them to do formal acts for the organization. They belong to the Church; they belong to the stake; they belong to the ward. They are invited to attend various classes and meetings designed for their instruction, but at the conclusion of a meeting they go home, having no particular appointment to arouse them to organizational activity. Many of them feel that they are being left out, that their talents are not wanted. Others do not want to accept any responsible calling.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/by-love-serve-one-another.p2" guid="8948b49b-e82a-4ed7-8012-67499f895957" pid="_4H6QNsxBkeaAvaR8wPU9w" hash="uxyfqQ">This may be because they do not understand the responsibility they have to the Church of Jesus Christ. Each of us has the same general calling. Each of us has the same responsibility as a result of entering into the waters of baptism and making the covenant. The Lord will not hold us blameless if we allow organizational responsibility, or the lack of it, to interfere with this special calling. Let me point out some necessary obligations in the words of the prophets.</p>

He urged them to cry to the Lord over all of their activities and their possessions and for the welfare of themselves and those about them. Their whole attitude should be one of prayer to the Lord for all they had and all they were. Then he said, “… do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need—I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</p>

To care for the poor is one of the first and early obligations. To help the needy and those who mourn follows close behind. All of us have some time, but those who are not given great responsibility in the organizations have more time to seek out the poor, needy, and helpless.</p>

All about us are those in need of encouragement, assistance, and help—help of a kind we can all give, not money, but time and attention and personal encouragement, especially to those who must bear great responsibility for loved ones and who cannot pass it to others for the simple reason there are no others to whom to pass it.</p>

A little time, not just calling on the confined for five minutes, but for an hour, reading, helping, feeding, cheering, will change whole attitudes. You will find the need in many homes.</p>

You can count on it, so plan to go at six and find relief for those four hours.” How blessed she was to me! How good! She blessed both me and the invalid by new cheer, new smiles, new ideas.</p>

We need to seek them out and relieve them. There are those who feel they are not accepted, who need to be built up in spirit and helped to find themselves. There are unmarried girls away from home who think no one cares. There are those troubled in spirit. It occurs to me that family home evening could occasionally be timed to bring in some of the lonely ones, some of the fearful, some of the downhearted, some of those troubled in spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/by-love-serve-one-another.p14" guid="8be95100-ece1-4682-ad84-7168441ccf12" pid="SWOK06XPZEG4CAWM-o08-w" hash="H7rY0g">I know of a prominent worker with a big church assignment who had no ward responsibilities. Weekly she went to Sunday School and sacrament meeting and came away feeling that she was no part of the program. Then she became aware of a sister who had been raised without a knowledge of the gospel, who would come to the door of the church on Sunday but was afraid to enter, and would then return home. She helped her to enter and to become enlarged in her soul. Then she noticed a man, a nonmember who was almost a member, and changed his outlook into membership. She noticed several single girls without purpose and gave them the desire to be what they could be. She was interested in the aged, and gave encouragement to young men nearing the age to go on missions. Suddenly she found herself a big part of the ward, not by a bishop’s appointment but by obeying the law which calls us to be our brother’s keeper.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/by-love-serve-one-another.p15" guid="86ef3997-d993-419b-a118-4c33cda84c7a" pid="eckxNwbtWECobNHSOon6YQ" hash="aJElAg">We may be sure that if there are many children or invalids or aged in a home, it is almost a certainty that such homes need help. O ye saints, do not pine if you have not presidency or teaching positions. Be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of your own free will. You may come nearer your heaven by the unobtrusive help you render those standing in need of comfort, succor, and attention. You won’t feel important to the organization, but the angels will be smiling as they record the hours of church service given to those whom the Lord loves and to whom he personally directed his own effort—the poor, the downtrodden, the needy, the ill, the discouraged.</p>

We then renew our pledges to remember him who is our Savior and to keep his commandments, the second one of which is to remember to love our neighbors as we love ourselves. Having entered into this covenant, it is our responsibility to seek diligently to show this love through our deeds.</p>

Let us not sit back jealous of those giving attention to the stake, the ward, the auxiliaries, but seek our salvation where the Lord appointed us, among those who, weak in spirit, weak in body, or weak in desire, need to be encouraged, need to be raised up in the kingdom of God on this earth.</p>

I know there are visiting teachers, but still there are many who hide their needs from them. I know the priesthood is expected to be alert, but this responsibility goes beyond the organized priesthood. This is a personal obligation that no living soul who loves the Lord can dismiss. It is one to which we must ever be alert.</p>

The one in need may not be a member of the Church. It can be anybody who stands in need. I know of no one who is exempt from the responsibility of constant succor and personal encouragement to many who never report their difficulties to the bishop, but who, in spite of pride, and even of means, badly need the help, understanding, and love we all can give as individuals.</p>

Whitney), “You prayed me here; now what do you want of me?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p2" guid="b957dfe4-0f40-4108-9923-baee95e06d11" pid="iUgvCHpItkCTjiLcv4cqcw" hash="1kP_YA">I do not know that his father, who is the general superintendent of the Sunday School and the father of nine daughters, wants him to become a famous surgeon. I believe he will lead his son wisely as to what his earthly vocation will be, but I am sure he will want this boy to go on a mission, that hope of great adventure which comes into the early life of all Latter-day Saint boys. If this is the father’s desire, he will start early to prepare his son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p3" guid="2a65bcb3-5c28-4062-a408-2b3d9211d55d" pid="jv2c7AeGqkKNyCj1LjkDjA" hash="X_J9Mw">The first prayers the baby will hear will be that he will grow up to go on a mission and to be married in the temple. Both of the words “mission” and “temple” he will not understand; but later, when comprehension comes, they will be so ingrained in his memory that they will be a part of his being. Later, as he lisps his own prayer, he will find the words “make me worthy to go on a mission” easy to say. Neither will he stumble over the words “marry” or “temple.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p4" guid="8e083f14-1658-40aa-b301-7ff52b4602a6" pid="vMvb-mTgqEWAf_Dg-3Kajg" hash="L0sW2A">If his father is wise, his boy’s early years will be filled with stories of the experiences of the missionaries of the past. He should begin by telling of his own ancestors, to give the boy knowledge that mission adventures are not the exclusive property of the leaders but that the followers had equally miraculous adventures. But, of course, he will want to learn of the heroic journey of Samuel H. Smith and his companion from Far West on an eastern missionary journey. He will want to learn of the missionary journey of Heber C. Kimball and Brigham Young when they, ill from fever, arose from their beds and started out, how Brother Kimball was poisoned and was saved by the loyal work of his companion, and how they miraculously found money in the purse, just enough for each day’s journey. But he will need to know, too, that today with our affluence he may not find money; he will find something far richer—the great joy that comes from seeing people’s lives miraculously changed as they accept the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p5" guid="dc1bb5a7-2a0b-4490-aacb-ac81323ad341" pid="Keeaa-HOtEuDf74a1oR_8g" hash="yfmooQ">He will need to know that he must develop physical stamina, not for athletics but for his mission. He will play basketball to develop wind and limb to serve the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p6" guid="2ed7d07a-043a-47c2-9e15-34ad39d65f60" pid="QIqMWmkdBUa_vnqE4kK1SQ" hash="tgPNzQ">As he grows, he will need to talk man-to-man, or rather boy-to-man, why all this should be. His father will say, “For your mission, son, you will need to learn by heart many things. And so we shall now start.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p7" guid="3fad8570-9c4c-4a32-b887-3d84e70b05eb" pid="-VXxTs4CfESm1--D-27j6g" hash="haKvEQ">Then his father will teach him the simple truths that are important. They will memorize the prophecy in the book of Nephi about the descendant of Joseph who, bearing the name of his ancestor, would do great things. And then his father will tell him the story of the modern Joseph, the fulfillment of that prophecy—what he did to be a great boy. He will learn that boys do not need to wait until they are men to be great.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p8" guid="3db77284-fd2f-4dc0-96b8-3a712b1f50a5" pid="bz-_anwPuUS3gDhoXrcnyg" hash="tCDpQg">He will thrill with the ancient prophecy of the angel who would fly through the heavens having the everlasting gospel to preach to all the world and how this prophecy was actually fulfilled through angelic visits to the young boy prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p9" guid="4ac53119-dd5e-4ed8-b0db-ad261ba3063f" pid="mnk-I7E6-UKbDvSXRWqgpQ" hash="DzK8xA">In the same manner they will comb the scriptures, doctrine by doctrine, and learn those vital to missionary work. They will read together the great boy-literature of the world. The chivalry at the court of King Arthur will be mirrored in his treatment of girls and, later, young women. And he will learn the place of animals in his life when he runs the <span class="emphasis">Trail of the Sand Hill Stag </span>with Seton and will learn the immense power of nature as he survives a ride down a snow avalanche with Enos A. Mills.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p10" guid="fbaa4141-d653-4598-a943-b64f29186cd9" pid="fGE4PfB5g0CMtoNO3XE7fg" hash="qZ3lOQ">He will also learn of the winter journey to rescue the handcart company, victim of the Wyoming blizzards. His father will see to it that he gets the feel of a real blizzard and the helplessness of the brave people who had only the Lord to depend on for deliverance. He will be taught these lessons at the home evening, at the dinner table, at bedtime, in camp, on hikes and journeys. And driven home at all these stages will be the theme that the greatest adventure a boy can have is to go on a mission and learn to depend on the Lord when faced with a bitter, cold, or hostile world, and that the greatest joy he can experience is to give of his all in the service of the Master in bringing souls unto him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p11" guid="3452ded7-cc66-4679-a7bb-84967bb8299f" pid="rnH52u4pkUy7XGXN6GkB8w" hash="MpAyvA">Having seen and heard his father pray, he will want to pray too and will soon learn about the whisperings of the Spirit, which comes into his “feeling,” as Nephi pointed out to his rebellious brothers. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.45" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:45</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p12" guid="70376797-fd4e-4a7f-9f98-a2d051e2402e" pid="o9Dv6DFDK0mdt-5BYth53Q" hash="F5YYjA">He will need to learn also of the important principle of obedience. Teach him that the Lord Jesus Christ was completely obedient to his father and that if your son would be a successful missionary, he must be completely obedient to those in authority over him. Faithfully learning this lesson before he goes into the mission field will equip him for his work there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p13" guid="aef54774-eebe-46f8-8ae2-c9bfb09465e7" pid="xoXdTKH1AkqO_0BxmsG4-Q" hash="Yj84-w">Give him responsibility, and teach him to forget himself in service to others. These, coupled with obedience, will help him to find true humility—all of which are vital factors for his reception of the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p14" guid="79a3d4f2-21c8-439d-bf07-49bcb2e7ca3d" pid="sjfOsXyAqESqLHNWDg1jOg" hash="N-0Q7Q">And so, through his growing years he will apply the truth of all things. Lay the foundation well, Brother Nelson; it begins at birth and its effects cease not until the mission of life is complete.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p15" guid="650f237d-f345-48e3-bc88-de556493d5c8" pid="n-vRM6ivCkGtXJzMzX4eTg" hash="mdjZtg">Meanwhile, his mother will have a hand in his growth also. Faith-building begins in the cradle and ends not at the grave. In the formative years your boy will need to learn how to give and take, how to get along, how to put up with inconveniences, how to be patient and tolerant, how to resolve differences with playmates and, later, with missionary companions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p16" guid="9f305d00-acba-4269-9ffa-c05b75a58e83" pid="sHDUiQjTf0aw6FVBjbVlXg" hash="jmSt-w">He will need long training in neatness and in the handling of his clothing. He will need to know the “rubbing board” techniques of washing his clothes and how to keep them white and clean. Ironing and pressing should be second nature. He will need to learn that bodily cleanliness goes with spiritual cleanness and that the body is the expression of the spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p17" guid="83fc4d33-2f1e-4e43-b456-21d69aefe71f" pid="hyXfMI8oXkqdKCOd0g_Ldw" hash="n9vTNA">He will need to know how to cook—how to make the food he prepares taste good and at the same time meet his many nutritional needs. Nothing will buoy up a missionary like a tasty meal. Why shouldn’t this boy learn to cook well? And while he is about it, he should learn that the dusty, ill-kept room with its unmade bed is the devil’s best means of discouragement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p18" guid="657f00e7-61f8-41f9-a3b1-de64b75e2d9c" pid="D3fzYuiSlkCNuv93u6z94A" hash="mDjbRA">Just as surely as he walks, his manner, his attitude, his clothing, his complete self will be concrete evidence of what he is in his soul. He cannot conceal himself. Teach him, then, that these things reveal his spirit and show what he really is and that the success of his mission will be found in how his spirit speaks to the spirits of those he meets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p19" guid="79a6ae4d-021f-4a76-81ec-364e5e369f74" pid="6DQHhXVr9Ey6LFKnPejpNQ" hash="wFK9Ig">In the process of his growing, make sure that he will learn how the Church came to be and where it has gone from there. And let him learn to know that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ will give men reason for their repentance from sin, which is the great doctrine that brings hope; that baptism by immersion is both a covenant and a sign of acceptance; and that the gift of the Holy Ghost is what makes him, and his father and his mother, different from the world; and that it will make those he converts different also.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p20" guid="0d2199da-f7e7-4f66-953b-03d4e3a4dbcc" pid="5_UcSR5NG02Vp1Y7icnKjQ" hash="PvuJUg">He will not consider the Book of Mormon dull reading if you will make it live for him while he is growing. And if he learns that reading scripture by the Spirit with an open heart and a searching mind is indeed hearing the voice of the Lord, as the Lord told the Twelve it is (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.34-36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:34–36</a>), you will have him on his way to becoming a missionary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p21" guid="4fe8e3f4-a6d6-4195-a44b-9284cc553c8b" pid="Xc0FZz_7rkKMiMrUN6VdDw" hash="l-Mmtg">He began to prepare for his work here before he came to earth, when he repudiated Satan and all of his subtle sophistries. Now he is to prove that he can live in a body and control its earthly tendencies and temptations as he did as a spirit before his arrival here in mortality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p22" guid="c47d7cb8-2a76-4e96-b3a3-28ae807f6952" pid="zLpJ2QU50UudepU-SNhPAA" hash="PaFKCA">As with Russell Nelson, Jr., so it is with all boys—and girls too. Let us not leave out the girls—they also may go on missions. These young folks may become great of themselves, but with the faith and teaching of their fathers and mothers they will become greater. The Eternal Father taught his Only Begotten Son. He depends on us to teach our children truth that they may . better serve the Father of their spirits and live.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p23" guid="a4b8a129-d977-4549-80b1-df73660ccd18" pid="Z3zSE6gII0OpKXHTiB7TcA" hash="FV9Diw">To those who may not have had these training opportunities in their childhood, through humility and diligent effort in their teen years, they can still achieve the same thing.</p>

It will confirm that the Lord truly speaks in this day, for he will constantly whisper the truth of this great latter-day work into the soul of the valiant missionary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/missionary-training-begins-early.p25" guid="5e1b8a0a-f498-4cd6-aaeb-96ba3dd34d58" pid="QZ-TkmHc8E2RNSJbe5cE4A" hash="x45MNg">Later he will know this whispering in the affairs of his adult years and, following it, will find the true entrance to the things which will give him eternal life in the kingdom of our Lord.</p>

I have that knowledge. Joseph Smith was the modern prophet through whom the Lord restored his work in these last days. Joseph Fielding Smith is the worthy recipient and holder of the same keys of authority to speak to the people on behalf of the Lord.</p>

He must have had an unexplained urge, because he would not know really why he came. He might think it was to better his condition.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p5" guid="083fd9a1-3422-437f-9e80-1159e2538149" pid="mZQSheFtqEq5EYJ7IZnDJQ" hash="4xpUBg">He fought in the American Revolution and was wounded. Many of us have ancestors who are reported to have fought in the Revolution, but few of them were wounded. This man was left for dead in the battle of Guilford County Courthouse in the Carolinas in March 1781. Thanks to good nursing he recovered and, as in all good endings, married his nurse. Four sons came to him, one of whom was Samuel, who was the youngest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p6" guid="ef620cde-9dd6-4823-a560-21e86ac1a349" pid="KXbPiSlOkkCjO9LzRO07Ag" hash="zbArAw">Samuel’s sons, Francis, Alfred, and Eli, and their families joined the Church in 1832, about the time that my great-grandfather joined. They suffered through all the vicissitudes and the troubles and persecutions and mobbings of Jackson County, Far West, and Nauvoo, and finally came west. At Winter Quarters their father joined them. He had not joined the Church until this time but joined shortly afterward. Francis married a young woman by the name of Jane Vail Johnson. I shall speak of her later.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p7" guid="2057002c-d050-4b49-a039-ae39fa7249d1" pid="4YFjazx7AUuY6Nrpz-ACwA" hash="Uh3Juw">They all came to Utah and settled in Tooele County. They were just getting settled and making things go when they were called by President Brigham Young to St. George, and they went, like all good Latter-day Saints did in those days. But they had not been in St. George very long when they were called to settle in Meadow Valley. That is a place you folks probably have not heard about. It is now known as Panaca, in what they thought was southwestern Utah, but which actually later came to be Nevada. These people, obeying the call, again without question, were the first family to move to Meadow Valley, and they made a dugout house. Sister Young said that you may not know what a dugout house is. I replied that most of the folks would know: One digs a cubical hole in a hillside and covers it with a roof of wooden poles topped with clay.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p8" guid="d4daa01f-0390-41a4-b963-42db1acbc2d8" pid="cGX5gjEQQ02OUmaBPfVxJA" hash="fiffyw">Troubles of the few settlers with the Indians caused the authorities in St. George to give them permission to abandon the project, but Sister Jane Johnson Lee refused to leave. She said she was there to stay, and stay they did. Later two Indians came into her dugout home, and one of them, seeing a rifle in one corner of the room, demanded it. Sister Lee refused to give it to him. He started for the gun, but she struck him so hard with a piece of stove wood, it knocked him down. He staggered to his feet and drew his bow, aiming the arrow at her. She let him have another piece of wood, which smashed the bow and arrow. Both Indians departed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/having-been-born-of-goodly-parents.p9" guid="d219b801-48d3-4636-8ce5-49d83cccf789" pid="WKygYSNvPUeDqHz8VM15oQ" hash="c4Qjlw">Two sons of this brave couple married sisters. Samuel Marion Lee married Margaret McMurrin, and Francis Lee, Jr., married Mary McMurrin. The McMurrins were converts from Scotland who had crossed the plains with the handcart companies. Brother McMurrin, a cooper, which is a man who makes barrels and bends wood, repaired many a handcart wheel en route, which helped get the carts to the valley but delayed him and his family. They also settled in Tooele. Each of the Lee brothers took his bride to Meadow Valley.</p>

He did not intend this to be my privilege alone. In his infinite love he reaches out to all of my family, all of my kin, to all of your families and kin, and to all of the people on the earth.</p>

That is the great hope—to penetrate the veil and see and know him as he is. Yet I do know some things because he has told holy men, who are prophets, about himself and has commanded that they bear record of what they saw and heard. I know that by reading about him in the scriptures I can hear his voice by the power of the Holy Ghost; that is, to read his word is to hear his voice.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.3" class="scriptureRef">John 1:3</a>.) It is plain that this great being, this Word, as John expressed it, was made flesh and dwelt among us (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.14" class="scriptureRef">John 1:14</a>) and was identified as the Only Begotten in the flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/when-i-read-i-am-there.p7" guid="4a6f1891-52c1-4086-aebb-ac3cbf77b7e4" pid="xanfo8Pz9E6LipeATdP0Cw" hash="kOU0nQ">I learn, too, that all of the children of God were organized as spirits to come to the earth to be tested, to see if they would obey the principles of salvation and exaltation as proposed by this Son. They were told: “We will go down, … and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.24-25" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:24–25</a>.) Then, in due time, he himself came to earth, the light and life of men. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.4" class="scriptureRef">John 1:4</a>.)</p>

I learn that when he was born, a host of angels sang anthems of joy to an audience of shepherds. Out of the East, with no explanation as to why they started, wise men came and deposited with Joseph and Mary presents which were of value: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. I do not doubt that they were inspired to find the Lord or that they were prompted to leave valuable gifts which could be used to sustain his family.</p>

There came the Son of God, unmarked and unknown; yet, recognizing him by the Spirit, John the Baptist could not help crying out: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.29" class="scriptureRef">John 1:29</a>.) What do you imagine could have been John’s feeling when, after the baptism, he heard a voice out of the heavens say in holy confirmation: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”? (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 3:17</a>.)</p>

There, as his glory was manifest before them and their eyes were opened to the presence of Moses and Elijah, they heard the same solemn witness as had John, only this time it came from a bright cloud nearby, which overshadowed them. In my soul I hear the solemn words from out the cloud saying: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/17.5" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 17:5</a>.)</p>

I am not capable of fully understanding the suffering of this great firstborn Son of God for the sins of the world. We call it Gethsemane. He gave us agency and then, knowing all would sin to a greater or lesser degree, took the responsibility on himself of paying the price of the atonement for our sins, provided we would repent and follow him and his teachings. I find peace in doing what he said to do. When he said: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>), he meant what he said. Someday I hope to be able to understand better. I know the peace I can have if I will keep his law and abide in his commandments.</p>

I look at my own hands and feet and try to imagine the pain of such torture—to hang there in the heat of the day, the weight of his body on those tearing nails, every muscle and nerve drawn tight in agony. No stopping, no escape until he, having said, “It is finished” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/19.30" class="scriptureRef">John 19:30</a>), gave up the ghost. I realize that this was endured for me and for you; I bow my head; it is hard to hold back the tears. Even now, 1900 years later, it is as poignant as though it occurred yesterday.</p>

He has risen! He is the King of kings. He is the one named “Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/9.6" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 9:6</a>.) I think of each of these titles given to him in prophecy and marvel as the meaning of each one touches my own heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/when-i-read-i-am-there.p15" guid="b8b88c19-ffaa-4cc8-a57b-b43d79d9c8eb" pid="0GdEYhmN9U-ColJwHw3Y5Q" hash="ZXqHZw">What did the 11 apostles think as the cloud received him out of their sight? I can see them, in my mind, walking across the Kedron, then the narrow streets to a common meeting place, each lost in his own fears, and in his own hopes according to his understanding. I read with gratitude of the great event of the day of Pentecost, when the promise of the Lord was realized and the Spirit of the Holy Ghost was on them in miraculous abundance.</p>

And then I read in a book of scripture, newly discovered, with an unusual name—the Book of Mormon—of his coming to a people in this land, a people descended from the Jews and their kin in Israel. I read of his descent from the heavens above them, of the great multitude of Nephites gathered together round about their temple, and of the voice from heaven which pierced them to the center.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/when-i-read-i-am-there.p17" guid="5b45d71a-7ee8-4089-86aa-9bb8a62d9516" pid="Wkcmk12d-kuLXLyv2GjslA" hash="3tS2Ug">My heart sings in confirmation as I hear once more in my soul the words of introduction and acceptance twice heard during his ministry in Palestine and now repeated and enlarged: “Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.7" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:7</a>.) Once more the voice of the Father out of the cloud is placing his approval on his divine Son. I know that the account is true.</p>

It surprised this prophet, but it does not surprise me, for I have learned that the Lord was the firstborn Son of God, whose name is Man of Holiness. So when the Lord showed his complete self to that great prophet, I am not surprised, but I am awed. The more I study and read the scriptures, the more I know this is true.</p>

For the first time, so far as I know, the personage who spoke in testimony at the baptism of Christ, again on the mount, and to the Nephites (saying, “This is my beloved Son”) did not speak out of a cloud as on those occasions. This time he stood in majestic holy light together with his Son and declared to Joseph Smith: “This is My Beloved Son. Hear him!” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>.) With Joseph Smith, as I read, I know that there is a God and he is indeed my Father. He is the great Elohim, the Father of us all. And there with him stood his Son Jesus Christ, identified once more by his Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/when-i-read-i-am-there.p20" guid="5b6881ac-c21f-4b7d-baae-635e56f4b0e1" pid="HP69TY6PdU-c_Pmk7x6dfA" hash="QlyZpA">It is no coincidence that the Father used the same introduction. If the young Joseph Smith was to bear witness of the truth, he must know the truth. It was revealed to him in that grove of trees 153 years ago. By the spirit of truth I know that the vision is true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/when-i-read-i-am-there.p21" guid="b45c0239-8a97-4aaa-b2fd-7e6ce2b2ea05" pid="tA4jj06WO0OkDTzRGHAi3g" hash="ixr-zA">For 1700 years men had claimed to represent Christ, but none had declared him, none had heard a voice declaring him. In 1700 years no man had imagined or dared to imitate this great statement of truth to justify his own claims. This time is different. There in one moment on a spring morning the eternal truth was once more revealed in such a way and in such power that no one with the Holy Spirit in his heart can doubt that the heavens <span class="emphasis">were </span>opened and that God our Father and his Son appeared together—the Father declaring the Son in almost exactly the same words as he did three times nearly 2,000 years ago.</p>

The sacred words are from the lips of the Eternal Father. This is my testimony, and our testimony to the world. Here today we declared his Beloved Son, and here today we worship him and give praise and honor and glory. Today in honor of him we assemble at this conference of his people.</p>

Let us worship him in spirit and in truth. Let us give loyal support to his presently anointed prophet and mouthpiece and those who assist him. President Harold B. Lee is that prophet. He holds the same keys that were given to Joseph Smith by the heavenly messengers in 1829. His word, inspired of the Holy Ghost, is the modern revelation of our day. This is my witness to you and to the world, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

The Lord inspired his people who followed this prophet to be led to America, an unknown land in that day; and later he caused groups of the House of Israel in Palestine to migrate also.

In 1827 this same prophet, resurrected, delivered the record to Joseph Smith, who by the power of God translated it.

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4-5" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:4–5</a>.) This book is called the Book of Mormon. It could not have been written by a man without divine help. It is an abridgment of more than a thousand years of records kept, yet it rings true. No person mentioned in the book is out of place or out of character. The Lord stands forth as sharp and vivid as in Palestine, and he completed his witness when the translation wag published in 1830, a witness began two thousand years before Christ. Anyone reading this book, the Book of Mormon, with a desire to know, and who will ponder as he reads and then ask the Lord if it be true, will know that it is a true account. He will know too that this Church is Christ’s Church and he will know that Joseph Smith was a prophet, a true prophet of the Lord Jesus Christ and his Father, the living God. Jesus Christ is the God of this earth, and he has carried its destiny in his hands from the beginning and will continue to do so until he gives the work complete to his Father, who is our Father in heaven.</p>

And so if this man who did such mighty works was truly the Messiah promised for nearly 2,000 years, he must fulfill all the prophecies which have been inspired of the Holy Ghost concerning him. There are numerous such prophecies in the Old Testament I shall enumerate those called to our attention by Matthew and John. You will have no trouble affirming that they attest Jesus Christ, the only one whom they fit.</p>

He was to make his grave with the rich. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/53.9" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 53:9</a>.)

Isaiah outlined the fact that some of his people would be brought down and that they should speak out of the dust and that this voice would be as a familiar spirit, speaking out of the ground. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.4" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:4</a>.) Ezekiel spoke of the sticks of Judah and Ephraim which, having been written on, should become one in the hand of the Lord.

The later joining of this Book of Mormon, the history of the dealings of Christ with a people who were, as Ezekiel said, of Ephraim, with the account of Christ’s dealings with Judah, the Bible, is a literal fulfillment of the prophecies I have just mentioned by Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Enoch.</p>

No man could have brought it about nor have foreseen the events by which it was restored to the earth. Nothing like it has ever been done before; and yet after its accomplishment, we know that it could have taken place in no other way.</p>

A confirmation of this took place in far-off Scotland, in a meeting high in spiritual manifestation, when a Latter-day Saint of Scotch ancestry spoke. Those who were there heard President James L.

Is a person who is ill given a blessing? Inspired promises are often made by the elder pronouncing it. Is a baby given a name? The blessing following may be and is often prophetic. Does a father give what we call a “father’s blessing”? Then in his patriarchal position, he may be as prophetic as was Jacob in blessing his twelve sons. Promises made when inspired of the Holy Ghost will be fulfilled if the persons to whom they are given keep in harmony with divine principles.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p3" pid="DcWz4LbDsUWCXgr-mcRivQ" hash="ACp0LA">We all know the story of Joseph, of his enslavement, of his prophetic gift of interpretation, of his great temptation by the wife of Potiphar when he set the example for the youth of all future ages and “got him out.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/39.12" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 39:12</a>.) And we know of his success in saving his people from famine.</p>

This peculiar circumstance, cruel and harsh, turned out to be for his good because he trusted in the Lord. That trust, through his obedience, has benefited all mankind through all generations. To Joseph went the promise of the birthright—and the promised land.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p5" pid="LNSJLDsKCkqx8HKk229QlQ" hash="cDj4Pg">Perhaps you with me will transport yourselves back 1,000 years before Christ to that ancient land of Israel and enter the room in the temple where Samuel, a youth, lay sleeping. You will not hear the voice calling him, but you can see him arise and go to Eli, asking if he called. You will notice the impatience of Eli until he finally realized who was speaking to Samuel. After the third awakening, you will hear Eli say, “Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/3.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 3:9</a>.) Remember, you are living ten hundred years before Christ when people knew that the Lord spoke intelligible words of instruction and reproof, as well as words of acceptance and praise. Of course, you will say to yourselves, “But Samuel was chosen to be a prophet.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p6" pid="ef0tT2s6A0eB1AFefUtEog" hash="UmKagw">As with me, it will thrill you that the Lord takes a pure boy and teaches him the truth before he can be taught what uninspired men conceive to be truth. Perhaps you will remember that the Lord puts into the minds and hearts of his prophets what he wants them to think and say rather than the thoughts of philosophical men. Remember what he said to Isaiah:</p>

Samuel heard the voice of the Lord. Would it have surprised you in that day to learn that sometime after hearing the voice of the Lord, Samuel saw the Lord. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/3.21" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 3:21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p9" pid="CW9HhTthgE6j08Qr_qQx8w" hash="CVtTqg">What do you suppose would have happened to Samuel if he had declared in the streets that he had heard the Lord without having the protection of the sanctuary and of Eli? What would Eli himself have said to Samuel if he had come as an unknown lad and knocked on his door and announced that he had a message for Eli?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p10" pid="9MrahBFgp0WBBgAut11tZA" hash="8GiICw">David was a boy tending his father’s sheep when Samuel, spurning the other sons of Jesse, was led by the inspiration of the Lord to anoint David king of Israel. No one reading the account can doubt that the Lord had a deep love for David and that he was called of God.</p>

I mention these to remind us that boys in their adolescent years have been personally called by the Lord. They have learned by direct revelation that the Lord is God; that he is real, known, definable; and that he speaks to them in a language they can understand. Let us remember too that the Lord God does not change. He is the same yesterday—even if it be 3,600 years ago—today, and forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p12" pid="SEGHSGvedEWp6EIAz2RUkA" hash="OQKSEg">Joseph Smith was a boy in his fifteenth year when the Lord spoke to him. Conditions were different then than anciently. Nearly 1,800 years had passed since the Lord had spoken to anybody. In those days, what the Lord had revealed had been written on parchment and kept in rolls. Later as philosophical men read them and reproduced them, they interpreted them by reason and not by the Spirit of God to guide them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p13" pid="wuXISCDu8kCT1u2Xy--fZQ" hash="lw2QAQ">The only way the rolls could be reproduced was by scribes who laboriously copied the written word. It is almost impossible to copy anything without some error in the doing. Multiply the number of times copies were made from copies, over a period of nearly 1,400 years, each copy increasing the errors in the previous copy, and one can understand that many errors were bound to creep in.</p>

Their protests were vigorous and determined. Many lost their lives refusing to conform. That protest still goes on with multiplied Protestant interpretations of what the Lord taught. Indeed, even today a man needs but to consider himself called, and he can and often does begin a church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p15" pid="7Inl2uwUkUmG8N7DaNDPDQ" hash="okq6aw">Some of the sects were vigorously protesting in Palmyra, New York, in the winter of 1819 and the spring of 1820. Efforts were made by the ministers to convince the people of the community that their varied interpretations were correct. And many confessed their acceptance of the word of these ministers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p16" pid="m0CtwwQh2UOuWImmO3mYfg" hash="ZuXZOg">Joseph Smith wanted to find the peace of salvation also, but he was confused as to which church was right. Even as a boy he knew that in such diversity of ideas and ordinances, not all could be the truth. He read the verse in James which says, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a>.) The words stirred him as much as the voice of the Lord stirred Samuel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p17" pid="hCUfO2vr5ku47u1LAbBM5g" hash="Sh2rwg">Many have read that verse and received comfort. Many have followed the admonition and have asked for wisdom. As they have had faith, they have received wisdom. This time the inspiration was more powerful. He was to receive knowledge as well as wisdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p18" pid="_k1vNGdGs0WW3F0OGnbWaA" hash="FWMlCg">There are times in the history of this earth when the moment for great events has arrived. Prescribed, ordered, and arranged by the power of God, they cannot be stayed. For example, when the time came for the children of Israel to leave Egypt, no one could stop them, and those who tried failed to their sorrow. When the meridian of time came, the promises made by the prophets were fulfilled and miraculous events took place. The angels came, and suddenly Mary was told that she was to be the mother of the Son of God, and Elisabeth was told of her own part in this great and sublime event. This first public revelation came by an angel to a few simple shepherds. They only heard the heavenly chorus sing praise to God.</p>

The prophets had declared it. And so Joseph was impelled to walk across his father’s newly cleared field, dodging the raw stumps en route, and climb over the worn fence, and enter the forest. Climbing a hill, he found a spot where he felt he could not be disturbed and began to pour out his soul to the Lord.</p>

There stood God, the Father of us all, glorious beyond description, and by his side the glorified resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. Joseph saw that each was a personage—that men are truly formed in the image and likeness of God. The Eternal Father spoke: “This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>.) Joseph heard.</p>

He was told that <span class="emphasis">all</span> had gone astray, and that no man had the power to speak for the Lord, that all had been misled. Many important truths were told that spring day, and he learned that he was to be the instrument by which the true church would be restored to the earth.</p>

His father and mother and his brothers and sisters believed him. To his surprise, when he told others, they not only did not believe, but heaped upon his youthful head ridicule—which is a most difficult form of persecution for a boy to endure. The kindly minister who had been advising him how to seek turned bitter, sarcastic, and critical. From then on as Joseph grew into manhood and as the time came to do the things required of a prophet, bitter words, ridicule, and some physical torture were his lot. But, like Samuel who knew he had heard the Lord speak, Joseph knew he had seen and heard the Father and the Son.</p>

With him as the instrument, the Lord brought forth his heavenly doctrine of the way, the truth, and the light—which pointed the way back into the heavenly home of God the Father—to become indeed his sons and his daughters and his children to inherit all that the father has, even eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/for-thy-servant-heareth.p24" pid="RFqdVygkaESUb4uX8jKmKQ" hash="2O4jDg">Through him the Lord provided a miraculous witness which is a sure sign to anyone who will investigate it without prejudice. That witness is a record of Jesus Christ and his visit to the people of ancient America and is called the Book of Mormon. This is not man’s witness. It is the Lord’s. The existence of the golden plates from which it was translated was verified by 11 men who saw the plates and who bear witness to all men today. Three of them further testified that the voice of God declared unto them that these ancient records had been “translated by the gift and power of God.” (Book of Mormon foreword.)</p>

Obtain a copy of the Book of Mormon; read it with a desire to know of its truth. If you do as one of the prophets said—ponder it in your heart, and then ask the Lord if it be true—the Lord will “manifest the truth of it” unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost. If you make that test, you will know that Joseph, the modern prophet, bearing a common surname—Smith—was indeed the prophet he proved to be. If you know that truth by the power of the Holy Ghost, you will not rest until you have come into the kingdom of God and into the rest of the great Jehovah, even the Lord Jesus Christ, and have joined with the Latter-day Saints.</p>

Hunter has been in Hawaii for several weeks gaining strength after a long illness. He came home a week or so ago with the hope that he could attend this conference. This one has particular meaning for him, for it marks a long period of service as a member of the First Council of the Seventy. It was just 30 years ago today that he was sustained by a conference held in the Assembly Hall. (It was during a period of war, and the Tabernacle was not in use.)</p>

It has been a lifelong study with him—a study made with deep love of the Lord and of the book. He might also have told of a miraculous sparing of his life when the Spirit whispered, “Turn right,” and he forced the pilot of a plane he was riding in to do just that, with the result of a safe landing instead of hitting a mountain toward which they were heading in a dense fog.</p>

It is your business, brethren, to put into the minds and hearts of boys the ethical and moral ideals which the Scouting movement points out as your reason for being. But it is not your purpose to give the national interpretation. It is rather your obligation to plant the ideals and moral standards of the kingdom of the Lord.</p>

The words in each case are the same. No one can quarrel with the great Scout oath, <span class="emphasis">“On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God. …”</span> But it is one thing to use the universal Scout benediction, “May the great Scoutmaster of all good scouts be with us until we meet again,” and an entirely different thing to know how to pray to the living God. It is one thing to tell a boy that his Father in heaven is everywhere in all things; but it is an entirely different concept to teach that God our Father is an exalted, glorified man and is, in every sense of the word, the real Father of our spirits and the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ in the flesh. Further, it is a different concept to teach that it is his Scout obligation that in doing his duty to God he prepares himself to go on a mission when he is old enough. Every Scouter can lead a boy into receiving this rich gift. <span class="emphasis">This should be a first objective in your Scouting.</span></p>

This is a most important experience in the life of a boy. The opportunity I missed to do this is one of my most intense regrets. I have organized and conducted about 1,150 campfires during the time I was professionally in the Boy Scout movement and organized the programs presented during those exciting hours. With other leaders, I have told stories to 15,000 boys.</p>

I have achieved some fame as a storyteller. The one I am most famous for is called “The Wendigo”—Algernon Blackwood’s thriller about the New Brunswick woods. That story never sent a single boy on a mission. It was a thrilling story, but the motivation was not of the kind which sends a boy on a mission—rather, it tended to pull the covers over his head.</p>

Then as needed, according to his wisdom, his word will come into my mind through my thoughts, accompanied by a feeling in the region of my bosom. It is a feeling which cannot be described, but the nearest word we have is “burn” or “burning.” Accompanying this always is a feeling of peace, a further witness that what one heard is right. Once one recognizes this burning, this feeling, this peace, one need never be drawn astray in his daily life or in the guidance he may receive. He may also know that if this revelation is in harmony with the revealed principles, that it is right, and if in disharmony, it is not from the Lord. The Lord does not contradict himself. It is vital to everybody to know that no one will ever receive revelation that is contrary to the word given to the living prophet. The application of this principle will prevent many of the frustrations experienced in daily life.</p>

When we become alert to situations which point the need for its application. On an occasion when a small boy got angry at a playmate, he came into the house stating that he would never play with that boy again and would not ever let him into the house. The mother—a wise woman—stopped what she was doing, not later, but that very moment, and said: “Son, we need to go into the bedroom and kneel down and talk to Heavenly Father.” There she explained that the boy needed to learn how to forgive and told him he should pray about it. She prayed first and then helped him to start. When they came from the bedroom, the boy looked up at the mother and said: “I guess I’ll play with him again. I think he can come here.” You might say, answer to prayer. Yes, but it was also the beginning of that boy’s hearing the voice of the Lord, and that’s important.</p>

Then they understand that, <span class="emphasis">if righteous,</span> the voice of the Lord comes into their minds with a certain feeling in the breast, accompanied by a peace. They are receiving the word of the Lord to them.</p>

I bear witness of its truth and of the fact that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/he-hath-showed-thee-o-man-what-is-good.p2" pid="wYMS7PhiK02Zl-_Aa-EC4A" hash="ciZI6g">In this day of mechanical marvels my mind harkens back to the days of my childhood. I suppose that is natural enough for those upon whom age descends.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/he-hath-showed-thee-o-man-what-is-good.p3" pid="xkg3DOLyxE-Td2dspOx-vA" hash="DLA3gQ">I remember well the old one-room rock meetinghouse of the Second Ward on Seventh South between Fourth and Fifth East in Salt Lake City. This particular ward was one of the gathering places for members from Denmark. The bishop, Heber C. Iverson, could speak their language. In fast day meetings, testimonies were often unintelligible to me as the Saints struggled to testify in English, their new tongue. In Sunday School the room was divided into classrooms by green curtains hanging from wires overhead. If I was not interested in what my teacher was saying, I could choose from five other classes, all of which I could hear. It was always interesting to try to solve the problem of the identity of the boy who kept poking me in the back through the curtain at my rear.</p>

Today I cannot identify the exact teaching of this principle, but I suspect that it came from those testimonies I heard in the Second Ward, the Sunday School class, my parents, and the repetition of the second Article of Faith [<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.2" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:2</a>], which I repeated many times in that day. This article states: “We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam’s transgression.”</p>

The word <span class="emphasis">punish</span> was also quite common. My father and mother used it to explain to me why I was being spanked, both before the event and after. I grew up with the sure knowledge that I was responsible for my own acts of good and evil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/he-hath-showed-thee-o-man-what-is-good.p6" pid="_E-s-ZItT0qXNoT5TP20hQ" hash="7idYOg">I have come to know that the acts of men, once governed by the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount, are in my day to a great extent governed by the whims of the persons committing the act. The excuse is that one has to “do his own thing.” And apparently the commandments are forgotten. But they have not been cancelled. They still stand as a beacon light on the way to eternal life—which is, of course, eternal happiness and joy.</p>

Five of them were repeated in section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants. [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42</a>] Others are spoken of in other sections.

To make the teaching effective, parents must live to deserve the honor children are commanded to give them. It is devastating to a child to learn that his father does not have integrity.</p>

And “to walk humbly with thy God” brings me close to him. These thoughts are repeated in section 11, verse 12 of the Doctrine and Covenants [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 11:12</a>].</p>

Anyone who ever heard her sing those words was lifted into resolve to make his life conform to the teaching. In the words from Psalm 24 the Psalmist first asks two questions: “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?” The answer comes with startling simplicity: “He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.” Then comes the promise: “He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/24.3-5" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 24:3–5</a>.) The Psalmist then goes on to assert that the generation thus obedient is the generation that truly seeks his face.</p>

We discover then that it is not difficult to follow the teaching of the Prophet Joseph Smith when he declared that we have as our standard of daily conduct to be “honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and [to do] good to all men” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:13</a>). For if one has clean hands and a pure heart, does justly, loves mercy, seeks not vanity, and walks humbly, the temptation to violate the Decalogue will hardly ever enter into his head.</p>

If in addition he loves and serves his fellowmen, he will add a chain of pearls and will find eternal life in the presence of his Heavenly Father and that Savior.</p>
