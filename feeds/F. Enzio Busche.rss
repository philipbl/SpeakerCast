      <description>I’m deeply touched by the spirit of this building, by the presence of a prophet of the Lord, by the presence of the members of the General Authorities, and by your presence. I pray that I will find words to express my feelings in this moment.</description>

I pray that I will find words to express my feelings in this moment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/they-didn-t-give-up.p2" pid="Ma0ouQnOEE-uQD2dQhxrJw" hash="wWy0xw">I’ve had many blessings in my life—spiritual blessings. I had good parents, a good education, material blessings like a good home. I always had enough to eat, always a bed to sleep in, and many, many other blessings. I had the opportunity of working in business capacities, and in this capacity, of seeing the world, seeing many people. I have had many opportunities, but the greatest blessing that has come to me came through humble missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/they-didn-t-give-up.p3" pid="mdS3mp1zVEmrRwF9BIsang" hash="7T8MvQ">I want to express gratitude for all that I have to these young men that came to our home—not only that they came, but that they had love enough not to give up. I was a very hard case. I had thought that through my education, and through my background, and my history, and my family that I would be superior. I felt pity for the missionaries. I said, “Well, this fine young man, with such a poor message!” They didn’t give up. They came again and again and again. And I felt an authority radiating through them that was stronger and more than all the knowledge that I had in my previous life—the authority of the true love of Christ. I want to give thanks to this generation of missionaries who did not give up and to the mission president who had concern enough not to withdraw the missionaries from me. It was Elder Theodore M. Burton. I will never forget that.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/they-didn-t-give-up.p4" pid="HLe7EOMsDUiiNc0RUgerdA" hash="0ewdpA">I will tell you that I’m deeply convinced that this is in my life the most important blessing I have ever received. It changed my life totally. I began to realize that a man can know nothing important in this world unless he has knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ restored by his prophet, Joseph Smith, and follow-through by a living prophet, Spencer W. Kimball. Without this message I would not have a family like I have now. I would not have the love for my lovely wife that I have now, and I would not be able to be so proud of my children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/they-didn-t-give-up.p5" pid="Zv1RepJNbUa4mlcWE2bejA" hash="ZmIrBw">Our oldest son is now another young man serving as a missionary in Manchester, England, and we are so proud of him. And a second boy is preparing to become a missionary next year.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/they-didn-t-give-up.p6" pid="0NP1ylxIl0Wp9Zm4LN5OmQ" hash="8tdiag">And now this call. It is beyond understanding for a human being. I need all your prayers. I promised the Lord when I went into the baptismal font and later in the temple that he could count on me. And I want to tell President Kimball that he can count on me. I have no other desire than to be a servant of the Lord. In his name, amen.</p>

This step seemed to be too big for me to take, but because I already had a testimony burning within me of the truthfulness of this work, I knew that withstanding baptism would take away my right to speak to my Father in Heaven again in prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p2" pid="KyJOsT2eF0ygR_Qwx77emQ" hash="An0QPg">So I accepted the challenge for baptism, with a fearful heart, but I told the missionaries that I would do it only on two conditions: First, that I would never be called to any Church position, and second, that I would never have to give a talk. Without the loving influence and the power and security of the Holy Ghost, which I received by the laying on of hands after baptism to help me, I could not have done anything in my various Church assignments by myself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p3" pid="NgUq0KZwjEuCUadjMMVZ9w" hash="cBKv_A">We, as members, have the privilege to bear witness of the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ through a divinely authorized man, Joseph Smith, in these latter days. As I bore this witness to a man just recently while I was serving as mission president in Germany, I saw that he felt very uneasy about my statement, and he, like so many others, responded with a question: “Don’t we all believe in the same God?” This question hurt me. It always hurts me when I see how many people are so indifferent and show such a lack of awareness in this most vital question in man’s life: Can I find thee, my Father in Heaven?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p4" pid="kYwmb65SdE2qt1tz-RBtyw" hash="PsODeQ">Yes, one could say that regardless of when, where, and in what circumstances we are raised, we all long for our Heavenly Father and desire after him, because we knew him before we came to this earth. But do we, on this earth, all believe in the same God? No—absolutely not! Men have created, in their use of free agency, all kinds of different interpretations of our Father in Heaven and the purpose of our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p5" pid="Nu-pBVPKv0i1_5uo8iYneg" hash="By799g">In our mortal existence there is no place for an uncertain, indifferent awareness of our responsibility and obligation to decide whom we should follow. Either we must attain a knowledge of our Creator and God, who loves us, who wants to bring peace, dignity, light, and happiness into our lives, or by and by we will forget our divine origin and remain in the foggy mists of the deceiver—the adversary, who cannot stand the fact that we, as living souls, did not accept his plan in our premortal lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p6" pid="U78CE8awXUyANup24mG2ag" hash="IbtwWA">He is fighting, with all of his knowledge, to lead men astray as they exercise their free agency, that he might make them his slaves. We are witnesses that the fear, hatred, despair, loneliness, and ugliness that people experience in their lives are the fruits of the influence of the adversary. It is obvious that his long-range, ungodly strategy to destroy our ability to truly love and have faith is aimed at these latter days before the second coming of the Savior, when a decision is required of every man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p7" pid="qdeMiZlFB0yQa3l7ie3DiQ" hash="DtirpA">If we do not decide to search out and accept the truth in the only way authorized by God, with all our might, mind, and strength, even when it means changing our lives completely, we will have built our house on sand. The half-truths of men, often mingled with scripture, are sometimes strong enough to fulfill the expectations of the people for a season or for a generation, but they can neither bring them along the path of exaltation and eternal life nor bring satisfying answers to the demanding problems of mankind in these days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p8" pid="1SOXC9SuWkOWwPZqUugC1g" hash="Bt348A">Receiving and accepting Jesus Christ and his plan of salvation in its fulness and its truth means leaving the world and its earthly desires behind and building Zion around ourselves. When Christ walked the earth to prepare the way for his disciples, standing in purity and bearing testimony of the truth, he was a light in the darkness, and the darkness knew him not (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.5" class="scriptureRef">John 1:5</a>). The darkness organized itself to destroy him. Christ knew that this would happen, not only to him but also to all his true disciples. He said, in speaking to his followers, in <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/10.22" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 10:22</a>, “And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/do-we-all-believe-in-the-same-god.p9" pid="SsXNw6yonk2INC4-Akmc6Q" hash="P0U06g">When we really follow Christ in his true restored church, it will be manifested in our lives. The fruit will follow. The Holy Ghost will lead us to make uncomfortable decisions, to develop true love and faith by learning to sacrifice and to discipline ourselves. Our abilities will grow and will bring satisfaction and joy and happiness. Through the instrument of an ongoing communication with our Heavenly Father—a constant prayer in our hearts for direction in the many little decisions in our lives—we feel the softness of the yoke of Christ, as he said in <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28,30" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:28, 30</a>:</p>

He wants them to forget that someday we all have to stand in the judgment of Christ and report our deeds and words. The Savior said in <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/12.36" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 12:36</a>, “But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”</p>

In our day the works of the deceiver of all the ages are being revealed by Christ through a living prophet. The disciples of Christ—the Saints of the latter days under the leadership of a living prophet, even Spencer W. Kimball—are taking the offensive to show the world the fruits of righteous living in the gospel of Jesus Christ. We testify with the angels that these are the days of warning for the people of the nations of the world, and that the time is near when it will be too late. We testify with the words of Amulek, a Book of Mormon prophet, recorded in <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.32-33" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:32–33</a> and <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/35.title" class="scriptureRef">Alma 35</a>:</p>

These powers are working through the innocent and the pure in heart as prophesied since the days of old. Thirty thousand missionaries are sent out to teach with this power, searching for those who are seeking the eternal principles of truth that they have been waiting for during their whole lifetime. Hundreds of thousands of priesthood holders and women witness daily—through their righteous lives, their example, and their testimonies—that they have been sealed by the Holy Ghost with the knowledge that these things are true, that the kingdom of God is in the process of establishment in these days to prepare for the second coming of the Savior.</p>

Nearly all the circumstances that have made family life in the past the most natural way for people to live together have changed—and it has all happened in the brief span of the last seventy years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p2" pid="Ri74ZdPyxEyaihH5uXsIaQ" hash="dafV_A">Just a little over a generation ago, members of the average family had to work a long day to provide a humble living, and the dark evenings found them huddled around a fire, enjoying one another’s company in singing and sharing personal experiences. This was the natural way for education and entertainment and was nearly the perfect environment for a harmonious family life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p3" pid="qEjwgYO_xkuFbFQfV5K-dQ" hash="sRdiYA">Today influences from literally unlimited sources through the media of radio, television, and print, together with numerous inventions of modern civilization, have drastically changed the historical cultural setting of the family. In this time of special challenge for marriage and the family, the Lord has restored, through his prophets in these latter days, the eternal dimension of that sacred covenant between husband and wife and has charged us with a new awareness of the real purpose of the family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/love-is-the-power-that-will-cure-the-family.p4" pid="A5H7Vm0_RU27WOUE9vPz7A" hash="-fWQHQ">The integrity of this covenant became the center of revealed gospel truths in these latter days, well summarized by the late prophet David O. McKay, who said, “No other success can compensate for failure in the home.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1964, p. 5.) It is obvious that in marriage today we cannot rely merely on patterns of the past without developing, perfecting, and putting into action that power that the Lord has given us as the greatest commandment—the commandment to love one another.</p>

It does not mean just to love the one who is nice, who behaves well and is respected, powerful, and influential. Our Heavenly Father, through his prophets in these latter days, calls us to develop the love of God as a power from above that cannot be threatened through outward circumstances. This love of God, according to the prophet Nephi of the Book of Mormon, has to be achieved and is “the most desirable above all things.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11:22</a>.)</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>.) We have to overcome this natural man—this “enemy to God”—our natural self. According to King Benjamin, we have to learn to listen to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and literally make a covenant with God, accepting the atonement of the Savior, and becoming as a child—submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, and willing to submit to all things, even as a child submits to his father.

One day when circumstances made it necessary for me to be at home at an unusual time, I witnessed from another room how our eleven-year-old son, just returning from school, was directing ugly words towards his younger sister. They were words that offended me—words that I had never thought our son would use. My first natural reaction in my anger was to get up and go after him. Fortunately, I had to walk across the room and open a door before I could reach him, and I remember in those few seconds I fervently prayed to my Heavenly Father to help me to handle the situation. Peace came over me. I was no longer angry.</p>

To my surprise I heard myself saying, “Welcome home, son!” and I extended my hand as a greeting. And then in a formal style I invited him to sit close to me in the living room for a personal talk. I heard myself expressing my love for him. I talked with him about the battle that every one of us has to fight each day within ourselves.</p>

What could have been a disastrous confrontation between father and son became, through the help from the powers above, one of the most beautiful experiences of our relationship that we both have never forgotten.</p>

He is becoming aware of how richly his life has been blessed since he began to listen to the spirit radiated by these two humble ambassadors of the Lord from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This truly is not an ordinary day, for on this day he was allowed, by invitation of the two young missionaries, to make a covenant with his Heavenly Father for the remission of his sins through baptism and to receive the Holy Ghost for himself.</p>

Oh, what great joy came into his heart as he learned from the missionaries that he is indeed literally a child of a loving Heavenly Father! With an ever-increasing light within himself, he now understands the true purpose of the pain, frustrations, and strugglings of his earlier life that became an instigating influence to make him think, to make him search, and to make him become an earnest seeker of the truth so that he was ready to listen as these two young men came knocking at his door.</p>

Suddenly he understands the deep, meaningful purpose of his life. He is now aware, in the depths of gratitude, of the many precious blessings of every day with its opportunities to serve and help. With an ever-increasing awareness of the need for constant repentance, he is able to fill all the hours of his life with the presence of this Spirit and, therefore, with great joy. He feels with each new day as if the sun of a beautiful spring morning is quickening and refreshing his soul after a long, dark, Arctic night.</p>

He is learning to understand that the only burden, the only pain, and the only frustration of a human being is the burden of wrongdoing—the burden of sin. “Oh, what a sacred experience,” he reflects, “to learn about myself and the majestic request by the Spirit to grow in the dimensions of honesty, to grow in the dimensions of exercising the pure love of Christ, to be able to forgive, to have patience, to understand, and to overcome laziness, procrastination, and other cravings of the carnal mind.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p1" pid="riSY4sat4ky9q4pDYxMOlw" hash="Azz8EA">I am overwhelmed with feelings of joy and deep gratitude to be able to participate in this gathering of the Saints of the latter days in this great conference. It is impossible to describe with words the feelings that Sister Busche and I share as we are now serving in the second year in one of the temples of the Lord. The dimensions of its sacredness and holiness continue to inspire us every day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p2" pid="k5gRR8rJ0U-w_wlGqujcCg" hash="guUwyw">Since our first visit to the temple thirty years ago, we have always revered and cherished the temple as a sacred place—a place of learning and a place of service—but now, after having been permitted to concentrate our minds and hearts for two years solely upon the purposes and holiness of the house of the Lord, it seems as if our souls have come to a new awakening. Our first awakening came when the gospel of Jesus Christ was manifested to us through the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, giving us an understanding of faith, repentance, and baptism. This time it is as if a veil has been removed from our spiritual minds and we see the same gospel, but in sharper focus, with clearer colors, and with added dimensions of understanding.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p3" pid="rgzBvyXusUuLzFsxRdiRdQ" hash="OVrwYw">This is not the time or the occasion for me to speak at any length or depth about the meaning and purpose of the temple, but I feel I should share some feelings with you that have grown during many quiet hours in the house of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p4" pid="q1PXxpidBUa9WZmAsh9QzA" hash="xqjr6w">It is certainly true that after we members have received our own endowment, we usually return to the house of the Lord to dedicate our time for the salvation of our ancestors. But, in the light of my experiences in being close to the house of the Lord, I have come to know that the Lord is urgently inviting <span class="emphasis">all</span> members of His church to prepare and to go to the temple, not only for their own ordinances for salvation and for their ancestors, but also for additional reasons. It has become my conviction that the temple is the only “university” for men to prepare spiritually for their graduation to eternal life. The temple is the place where the Lord wants us to make a sincere evaluation of our mortal lives. He wants us to know the consequences of the fact that this life is a probationary time, for it has been revealed to men of our day through the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. We read, for instance, in <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.24" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:24</a>:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p5" pid="UpYiixp7TESWvqtLNNYD_g" hash="arMDPQ">“And we see that death comes upon mankind, … which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p6" pid="CXGIpkLmfkeP0h84RN1kEQ" hash="_mxf9w">Understanding this, it seems to be imperative to ask ourselves these questions: How are we really doing? Is there a way to find out or to know where we are and whether we are on the right track?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p7" pid="CO4GjBPyyEi9iLiLiHxAnA" hash="1cEy5w">Again, I feel the answers to these questions are to be found in the Book of Mormon, in the forty-first chapter of Alma, verses 10–11:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p8" pid="-A65xkxbi0SZl3_RK-a5qQ" hash="Ga-oQw">“Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p9" pid="rm1nS2ikJUmXx69Onj4oNA" hash="pFF98g">“All men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; … they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.” [<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10-11" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10–11</a>]</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p10" pid="jT6_Jlkq9EKLYVTwoDaR_A" hash="UZtmNg">We all are prone, once in a while, to be in a state contrary to the nature of happiness, and not necessarily because we have pursued wickedness or iniquity to a full extent. But so long as we are in this earthly probationary state, the adversary can influence us. We may have become a little careless. We may have neglected our relationships with those closest to us—those who are our first responsibility—our spouse, our children, or our parents. Perhaps we may have permitted small bad habits or attitudes to enter into our lives; or perhaps we have even lost to some degree an understanding of the importance of keeping a covenant with exactness. If so, we are in a dangerous state. We must become aware of it. We cannot afford to ignore the situation. We may observe that for some time we are not really happy, that we must constantly force ourselves to smile, or perhaps that we are in a state close to depression. One may not yet have formally broken a covenant, or may even still manage to hide behind a facade of happiness. Although we might deceive others, we cannot deceive ourselves, and we cannot deceive the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p11" pid="bmwYmOjiyk2Y6qn6xSIZcw" hash="Py8xMQ">When the Spirit of the Lord is withdrawn even in part, we feel it, though we may know little or nothing about the gospel of Jesus Christ or the plan of salvation. When any child of God breaks any of the laws of God, which are the laws of righteousness, the Spirit of Christ, which, according to the scriptures, gives “light to every man” will be withdrawn to some degree. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:46</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:37</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.9" class="scriptureRef">John 1:9</a>.) Shadows of darkness will fall upon the soul, and, in this state, an <span class="emphasis">awareness</span> of what is happening to us is essential.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p12" pid="y63H5yb9IEW7fsEWzkNW7w" hash="AFgnvA">The gospel in its fulness is being preached throughout the world by the Lord’s anointed servants, that everyone may come to an awareness of his state. In order to be close to the words of the Lord’s anointed, it is necessary to read and study the scriptures with commitment and dedication. What we have seen or felt, or what we have learned from the lessons others have learned after much tribulation can make it possible for us to avoid going through the same suffering ourselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p13" pid="PdPAN99peEyex4I6G5ojcw" hash="_ouMPg">For instance, we of this day and age can today feel and learn from the teachings of the prophet Alma in the Book of Mormon, as though we were listening to him preach more than two thousand years ago:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p14" pid="DrIgur2CekewrnR3eKsPww" hash="2cVRrg">“If our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not been found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p15" pid="UiR7JPx4jkKW67rmgL7MJQ" hash="Hia2ZA">“For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p16" pid="bxNrmtkUnUeZKak8dU_RdA" hash="JgAviw">“But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power to save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.13-15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:13–15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p17" pid="GWqrEqMf40O31DCnCSaq2A" hash="RnUJtg">My dear brothers and sisters, the Lord does not want us to become aware of our state of nothingness and misery (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.11" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.7" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 12:7</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:10</a>) only at the Day of Judgment. Now and every day in our mortal lives, He wants to sharpen our awareness, that we may become our own judges, as He calls us to a continuous process of repentance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p18" pid="lIXXJTTerkKPciBSS6ZjiA" hash="U5DpnQ">After Alma had spoken about repentance and desires of righteousness until the end of life, he said, “They … are redeemed of the Lord; … for behold, they are their own judges.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.7" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:7</a>.) The Apostle Paul also explained, as stated in <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.31" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 11:31</a>: “For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p19" pid="tNjM5o2UKUySu3dnv4tQUA" hash="fxjb_g">It seems that we can only effectively go through the process of continuous repentance if we literally learn to become our own judges. We ourselves and the Lord are the only ones who really know us. We do not even know ourselves unless we have learned to walk the lonely and most challenging road toward self-honesty, as constantly prompted by the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p20" pid="_9j1qAK0WkuSAAM2MNsWzA" hash="rzRasw">This is the sacrifice we have to learn to offer. Nobody will ever be able to understand or even to accept principles of truth unless he or she, to some degree, has developed a painful awareness of the dimensions of self-honesty. Without the capability to recognize truth, we will not be really free: we will be slaves to habits or prejudices heavily covered with excuses. But learning to become aware of the depth of the dimensions of truth will make us free. We cannot remove a stumbling block unless we see it first. We cannot grow unless we know what is holding us back.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p21" pid="Unk-WbfZJESkWRiGFvVSJA" hash="IIcCOg">My dear brothers and sisters, I know of no better place where we can grow in the understanding of the principles of honesty than in the house of the Lord. I know of no better place to learn to grow in the dimensions of becoming our own judge than in the house of the Lord. We have reason to rejoice because the understanding that this life is a time for men to prepare to meet God has come to us while we still have time to consider the consequences of this message. We are still alive, and our probationary state is not yet over. Temples have been erected as houses of the Lord. They are standing ready to serve as instruments to our own gradual awakening to the full dimensions of truth on our inevitable road to eternity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p22" pid="c2aJ3TS-JkKiJxszMYo9Ig" hash="zfSNng">I personally have been humbled deeply in these days of quietness in the temple as I have been granted a deeper understanding of the nothingness of man, the need for a process of continuous repentance, and the need for temple covenants, which are based upon the principles of the atonement of Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p23" pid="EnYl5BQwmUWzzolvWLkaXg" hash="FPerPQ">I know that the Lord Jesus Christ lives. I know that this is His church. I know that He stands at the helm of this work. It is a great joy to see the continuously increasing numbers of members who are understanding the importance of the temple for their own spiritual education and, therefore, for their own spiritual preparation for eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/university-for-eternal-life.p24" pid="hV_ZLpKP7kWo4MLRNyWilQ" hash="auT4ig">I leave you this testimony as your brother and your servant, and I do this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/truth-is-the-issue.p2" pid="zej43y_i90yWnqgnn4u2Pw" hash="qTv0jg">This message of warning reminds us that we human beings are spiritual children of a Father in Heaven, who is the author and finisher of all truth, and that we are lost in this earthly, fallen state unless we allow the Light of Christ, or the Spirit of truth, to become our constant and infinite guide.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/truth-is-the-issue.p3" pid="lWkbfQcGokGeVF6vD4-SRw" hash="-imZnw">In the message of the Restoration, we learn that during our mortal life our agency is tested through the inseparable connection of our spirit with the elements of this earth, “the flesh,” or the “natural man” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:15</a>). By this revelation we not only understand the cause of mankind’s misery, but we also receive the keys and power that enable us to end this misery once and for all. As our mind is opened through our study of the plan of salvation, each of us comes to see that our life means that the “real me,” or “the spiritual child of God,” created in innocence and beauty, is engaged in a fight for life or death with the elements of the earth, the “flesh,” which, in its present unredeemed state, is enticed and influenced by the enemy of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/truth-is-the-issue.p4" pid="vh9GV9zYrEyLNbix4YEJNQ" hash="DmtX-Q">From the revelations of the Book of Mormon, we know that this enemy fights with all fury and cunningness to make all men miserable like unto himself (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>). It is Jesus Christ who, through His light, is searching and finding each individual child of God who is yearning and fighting for righteousness and truth and who is crying for help. Without Christ, this war within us is lost. Without Christ’s plan of redemption and His atoning sacrifice, we all would have been lost. We knew that before we came to this earth, and we can sense it again, when through the Light of Christ our minds are quickened with understanding (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:11</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/truth-is-the-issue.p5" pid="u1u5AfgmukKYnS2YYRdsJQ" hash="ksJcaA">The issue is <span class="emphasis">truth,</span> my dear brothers and sisters, and the only way to find <span class="emphasis">truth</span> is through uncompromising self-education toward self-honesty to see the original “real me,” the child of God, in its innocence and potential in contrast to the influence from the other part of me, “the flesh,” with its selfish desires and foolishness. Only in that state of pure honesty are we able to see truth in its complete dimension. Honesty may not be everything, but everything is <span class="emphasis">nothing</span> without honesty. In its final state, honesty is a gift of the Spirit through which the true disciples of Christ feel the force to bear testimony of the truth in such a powerful way that it penetrates the very core of our existence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/truth-is-the-issue.p6" pid="B0qWT5myuUqdym_mAj1TJQ" hash="RGvjRg">One great example of the effect of the preaching of the prophets is recorded in the Book of Mormon. King Benjamin, out of love and concern for the welfare of his people, preaches the truth of the plan of salvation. He does this in such an uncompromising, pure way that the people come to a complete awareness of their nothingness and their worthless and fallen state (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.5" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:5</a>). This last step of awareness of honesty, where we see ourselves in our sinful, mortal existence, causes the people of King Benjamin to cry aloud with one voice, “O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:2</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/truth-is-the-issue.p7" pid="5KUfQbWtmEiywy7HjyBe3A" hash="d7Zpuw">Initiated by the hearing of the word of truth, a disciple of Christ is therefore constantly, even in the midst of all regular activities, striving all day long through silent prayer and contemplation to be in the depth of self-awareness to keep him in the state of meekness and lowliness of heart. It is the prophet Moroni who points out that “because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.26" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 8:26</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/truth-is-the-issue.p9" pid="GNMkR4bKh0yweZTVf6z-sg" hash="K-yYcQ">This war is a war that has to be fought by all of Heavenly Father’s children, whether they know about it or not. But without a keen knowledge of the plan of salvation, and without the influence of the divine Light of Christ to bring us awareness, this war is being fought subconsciously, and therefore its battlefronts are not even known to us, and we have no chance to win. Wars in the inner self that are fought subconsciously, with unknown battlefronts, lead to defeats which also hurt us subconsciously. These defeats are reflected in our conscious life as expressions of misery, such as a lack of self-confidence, lack of happiness and joy, lack of faith and testimony, or as overreactions of our subconscious self, which we see then as pride, arrogance, or in other forms of misbehavior—even as acts of cruelty and indecency.</p>

Our brain, the great computer where all the facts of life’s memories are held together, can also be programmed by the “flesh,” with its self-centered ideas to deceive the spiritual self. Without the constant striving through prayer and contemplation to reach the ends of self-awareness and honesty, our so-called intellect can, therefore, based on look-alike truths, play many games of reason, to impress, to get gain, to intimidate, or even to manipulate truth with the vain results of deceit.</p>

In such striving, we suddenly know how to pray. Paul says, “For we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.26" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/truth-is-the-issue.p16" pid="KanJPR-Z1UacE8hvZX2rjg" hash="0YJHeA">Enlightened by the Spirit of truth, we will then be able to pray for the increased ability to endure truth and not to be made angry by it (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.28" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:28</a>). In the depth of such a prayer, we may finally be led to that lonesome place where we suddenly see ourselves naked in all soberness. Gone are all the little lies of self-defense. We see ourselves in our vanities and false hopes for carnal security. We are shocked to see our many deficiencies, our lack of gratitude for the smallest things. We are now at that sacred place that seemingly only a few have courage to enter, because this is that horrible place of unquenchable pain in fire and burning. This is that place where true repentance is born. This is that place where the conversion and the rebirth of the soul are happening. This is the place where the prophets were before they were called to serve. This is the place where converts find themselves before they can have the desire to be baptized for the remission of their sins. This is the place where sanctifications and rededications and renewal of covenants are happening. This is the place where suddenly the atonement of Christ is understood and embraced. This is the place where suddenly, when commitments have solemnly been established, the soul begins to “sing the song of redeeming love” and indestructible faith in Christ is born (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:26</a>). This is the place where we suddenly see the heavens open as we feel the full impact of the love of our Heavenly Father, which fills us with indescribable joy. With this fulfillment of love in our hearts, we will never be happy anymore just by being ourselves or living our own lives. We will not be satisfied until we have surrendered our lives into the arms of the loving Christ, and until He has become the doer of all our deeds and He has become the speaker of all our words. As He has said,</p>

And let us embrace the Spirit of truth that we may stand blameless through the atonement of our Lord. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p2" pid="TB_19spCpkibRI3k3r3UHQ" hash="grv1wA">This young man with the name Joseph Smith became, in the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ, the instrument to restore to mankind the knowledge of the long-lost and nearly forgotten truth: the knowledge about us human beings—who we are, where we came from, what the meaning and purpose of our earthly existence is, and why mankind has experienced so much misery and injustice. Eventually answers were also given to mankind’s questions of life after death and our final destiny.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p3" pid="9ttFcejELkCqhIkZu67ffg" hash="kojs-g">Even to this day, more than 42 years after I accepted, by my own choice, the Lord’s sacred covenant of baptism, I am still in a state of awe at all of the marvelous and miraculous happenings of the Restoration. Not only were we permitted to learn all about the essential meaning of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, but also the important meaning of the priesthood of God was revealed, and it was restored for us to act in caring love and patience to bring about the choice of salvation to all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p4" pid="07WsI-gBq06JKxruhR1--A" hash="xTPiMQ">Time will not allow me to talk more about the details of this marvelous work in our time, but I feel to talk about one key aspect in the Lord’s kingdom that, if not understood, may result in the fact that the whole picture may never be quite in focus.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p5" pid="nYYh3PPuQEWZ6IzlsZTzLQ" hash="1dsolg">In order to come to the point, I want to tell you of a faithful brother who was a member of the same branch in my home country of Germany in the early years of my membership.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p6" pid="QSCgWA1tMECzf9ysRK_b8A" hash="ZcVvNg">He was living in humble circumstances and felt very blessed to have recently begun a job in a small, privately owned company. He told me about an upcoming event where all of the employed people were invited to participate in a traditional company dinner party. He was concerned because he knew that there would be a big beer party at the end of this meeting, with the boss being probably the heaviest beer drinker of them all. But he also knew that it would be considered very impolite if he did not attend the dinner at all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p7" pid="Yj2Vhydgq0m9AIdY-RhAug" hash="bfECoQ">When I saw him again, after that dinner event occurred, I saw him with a most happy, deep inner glow, and he could not wait to tell me what had happened. Because he was new in the company, the boss had sat right next to him, wanting to get to know him better. As the evening progressed, the brother saw his wildest fears confirmed because the boss would not tolerate that he would not drink beer with him, and he said, “What kind of church is that that would not permit you to drink even a glass of beer with me?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p8" pid="awQuhF8y-EqSYmX96TmVpA" hash="Dwqipw">The fear of my friend did not grow into panic as he was able to calmly answer his boss that the reason he was not drinking had nothing to do with the church that he belonged to, but that <span class="emphasis">he</span> himself had made a sacred covenant with God that he would not drink. If he would ever break this covenant, how could he continue to stay true to that which he would ever promise, and how could he be trusted, even by his employer, that he would not lie or steal or cheat.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p9" pid="VXHiIOLGDUq_fxDbyJwqBw" hash="SVdYVw">According to my friend, the owner was deeply touched by this statement, and he hugged him, speaking words of profound admiration and confidence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p10" pid="BbKb2oJdHEmsFDEcsStK4Q" hash="NhkO9w">My dear brothers and sisters, in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, many new members, specifically when they come from countries other than the United States, learn for the first time the true dimension of the word <span class="emphasis">freedom.</span> Freedom for most people of the world means “freedom from” the absence of malice or pain or suppression. But the freedom that God means when He deals with us goes one step further. He means “freedom to”—the freedom to act in the dignity of our own choice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p11" pid="i1QHmCHxx0yvUZ_EZW__6w" hash="qIGZ3w">What then does it mean to be free? Freedom means to have matured to the full knowledge of our dangerously many responsibilities as a human being. We have learned that everything we do, and even say or think, has consequences. We realize that too long we have believed that we were victims of circumstances. In the Gospel of John, 8:32, we read the following: “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p12" pid="Bp7FcZQVQUK5lRe9ZGJxNg" hash="UG05iA">As we open our hearts to the message of God’s truth, as it was restored in our time, we begin to understand why there was, and still is, so much misery, pain, suffering, and even starvation. In the same dimension as we are learning to accept the revealed truth in our own life, our faith in the living Son of God will grow, and therefore we will receive spiritual gifts of heretofore unknown capacity. We will learn that nothing is impossible for those who believe in Jesus Christ. False bondages will be loosened. Narrow thinking born in tragedies of false traditions will disappear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p13" pid="2xJK1gw13kCgDUG_mXArjw" hash="OAlUKA">The more our understanding of the vastness and the completeness of the plan of salvation is developing, the more we see ourselves in our smallness, in our incompleteness. And seeing ourselves in that humility, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, will let us understand and finally accept this most sacred covenant with our Heavenly Father in the form of baptism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p14" pid="Rz4kWL4LBEuo3ULfKvhAJw" hash="bgxZtg">We gladly will submit ourselves into this covenant, knowing that there is a big difference between mere desire and covenant. When we just desire something, we will work towards achieving it only when convenient. But when we are bound by a sacred covenant, like baptism, we are learning to overcome all obstacles through obedience, and in so doing we will be blessed with the presence of the Spirit and therefore eventually with achievement. We are beginning to become alive as we take, knowingly, full responsibility for our own life and as we stop blaming circumstances.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p15" pid="0ESGQBW220qhFNOIYsA5lw" hash="6zAVlA">One thing, of course, we know: having “freedom to” means that we have the potential of making wrong choices. Wrong choices have their merciless consequences, and when they are not stopped and corrected they lead us into misery and pain. Wrong choices, if not corrected, will lead us to the ultimate possible disaster in each person’s life: to become separated from our Heavenly Father in the world to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p16" pid="ycUOuDO6QUyPyso6jNSXdg" hash="lZEBiA">When we have received this life-enabling message, we begin to understand that in our earlier life we were like a football player standing in the middle of the field, totally depressed because we did not know the purpose and the rules of the game. We did not know which team we belonged to, and we didn’t even know who was our coach. Only in the awareness of the restored gospel, our game plan becomes clear, and we comprehend that Jesus Christ and His restored Church and priesthood are the only way for us to succeed in our earthly experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p17" pid="-ywWwEs4iE-eD67LOduhcQ" hash="Hs7oTw">Jesus Christ wants to empower our lives, according to our own righteous choices, to that dimension that, through our faith and our doings, the circumstances whose prisoners we were in the past will eventually change. In the Book of Mormon we learn that the Redeemer monitors our lives, together with a multitude of holy angels. We read:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p18" pid="eBt05yJHhkuIfA5PRGhRRw" hash="34-6QA">“Have miracles ceased? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/freedom-from-or-freedom-to.p20" pid="Bn3xBkXQLkeCXei-xcRVEQ" hash="ZIISJQ">In this freedom that we have received in our time, through our understanding of His divine plan for us, we stand in our full responsibility. Let us always stay close to the loving, caring hand of our Redeemer and our Savior to find safety and joy. I say this in deep humility. And I bear you my testimony as your brother and servant that I know that Jesus lives and that He is the head of this work. I say this in Jesus’ name, amen.</p>
