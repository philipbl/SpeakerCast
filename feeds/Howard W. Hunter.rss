The color of the container, the attractiveness of the wrapping, or the shape of the package has an effect upon the consumer’s decision to buy. The visual image often makes or loses the sale. A dish of ice cream is enjoyed by nearly everyone, but it is often improved by ribbons of chocolate cascading down the sides, a fluff of whipped cream around the base, a light sprinkling of chopped nuts, and a cherry on top. Eyes open wider and lips smack with each addition that is made. The same principle applies to the teaching of lessons. Good visual aids and instructional materials increase the interest and assist in the learning processes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/prepare-every-needful-thing.p2" guid="a1f0cbaf-c9d8-498c-af4f-e667d3117115" pid="KUFmKc90Mku3elfcUgUdCw" hash="fXGhog">Meetinghouse libraries have come into being and are being stocked with instructional materials to be used by the teachers in the Church to create more interest in lessons, to display them in the most attractive way to sell the idea, to visualize the point, to teach the gospel. Meetinghouse libraries add the chocolate and the nuts, and they put the cherry on top. The teaching may be excellent, but the materials from the library make it better. Abstract ideas may be difficult to understand, but when principles can be visually demonstrated to students, they comprehend more readily.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/prepare-every-needful-thing.p3" guid="94132b77-a314-48fb-a214-35f6e1656548" pid="nB-BEmjuY0GHekLaJQhuwA" hash="Sj17ow">A discussion of the travels of Paul through the old part of the world is interesting; yet names such as Cyprus, Galatia, Macedonia, Ephesus, or Thessalonica are often unlocated places in our minds. Picture a teacher with a group of enthusiastic students around a large colored map. As the story is being told, they place pins at the points in Paul’s travels, then stretch different colored yarns from pin to pin to show his different missionary travels and his last journey to Rome. Now the lesson becomes fascinating. A picture is worth a thousand words. Advertisers know this, merchants know this, but no one knows it better than the teacher who is anxious about his or her students.</p>

The Church was less than one year old when the Lord gave a revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith at Kirtland in which teaching was mentioned in these words:</p>

This is how he said it should be done: “Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.119" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:119</a>.)</p>

This committee supervises the meetinghouse library program, which has been in operation for only a short time. Details of the program were carried to all areas of the Church during the first half of last year. A number of publications have been issued concerning the establishment and operation of the program.

Regardless of the number of wards or branches meeting in the building, one library would serve all of them. Plans and specifications for such a facility may be secured from the Church Building Department. There are five alternate plans that make it possible to have a meetinghouse library in every type of Church building.</p>

Equipment should include motion picture, slide, and overhead projectors; audio-tape and record players; a spirit duplicator; a screen; a dry-mount press; and other equipment as needed. Instructional materials to be included are books, magazines, manuals, handbooks, music, printed articles, pictures, charts, maps, slides, filmstrips, overhead transparencies, motion picture films, and other types of teaching materials that would be used by teachers.</p>

The quality of teaching will be greatly improved by the implementation of this library of instructional materials, and it will be needed in every meetinghouse. The statistics presented yesterday to the meeting of the Regional Representatives of the Twelve indicate that 72 percent of our meetinghouses now have such libraries. We strongly urge that those who have been slow in moving forward do so as rapidly as possible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/prepare-every-needful-thing.p15" guid="572f4dc8-18bd-4277-9edd-6d6f6aac5c0e" pid="gKD0ekK1iUWtPlwful0gIQ" hash="lCZc2A">Now we come to the portion of the program which makes the library a vital part of teaching. There has just come from the press this booklet that I hold in my hand. You are not close enough to see its contents, but let me explain them to you. This is known as the <span class="emphasis">Instructional Materials Catalog. </span>In this publication are miniature illustrations of all the pictures related to topics now being taught in all the classes of the priesthood and auxiliary organizations, together with all those that will be taught during the coming year. All picture packets for lessons for the year 1972–73 are to be eliminated, and it will be necessary for materials normally supplied through packets to be ordered, filed, and circulated by and through the meetinghouse library for use in classes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/prepare-every-needful-thing.p16" guid="e37d9d27-c80e-46de-b347-23e95adf224f" pid="Xi4u8Wy0o06dx_QNv3_9gQ" hash="iNOAyg">In this catalog, each of the pictures has been given an identification number. They will be ordered from the General Church Distribution Center by this number, and they will be filed in the library by this number. Lesson manuals will make reference in each lesson to the materials to be used by this standard number. The catalog will be available to the libraries and to all teachers. The writers of lessons will have this standard reference work available while preparing future lessons so they can prescribe materials that will be in the library. These visual aids will be referred to in the lesson manuals by the library number.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/prepare-every-needful-thing.p17" guid="ffeafe29-6299-4c29-b06b-4b0a9246ffad" pid="cnpZ6eoMQUiiArClZJqvKA" hash="_J-WYg">The <span class="emphasis">Instructional Materials Catalog </span>is in loose-leaf form so it can be expanded to include additional materials for future lessons. Many other types of materials will be added also, such as overhead transparencies, motion pictures, filmstrips, slides, tapes, and other media.</p>

The well-organized, adequately stocked, and competently staffed library will become the nerve center of the ward or branch for more excellence in teaching. You can now see why it is important to move forward in every meetinghouse to “prepare every needful thing,” as stated in the revelation from the Lord, for Churchwide uniformity in teaching assistance to all priesthood and auxiliary organizations. We encourage each member of the priesthood to make use of the meetinghouse library. Its purpose is to provide you, as well as the sisters who have teaching functions within the Church, with the materials and equipment to increase the quality of teaching.</p>

It is guided by the hand of our Heavenly Father to make teaching in the Church more effective. It has the immediate promise to increase the activity of the entire membership of the Church through making the messages of the gospel more vital in our lives. I pray we may be successful in this effort to “prepare every needful thing,” in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

He called attention to the fact that young people today are following divergent courses to those traveled by their parents. The speaker pointed out the concern of parents for their children, whom they believe are being misdirected by the modern-day innovations of society.</p>

He then took a position on the side of youth, claiming that there must be this generation gap if the world is to make real progress because parents are from the past generation, and we need new thinking, new ideas, and a change from the old. His contention was that if children follow the same course as parents, there would never be progress; therefore, we must accept the new even though it is forced by an uprising of the modern generation against the established ways of the past. He asked this question: “Who can say that the old is better than the new until it is tried and tested?”</p>

The relationship between the two would become stronger because of this adjustment, which would weld together the old and the young as their differences were resolved through intellectual compromise.</p>

Who is the prophet Elijah who is to come before the great and dreadful day of the Lord? Let me review some of the highlights of his life.</p>

The events with which he was associated occurred in the ninth century before the birth of Christ. This great prophet was one of the leaders in defending Jehovah as the true God of Israel against those who were advancing Baal worship. His life is associated with many miracles.</p>

The prophet went to the east of Jordan by the brook Cherith. The brook provided him with water, and the Lord caused him to be fed by ravens morning and night. Because of the drouth, the brook dried up and he sought another refuge.</p>

Elijah found her at the gate of the city and asked for water and bread. The widow answered: “As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/17.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 17:12</a>.)</p>

Ahab married Jezebel, the daughter of the King of Tyre, where the god Baal was worshiped. She brought her religion with her, introduced Baalism to the Hebrews, and carried on an attack against the religion of the Hebrews and against Israel’s God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/elijah-the-prophet.p14" guid="a355286e-c33d-4f06-9ca6-ac3cba109688" pid="--Qd-YYW0EykiLgojFFIWg" hash="RPa-7g">When Elijah went to King Ahab to tell him of the end of the drouth, Ahab accused him of causing trouble in Israel. Elijah charged Ahab with forsaking the commandments of the Lord and following Baal. He challenged the prophets of Baal, supported by Jezebel, to come to Mount Carmel and determine whether the Lord or Baal was God.</p>

The contest was to build two altars—one for the Lord and the other for Baal—and to place thereon sacrificial bullocks on unkindled wood. Whichever deity answered by fire would be accepted as God. The 450 prophets commenced first. They called upon Baal from morning until noon but there was no answer. In their frenzy, they leaped about the altar and cut themselves with their knives and lancets till the blood gushed out, but still no answer.</p>

He called for barrels of water to be poured on the sacrifice he had prepared, and he said: “… Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</p>

The very first written revelation of this dispensation, being the statement of the Angel Moroni to the Prophet Joseph Smith, repeats almost the same words used by Malachi and indicates that Elijah was yet to come. Eight years later, a few days after the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery had finished praying together in the temple when a marvelous vision was manifested to them. Let me read just a few lines as recorded in the 110th section of the Doctrine and Covenants: “The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened.”</p>

How will they be judged in the absence of this knowledge? Peter said that after Christ was crucified, “but quickened by the Spirit … he went and preached unto the spirits in prison.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.18-19" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 3:18–19</a>.) Then he adds, “For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/4.6" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 4:6</a>.) Thus, those who die without knowledge of the gospel will have the opportunity to hear and accept it and to accept baptism.</p>

Is there anything unreasonable about the living performing the baptisms for the dead? Perhaps the greatest example of vicarious work for the dead is the Master himself. He gave his life as a vicarious atonement, that all who die shall live again and have life everlasting. He did for us what we could not do for ourselves. In a similar way we can perform ordinances for those who did not have the opportunity to do them in lifetime.</p>

The sealing of family units can be continued until the family of God is made perfect. This is the great work of the dispensation of the fulness of times, by which the hearts of the fathers are turned to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers. The uniting and redemption of the family of God was the divine plan before the foundations of the earth were laid.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/elijah-the-prophet.p33" guid="96a835f9-3c13-4506-865c-64f7ca514c3f" pid="yhcM3RDp302kMaIatSoHtA" hash="byrQuw">I bear witness that the same prophet who was fed by the ravens, by the never-depleting handful of meal and cruse of oil, who brought back life to the widow’s son, whose sacrifice was consumed by an unkindled fire, who was taken into heaven in a chariot of fire, has appeared in this day, as foretold by Malachi. He is turning the hearts of this and the past generations toward each other.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/elijah-the-prophet.p34" guid="8c7da829-55a1-43e3-bed9-61df377ad3df" pid="MAjE5MzrXEGwDh1lhwtcYQ" hash="xODi2A">Prior to the building of temples in this dispensation and the appearance of Elijah, there was little interest in seeking out and identifying families of the past. Since temples have been built, genealogical interest in the world has increased at an accelerating rate. The gathering of hundreds of people to Salt Lake City, representing forty-five nations, for the World Conference on Records is a demonstration of this great interest.</p>

Could the words of Malachi mean that the mission of Elijah in the last days would be to resolve differences between parents and children, restore domestic tranquillity, and close the generation gap? Of course not. Revelation in this day has given us the true meaning. Let me read to you the words of Joseph Smith in answer to the question:</p>

Amos brought this understanding into sharp focus by his prediction of a spiritual famine. He said: “… not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p7" guid="0c055da2-c7c7-4c7b-b5e7-a721f8b58af7" pid="pDIGg5QG9kGhcu5gEcRohw" hash="AWRKmg">They seek to find the solution without building on the rock of revelation, as the Lord said must be done, if the gates of hell are not to prevail against it. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.17-18" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:17–18</a>.) This problem has engaged the minds of good and sincere men before and since the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in this dispensation.</p>

In it he asked questions that were then unanswered and are unanswered for many individuals of our time. He said this:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p9" guid="a25b807f-fec9-49af-8003-525392053799" pid="24Me7PxMi0CtMz_fOHy4Vw" hash="MZTfCg">“And it is my duty to say to you that the need was never greater of new revelation than now. … In how many churches, by how many prophets, tell me, is man made sensible that he is an infinite Soul? … It is the office of a true teacher to show us that God is, not was; that He speaketh, not spake. … Men have come to speak of … revelation as somewhat long ago given and done, as if God were dead.” (See <span class="emphasis">The Complete Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, </span>pp. 37–45.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p10" guid="77e75245-a15e-41e6-b75f-9805003af0f6" pid="3jwOIa3o6EWQY-QV14BC7w" hash="oZ-Icw">That is an interesting statement to have been made nearly a century and a half ago. It has the sound of an echo from some of today’s modern pulpits.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p11" guid="937b3082-d784-4b28-a46a-5a8561444d6f" pid="LE-kGskzkkqHJZW34y2dPg" hash="8Bkc7Q">Over a hundred years later, the educator Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul described this condition in modern Christian churches in these words: “We have the peculiar spectacle of a nation, which to a limited extent practices Christianity without actively believing in Christianity. We are asked to turn to the church for enlightenment but when we do we find that the voice of the church is not inspired. The voice of the church today is the echo of our own voices. … The way out is the sound of a voice, not our voice. … It is the task of the pastors to hear this voice, cause us to hear it and tell us what it says. … Without it we are no more capable of saving the earth than we were capable of creating it in the first place.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p12" guid="7ce92a66-d27e-47f2-ac69-c7a500683759" pid="bFJvNNk7qUiiBGvHedqZEw" hash="hiXUaw">Louis Cassels, a senior editor of United Press International, recently remarked that public interest in religion has declined because people “are sick and tired of being told what they can’t believe. They want to know what, if anything, they can believe,” he said, “and many churches haven’t been doing a very good job of answering that question.” He ended with the warning that “if you persist in handing out stones when people ask for bread, they’ll finally quit coming to the bakery.” (<span class="emphasis">Christianity Today,</span> Oct. 23, 1970.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p13" guid="82c01710-bce8-45f2-81ae-48c01a3e750f" pid="7s4MyUaUj0OiSbctftH1ug" hash="GOc2ZA">The Gallup poll revealed in early 1967 that the majority of Americans—fifty-seven percent—say religion is losing its influence on American life. Ten years previously the proportion holding this view was 14 percent, only one-fourth as large. “This represents,” said polltaker George Gallup, “one of the most dramatic shifts in surveys on American life.” Surely we would agree that in the five years since that survey was made, there has been further deterioration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p14" guid="c362bd20-61c4-4b3e-9265-022702a36ac9" pid="XQd9Un0lF0CzCTCCoBjWcg" hash="cHblew">In the year 1820, just prior to the time Ralph Waldo Emerson made his statement to the Cambridge Divinity School that “the need was never greater for new revelation than now,” the Prophet Joseph Smith went into a grove of trees near his home and inquired of God which church he should join. The same confusion existed in his mind that exists in the minds of countless millions today, but the answer given him by the Lord takes away the uncertainty, for he said that “all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; … ‘they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.’” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p15" guid="c20e48d5-b1f1-4f48-a254-8d504c733ee1" pid="511RE6-dREOokZ5gd45lpQ" hash="mh9Vvw">For the world generally, this condition has not changed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p16" guid="6ba031c3-eebe-43a5-b083-df46c3c3f2b7" pid="Si-4Q-fasEKkgXmMC_ylpA" hash="R2G1rg">After the long period of apostasy from the true church established by Christ during his personal ministry, a sure foundation for the kingdom of God was laid through the restoration of the priesthood and the gospel by the principles of divine revelation in this dispensation of time. The priesthood, authority to act in the name of God, was restored through visits of John the Baptist and of Peter, James, and John, who held its keys during the Savior’s sojourn on earth. Other messengers, mighty prophets and leaders, including Elias, Elijah, and Moses, appeared and restored the essential keys of the kingdom. The Book of Mormon, a new witness for Jesus Christ, was revealed through the angel Moroni.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p17" guid="d1ca24a6-c964-4e5c-a3ae-a53b51c2ad24" pid="_jrrvUa80E6dpo7naLi84g" hash="QT1S1A">Revelation followed revelation, as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. The foundation was laid for the organization that would govern the kingdom of God, even until it should cover the whole earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p18" guid="074f4e31-5618-4c6b-b61a-c3c556d34889" pid="VUcsHrC7QEWPk7X8_LIesQ" hash="SqQ0lw">In a little over 140 years, a miracle has been achieved as the priesthood has administered the restored gospel. Temples have been erected on this continent and in other places in the world. Houses of worship dot many lands of the globe. A desert has been made to bloom as a rose. Over 16,000 full-time missionaries are proclaiming the gospel in many lands. Elementary schools, high schools, seminaries, institutes of religion, and colleges in many countries give instruction to more than a quarter of a million young people daily, not only in the elements of secular learning, but in the eternal truths of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p19" guid="dd62df39-e336-49f5-8ef5-fbd608bb32b9" pid="jH_nQQqnaEupiPd68dVE7g" hash="Jsp7-A">Most important is the fact that down through its history, including this very day, the Church has had a prophet, seer, and revelator. At the head of the Church is Jesus Christ, who directs his prophet, presently Harold B. Lee. His counselors, the members of the Council of the Twelve, and the Patriarch to the Church are also prophets, seers, and revelators. The more than three million members of the Church do not have to listen to an uncertain trumpet. They can believe the voice of their leaders, knowing they are guided by the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p20" guid="2272ed43-2048-4a5f-8868-ad1d14cb980d" pid="GI3JmrPthE-y4b8fsS_6AQ" hash="z1Flww">The church of Jesus Christ provides maximum opportunity for involvement of its members. From early youth to the last years of life, satisfying and meaningful activity and responsibility are available to all who are worthy and willing. This promotes the deep satisfaction and emotional well-being which the gospel of Jesus Christ should bring into every human life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p21" guid="10c8a595-f126-4059-a8ec-79a1db88280b" pid="FMc0rH6MA0CzeUXJ6fvkWQ" hash="A6ZRHA">Youth is trained from the earliest age to take part in Primary and Sunday School. At twelve years worthy young men receive the Aaronic Priesthood and, in a sense, begin an apprenticeship that prepares them for the many roles of leadership they will assume throughout their lifetime.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p22" guid="3849c636-1102-4409-9f2f-8ffe97297064" pid="9aTR23ILFE-Bzn9ZIpnfLg" hash="PMOScg">There is no more powerful principle of life to promote love, forbearance, and devotion in the home than that of eternal marriage. Good adjustment and performance in adult life depend largely on the quality of home life. The principle of eternal marriage is a most powerful stabilizing influence in promoting the kind of home needed to rear children who are happy and well adjusted. No church lays greater emphasis on producing a close, cohesive family life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p23" guid="efef4217-47f1-4c5f-b2d7-beacce5d1fe0" pid="ZdC7gmdVjEKzXl8bAS6YPg" hash="j7flZg">What a contrast to the declarations that God is dead—there is no believable voice—the future is blank, as expressed by religious leaders, educators, and columnists. The confusion and frustrations from which the world is suffering are not common to faithful members of the Church. The proof is provided by the loyalty and dedication of its members for nearly a century and a half.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p24" guid="104fd261-d637-4cee-9239-5d059f426562" pid="QhwHnjDgHEajs_8DBO3H2Q" hash="GQJ-cA">That loyalty and dedication is not diminishing—it is increasing. Hundreds are going daily from the darkness and uncertainty of unbelief and disbelief into the eternal life of the gospel by having faith, complying with the law of repentance, and accepting of baptism. Their lives are made bright and luminous by the gift of the Holy Ghost, and their souls are lifted up by their service to God and man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p25" guid="5248c7e6-7511-4029-b424-cd4a58bf686e" pid="4-1HZwoukk2sHPhUaGOxTQ" hash="mYu33A">There is hope—God does live—and there is a believable voice to those who have faith and the will to believe. Certainly we live in a day of famine, as described by Amos, when “they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/8.12" class="scriptureRef">Amos 8:12</a>.) Nevertheless, in what appears to be a spiritual famine, there are many who have found a spiritual abundance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/spiritual-famine.p26" guid="d5d248b2-f912-4229-9782-ab0b7b325139" pid="LFlcduKgKk60ARMuLqw9EA" hash="_KVbDQ">It is my witness that God lives and Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. These few words I have spoken are a portrayal of my humble testimony that the gospel in its fullness has been restored in these latter days and that there is a prophet on the earth today who speaks the mind and will of the Lord to those who will hear and have the faith to follow. That we may do so, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

These happenings, which occurred many years ago in Jerusalem, are recalled to us by the writings of the New Testament. His death, however, did not bring his personal ministry to a conclusion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/this-is-my-gospel.p3" guid="1af6ae72-0794-44bc-8c72-dd98b304802e" pid="4Mmb-j8_-0eHDIHWGn1syQ" hash="NQN8Xw">An account in the Book of Mormon, a second witness for Christ, gives us additional knowledge of the teachings of the Master. This record tells of his appearance to the people of this Western Hemisphere after his death and resurrection, adding much to our understanding of the great atoning sacrifice.</p>

There was thunder and lightning greater than had ever been known, and earthquakes rocked the earth. The city of Zarahemla was burned by fire, the city of Moroni sank into the sea and the inhabitants drowned, and the city of Moronihah was covered by a mountain. Highways were broken up, other cities destroyed, and many people were slain or carried away by the tempest. The raging storm and devastation continued for three hours, and the face of the whole land was changed.</p>

If we would join with them as we read, we would learn a great lesson. They talked about the changes that had taken place in the land because of the earthquakes and the inrush of the sea, and about Jesus Christ of whom these signs had been given. While they were conversing one with another, they heard a voice which said unto them: “Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.7" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:7</a>.) They cast their eyes toward heaven and beheld a man clothed in a white robe who descended and stood in the midst of them.</p>

He admonished the multitude to cease their contentions and disputations; and he taught them, among other things, truths he had proclaimed to his followers on the eastern continent—the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord’s Prayer, the fulfillment of the Mosaic law. He healed the sick, blessed little children, administered the sacrament and gave instruction concerning it.</p>

The statement he made to them describes the glories of the plan and explains the requirements for man to gain eternal life and exaltation. These are his words:</p>

The plan of salvation, therefore, is the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Master explained to the Nephites that he had fulfilled his mission on earth by complying with the will of the Father, thereby becoming the Redeemer of all mankind. The further statement to “repent … and be baptized in my name” defines the gateway to the narrow path leading to eternal life. This gives rise to the fundamental statement expressed in the Articles of Faith of the Church:</p>

Returning to the words of the Savior to the Nephites, we learn that after complying with these four, there must be a lifetime of compliance with the laws and commandments of the Lord, for he said, “… and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.16" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:16</a>.)</p>

The atonement was for this very purpose, to bring about the resurrection and subsequent judgment of all men. The Master made it very clear by saying: “And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.15" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:15</a>.)</p>

The 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants states it this way: “And the lesser priesthood continued, which priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel; Which gospel is the gospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.26-27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:26–27</a>.)</p>

The pathway of the preparatory gospel for the forgiveness of sins and entrance to the kingdom is clearly marked. The way is pointed out for the fullness of the everlasting gospel to be enjoyed by man, blessed by the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, to so live as to obtain a knowledge of God and receive his approbation upon resurrection.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/this-is-my-gospel.p40" guid="a9d3bf34-4ec4-4e9f-a0ad-a611e9dcbccc" pid="almoXi7HV0eDAt7oE7daIQ" hash="d4EW9g">We should be grateful, as Easter approaches, for the record of the people of the western world, which has preserved for us the teachings of the resurrected Savior to the Nephites. It is an additional witness to his divine mission. I know the Book of Mormon is the word of God.</p>

If the world would follow the principles of the gospel proclaimed by him, a real peace, beyond the cessation of hostilities, would come to all people, for he said, “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>.)</p>

Scientific achievements of today are staggering to the human mind. We realize that the law under which these achievements have been accomplished has always been in existence, but it was not until this era that man’s learning and understanding have sufficiently increased to make use of natural laws to produce the accomplishments of today’s world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p3" guid="b54a5a00-2e98-497f-8822-6866143c0071" pid="BhgSgE8GI0O0UECCYeeZlg" hash="xQ1XvA">A few generations ago, goods were produced with hand tools from crude materials; but in our day, mass production has replaced the old methods with greater efficiency and better quality because of the genius and skills of man and the machines he has developed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p4" guid="0bbe91d3-e0a9-49ff-9050-15f791985c97" pid="2o6rZK1zREil-89KIGXjIQ" hash="AHCnog">Agriculture is the means of livelihood for more than half of the world’s population. As we pass through modernized farming areas, we no longer see farmers tilling the land with horse and plow, cutting one furrow at a time, or families working together in the fields at harvest time. These things seem to have disappeared. Today large pieces of mechanical equipment with the strength of a hundred horses plow many furrows at one time. Not many years ago the hand sickle was used to harvest the fields of ripened grain. The sheaves were flailed by hand and tossed into the wind to separate the chaff. Large combines now do all of the work in one operation as they mow the fields.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p5" guid="e16f96c0-b95e-4c3c-b90b-c45cefe61b08" pid="2l5f7EL2r0asjm2sfWIM7A" hash="69Sdbw">Happenings in faraway places are viewed in the quiet of our own homes, a phenomenon which would have been considered a miracle in the generations preceding ours. Modern living requires that we have instantaneous communications at our side so that we may quickly dial and transact business or have the luxury of visiting, regardless of long intervening distances. Animals provided man’s transportation for centuries, but these have now been replaced by vehicles of great speed and comfort. There has always been a curiosity as to what lies beyond the river. Today’s rapid flight through the air has made the oceans no wider than the rivers of years past and man has quick access to the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p6" guid="4129b2f1-ab2a-40c7-b48d-9d5f54271266" pid="PYCJo2T4hkiLQzqN0YtuAQ" hash="rk6A8A">We take great pride in modern accomplishments—the fact that we are better housed and fed, have greater conveniences, improved medical facilities, greater advantages in education, and the highest standard of living ever enjoyed in the history of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p7" guid="47044edc-7656-4db5-9e76-f378affd15e4" pid="CaoVb1OkIUmRaqOF-v8s-Q" hash="ZzDI_A">Many of my ancestors were engaged in the world’s most followed occupation of tilling the soil. Some of them left their old moorings in England and came to the shores of the New World, settling in the Plymouth and Massachusetts colonies. I get a warm feeling when I read the soul-stirring accounts of their conquest against hardship and the difficulties that faced them and their families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p8" guid="171f6c17-96e0-4437-a094-ffab72137181" pid="Br23yvKjIUKrRhrq8j64tw" hash="nHBb5w">Early missionaries of the Church went to Scotland, Denmark, and Norway, where other of my early ancestors lived. They accepted the teachings of the gospel, gave up the security of their homelands, and participated in the gathering to Zion. These people faced even greater hardships as they walked across the dusty plains of the Middle West and over the Rockies to the desert valleys of the mountains, pushing all of their earthly belongings in self-styled carts. The difficulties they endured bring tears to the eyes of those who are their beneficiaries today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p9" guid="bf87bbea-8696-4957-addd-84f979d3fd22" pid="oyUyOIeOj0y_Ab_shGP7nQ" hash="PZ9C8g">The stories of these people who have gone before us are ones of faith, devotion, and dedication. Although there were trials, hardships, and lack of the conveniences we think necessary in our world today, there seems to have been a happiness in their living, in their individual lives, and in their families. In their homes there was faith and prayer—faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and prayers to God asking for their needs and thanking him for his goodness to them. The Bible was read in the home and there was profound belief in its teachings. Life was more simple, but can we say that there was less happiness in simplicity?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p10" guid="6c044ec1-ae5a-4401-a1e2-3e964cbf52aa" pid="FAcu8VvQ2EWsURC8dl7_3w" hash="7hv9nQ">Society has made a great effort to modernize the world in education, communication, travel, health, commerce, housing, and in many other ways, so as to increase the standard of living; but what has this socialization and modernization done to the family—the basic institution of society? Never before has there been greater instability. The divorce rate is higher now than at any time in history. Modernization has transferred the responsibility of education from the family to public institutions where modern thought has become paramount and moral principles have become abandoned. The crime rate has increased alarmingly. Drug addiction, disobedience to law, increase in venereal disease, and corruption in all forms seem to be accepted. In this day of modernization, freedom of thought and action is sponsored and promoted without consideration of the responsibilities that must accompany such freedoms if society is to be stabilized. Surely we would agree that the family institution has been seriously, if not irreparably, damaged in our society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p11" guid="bcc7b385-56d8-4576-8214-e541b1925f0b" pid="EfwpjGJ76Eano-1I0iAlvQ" hash="NzGyRA">In the past, churches have taken a leading role in teaching men to have faith in God and to develop moral stability. What is happening to organized religion as a stabilizing force in society? Many of the largest of the Christian churches have reported losses in membership and also in income to carry on the work of their religious endeavors. Here again modernization has taken a heavy toll.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p12" guid="9ed462a0-ce84-4784-aced-75bc6d93cfbd" pid="UFdOjjobjEquPZ54oZyniQ" hash="mjtn6Q">Modernism has become the order of the day in some religious thought. Modernists advocate a restatement of traditional doctrine on the grounds that today’s modern scholastic and scientific advances require a new critical interpretation of the Bible and the history of dogma. The term “modernism” is often used interchangeably with “liberalism.” Its advocates claim that religious truths are subject to constant reinterpretation in the light of modern knowledge; therefore, new and more advanced concepts are required to express modern thought and progress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p13" guid="06aa6786-1d60-43fa-80a1-2257c7b50f00" pid="0243fH10Uk-pDdsEDACfVg" hash="EK38ZA">The Bible has been the subject of attack by modernists. It is said by some that science refuses to support the authenticity of such Biblical accounts as the creation of the world, placing life upon the earth, Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, the flood, and many other happenings in the Old and New Testaments. What is claimed to be superior knowledge in this day of enlightenment causes some men to look upon these accounts as fables. Because of this, can believers in Christ repudiate them? In an attempt to regain the confidence of communicants who have ceased to believe, many liberal churches have abandoned one doctrine after another, even to the extent of failing to stand by the doctrine of the existence of a personal God. They no longer uphold as a reality the resurrection of the crucified Savior, and the doctrine of the atoning sacrifice has lost its credibility. Under such circumstances, how can organized religion maintain its place as a stabilizing influence in society?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p14" guid="bd60d568-23de-48c4-9924-b9c01a39053a" pid="cYYPz68bb0C2Gj4IYXR1fA" hash="n-W9sQ">In this day of increased knowledge, higher thought, and a modernization of the old, the simple has been overlooked and the profound sought after. The basic, simple, fundamental truths of the gospel are being ignored. Paul taught the true gospel of Jesus Christ to the people of Galatia and, after he left them, spurious teachers came and turned them from his teachings. This gave rise to the letter written by Paul in strong language of criticism, denouncing those who would pervert his teachings. He said to them:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p15" guid="544f5850-86a6-496f-a7fe-6ad8937584e0" pid="Qi3dV1ioZE-0BH4AWMN_4w" hash="YnbhiA">“I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/1.6-8" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 1:6–8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/of-the-world-or-of-the-kingdom.p16" guid="d6f54307-e128-45b7-b119-097e13ba0e2d" pid="zydxVaf090eUHnyC7WJ0zg" hash="25PnrA">From the earliest days of the Christian church, spurious gospels have been taught—not really gospels, as Paul pointed out, for there is only one gospel of Christ. Today is not different. We are surrounded by frustrations and advances in thought and learning which raise questions and doubts. These seem to drag men down and destroy faith and morality. Where, then, is hope in this world of frustration and moral decay? It lies in the knowledge and understanding of the truths taught by the Master, which must be taught by the Church of Christ without deviation and believed in and lived by its membership. These are eternal truths and will be so in perpetuity regardless of changing circumstances in society, development of new scientific achievements, or increase of man’s knowledge.</p>

I believe the principles of the gospel announced by the Savior in his personal ministry were true when they were given and are true today. Truth is eternal and never changing, and the gospel of Jesus Christ is ever contemporary in a changing world.</p>

It is his discovery of portions of the unlimited knowledge and information which is part of God’s knowledge. How we use it is determined by whether we are of the eternal kingdom of God or a part of the temporary understanding of the world. The question is simply this: are we seeking to find our place in the world in the realm of worldly thought, or are we seeking to find our place in the unchanging kingdom of God?</p>

We take no such course.</p>

I also bear witness that there is a prophet of God on the earth today.</p>

Jesus of Nazareth, with scarcely a three-year ministry among his countrymen, left the home of his friends Mary, Martha, and Lazarus and walked resolutely toward the gates of Jerusalem. Some of the inhabitants of that ancient city considered him to be a blasphemer, a demon, a transgressor of Jewish law. Others believed him to be a prophet, the Messiah, the Son of the living God. Whatever the opinions may have been, all Judea knew of this man who taught with power and authority though he was neither Scribe nor Pharisee.</p>

But members of the Sanhedrin had openly vowed to put Jesus to death, and the likelihood of his appearance at such a public gathering was doubted by many.</p>

A great multitude went out of Jerusalem to greet him, spreading branches of palm trees before his path and crying: “… Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/21.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 21:9</a>.)</p>

The multitude was jubilant and vocal; Jesus was regal and silent. Indeed, as he approached this city so highly favored of God, he wept for Jerusalem saying:</p>

He spoke in parables of grain that had to die in order to bring forth fruit, and of a chosen son sent by his father into the family vineyard only to be killed as the father’s servants before him had been killed. At times the burden seemed almost too heavy to bear.</p>

Such statements were uniting his enemies against him, yet he proclaimed: “For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/12.49" class="scriptureRef">John 12:49</a>.)</p>

One group of Pharisees and Herodians asked him a most diabolic question:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/his-final-hours.p15" pid="seHLItKx3EWjmWx-8E69vw" hash="agSg4g">“… Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth. …</p>

If he were to answer yes, he would easily be accused of betraying his heritage among Abraham’s seed, the very group staggering under the oppression of Roman law. If he were to answer no, he would immediately be apprehended as a political agitator. He answered neither, but rather asked to be shown a coin by which such tribute money commonly was paid.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/his-final-hours.p17" pid="vyLJeJ15C0O50OIparl2FA" hash="HOPV0w">Holding the piece of money up to his accusers, he asked: “Whose is this image and superscription?” Of course, they answered as any child in the street could have: “It is Caesar’s.” With that single question he had taken command of the confrontation. He returned the coin saying: “… Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.20-21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:20–21</a>), as if to say: “The man’s name and picture are on the coin. Surely it belongs to him. Please be kind enough to return it to its rightful owner.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/his-final-hours.p18" pid="KcBedkyOq0uEpKFKIBYrGQ" hash="qXKRkg">Brilliantly he had destroyed the ploy of his oppressors, but that was never his true mission or desire. These, too, were sons of God. These, too, were among those he came to save. He feared for them and loved them even in their malice. As they turned away he added a plea: “… and [render] unto God the things that are God’s.” As the coin bore the image of Caesar, so these and all men bore the image of God, their Heavenly Father. They had been created by him in the likeness of his image, and Jesus was to provide a way for them to return to him. Yet, “When they heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.21-22" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:21–22</a>.)</p>

Legal scholars had divided, subdivided, and categorized the original Mosaic code so minutely that some parts of the law seemed to be in direct opposition to other parts. But Jesus would not be paralyzed by the jots and tittles of legal debate. In a single stroke he penetrated to the heart of the law and integrated those several parts into its one great whole: “… Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/his-final-hours.p20" pid="t7HfYuOEok6tjoyB_FSbPQ" hash="pLnaTg">“This is the first and great commandment.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/his-final-hours.p23" pid="YjKvgVlTfEOynJA64WLt8g" hash="MAodDA">As the final hours of his earthly mission came upon him, Jesus turned away from the multitudes and sought only to strengthen his disciples. He warned them of what lay ahead. He spoke of Jerusalem’s destruction and of the distress and apostasy that would precede his latter-day return to the earth. He spoke of a master who would, after a long time in a distant country, come and make a reckoning with his servants, each according to his ability and the talents given him for investment in a worthy cause. He spoke of a shepherd who would separate his sheep from the goats, the former being those followers who gave meat to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothing to the naked, and attention to the afflicted. He spoke of virgins attending a wedding, some of whom had sufficient oil for trimming their lamps while others saw their meager supply depleted because the bridegroom tarried longer than they supposed. Thus Jesus taught his disciples to watch and pray; however, he taught them that prayerful watching does not require sleepless anxiety and preoccupation with the future, but rather the quiet, steady attention to present duties.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/his-final-hours.p24" pid="jukq0mCkB0ibc-TdN9vx8Q" hash="IhOv_A">As the hour of sacrifice approached, Jesus retreated with his twelve apostles to the peace and privacy of an upper chamber. There the Master sought to fortify his special witnesses against the snares of the evil one by laying aside his outer garment, girding himself with a towel, and washing the apostles’ feet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/his-final-hours.p25" pid="9EjzSWq3c06OuVrJvIE5SA" hash="fDzNwA">This magnificent gesture of love and unity was a fitting prelude to the paschal meal that followed. From the time the firstborn of the faithful children of Israel had been “passed over” in the destruction brought on Egypt by Pharaoh’s intransigence, the Passover meal, with all its symbolic emblems and gestures, had been faithfully observed by Israel’s families. How fitting it was during the observance of this ancient covenant of protection that Jesus should institute the emblems of the new covenant of safety—the emblems of his own body and blood. As he took the bread and broke it, and took the cup and blessed it, he was presenting himself as <span class="emphasis">the</span> Lamb of God who would provide spiritual nourishment and eternal salvation.</p>

He was not, even at this late hour, selfishly engrossed with his own sorrows or contemplating the impending pain. He was anxiously attending to the present and future needs of his beloved followers. He knew their own safety, individually and as a church, lay only in their unconditional love one for another. His entire energies seem to have been directed toward their needs, thus teaching by example what he was teaching by precept. He gave them words of comfort and commandment and caution.</p>

He did what no other has ever done—he arose the third day from his own tomb, a tomb once again filled with the light and the life of the world, and he ascended to his Father. Jesus of Nazareth was now Jesus the Christ; he had conquered death.</p>

He lived in humble circumstances. He had not surrounded himself with the proud and mighty of the earth, but with the poor, the humble, and those of modest circumstances. There was nothing complicated about his life or teaching. The words he spoke relate to people of all walks of life—to all those who listened in his day and to all those who will listen today.</p>

May we, in his name, unite our hearts, love one another, and keep his commandments is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p1" pid="tOntjtMjfU-cmgybTn8C3Q" hash="JE3F7A">This is the season of the year when we come together for the general conference of the Church in this great historic Tabernacle, built by the early pioneers and settlers in what was then a wilderness valley of the unexplored mountains of the West. To this conference have come people from around the world—from many, many countries. It is glorious to look out over this large assembly. Some are wearing headsets, listening to the proceedings in their own language. Although we are speaking in English, what is said is being translated simultaneously for those who speak other languages, giving us a community of understanding.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p2" pid="XcvgIUbPe0eMUTNBctdIHg" hash="yTdAKw">A few years ago it would not have been possible for simultaneous communication for such a multi-language assembly, nor would it have been possible to travel from the distant places of the world in the few hours it has taken us to come here. We marvel at such modern conveniences and at the advance of science in our day. Man, in his quest to achieve, is reaching out into what was unknown in former years and is becoming the master of the elements of the earth and the forces of nature.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p3" pid="Cqwerg9ZZUim1ibxdVth8w" hash="Vv4UMw">The accelerating advance of science, bringing into common use the achievements of our modern world, is staggering to the human mind, yet we know it is the result of the application of natural law—God’s law. Many modern scientific developments appear miraculous and amazing to us, even surpassing many of the miracles recalled in the pages of the Old and New Testaments. As marvelous as some of these modern discoveries may appear, they quickly fall into daily use and become accepted as commonplace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p4" pid="gxVWv49URkOQeZ6ZuBZTEg" hash="jwTgsQ">Man’s knowledge has rapidly increased and scientific research accelerated at proportions never known before in the history of the world. This has come about through concentrated effort on the part of business, industry, government, and educational institutions. A large portion of the world’s wealth and income is devoted to this pursuit, and hundreds of thousands of men and women around the world are devoting time and effort to the extension of man’s knowledge and understanding of science through research. The pursuit of knowledge of the laws of the universe, which we know have always been in existence, has reached new heights, and investigation continues to increase in this search for truth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p5" pid="Kd3o9t2a-EyAwcrtKqudYQ" hash="LvdHGg">Science is providing marvelous things to give ease and comfort to man in this modern world and is creating the highest standard of living ever known. Because we are provided with all our needs and the luxuries of life, can we turn from God, the teachings of religion, or the gospel of Jesus Christ? With the advance of knowledge has come a reliance upon scientific principles of proof, and as a consequence, there are some who do not believe in God because his existence cannot be substantiated by such proof. In reality, scientific research is an endeavor to ascertain truth, and the same principles which are applied to that pursuit are used in the quest to establish the truth of religion as well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p6" pid="-7ygzTjo7k-7mfYPwjA0SQ" hash="pCUfJQ">When Jesus spoke to the multitude gathered on the Mount, he said to them:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p7" pid="FQEFHqY7R0OIiuPifPtEPQ" hash="OMaxbA">“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p8" pid="khHf4UP1tEe-PdIa6wFV_A" hash="CSGiNg">“For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.7-8" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:7–8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p9" pid="TQOdpx-_S0mhwxyzr_6_SQ" hash="8U_KYg">This seems to be an admonition to search with determination and make earnest inquiry for truth. It is as applicable to religion as it is to science—the process is the same in either case. The search may require a lifetime to examine the necessary materials, discard that which proves to be false, and isolate the truth when it is found.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p10" pid="lIVpaUIWqEShwyX4IBs4fQ" hash="PjFbZA">As important as scientific research may be, the greatest quest is a search for God—to determine his reality, his personal attributes, and to secure a knowledge of the gospel of his Son Jesus Christ. It is not easy to find a perfect understanding of God. The search requires persistent effort, and there are some who never move themselves to pursue this knowledge. In place of making the struggle and effort to understand, they follow the opposite course, which requires no effort, and deny his existence. One writer has stated it this way:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p11" pid="npaxHRMv3EKKbwrJzd_hwg" hash="5-xgTg">“There are musicians but most of us are not musicians, some lacking musical talent, but the majority probably lacking inclination. But of those who are musically talented none ever becomes a great musician without years of persistent, continuous work. Great performers continue long hours of practice even though their reputations may be international. … No athlete becomes outstanding, no mechanic becomes skilled, no physician becomes an expert, no orator becomes great, no lawyer becomes renowned, except by persistent practice and many, many hours of hard work. … How foolish it would be for me to close my eyes and ears and say there are no musicians because I am not talented to become a musician; that there are no Edisons because I cannot become an inventor; that there are no artists because I do not have the talents and inclinations to become an artist. Does not reason tell us it is equally foolish for a man to declare there is no God simply because he has not discovered him? …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p12" pid="vFfZxoueQ0KdwfS-WXvsWQ" hash="-DXqBw">“He who makes no effort to learn of the existence of Deity will, in this life, likely not learn there is a Deity. But his ignorance does not warrant him in declaring there is no God.” (Joseph F. Merrill, <span class="emphasis">The Truth-Seeker and Mormonism,</span> Deseret Book Co., pp. 76–77.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p13" pid="sXV6xeWUHEObqR14m2UO_Q" hash="j13W2g">Whether seeking for knowledge of scientific truths or to discover God, one must have faith. This becomes the starting point. Faith has been defined in many ways, but the most classic definition was given by the author of the letter to the Hebrews in these meaningful words: “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:1</a>.) In other words, faith makes us confident of what we hope for and convinced of what we do not see. The scientist does not see molecules, atoms, or electrons, yet he knows they exist. He does not see electricity, radiation, or magnetism, but he knows these are unseen realities. In like manner, those who earnestly seek for God do not see him, but they know of his reality by faith. It is more than hope. Faith makes it a conviction—an evidence of things not seen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p14" pid="mENrNibig0O79xPF6sd0ig" hash="0y9Zsw">The author of the letter to the Hebrews continues: “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.3" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:3</a>.) Faith is here described as believing or having the conviction that the world was created by the word of God. Witnesses cannot be produced to prove this fact, but faith gives the knowledge that what we see in the wonders of the earth and in all nature was created by God. It is just as reasonable to believe in an unseen God, in a literal resurrection, or in the miracles of the things pertaining to the spiritual as it is to believe in some of the discoveries in the field of the physical sciences. Faith is the primary tool in the realm of religion, and it is also the tool of the scientist.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p15" pid="fuCSfaw7okum3B36Rimp6Q" hash="4lnqFA">Christ, during his ministry, explained the manner in which one could know the truth about God. He said, “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/7.17" class="scriptureRef">John 7:17</a>.) The Master also explained the will of the Father and the great commandment in this manner: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.37" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:37</a>.) Those who will strive to do God’s will and keep his commandments will receive personal revelation as to the divinity of the Lord’s work in bearing testimony of the Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p16" pid="PNFQl84XEEu0Zaz8Txa8kw" hash="0bGStg">To those who desire understanding, the words of James explain how it may be obtained: “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a>.) It doesn’t appear that James was referring to factual knowledge in the sense of science, but rather to the revelation that comes from on high which answers men’s questions as the result of following this admonition to pray.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p17" pid="3i9OJN43QUWxWteWd6A0vg" hash="AhcOSw">Listen carefully to these words of the Lord: “I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.” Then follows the promise he makes to those who serve him in righteousness and in truth to the end:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p18" pid="wRJZPRG7skC7XuvHU8x5gQ" hash="K_QM-w">“Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p19" pid="o8jBp2A7i0uaTm51LsuBaA" hash="qw3AJg">“And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p20" pid="QN_w7CJ8lEa0HUjJFktcRA" hash="n_sbPA">“Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to come will I show them, even the things of many generations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p21" pid="2M9cil2_F0ioNeNGXbCpqw" hash="qjxSwQ">“And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p22" pid="NsVq6_eDDUyEG6CjxwRmEg" hash="MBs8uQ">“For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will—yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.5-10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:5–10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p23" pid="HGQuoe0mYkG_X0zzilDnjg" hash="p14Nhw">Thus we have the formula for the search for God and the tools to accomplish the quest—faith, love, and prayer. Science has done marvelous things for man, but it cannot accomplish the things he must do for himself, the greatest of which is to find the reality of God. The task is not easy; the labor is not light; but as stated by the Master, “Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/to-know-god.p24" pid="ZS7EHKcFsEmMuIhclVxvag" hash="FD5j1g">I have a positive conviction that God is a reality—that he lives. He is our Heavenly Father, and we are his spiritual children. He created the heaven and the earth and all things upon the earth and is the author of the eternal laws by which the universe is governed. These laws are discovered bit by bit as man continues his search, but they have existed always and will remain unchanged forever. I bear this witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, our Savior and Redeemer by reason of his atoning sacrifice to give life everlasting to all men. May the Lord bless us with the desire for an upward reach to the spiritual—to know God, to find him, and to have the determination to serve him and keep his commandments. This is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

This event has been celebrated each spring for more than 1,900 years. We are reminded, when the day comes, that the cold, dark winter has drawn to a close, and all nature is ready to come to life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p2" pid="Oeh-Xn931k-9veq0Xz-3SA" hash="iycEYw">After the snows have melted away, trees and shrubs put forth new shoots, buds commence to burst, and all the earth becomes a symphony of warmth and color, assuring us of new life. The change of nature from the chill of winter to the beauty of spring, as nature comes to life each year recalls the change from the gloom and despair of Gethsemane to the glorious event of the resurrection. The stone was rolled away and the announcement made: “He is not here, but is risen.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.6" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p3" pid="9nmxGjAQAkmymn5fmPimkw" hash="7h9L0Q">The reality of the event of the resurrection had profound meaning to every person who has the courage to believe. Is it true? Is Jesus Christ a reality? Did he actually come to earth, proclaim his gospel, and give his life for mankind? Is it true that he was resurrected from the tomb to make it possible for you and me to live again after death and have life everlasting? What evidence is there of these things? How do we gain a knowledge of the truth of them if we do not know?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p4" pid="JBH8BRUOdk-onnRidHjWcA" hash="Nyvx4A">I want to tell you that I believe these things with all my heart. I know they are true. I know that God lives and is literally our Heavenly Father; that Jesus Christ is his Son, the Redeemer of the world, and that through his atoning sacrifice every man who lives upon the earth, or who has lived or will live upon the earth, will be resurrected after death to live again. My belief in this regard has come in the same way as it has to others who believe. All persons could have this understanding by following the simple scriptural admonition:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p5" pid="YNGzhqUwcE2wgzdEy0KTcA" hash="OMaxbA">“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</p>

Of course, those who lack the desire to know and are “driven by the wind and tossed” will never understand the things pertaining to God and his divine plan. A prophet has made this meaningful statement:</p>

To know whether or not Jesus Christ is a reality, or if it is true that he is the Son of God and came to earth to proclaim his gospel, give his life, and accomplish the resurrection that all men may live again, there must arise within one’s soul a genuine desire to gain a knowledge of the truth. When such a desire becomes strong enough, we are persuaded to examine the evidence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p16" pid="HwXLDycdrkWrfAZywYP1dg" hash="WpCSjA">There is no tangible, concrete evidence of the existence of God or the divinity of the Master in the legal sense, but not all inquiry for truth results in proof by real or demonstrative evidence. It is fallacious to argue that because there is no demonstrative evidence of the existence of God he does not in fact exist. In the absence of evidence often thought necessary by the scientific world for positive proof, our search may take is into the realm of circumstantial evidence. We could spend hours describing the wonders of the universe, of the earth, of nature, of the human body the exactness of the laws of physics, and a thousand things, all of which dictate to the conscience of a truth seeker that there is a creator and one who rules over the universe.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p17" pid="tmBYKtL9mkScZlifHNsLog" hash="DZd6qg">What would be the situation if the existence of God could be proven by demonstrative evidence? What would happen to the element of faith as the first step or principle of the gospel? One of the burdens of the teachings of the Master was to emphasize the importance of faith. Faith is the element that builds the bridge in the absence of concrete evidence. This is exactly what the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews was talking about when he referred to faith as “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:1</a>.) In other words, faith is the assurance of the existence of a truth even though it is not evident or cannot be proved by positive evidence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p18" pid="326jRCCsXk2S6TNvo3UVVA" hash="70_7YQ">Suppose that all things could be proven by demonstrative evidence. What then would become of the element of faith? There would be no need for faith and it would be eliminated, giving rise then to this query: If faith is the first step or principle of the gospel and is eliminated, what happens to the gospel plan? The very foundation will crumble. I submit that there is a divine reason why all things cannot be proven by concrete evidence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p19" pid="Om-jR4Y1V0GuYWYnvTeOrw" hash="kcMJVA">Those who doubt are prone to ask for proof or a sign that they might believe. The prophet Alma spoke to his people on this very subject and said to them, “Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p20" pid="di8NYIaeC0CgRgJlqPI0Ig" hash="-Z1UIw">“Now I ask, is this faith?

The desire for fruit caused the seed to be planted, and the planter had faith that it would sprout and grow. Alma continues to describe this seed of faith:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p22" pid="kCpxjmvwwEKPvTbBlztQxw" hash="dsWqCg">“As the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us.

Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ brings us to a knowledge of the reality of his atoning sacrifice. We have need to be taught and to understand this first principle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/faith-the-first-step.p27" pid="nAa3XndackuuTQLsT6TlWw" hash="1A3UaQ">In the closing two verses of Matthew is given the account of the final appearance of the Master to the eleven disciples on the mountain in Galilee.

May the faith of each of us be strengthened by conscientious effort, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p1" pid="vWJL6r7-lEaQzkszUPFyqA" hash="YS20ig">This is a historic day for the Mormon Tabernacle on Temple Square—the building in which this huge congregation is seated. Today commences the second century of its history since the occasion at which it was dedicated to the service of the Lord. It is known for its unique architecture, and people around the world listening to radio and viewing television know it as the place of origination of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Organ at the “Crossroads of the West.” This general conference falls on the centennial anniversary of the general conference held in October, 1875, at which this tabernacle was dedicated one hundred years ago yesterday. The hard work and labor and the sacrifice of worldly possessions by those early pioneers participating in its construction have brought blessings to the many hundreds of thousands who have come here or who have listened to the music and spoken word.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p2" pid="GDPOO6w1AkqiXSxWvCHANQ" hash="0mz2dw">The story of the builders is fascinating. When they left their homes on the banks of the Mississippi, little was known of the unexplored West. After a long and hard-fought journey, blazing a trail across the Great American Desert, they entered the Salt Lake Valley on Saturday, July 24, 1847. The following day, being Sunday, was devoted to religious services and Monday and Tuesday were spent exploring the valley and surrounding country. By late afternoon of the next day, the location of the city had been determined and Brigham Young thrust his cane in the ground on the spot where the temple would be built.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p3" pid="2Q9E56gEQUCHNczV-olzag" hash="LFk9jw">On Thursday, a group from the Mormon Battalion who had been released in New Mexico entered the valley and joined the Saints, increasing their number to about 400. These men from the battalion went to work immediately on the construction of a bowery on the southeast corner of the place designated as the Temple Block to serve as a place of assembly—a predecessor to this tabernacle. Poles were cut and brought from the mountains and planted in the ground to support a roof of leafy boughs. This first structure to be built in the valley was finished on Saturday, one week from the day of arrival. On the following day, Sunday, they were able to hold religious services under the shade of this bowery.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p4" pid="nErEajUmWUuvIdMjmj4kjw" hash="easWzQ">The bowery was temporary, of course, but it served those early pioneer settlers for two years before being torn down to make way for a larger one on the same site. The roof of the second bowery was of boughs and dirt, supported by one hundred upright poles and had open sides like the first structure. It could be used only in good weather; nevertheless, it served as a meeting place for the next three years.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p5" pid="OZsYr4g7T02cBdXj5WV2Gg" hash="YqjkNA">By this time, the Saints were becoming established in their new settlement. They had land under cultivation, houses built, and there was a need for a more adequate place in which to hold assemblies and religious services. In order to have a building that was more permanent and usable in all kinds of weather, they set about to construct a tabernacle. The sides of this building were of adobe bricks supporting a truss roof. This eliminated the necessity of pillars or poles that had been an inconvenience to them in the boweries.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p6" pid="YnlsjDjxuEud3x9d-nrXpA" hash="mjO-dg">The adobe tabernacle, which later became known as the Old Tabernacle, took one year to build, but it was ready to be used for the general conference in 1852. More Saints were arriving in the valley, and by conference time the building was not large enough to seat the throng and many could not gain admittance. At the April conference two years later, Brigham Young invited the seven thousand who attended to move out-of-doors because of the large overflow crowd. Before the October conference of that year, a third bowery was built large enough to seat the conference.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p7" pid="MSLJDE3aKkCixiwa56-Jig" hash="73V4cA">The need for an adequate building was evident and President Brigham Young commissioned the preparation of plans for a new structure that became known as the Great Tabernacle, the one in which we are seated today. Only fifteen years had passed since the arrival of the first pioneers in this desert valley. At the April conference of 1863, many of the speakers mentioned the proposed building and made appeals for all to join in the sacrifice of financing and construction. It was an ambitious undertaking for people in an outpost settlement with only limited building materials and without the benefit of a railroad for transportation. Any imported materials had to be hauled from the Missouri River by oxteam. The building was to be erected by donation because tithing funds were needed for the temple that had been under construction for ten years. The Saints were invited to donate liberally of their substance—jewelry, building materials, bread, and labor, inasmuch as cash was scarce.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p8" pid="HuewMVwW5UipRhc6rJ_HuA" hash="znjiwg">It was decided that the building should be 250 feet long and 150 feet wide with semicircular ends and 46 piers to support the roof structure. The plans provided for an elliptical arch roof, rising 44 feet from the top of the 20-foot piers, making the distance from the floor to the roof 64 feet. The floor was to slant from the back to the front with a 16-foot elevation so there would be less visual obstruction. At the time of its planning and construction, it was said to be the largest building in the world unsupported by columns.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p9" pid="91mrTfzVy02Odzxw9wuisQ" hash="grR7wg">In the spring of 1863 the building was commenced. The large red sandstone blocks were quarried in Red Butte Canyon in the mountains back of Fort Douglas and most of the lumber was cut in the pine forests of the Wasatch Mountains and sawed in mills in Big Cottonwood Canyon. The center section of the tabernacle was built first, then the west-curving end section was added so the construction and installation of the organ could commence. Bolts, nails, and steel straps were not available. Where the timbers crossed, holes were bored through the beams and dowels were driven into the holes and cut so that they extended on each side. The ends were spread by a wedge to hold them securely in place. When timbers split, they were wrapped with green rawhide that contracted as it dried, holding the beam in a viselike grip.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p10" pid="5TmzxXpprE6G6veeKC0uNA" hash="2Ya6YA">The story of the building of the great pipe organ is fascinating. When it was first played, a team of five men pumped its bellows; later a waterwheel was installed in the basement to replace their labor. Eventually the introduction of electricity furnished the power to fill the bellows. The need for additional seating was evident when the building was completed and the gallery around the sides and back was constructed to seat another 3,000 persons.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p11" pid="zNwucoL3jk-78RygSbRmVw" hash="z_rrhA">Although there had been meetings and conferences held in the building, it was not ready for dedication until the general conference of October 1875—one hundred years ago. By this time the railroad had been constructed and on Sunday of that week President Ulysses S. Grant, the first president of the United States to visit the Territory of Utah, arrived on a special train decorated with flags and bunting. The streets were lined from the depot to the Walker House with Sabbath School children, backed by hundreds of spectators to see the president and the long line of carriages that escorted him. The newspaper referred to Salt Lake City as having a population of about 25,000, and “more houses devoted to public religious uses in proportion to its population than any other city or town in the United States, and probably churches and meeting houses of aggregate seating capacity sufficient to accommodate every man, woman and child in the community.” (<span class="emphasis">Salt Lake Herald,</span> Oct. 3, 1875, 6:102.) The next morning President Grant, accompanied by Governor Emery, drove to the Temple Block and visited the new tabernacle.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p12" pid="OG9KOSKcqEmVzm8LLq4iDg" hash="Fp9iAA">At the beginning of the morning session of the general conference on Saturday, President Brigham Young announced that Elder John Taylor would offer the dedicatory prayer. I wish we could read all of it, but time will not permit more than a few of the words. President Taylor prayed: “Be merciful unto thine ancient covenant people, O Lord, that in Thine own due time the spirit of grace and supplication may rest upon them, that they may be gathered from all nations whither thou has scattered them, that they may possess the inheritance of their fathers, know their Redeemer, and that Jerusalem may become the throne of the Lord.” Then follows this interesting petition: “Remember, O Lord, in mercy the Lamanites who have wandered from thy ways, and to whose fathers thou promised that thou wouldest renew thy covenants to their seed. We thank thee that thou hast commenced to give unto them dreams and visions and they have begun to feel after thee.” (<span class="emphasis">Deseret News</span> 24:594.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p13" pid="m1Sbaeuui0CIjvZlNKWqSQ" hash="Krrj_A">At the afternoon session, Elder George Q. Cannon read the names of persons called to leave their homes and families and go into the world as missionaries. There were 105 of them. In those days missionaries were called by reading their names from the podium of this tabernacle in the general conferences. Later the practice was changed as the number of missionaries increased and calls were ultimately made by a communication from the President of the Church. If the practice were still followed of calling missionaries by reading their names at a general conference, it would have been necessary to read the names of 7,923 persons at this present conference, which alone would take about one-half of the total time of this three-day assembly. That is the number of missionaries called since we were last assembled in a general conference six months ago, and incidentally, about the number that are presently seated here today.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p14" pid="T7bce2LmREKYqJJ1APnzBA" hash="JS6o6Q">Elder George Q. Cannon stood at this pulpit after the building was completed but not yet dedicated and talked about missionary work. His words seem to echo from the past what our president is saying to us today. He said: “Our Elders have gone to the Eastern States by hundreds to lift up their warning voices to the people concerning the things which God is doing and is about to do in the midst of the inhabitants of the earth. For this purpose they go to Europe, to the West, to the Islands of the Pacific, to Asia and Africa, and they will yet traverse every country on the face of the whole earth. The millions of Asia will yet hear the glad tidings of salvation from the Elders of Israel … and the time is near at hand when the sound of this Gospel, proclaimed by the Elders of Israel, will re-echo from one end of the earth to the other, for it must be preached as a witness unto all nations.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses</span> 13:53.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-tabernacle.p15" pid="bNwFSwka_0KrPKYgHyy8RA" hash="fNY5Mg">Times may have changed and conditions under which we now live may be different, but the purposes and objectives of the restored gospel do not vary and truth remains constant. The sacrifices and efforts made by those who are now gone have brought blessings to us of today and are reminders of our obligation to those who will come after us. This building stands as a memorial to that reminder. It has stood as a great missionary, introducing the gospel of Jesus Christ to people around the world—those who have entered its portals and those who have heard the message that has gone forth from here in music and the spoken word. Down through the years our missionaries have carried a message that has blessed hundreds of thousands of people in the earth, and they are carrying that same message today to bless, for all eternity, those who will hear and believe. This message is true, and I bear witness of it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

One of those aspects of preparation, as Bishop Brown and his counselors explained in their discussions of family preparedness, is employment and career development. I should like to discuss this in more detail, because it is so important to most of us, who as leaders, give assistance to others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p2" pid="IZQNXWLQv0Wh31F1ZM4ayg" hash="Om3scg">It is interesting that the first recorded instruction given to Adam after the Fall, dealt with the eternal principle of work. The Lord said: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 3:19</a>.) Our Heavenly Father loves us so completely that he has given us a commandment to work. This is one of the keys to eternal life. He knows that we will learn more, grow more, achieve more, serve more, and benefit more from a life of industry than from a life of ease.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p3" pid="TSmEoqElrkapqkyGmaW-bA" hash="I1GBqw">There are several principles which undergird the significance of work in the Lord’s plan. First, as the covenant people we must be as self-sufficient as possible. We are to be free from dependence upon a dole or any program that might endanger our free agency. Second, we must work to support the families with which the Lord has blessed us. Every true son of God wants to care for his own, and many a noble mother, from whom a husband has been taken, struggles to support her children, both as a breadwinner and a single parent. Finally, we work so that we may have the necessities of life, conserving time and energy left over for service in the Lord’s work. Sometimes it seems that the men who work the hardest at their occupations are the men most willing to devote time to church service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p4" pid="2V58Ict4dEq86ElnJGcpRA" hash="mfYbjQ">Now, may we refer specifically to vocational work or employment. The employment we choose should be honorable and challenging. Ideally, we need to seek that work to which we are suited by interest, by aptitude, and by training. A man’s work should do more than provide adequate income; it should provide him with a sense of self-worth and be a pleasure—something he looks forward to each day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p5" pid="M3S2aIhyxEWLR55eYve4yA" hash="dJIcWw">May I suggest a definition of “honorable employment.” Honorable employment is honest employment. Fair value is given and there is no defrauding, cheating, or deceit. Its product or service is of high quality, and the employer, customer, client, or patient receives more than he or she expected. Honorable employment is moral. It involves nothing that would undermine public good or morality. For example, it does not involve traffic in liquor, illicit narcotics, or gambling. Honorable employment is useful. It provides goods or services which make the world a better place in which to live. Honorable employment is also remunerative. It provides enough income so that we may be self-sufficient and able to support our families, while leaving us enough time free to be good fathers and church workers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p6" pid="ob-h61rqoUKtCWUSn6v29Q" hash="M0JNSg">It is necessary to say a word about what is “enough income.” This is a materialistic world, and Latter-day Saints must be careful not to confuse luxuries with necessities. An adequate income allows us to provide for the basic requirements of life. There are some who unwisely aspire to self-indulgent luxuries that often lead them away from complete commitment to the gospel of our Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p7" pid="x367pz11wEmE6b5jIr9M1w" hash="M0T44g">May I offer to the youth—these young people we want to help—for their consideration, four steps which are important in obtaining the right employment. They are: first, to invite the Lord’s help in this important search; second, to plan ahead carefully; third, to gather all possible necessary information; and fourth, proper vocation or education preparation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p8" pid="7MvHewg6BEGEkTYVsmoRmQ" hash="IvWXFQ">The first step, prayer, must continue throughout the entire process. As we gather facts, make decisions, gain the appropriate training and experience, and then seek jobs, it is essential that we combine our self-reliant efforts with a humble, prayerful attitude. The decision is ours to make, but the Lord will increase our wisdom if we seek him earnestly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p9" pid="yX4FHduU3keyG-rUkUcN9g" hash="J2tgUg">Planning ahead for a vocation is a very important second step. The sooner a young man can begin the planning, the sooner he will begin to acquire the skills of that vocation. Parents have an important responsibility to teach and guide children in thinking seriously about their future in the working world. Of course, parents must exercise wisdom, being careful to counsel rather than pressure children as they make their own decisions about careers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p10" pid="xOTe6I5-qUaSDdBXz9-Q6Q" hash="7YSXsw">The third step, gathering facts, involves many people and resources. Youth and parents should be able to draw upon the ward welfare services employment resource person, school counselors, and others. Interviews with potential employers, visits to occupational locations, and actually working at different jobs will greatly broaden career perspective.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p11" pid="p1WEi8E1uk6mhWCAeNAHug" hash="BVrGPw">Effective fact gathering includes a search to learn which vocations are in demand now and which will be in the future. We need college-trained people, but many have gone to a university and have become trained for jobs that do not exist in the marketplace. In addition to those trained in colleges, we need young men who are trained in other fields—carpenters, farmers, auto mechanics, and other skills.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p12" pid="3FyU5DBu0k62EPwHPrNVCQ" hash="ZeINJw">As the final step, when the decision has been made and the young person feels right about the decision, the preparation process should begin in earnest. Whether the training involved is an apprenticeship, university education, or a trade school, it is often an advantage to have formal, recognized training for a vocation. The best positions and the highest pay go to those who have adequately prepared themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p13" pid="tK4JkM_p5EydV-akBq_ZkQ" hash="v332gw">The realities of life often cause people to seek any employment to provide income to meet their obligations. This happened to many during the great depression in the early 1930s. It is happening today to a lesser extent. It is important that a man be engaged in employment of his own choosing, where he is happy in his work and where he feels he is making a contribution. If he is not entirely satisfied with his success in what he is presently doing, it may not be too late to prayerfully consider making a change by planning, gathering facts, and making adequate preparation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p14" pid="2jhvDsZYvkWy8rEJh8y-pg" hash="l6r_hQ">May I say a word here about Church employment centers and the responsibility of the priesthood quorums. Speed is crucial when a job opening occurs. A person who needs a job must hear of it as soon as possible and apply immediately. It is for this purpose that we have employment centers established by the Church. The key to success for this system lies not with the few full-time staff, but with the ward Welfare Services Committees and the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood quorums.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p15" pid="O9VZDCdhy0OZTY5FfikDag" hash="nJ7Cbg">It is through the priesthood network that openings and applicant information should flow. Our quorums should identify those who need work or who need to upgrade work, and then do all they can to help their members find employment opportunities. Every ward Welfare Services Committee should have an employment resource person called and functioning. This person should be well-acquainted with all the career planning resources of the Church and community, in order to assist adults and youth to obtain the very best employment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p16" pid="2oPdhir2Wk6XH5uo7rMDGw" hash="yuN5cw">In a personal way, I recall the experiences my dear wife and I went through after deciding the course I should take for my life’s work. I had taken some courses in pharmacy with the plan in mind of converting to a career in medicine. As many of us do, I changed my mind and engaged in another business, banking. We were blessed with steady employment, but I felt attracted toward the profession of law. This was a serious decision because I was married and had a family to support but after fasting and prayer and obtaining the facts as to the best way to proceed, I completed my undergraduate work and entered law school. I took classes at night because it was necessary to be employed during the daytime. These were not easy years for us, but desires are usually accomplished if we are willing to make a determined effort. Needless to say, I had the help and support of my wife. She remained a homemaker and cared for our children. What she gave in love, encouragement, frugality, and companionship was far in excess of any material contribution she might have made by taking employment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p17" pid="fCzs1KCHX0SlcQ_PqB93mg" hash="XkXrkQ">Our wives deserve great credit for the heavy work load they carry day in and day out within our homes. No one expends more energy than a devoted mother and wife. In the usual arrangement of things, however, it is the man to whom the Lord has assigned the breadwinner’s role.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p18" pid="V7L6irv2PEuHiHDUK5AVXA" hash="0xWLxQ">There are impelling reasons for our sisters to plan toward employment also. We want them to obtain all the education and vocational training possible before marriage. If they become widowed or divorced and need to work, we want them to have dignified and rewarding employment. If a sister does not marry, she has every right to engage in a profession that allows her to magnify her talents and gifts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p19" pid="wADGBGJ_w0eTaRnmweArUA" hash="lnjEzQ">Brothers and Sisters, we need to do everything necessary to adequately prepare ourselves for employment or careers. We owe it to ourselves to do our best, and we owe our best in providing for our families. In addition to preparing ourselves for success, we need to help others. This is the spirit of our priesthood responsibility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/prepare-for-honorable-employment.p20" pid="8t5JwJZqPE-ukxdt0SYPsA" hash="nZk8rA">I am grateful for my membership in a church that has this concern for its members, and for my association with brethren who have a concern for each other’s welfare. This is the Lord’s church. This is his work led by his prophet. May we follow the counsel given for preparedness, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Preparations had been made and orders given for the camp to make ready to cross the Jordan and lay siege to Jericho. Joshua told the people that the Lord would do wonders by drying up the river when the feet of the priests leading the march and bearing the ark of the covenant would touch the water. Just as he had foretold, the waters of the Jordan were miraculously dammed up and they crossed over on dry land.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/that-we-may-be-one.p2" pid="QE644Miawkeo-Vvu2TkEyg" hash="CS3IXA">After the people of Israel had crossed the dry riverbed, the Lord commanded Joshua to select twelve men, one from each tribe, to carry on their shoulders twelve stones from the Jordan and lay them down in the place where they would encamp that night. Then he added, “That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/that-we-may-be-one.p3" pid="PJckjByty0qxyBmd1OpZvw" hash="9jo_Jg">“Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/4.6-7" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 4:6–7</a>.)</p>

Here on Temple Square we have consciously surrounded ourselves with such memorials—the old Nauvoo bell, the Seagull Monument, statues of the Restoration, Thorvaldsen’s <span class="emphasis">Christus,</span> to name just a few. These serve to unite generation with generation, preserving in a long, unbroken chain the important events of our common heritage. The passage of time and the growth of our institutions often tend to separate us not only from each other but also from our common purposes. Down through history we have been commanded to construct memorials, or hold Passover feasts, or convene general conferences to preserve the power of our united faith and to remember the commandments of God in achieving our eternal, unchanging goals.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/that-we-may-be-one.p5" pid="FxaZMYkUUECmwESmUt0btQ" hash="Etl92w">More than monuments and festivals are needed, however, for us to succeed in reinforcing our strength and preserving our unity. In much the same way as Joshua did years ago, the builders of the impressive Washington Monument gathered stones from each of the states of the union and encased them within the interior of that 555-foot obelisk, the tallest masonry building in the world, as a tribute not only to the first president and Father of Our Country, but also to our national unity. Yet, while that monument was in preparation, America entered into the bloodiest, most decisive internal conflict it has ever known. It was, as someone has suggested, a Civil War fought over a pronoun—should the United States be referred to as “they” or “it”? Memorials and flags and festivals notwithstanding, the “union” was at stake, for as President Abraham Lincoln had earlier warned, using the Savior’s own words, “If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/that-we-may-be-one.p6" pid="tKlrFZoLkE-Fyyh-AFbRnA" hash="7mOROQ">“And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/3.24-25" class="scriptureRef">Mark 3:24–25</a>.)</p>

As this great conference draws near its close, may I read from what a modern-day prophet referred to as “the greatest prayer ever uttered in this world”? It is recorded by John in impressive detail as he hears it fall from the lips of the Son of God at the close of the evening, after he and his apostles had dined together for the last time:</p>

Nor can the North Americans say to the Asians, nor the Europeans to the islanders of the sea, “I have no need of thee.” No, in this church we have need of every member, and we pray, as did Paul when he wrote to the church in Corinth, “that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</p>

More must be done. These great purposes of the Lord could not have been achieved with dissension or jealousy or selfishness. Our ideas may not always be quite like those who preside in authority over us, but this is the Lord’s church and he will bless each of us as we cast off pride, pray for strength, and contribute to the good of the whole.</p>

There he remained for forty days and nights, preparing himself for the formal ministry which was then to begin. The greatest task ever to be accomplished in this world lay before him, and he needed divine strength. Throughout these days in the wilderness he chose to fast, that his mortal body might be completely subjected to the divine influence of his Father’s Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p3" pid="qd6cEn0qUk2qjQ1lRr0xMA" hash="mn_9-g">When Jesus had completed the fast of forty days and had communed with God, he was, in this hungry and physically weakened state, left to be tempted of the devil. That, too, was to be part of his preparation. Such a time is always the tempter’s moment—when we are emotionally or physically spent, when we are weary, vulnerable, and least prepared to resist the insidious suggestions he makes. This was an hour of danger—the kind of moment in which many men fall and succumb to the subtle allurement of the devil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p4" pid="rVEHKMAgikWMN7SEW0uQ0A" hash="-Tx3NA">Satan’s first temptation was to entice Jesus to satisfy his craving for food, that most basic, physical, biological need. It was a temptation of the senses, an appeal to appetite, and in many ways the most common and most dangerous of the devil’s allurements. “If thou be the Son of God,” he said, “command that these stones be made bread.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.3" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:3</a>.) During the long weeks of seclusion, the Savior had been sustained by the exaltation of spirit that would naturally accompany such meditation, prayer, and communion with the heavens. In such a devoted spirit, bodily appetites were subdued and superceded, but now the demands of the flesh were inevitable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p5" pid="YIohwRL1FU2yLnkohYTGuw" hash="D2O6NQ">Satan was not simply tempting Jesus to eat. Had he suggested, “Go down out of this wilderness and obtain food from the bread maker,” there would have been no temptation because undoubtedly Jesus intended to eat at the close of his fast. Satan’s temptation was to have him eat in a spectacular way—using his divine powers for selfish purposes. The temptation was in the invitation to turn stones into bread miraculously, instantaneously, without waiting or postponing physical gratification. His reply to the tempter was crystal clear: “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.4" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:4</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p6" pid="QNY6tl34GUKenOeKHwwIDA" hash="2RNbrQ">Then followed the second temptation. Realizing that he had utterly failed in his attempt to induce Jesus to use his divine powers for personal, physical gratification and having seen Jesus defer totally to the will and spirit of his Father’s sustenance, Satan went to the other extreme and tempted Jesus to wantonly throw himself upon the Father’s protection. He took Jesus into the Holy City, to the pinnacle of the temple overlooking the spacious courts and people below, and quoted scripture:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p7" pid="b5v8SrfQJk6JPas9i81HYA" hash="z-DfdQ">“If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:6</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/91.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 91:11–12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p8" pid="e8sYpV9y30mvV01PPykIHg" hash="FFqWww">There lurked in this appeal from Satan another temptation of the human side of mortal nature—the temptation to perform some dazzling feat, some astounding exploit which might bring crowds of amazed and attentive onlookers. Surely leaping from the dizzy heights of the temple turret and landing in the courtyard unhurt would be such a feat. This would be public recognition that Jesus was a superior being and did have a message from on high. It would be a sign and a wonder, the fame of which would spread like wildfire throughout all Judaea and cause many to believe that the Messiah had indeed come. But faith is to precede the miracle; miracles are not to precede the faith. Jesus, of course, answered scripture for scripture by replying, “It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:7</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/6.16" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 6:16</a>.) Once more the purposes of Satan were thwarted and Christ became the victor.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p9" pid="ARoBVR2eU0GSFjYYKnOMdA" hash="xhLT0w">In his third temptation, the devil casts away all subtlety and scripture and all deviousness and disguise. Now he staked everything on a blunt, bold proposition. From a high mountain he showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them—the cities, the fields, the flocks, the herds, and everything nature could offer. Though they were not his to give, Satan offered them all to Jesus—to him who had lived as a modest village carpenter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p10" pid="8ITStzLJ1Umz42Mx2Qwr1g" hash="5HuZXA">With wealth, splendor, and earthly glory spread before them, Satan said unto him, “All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:9</a>.) In a final ploy Satan was falling back on one of his false but fundamental propositions, one which resulted in his leading one-third of the hosts from heaven and continues to direct his miserable efforts against the children of men here on earth. It is the proposition that everyone has a price, that material things finally matter most, that ultimately you can buy anything in this world for money.</p>

The surest way to lose the blessings of time or eternity is to accept them on Satan’s terms. Lucifer seemed to have forgotten that this was the Man who would later preach, “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”</p>

Anguished and defeated Satan turned and went away. “And when the devil had ended all the temptation,” Luke adds, “he departed from him for a season.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Luke 4:13</a>.) Matthew tells us that “angels came and ministered unto him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.11" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:11</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p14" pid="fbKqmglJbkOoTDzlenbpdg" hash="Xigg6w">As with Jesus, so with us, relief comes and miracles are enjoyed after the trial and temptation of our faith. There is, of course, running through all of these temptations, Satan’s insidious suggestion that Jesus was not the Son of God, the doubt implied in the tempter’s repeated use of the word if. “If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.3" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:3</a>.) “If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:6</a>.) These, of course, were foreshadows of that final, desperate temptation which would come three years later: “If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/27.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 27:40</a>.) But Jesus patiently withstood that ploy also, knowing in due time every knee would bow and every tongue confess.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p15" pid="fcKusZm3yESmelTdhrLsIA" hash="3FlQIQ">It was not necessary then, or ever, for Jesus to satisfy the curiosity of men, least of all unholy men. So as victory in every encounter came to Jesus, the pathos and tragedy of Lucifer’s life is even more obvious: First bold and taunting and tempting; then pleading and weak and desperate; finally, and ultimately, simple banishment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p16" pid="km6huF-LsEeK_ANQVeAH4A" hash="dJ-_zA">The question for us now is—will we succeed? Will we resist? Will we wear the victor’s crown? Satan may have lost Jesus, but he does not believe he has lost us. He continues to tempt, taunt, and plead for our loyalty. We should take strength for this battle from the fact that Christ was victorious not as a God but as a man.</p>

Had there been no possibility of his yielding to the enticement of Satan, there would have been no real test, no genuine victory in the result. If he had been stripped of the faculty to sin, he would have been stripped of his very agency. It was he who had come to safeguard and ensure the agency of man. He had to retain the capacity and ability to sin had he willed so to do. As Paul wrote, “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/5.8" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 5:8</a>); and he “was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/4.15" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 4:15</a>). He was perfect and sinless, not because he had to be, but rather because he clearly and determinedly wanted to be. As the Doctrine and Covenants records, “He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:22</a>.)</p>

We live in a world of temptation—temptation that seems more real and oppressively rampant than any since the days of Noah. Are we remaining faithful in such a world? Every individual in this church should ask himself, “Am I living so that I am keeping unspotted from the evils of the world?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-temptations-of-christ.p19" pid="a0dEvyGhj0WZua5mT-Csxg" hash="hqciNg">In speaking of the three temptations that came to Jesus, a former President of the Church made this statement concerning them: “Classify them, and you will find that under one of those three nearly every given temptation that makes you and me spotted, ever so little maybe, comes to us as (1) a temptation of the appetite; (2) a yielding to the pride and fashion and vanity of those alienated from the things of God; or (3) a gratifying of the passion, or a desire for the riches of the world, or power among men.” And then he said: “Now, when do temptations come? Why, they come to us in our social gatherings, they come to us at our weddings, they come to us in our politics, they come to us in our business relations, on the farm, in the mercantile establishment, in our dealings in all the affairs of life, we find these insidious influences working, and it is when they manifest themselves to the consciousness of each individual that the defense of truth ought to exert itself.” (David O. McKay, <span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> Oct. 1911, p. 59.)</p>

Throughout the Church all around the world, thousands and thousands of families attend sacrament meeting on the day of rest—the Lord’s day—most of them led by the priesthood bearer of the home, whose responsibility it is to guide the family in keeping the commandments of God. The Lord said, “And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:9</a>.)</p>

From all around they were gathering—men, women, youth, and children. Many were coming as families.</p>

Sometimes there is not a mother or a father, and sometimes no children. Often there is one person living alone. In years gone by, our family was larger, but now it consists of only two.</p>

As we went down the aisle, Brother Doxey, our home teacher, nodded a greeting and we responded similarly—an affectionate greeting in the spirit of a handshake except that distance separated us. And there was Brother Jensen, who was formerly our home teacher, sitting with his wife and daughters. We could also see Sister Nielsen and Sister Whitney, the lovely Relief Society visiting teachers who come to our home and bring a ray of spiritual sunshine to cheer up Sister Hunter. A couple moved over and let us sit by them, and someone on the row behind touched us on the shoulder and whispered that they were glad to see us.</p>

I looked at each of them—well-groomed, reverent, serious. Many young men of their age were spending the day in recreation or sports, but they had come to the house of the Lord. Seated in front of them was a row of deacons. They, too, were well groomed and well behaved, taking seriously the responsibility of their first office in the Aaronic Priesthood.</p>

Then came thoughts of others who have an interest in them: their bishop and his counselors, home teachers, priesthood leaders and teachers, those who are helping them in the Sunday School and the young men’s organization, Scouting and Exploring leaders, and an array of persons who are giving their time and effort to teach and encourage them in their young years.</p>

The deacons dispersed throughout the chapel to serve the broken bread. One of them came to our row and held the silver tray while I partook. Then I held the tray so Sister Hunter could partake, and she held it for the person next to her. Thus the tray went down the row, each serving and being served.</p>

He had sent Peter and John into Jerusalem to make ready the Passover. This included, as was the custom, the sacrifice of a lamb. The laws of sacrifice had been followed down through the centuries since commenced by Father Adam, looking toward the time when the Savior would make the great sacrifice for mankind by the shedding of His own blood and death on the cross.</p>

I asked myself this question: “Do I place God above all other things and keep all of His commandments?” Then came reflection and resolution. To make a covenant with the Lord to always keep His commandments is a serious obligation, and to renew that covenant by partaking of the sacrament is equally serious. The solemn moments of thought while the sacrament is being served have great significance. They are moments of self-examination, introspection, self-discernment—a time to reflect and to resolve.</p>

Anything that breaks the silence during this sacred ordinance seems out of place; but surely the sound of a little one would not displease the Lord. He, too, had been cradled by a loving mother at the beginning of a mortal life that commenced in Bethlehem and ended on the cross of Calvary.</p>

Then followed words of encouragement and instruction, a closing hymn and prayer; and the sacred moments “unmarred by earthly care” had come to a close. On the way home we saw several boys playing ball in the street and a family returning in their motor home from a weekend in the mountains. This thought came to my mind: What a wonderful thing it would be if all persons had an understanding of the purpose of baptism and the willingness to accept of it; the desire to keep the covenants made in that ordinance to serve the Lord and live His commandments; and, in addition, the desire to partake of the sacrament on the Sabbath day to renew those covenants to serve Him and be faithful to the end.</p>

How far reaching! How comprehensive! It excludes from man’s life, profanity, vulgarity, idleness, enmity, jealousy, drunkenness, dishonesty, hatred, selfishness, and every form of vice. It obligates him to sobriety, to industry, to kindness, to the performance of every duty in church and state. He binds himself to respect his fellowmen, to honor the Priesthood, to pay his tithes and offerings and to consecrate his life to the service of humanity.” (David O.

And yet, skeptical “modern” men have need for prayer. Perilous moments, great responsibility, deep anxiety, overwhelming grief—these challenges that shake us out of old complacencies and established routines will bring to the surface our native impulses. If we let them, they will humble us, soften us, and turn us to respectful prayer.</p>

We should remember the Most High day and night—always—not only at times when all other assistance has failed and we desperately need help. If there is any element in human life on which we have a record of miraculous success and inestimable worth to the human soul, it is prayerful, reverential, devout communication with our Heavenly Father.</p>

We must continually look up and acknowledge God as the giver of every good thing and the source of our salvation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/hallowed-be-thy-name.p8" pid="d2xc-7dWJkmhxjSRMdCknQ" hash="IQ3G7A">Jesus looked up throughout the course of his ministry. He prayed constantly and sought faithfully the divine direction of his Father in heaven. Furthermore, he acknowledged that the work and the will he came to fulfill was his Father’s, not his own. He, more than any other in this world’s history, was willing to humble himself, to bow down, and to give honor and glory to the Most High.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/hallowed-be-thy-name.p9" pid="dcGcZqB1l0yGFTuQJXPxdg" hash="q0cTmg">Reverence and adoration were frequently declared in prayer by the Master and were beautifully expressed in the Sermon on the Mount when he gave this counsel: “After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:9</a>.)</p>

We slide over them as though they were only a parenthesis and hasten on to ask for bread and deliverance from our greatest foe.” (Charles Edward Jefferson, <span class="emphasis">Character of Jesus,</span> Salt Lake City: Parliament Publishers, 1968, pp. 313–14.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/hallowed-be-thy-name.p11" pid="yqvD7tpD2EiHIwKfwvrKrQ" hash="csWfDw">Jesus was careful to place the petition “Hallowed be thy name” at the very forefront of his prayer. Unless that reverent, prayerful, honorable attitude toward God is uppermost in our hearts, we are not fully prepared to pray. If our first thought is of ourselves and not of God, we are not praying as Jesus taught. It was his supreme hope that our Father’s name and station would be kept beautiful and holy. Living always with an eye single to the glory of God, he urged men everywhere to so speak, and act, and live, that others seeing their good works might glorify their Father in heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/hallowed-be-thy-name.p12" pid="zr42XwiGX0SRyNEu2sG31A" hash="NHuZ9g">The reverence of the Savior for our Father and the understanding of his love made the whole world hopeful and holy. Even the temple where Jesus taught and worshipped in Jerusalem was built in such a way as to establish respect for and devotion to the Father. Its very architecture taught a silent but constant lesson of reverence. Every Hebrew was privileged to enter into the outer courts of the temple, but only one particular class of men could enter into the inner court or holy place. Into the innermost sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, only one man was permitted to make his way, and this was limited to only one special day each year. In this way a great truth was taught: that God must be approached carefully, respectfully, and with great preparation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/hallowed-be-thy-name.p13" pid="E1dVqW3QbUmtnlhsPPKnlg" hash="YxrMCQ">In the process of moral decline, reverence is one of the first virtues to disappear, and there should be serious concern about that loss in our times. Love of money had warped the hearts of many of Jesus’ countrymen. They cared more for gain than they did for God. Caring nothing for God, why should they care for his temple? They converted the temple courts into a marketplace and drowned out the prayers and psalms of the faithful with their greedy exchange of money and the bleating of innocent sheep. Never did Jesus show a greater tempest of emotion than in the cleansing of the temple. Instantly he became avenging fury, and before the miscreants knew what was happening, their coins were rolling over the temple floor and their flocks and herds were in the street.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/hallowed-be-thy-name.p14" pid="hsd7sNyEA0aN8EeVa9OQVA" hash="ar4LzA">The reason for the tempest lies in just three words: “My Father’s house.” It was not an ordinary house; it was the house of God. It was erected for God’s worship. It was a home for the reverent heart. It was intended to be a place of solace for men’s woes and troubles, the very gate of heaven. “Take these things hence” he said, “make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/2.16" class="scriptureRef">John 2:16</a>.) His devotion to the Most High kindled a fire in his soul and gave his words the force that pierced the offenders like a dagger.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/hallowed-be-thy-name.p15" pid="3MlofwsGr06BpmljGtngRw" hash="5nmsrA">How careful Jesus was for even the name of his Father is illustrated in what he said regarding oaths. The religious leaders of his day had a certain form of prayer and reverence that was often circumscribed and shallow. They paid such high respect to the letters that spelled God’s name that they would never take them upon their lips, but they used in their oaths the names of things that were creations of God. The Savior’s adoration for his Father was so reverent that it extended to all things created by and possessed of the Father. The religionists of the day were in the habit of swearing by heaven, but this to Jesus was profane because heaven was where his Father dwelt. They sometimes swore by the earth, but this to him was irreverent also because the earth was his Father’s footstool. Here indeed is a sensitive, reverential heart. He felt so keenly the majesty and dignity of the Eternal Father that all created things reflected his glory. Nothing was to be treated irreverently or dragged down into vulgarity or converted into jest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/hallowed-be-thy-name.p16" pid="7PJcVnlr_UK-PTPmS3QXTw" hash="8YkIzA">There are wide areas of our society from which the spirit of prayer and reverence and worship has vanished. Men and women in many circles are clever, interesting, or brilliant, but they lack one crucial element in a complete life. They do not look up. They do not offer up vows in righteousness, as the requirement is stated in the Doctrine and Covenants, “on all days and at all times.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:11</a>.) Their conversation sparkles, but it is not sacred. Their talk is witty, but it is not wise. Whether it be in the office, the locker room, or the laboratory, they have come too far down the scale of dignity who display their own limited powers and then find it necessary to blaspheme those unlimited powers that come from above.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/hallowed-be-thy-name.p17" pid="uTvVGyM3jEeJxhpsYL3nHg" hash="Ji1OoQ">Unfortunately we sometimes find this lack of reverence even within the Church. Occasionally we visit too loudly, enter and leave meetings too disrespectfully in what should be an hour of prayer and purifying worship. Reverence is the atmosphere of heaven. Prayer is the utterance of the soul to God the Father. We do well to become more like our Father by looking up to him, by remembering him always, and by caring greatly about his world and his work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/hallowed-be-thy-name.p18" pid="OnJV5lDso0OLiFdurb7Wbw" hash="-Wq8rg">Dr. Alexis Carrel, recipient of the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine, once said, “Today as never before, prayer is a binding necessity in the lives of men and nations. The lack of emphasis on the religious sense has brought the world to an age of destruction. Our deepest source of power and perfection has been left miserably undeveloped.” (<span class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest,</span> March 1941, p. 36.)</p>

A number of years ago, President David O. McKay made this statement: “We are living in a troublous age. Many people in the Church, as millions in the world, are stirred with anxiety; hearts are heavy with feelings of foreboding. For the third time in half a century lowering war clouds threaten world peace. O foolish man! Will he never profit by the experiences of the past! … It is the duty of the members of the Church to hold aloft true spiritual standards. Then we shall be better prepared for any eventuality.” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> April 1948, pp. 64–65.)</p>

One of our LDS chaplains once wrote to a Church leader about the need for reverential faith, or the need to keep looking up. “In combat,” he said, “I learned that a chaplain, if he will, can be the spark plug in the nerve center of a group of men who suddenly realize that they need something from above and beyond. A word here, a word there, a nod there, a prayer with this man, a story with that one, a smile and a comforting arm—all work wonders in teaching men sanity and stability where insanity and instability are the order of the day.” (Harold B. Lee, “Prayer,” Address to Seminary and Institute Faculty, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, July 6, 1956, p. 19.)</p>

In giving his views on a question of present-day concern he made this comment: “I am not a religious man, but there was something about the circumstances of the proposed action that did not strike me as being right.” His comment made me wonder why he associated religion with the social and political subject he was talking about, and it also made me wonder why he thought he was not a religious person. The answer to these queries, I suppose, lies in the definition of religion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/true-religion.p2" pid="IVrRadrZW0OYUla8NW_MbA" hash="GS35qA">The word <span class="emphasis">religion</span> has no one generally accepted definition. Sometimes it is used in reference to worship, whether it be public or private, and sometimes to distinguish between things sacred and those that are profane or worldly. Belief in the immortality of the soul is a concept that is looked upon by some as religious, and one of the most common uses of the term is the belief in deity or deities—a worship of God. The word <span class="emphasis">religion</span> is often associated with the pursuit of what is commonly called salvation, and sometimes with revelation from a divine source.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/true-religion.p3" pid="KkcEWIOVbk-sGN_yHKFeQg" hash="rEFlGA">Not long after the organization of the Church, Joseph Smith published answers to a long list of questions that had been asked of him. One of the questions was this: “What are the fundamental principles of your religion?” To that question, Joseph Smith replied: “The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that he died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 3:30.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/true-religion.p4" pid="RvfBQPZvF0amFgV_fCsicg" hash="axpVjw">On many subjects we are often able to find definitions in the scriptures, but it is interesting to note that even though we think of the Bible as a religious treatise, the word <span class="emphasis">religion</span> does not appear in the Old Testament, and in the writings of the New Testament it is used on three occasions only. I would like to make reference to these three.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/true-religion.p5" pid="_xq8-Mrle06ej_WGlMZvrQ" hash="v7c0QQ">The first use of the word <span class="emphasis">religion</span> is by Paul as he presented his defense before King Agrippa. He said to Agrippa: “After the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/26.5" class="scriptureRef">Acts 26:5</a>). He was referring to the three sects of the Jews: the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. He said he lived a Pharisee—the sect of the three that was the strictest in religious practices. Paul was not talking about a religious creed or a belief, but rather the form of worship, because the Jews placed great stress on practice rather than doctrine—on ritualistic worship rather than a creed of belief.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/true-religion.p6" pid="KT_vbbP8MUCK2dDWGwNXrA" hash="ocBJKw">The second use of the word <span class="emphasis">religion</span> was also by Paul, in writing to the Galatians. He made this statement: “For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/1.13" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 1:13</a>). We well know of the persecutions inflicted by Paul upon those who followed Christ and professed to be Christians and wonder why he did these things. What caused him to take such a ruthless course? Paul answers these questions by stating that he had practiced the religion of his fathers—a religion of iron rules, laws, and traditions inherited from his Hebrew lineage. These iron rules of practice are what caused him to relentlessly persecute the followers of Christ. Thus, in writing to the Galatians he referred to religion in the same manner as he did before King Agrippa, as rules of practice rather than doctrine or a creed of belief.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/true-religion.p7" pid="NRClWg6mF0eSXf959jeLpA" hash="Kmbkww">Now we come to the third instance in the New Testament of the use of the word <span class="emphasis">religion.</span> It is in the Epistle of James, written “to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.1" class="scriptureRef">James 1:1</a>), probably meaning to all Israel, in which he said: “If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.26" class="scriptureRef">James 1:26</a>). James seems to be using the term <span class="emphasis">religion</span> in the manner used by Paul, as being ritualistic or ceremonial—that if a man is ritualistic in this manner, yet fails to be guarded in what he says, his rituals are in vain.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/true-religion.p8" pid="VWkOZSL4IU6g5QWNhn2plg" hash="3Ng2dg">James then very pointedly defines what he refers to as pure religion, as distinguished from forms of ritualistic worship and iron rules of practice as described by Paul. James said: “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.27" class="scriptureRef">James 1:27</a>). The wording is simple and unpretentious, yet the meaning is profound and has deep significance. The words “visit the fatherless and widows” are a reminder that we should have compassion for our neighbor—our fellowmen. This is the teaching of the Master in his frequent reference to love. The Lord said: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:39</a>). This is what James was expressing—a love for, and devotion to, God, by compassionate service to fellowmen. He used as examples the fatherless and the widows.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/true-religion.p9" pid="w-mfojUon0OuluDKSTJC2A" hash="1NIgSw">The second element of the definition of religion stated by James is to keep “unspotted from the world.” To be unspotted from the world simply means being unworldly and free from the pollution of sin and unrighteousness. Paul said something about this also in his writing to the Romans: “Be not conformed to this world” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/12.2" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 12:2</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/true-religion.p10" pid="WPRblRAzcEOgvmmLKcXFHw" hash="YV7boA">In short, James tells us that true religion is a devotion to God, demonstrated by love and compassion for fellowmen, coupled with unworldliness. Such a statement seems too simple to be sufficient, but in its simplicity it speaks an important truth. Restated it may be said that true religion consists not only in refraining from evil (that is, remaining unspotted), but in deliberately and purposefully doing acts of kindness and service to others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/true-religion.p11" pid="Rlm7XM9pzESUUSfuwHxpAQ" hash="5JFBRw">King Benjamin recognized this principle as he spoke to his people from the tower. He reminded them that he had spent his days in their service and said: “I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.</p>

It was during the last two hours of his life, confined behind bars in Carthage, that his close friend, President John Taylor, sang a song to cheer him on that melancholy occasion. The song has a number of verses commencing with helping the unfortunate and sharing a crust with one perishing for want of bread. These are some of the words:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-spirituality.p" pid="60i5L2w5EEOkiYSmC11h5w" hash="pdbisA">President Wilford Woodruff once had a remarkable experience to which I would like to refer. He first publicly mentioned the incident at general conference in October of 1880. Sixteen years later he gave further details in a discourse delivered at the Weber Stake conference, and his remarks were published in <span class="emphasis">The Deseret Weekly.</span> In the 1880 conference President Woodruff told of dreams he had after the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith in which he conversed with the Prophet many times. He then related another dream in which he talked with Brigham Young, and this is what he said about it:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-spirituality.p" pid="8WKaVl2xYkyUNJ1Rq73yHQ" hash="rno6vw">“I saw Brother Brigham and Brother Heber ride in [a] carriage ahead of the carriage in which I rode when I was on my way to attend conference; and they were dressed in the most priestly robes. When we arrived at our destination I asked Prest. Young if he would preach to us. He said, ‘No, I have finished my testimony in the flesh I shall not talk to this people any more. But (said he) I have come to see you; I have come to watch over you, and to see what the people are doing. Then (said he) I want you to teach the people—and I want you to follow this counsel yourself—that they must labor and so live as to obtain the Holy Spirit, for without this you cannot build up the kingdom; without the spirit of God you are in danger of walking in the dark, and in danger of failing to accomplish your calling as apostles and as elders in the church and kingdom of God. And, said he, Brother Joseph taught me this principle.’” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 21:318.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-spirituality.p" pid="KwFQgtzrZ06u4dbGqHtjCw" hash="yarKfw">President Woodruff then went on to say of that experience, as he spoke at the Weber Stake conference, essentially what I want to say today: “Every man and woman in this Church should labor to get that Spirit. We are surrounded by these evil spirits that are at war against God and against everything looking to the building up of the kingdom of God; and we need this Holy Spirit to enable us to overcome these influences.” (<span class="emphasis">Deseret Weekly,</span> 7 Nov. 1896, p. 643.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-spirituality.p" pid="Os94ghBmGkqYYE2q0oti4g" hash="g771TQ">Continuing his discourse, President Woodruff told of his missionary experiences. He said: “In the time of the apostasy in Kirtland … the Spirit of God said to me, ‘You choose a partner and go straight to Fox Islands.’ Well, I knew no more what was on Fox Islands than what was on Kolob. But the Lord told me to go, and I went. I chose Jonathan H. Hale, and he went with me. … Through the blessings of God I brought nearly a hundred from there up to Zion, at the time the Saints were driven out of Missouri into Illinois.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-spirituality.p" pid="g9C4m6RDCU63hrPm5gW8ow" hash="Qfimjg">“So it has been all through my life. If I have undertaken to do anything, and the Lord has wanted me to do something else, He has had to tell me. When we were sent to England, we were sent by revelation. I went into the Staffordshire potteries with Brother Alfred Cordon. We were doing a splendid work, baptizing almost every night, and I thought it was the finest mission I ever was on. I went into the town of Hanley one night, and attended meeting in a large hall, which was filled to overflowing. The Spirit of the Lord came upon me and said that that was the last meeting I should hold with that people for many days. I told the people that that was the last meeting I should be with them. After the meeting, they asked me where I was going. I told them I did not know. In the morning I asked the Lord what He wanted of me. He merely said, ‘Go to the south.’ I got into the stage and rode eighty miles. The first man’s house I stopped at was John Benbow’s in Herefordshire. In half an hour after I entered the house I knew exactly why the Lord had sent me. There was a people there who had been praying for the ancient order of things. They were waiting for the Gospel as it was taught by Christ and His Apostles. The consequence was, the first thirty days after I got there I baptized six hundred of those people. In eight month’s labor in that country I brought eighteen hundred into the Church. Why? Because there was a people prepared for the Gospel, and the Lord sent me there to do that work. I have always had to give God the glory for everything good that has happened to me; for I have realized by what power it came.” (<span class="emphasis">Deseret Weekly,</span> 7 Nov. 1896, p. 643.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-spirituality.p" pid="5hdNg7IGXUOuya6nEV3X_w" hash="BtUQKQ">President Woodruff concludes with these words: “I refer to these things because I want you to get the same Spirit. All the Elders of Israel, whether abroad or at home, need that Spirit. … This is the Spirit that we must have to carry out the purposes of God on the earth. We need that more than any other gift. … We are in the midst of enemies, in the midst of darkness and temptation, and we need to be guided by the Spirit of God. We should pray to the Lord until we get the Comforter. This is what is promised to us when we are baptized. It is the spirit of light, of truth, and of revelation and can be with all of us at the same time.” (<span class="emphasis">Deseret Weekly,</span> 7 Nov. 1896, p. 643.)</p>

It takes time and frequently involves a struggle. It will not happen by chance, but is accomplished only through deliberate effort and by calling upon God and keeping his commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/developing-spirituality.p" pid="sqjWRDnaSk6VWTrkA9mZYA" hash="He1nmg">The Apostle Paul spent much of his life teaching and encouraging spirituality in the then far-flung missions of the world. He frequently used terminology from the sports, games, and athletic contests. He said that a Saint successfully keeping the commandments is like an athlete winning his contest; that comparable degrees of training, exertion, obedience to the rules, self-discipline, and the will to win are involved. To the Corinthians he wrote words, which paraphrased, are to this effect: “You know (do you not?) that at the sports all the runners run the race, though only one wins the prize. Like them, run to win! Now every athlete goes into strict training. They do it to win a perishable wreath, but our wreath will last forever. For my part I run with a clear goal before me.

The Prophet Joseph Smith said: “We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the intellect; and that the nearer man approaches perfection, the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till he has overcome the evils of his life and lost every desire for sin; and like the ancients, arrives at that point of faith where he is wrapped in the power and glory of his Maker, and is caught up to dwell with Him. But we consider that this is a station to which no man ever arrived in a moment.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 2:8.)</p>

Perfection is something yet ahead for every one of us; but we can capitalize on our strengths, begin where we are, and seek after the happiness that can be found in pursuing the things of God. We should remember the Lord’s counsel:</p>

Every person can and must make spiritual progress. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the divine plan for that spiritual growth eternally. It is more than a code of ethics. It is more than an ideal social order. It is more than positive thinking about self-improvement and determination. The gospel is the saving power of the Lord Jesus Christ with his priesthood and sustenance and with the Holy Spirit. With faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and obedience to his gospel, a step at a time improving as we go, pleading for strength, improving our attitudes and our ambitions, we will find ourselves successfully in the fold of the Good Shepherd. That will require discipline and training and exertion and strength. But as the Apostle Paul said, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 4:13</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p1" pid="6ZPqGAKEJ0Kc4zK4FOfOhA" hash="xFpG5w">When we follow the counsel of our leaders to read and study the scriptures, benefits and blessings of many kinds come to us. This is the most profitable of all study in which we could engage. The portion of scripture known as the Old and New Testaments is often referred to as the great literature of the world. These books have been regarded as scientific treatises, as philosophic dissertations, and also as historical records; but if we understand the true purpose of these and other scriptures, we realize that they are really the fundamental literature of religion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p2" pid="G2bkb6DeMEu4CLpPiv4kbg" hash="HfSQdQ">The scriptural library contains the basic declarations concerning God and his children and the interrelationship between them. Throughout each of the books there is an appeal to believe and have faith in God the Eternal Father and in his son, Jesus Christ; and from the first to the last of these books of scripture is the call to do the will of God and keep his commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p3" pid="gmUvHQiJJEisyATiXf2RJA" hash="SXwQfw">Scriptures contain the record of the self-revelation of God, and through them God speaks to man. Where could there be more profitable use of time than reading from the scriptural library the literature that teaches us to know God and understand our relationship to him? Time is always precious to busy people, and we are robbed of its worth when hours are wasted in reading or viewing that which is frivolous and of little value.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p4" pid="0wAk98BKN0-zk2q-5yrlsg" hash="ANDr4Q">Reading habits vary widely. There are rapid readers and slow readers, some who read only small snatches at a time and others who persist without stopping until the book is finished. Those who delve into the scriptural library, however, find that to understand requires more than casual reading or perusal—there must be concentrated study. It is certain that one who studies the scriptures every day accomplishes far more than one who devotes considerable time one day and then lets days go by before continuing. Not only should we study each day, but there should be a regular time set aside when we can concentrate without interference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p5" pid="18FXfCXu70mw1mP_A_7k2w" hash="mYZ2Rw">There is nothing more helpful than prayer to open our understanding of the scriptures. Through prayer we can attune our minds to seek the answers to our searchings. The Lord said: “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/11.9" class="scriptureRef">Luke 11:9</a>). Herein is Christ’s reassurance that if we will ask, seek, and knock, the Holy Spirit will guide our understanding if we are ready and eager to receive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p6" pid="1xzHYgKWYEiLnbcQ1h4Vfg" hash="R82JIQ">Many find that the best time to study is in the morning after a night’s rest has cleared the mind of the many cares that interrupt thought. Others prefer to study in the quiet hours after the work and worries of the day are over and brushed aside, thus ending the day with a peace and tranquillity that comes by communion with the scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p7" pid="3KbA17C9wUulCSYRSAlQNg" hash="EZNUIw">Perhaps what is more important than the hour of the day is that a regular time be set aside for study. It would be ideal if an hour could be spent each day; but if that much cannot be had, a half hour on a regular basis would result in substantial accomplishment. A quarter of an hour is little time, but it is surprising how much enlightenment and knowledge can be acquired in a subject so meaningful. The important thing is to allow nothing else to ever interfere with our study.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p8" pid="JADBGgoHv0im7jrxbDKX2g" hash="sXuOiA">Some prefer to study alone, but companions can study together profitably. Families are greatly blessed when wise fathers and mothers bring their children about them, read from the pages of the scriptural library together, and then discuss freely the beautiful stories and thoughts according to the understanding of all. Often youth and little ones have amazing insight into and appreciation for the basic literature of religion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p9" pid="A8etpE8l10G17fqjEnGFbQ" hash="r3porw">We should not be haphazard in our reading but rather develop a systematic plan for study. There are some who read to a schedule of a number of pages or a set number of chapters each day or week. This may be perfectly justifiable and may be enjoyable if one is reading for pleasure, but it does not constitute meaningful study. It is better to have a set amount of time to give scriptural study each day than to have a set amount of chapters to read. Sometimes we find that the study of a single verse will occupy the whole time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p10" pid="zAhHMuMV90e9V1PRwv5wLg" hash="vexQrA">The life, acts, and teachings of Jesus can be read rapidly. The stories are simple in most instances and the stories are simply told. The Master used few words in his teachings, but each one is so concise in meaning that together they portray a clear image to the reader. Sometimes, however, many hours might be spent in contemplation of profound thoughts expressed in a few simple words.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p11" pid="4FHPlccbjUGgyFxTZRkWPw" hash="sQz5xA">There was an incident in the life of the Savior that was mentioned by Matthew, Mark, and Luke. A significant part of the story is told by Mark in only two short verses and five words of the following verse. Let me read them to you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p12" pid="0vosE46MM0Keu9voFvpArA" hash="1jq8kA">“And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him [that is, when he saw Jesus], he fell at his feet,</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p13" pid="4z4_1wRmHkSfdeDccIkeww" hash="GYh48g">“And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p14" pid="fDnaO63pJ0apmXbQXeLTOA" hash="IT7j5w">“And Jesus went with him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/5.22-24" class="scriptureRef">Mark 5:22–24</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p15" pid="m4P_bPNN8UaX2-Ns8x-w7w" hash="qNIoBQ">The reading time of that portion of the story is about thirty seconds. It is short and uncomplicated. The visual picture is clear and even a child could repeat it without difficulty. But as we spend time in thought and contemplation, a great depth of understanding and meaning comes to us. We conclude that this is more than a simple story about a little girl who was sick and Jesus went to lay his hands on her. Let me read these words to you again:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p16" pid="9HqG94MU8kWEBTL8f0yY5Q" hash="stQEFg">“And, behold.” The word <span class="emphasis">behold</span> is used frequently in scripture with a wide variety of meanings. Its use in this instance designates suddenness or unexpectedness. Jesus and those who were with him had just recrossed the Sea of Galilee, and a multitude of people who had been waiting met him on the shore near Capernaum. “And, behold [suddenly and unexpectedly], there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue.” The larger synagogues of that day were presided over by a college of elders under the direction of a chief or a ruler. This was a man of rank and prestige whom the Jews looked upon with great respect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p17" pid="Z5my_ZP0lECxpY-dlWoXXw" hash="GDYxuA">Matthew doesn’t give the name of this chief elder, but Mark identifies him by adding to his title the words, “Jairus by name.” Nowhere else in the scriptures does this man or his name appear except on this occasion, yet his memory lives in history because of a brief contact with Jesus. Many, many lives have become memorable that otherwise would have been lost in obscurity had it not been for the touch of the Master’s hand that made a significant change of thought and action and a new and better life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p18" pid="undObsZzLkW4uWv9A__rvQ" hash="7JEoCg">“And when he saw him [that is, when Jairus saw Jesus], he fell at his feet.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p19" pid="tE7t192FY0uKfkGCsynFIw" hash="Mw6vww">This was an unusual circumstance for a man of rank and prestige, a ruler of the synagogue, to kneel at Jesus’ feet—at the feet of one considered to be an itinerant teacher with the gift of healing. Many others of learning and prestige saw Jesus also but ignored him. Their minds were closed. Today is no different; obstacles stand in the way of many to accept him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p20" pid="865uGKNwhUCP7qkgKBaPmA" hash="4IsjEA">“And [Jairus] besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death.” This is typical of what happens frequently when a man comes to Christ, not so much for his own need, but because of the desperate need of a loved one. The tremor we hear in Jairus’s voice as he speaks of “My little daughter” stirs our souls with sympathy as we think of this man of high position in the synagogue on his knees before the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p21" pid="chf1J0sof0e6i1HkNJ5LiQ" hash="mh7jxw">Then comes a great acknowledgement of faith: “I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.” These are not only the words of faith of a father torn with grief but are also a reminder to us that whatever Jesus lays his hands upon lives. If Jesus lays his hands upon a marriage, it lives. If he is allowed to lay his hands on the family, it lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p22" pid="yLcNUZHxhUuuDlqoGBky0g" hash="BTEeRw">The words, “and Jesus went with him” follow. We would not suppose that this event had been within the plans for the day. The Master had come back across the sea where the multitude was waiting on the shore for him to teach them. “And behold”—suddenly and unexpectedly—he was interrupted by the plea of a father. He could have ignored the request because many others were waiting. He could have said to Jairus that he would come to see his daughter tomorrow, but “Jesus went with him.” If we follow in the footsteps of the Master, would we ever be too busy to ignore the needs of our fellowmen?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p23" pid="J2-qJnf74EqCUKKEkahyug" hash="5BU7jw">It is not necessary to read the remainder of the story. When they got to the home of the ruler of the synagogue, Jesus took the little girl by the hand and raised her from the dead. In like manner, he will lift and raise every man to a new and better life who will permit the Savior to take him by the hand.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p24" pid="9CTTwqHD3UCupEQx2Wbb9g" hash="se_68w">I am grateful for the library of scripture through which a greater knowledge of Jesus Christ can be learned by devoted study. I am grateful that in addition to the Old and New Testaments, the Lord, through prophets of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has added other revealed scripture as additional witnesses for Christ—the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price—all of which I know to be the word of God. These bear witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/reading-the-scriptures.p25" pid="H7cGgDoqvUmQ7gLbgJ45_A" hash="dSaLrw">May the Lord bless us in our study and righteous quest to seek him, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Suddenly there was a roar from the crowd as the boats came into sight in the distance. Each of them had a crew of fifty powerful oarsmen dipping and pulling the oars with a rhythm that forced the crafts through the waves and foaming water—a beautiful sight.</p>

We walked over to the place where the boats docked after the race had concluded. One of the oarsmen explained to us that the prow of the fautasi is so constructed that it cuts through and divides the water to help overcome the resistance that retards the speed of the boat. He further explained that the pulling of the oars against the resistance of the water creates the force that causes the boat to move forward. Resistance creates both the opposition and the forward movement.</p>

Without this force, a person or vehicle could not move about, or if already in motion, could not be stopped except by collision. Simple things like nails, screws, and bolts would not stay in place; a cork would not stay in a bottle; a light globe would drop from its socket; a lid would not stay on a jar.</p>

This is probably what Lehi was referring to when he spoke to his son Jacob. He reminded Jacob of the afflictions and sorrows that had come to him because of the rudeness of his brethren, and told him how these afflictions would ultimately result in good. These are the words of Jacob to his son: “Thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.2" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:2</a>).</p>

If not so, … righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:11</a>).</p>

It was part of the plan for our eternal progress. Without temptation, sickness, pain, and sorrow, there could be no goodness, virtue, appreciation for well-being, or joy. The law of opposition makes freedom of choice possible; therefore, our Heavenly Father has commanded his children, “Choose ye this day, to serve the Lord God who made you” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.33" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:33</a>). He has counseled us to yield to his spirit and resist temptation. Free agency, of course, permits us to oppose his directions; thus, we see many who resist the truth and yield to temptation.</p>

The terrain over which we have traveled is a grim reminder that struggle, persecution, and sorrow have been the lot of our forebears.

With his parents, he left prosperous circumstances in Jerusalem and then for eight years, in great affliction, journeyed in the wilderness. The family then crossed uncharted seas to a new land. During this period, Nephi was assailed, ridiculed, and persecuted by members of his household. Following the death of his father, Nephi and other family members had to separate themselves from his older brothers because they sought his life. Out of his despair, he declared, “My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:20</a>).</p>

There are those who know pain and sorrow because of loss of loved ones; who know spiritual sorrow because children go astray; who experience loss of health, financial reverses, and emotional distress, and yet, like Job, resolve, “When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/23.10" class="scriptureRef">Job 23:10</a>).</p>

He spoke from experience when he wrote these words: “Being human, we would expel from our lives physical pain and mental anguish and assure ourselves of continual ease and comfort, but if we were to close the doors upon sorrow and distress, we might be excluding our greatest friends and benefactors.

We remember that at the end of the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the author, John, issues a warning and a curse upon any man who adds to or takes away from the book. Specifically, these are the words he wrote:</p>

Nothing more is to be added and nothing is to be taken away. They assert that the Book of Mormon is an attempt to add to the words of the Bible. These claims were made when the Book of Mormon was first published and have continued to be made, and are made today. Is there any validity to such assertions?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/no-man-shall-add-to-or-take-away.p5" pid="dGrwVVTuUUKjKnzq8rcB4A" hash="bD3xqg">The answer to this query is really very simple. A careful reading of the words makes it clear that the warning against adding to or taking away does not refer to the whole Bible or even to the New Testament, but to use John’s words, only to the words of “the book of this prophecy.” That is, the prophecy contained in the book of Revelation. This is substantiated by the fact that some of the books of the New Testament had not yet been written when John wrote the book of Revelation, and even those that had been written and were in existence at that time had not yet been gathered into one compilation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/no-man-shall-add-to-or-take-away.p6" pid="7W0zo01ADEiyZS_yqqlIEA" hash="LQhpOw">The collection of writings consisting of the sixty-six books we know as the Bible were brought together and compiled into one volume long after John wrote the prophetic book that has been placed at the end of the collection. It is clear, therefore, that the terrible judgments pronounced upon those who add to the book could not possibly apply to the whole of the Bible or even to the New Testament, but only to the book of Revelation.</p>

Of necessity the word <span class="emphasis">book</span> would have been in the singular because when written it was not associated with any other book or books, and it was after many years and many ecclesiastical debates that it was added to the collection that became known as the new canon of scripture or the New Testament.</p>

It was long after John left Patmos that he wrote his first epistle. This fact standing alone would be sufficient to defeat the claim that revelation was closed and that man was enjoined from adding to scripture. This adds cumulative evidence that John had reference to the book of Revelation only.</p>

The first is found in Deuteronomy, written at the time Moses was exhorting Israel to live the law of the Lord. The Torah was oral law and had not been reduced to writing prior to the time of the codification of the law in Deuteronomy. Now that it had been reduced to writing by Moses prior to his death and assumed to be complete, Moses wrote:</p>

In effect, these passages contain the same injunction as the one at the close of the Apocalypse; and if the same interpretation and argument was applied to them as is applied to the closing verses of the book of Revelation, there would be no scripture after the writings of Moses. Such an absurdity would result in discarding the greater part of the Old Testament and all of the books of the New Testament.</p>

There is no indication or intimation that God could not, or would not, add to or take from; nor would any reasonable person with a belief in the divine powers of God consciously believe that God would be so restricted. Without question he would have the right and power to give additional revelation for the guidance of his children in any age and to add additional scripture.</p>

Were it not for continuous revelation, Noah would not have been prepared for the deluge that encompassed the earth. Abraham would not have been guided from Haran to Hebron, the Land of Promise. Continuous revelation led the children of Israel from bondage back to their promised land. Revelation through prophets guided missionary efforts, directed the rebuilding of Solomon’s temple, and denounced the infiltration of pagan practices among the Israelites.</p>

Many years have passed since settlers came in covered wagons into this valley in the tops of the Rockies. Conference was an important occasion in their day, and it continues to be a significant occasion in ours as people of faith and devotion come together to renew and strengthen that faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/conference-time.p2" pid="htTDZSqCtkKGRWbzHcwKPw" hash="KPSEeg">Conference time is a season of spiritual revival when knowledge and testimony are increased and solidified that God lives and blesses those who are faithful. It is a time when an understanding that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, is burned into the hearts of those who have the determination to serve him and keep his commandments. Conference is the time when our leaders give us inspired direction in the conduct of our lives—a time when souls are stirred and resolutions are made to be better husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, more obedient sons and daughters, better friends and neighbors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/conference-time.p3" pid="74hUo8WKMECV24JdjKizRA" hash="qkEuCg">As we enter into the spirit of conference, another feeling comes to us—one of deep gratitude that we have been blessed by an understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ as it has been restored to earth in this dispensation of time. We mix with others from around the world who have that same feeling, and we wish that men and women everywhere could understand and find the joy and peace that come from the knowledge that all people are children of God and therefore brothers and sisters—literally, actually, and in fact, regardless of race, color, language, or religious belief. Turning to the scriptures, we read:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/conference-time.p4" pid="4T9qk9bPok6A1f-5qcnOXw" hash="JA4xdw">“And he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:33</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/conference-time.p5" pid="qNET_iBPDkWoCb_D0cuEGw" hash="HI668g">We are reminded as we participate in conference of the deep commitment we have to our fellowmen, our brothers and sisters throughout the world. It is a commitment to share with them a gift that has come to us and the greatest gift we could give to them—an understanding of the fulness of the gospel. We are committed to declare to all the world that Jesus of Nazareth is the Savior of mankind, that he has paid for our sins by his atoning sacrifice, that he has risen from the dead, and that he lives today. Our responsibility is to help the people of the world understand the true nature of our Father in Heaven: that he is a personal God, a loving father, and one to whom each of us may go with our problems and concerns.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/conference-time.p6" pid="mBHTpyHdw0yKJ6k-B2kT5w" hash="mhUGBw">We who are met here today claim a special, unique knowledge of the Savior’s gospel. Most striking of all, to those who first become acquainted with us, is our declaration to the world that we are guided by a living prophet of God—one who communicates with, is inspired by, and receives revelation from the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/conference-time.p7" pid="C_HXvHJalkW1VmL0IZ2bGA" hash="HuUe-w">How do we know such things are true? We know because God has spoken in our time—in our day. The heavens have opened; God has communicated his word to man; eternal truths have been given to the world from the Father of us all. God the Father and Jesus Christ, his Son, have appeared to and have talked with men in this dispensation. In fact, the Lord has appeared on numerous occasions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/conference-time.p8" pid="MnpI6nmdvUuGsQHEml2tSg" hash="O94bcQ">We know that our Father in Heaven loves us and is concerned about our spiritual and temporal welfare. We know that his Son, Jesus Christ, our Elder Brother, has provided a way for us to return to the presence of God; that there is a divine purpose for our being here on earth; that we have a work to do which is an important part of his plan. In addition, we know many details of that plan and have received specific direction about our responsibilities.</p>

We touch, we see, we hear and taste and smell and learn. However, spiritual knowledge, as Paul has said, comes to us in a spiritual way from its spiritual source. Paul continues:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/conference-time.p16" pid="xexNTk2UIEya3opsP8GprQ" hash="xsV_Qw">“But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.14" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/conference-time.p17" pid="WJyfNxDQP0i0S8q5Gh4rJA" hash="-xJhUw">We have found, and know, that the only way to gain spiritual knowledge is to approach our Father in Heaven through the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ. When we do this, and if we are spiritually prepared, we see things our eyes have not previously seen, and we hear things we may not have previously heard—“the things which God hath prepared,” using Paul’s words. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:9</a>.) These things we receive through the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/conference-time.p18" pid="57VzOFTz-EaveTtIfugs1A" hash="g8Pdkg">We believe, and testify to the world, that communication with our Father in Heaven and direction from the Lord are available today. We testify that God speaks to man as he did in the days of the Savior and in Old Testament times. We would say to the world: “Listen to and weigh the words of this conference; consider the direction and counsel that come from those who speak. Then, after prayerful pondering, that sweet warm conviction that comes from the Holy Spirit will testify to you of its truthfulness.”</p>

We know that this work will continue to roll forth, as the Prophet Joseph Smith has said, “till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:540.)</p>

We have concern for those who have worked hard and who have lived righteously but think—because they haven’t achieved in the world or in the Church what others have achieved—that they have failed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p2" pid="R4BmWddymEGUTsPLqFq5gQ" hash="CRpe4g">Perhaps we should consider the things that make a person great.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p3" pid="KW3CFEVuXk6r2g4p7FVOhQ" hash="KYHHKw">We live in a world that seems to worship its own kind of greatness. It’s true that the world’s heroes don’t last very long in the public mind, but, nevertheless, there is never a lack of champions and great achievers. We hear almost daily of athletes breaking records; scientists inventing marvelous new devices, machines, and processes; and doctors saving lives in new ways. We are constantly being exposed to exceptionally gifted musicians and entertainers, also to the work of unusually talented artists, architects, and builders. Magazines, billboards, and television commercials bombard us with pictures of individuals with perfect teeth and flawless features, wearing stylish clothes and doing whatever it is that successful people do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p4" pid="TKlUNU2F_0yYB-xpgJa30Q" hash="ysv7Ew">Because we are being constantly exposed to the world’s definition of success and greatness, it is understandable that we might frequently find ourselves making comparisons between what we are and what others are, or seem to be, and also between what we have and what others have. Although it is true that making comparisons can be beneficial and may motivate us to accomplish much good and improve our lives, yet we often allow unfair and improper comparisons to destroy our happiness when they cause us to feel unfulfilled or inadequate or unsuccessful. Sometimes, because of these feelings, we are led into error, and we dwell on our failures while ignoring aspects of our lives that may contain elements of true greatness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p5" pid="ZrcD1zet4kmjbk0V7Yv8Nw" hash="JXDHqA">In a short editorial written by President Joseph F. Smith in 1905, he made this most profound statement about what true greatness really is:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p6" pid="jnBfE8RcBE6vHcpG3YKpJg" hash="sWAJkQ">“Those things which we call extraordinary, remarkable, or unusual may make history, but they do not make real life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p7" pid="Skzxafem80SNTY2lp_EWhg" hash="hykClQ">“After all, to do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all mankind, is the truest greatness. To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman.” (<span class="emphasis">Juvenile Instructor,</span> 15 Dec. 1905, p. 752.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p8" pid="hd5OqGzJMkm4-F8FIPuINQ" hash="xFvrBA">This statement raises a query as to what are the things God has ordained to be the common lot of all mankind. Surely they include the things that must be done in order to be a good father or a good mother, but, to generalize, they are also the thousands of little deeds and tasks of service and sacrifice that constitute the giving or losing of one’s life for others and for the Lord. They include gaining a knowledge of our Father in Heaven and his gospel. They include bringing others into the faith and fellowship of his kingdom. These things do not usually receive the attention or the adulation of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p9" pid="VWlK2zKoyE6pzjA-6E9yBA" hash="m1miVQ">To extend the statement of President Smith and to be more specific, we could say: To be a successful Primary president or den mother or Spiritual Living teacher or loving neighbor or listening friend is much of what true greatness is all about. To do one’s best in the face of the commonplace struggles of life, and possibly in the face of failures, and to continue to endure and persevere with the ongoing difficulties of life—when those struggles and tasks contribute to the progress and happiness of others and the eternal salvation of one’s self—this is true greatness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p10" pid="fBeGQlfQSEyW6mJrDXr10Q" hash="Dxvb-g">Surely we need not look far to see the unnoticed and forgotten heroes of daily life. I am speaking of those you know and those I know who quietly and consistently do the things they ought to do. I am talking about those who are always there and always willing. I am referring to the uncommon valor of the mother who—hour after hour, day and night—will stay with and care for a sick child, or the invalid who struggles and suffers without complaint. I’m including those who always volunteer to give blood or volunteer to work with Scouts. I am thinking of those who may not be mothers but who nevertheless “mother” the children of the world. I am speaking of those who are always there to love and nurture.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p11" pid="gXJ3eJLo50WQc3jHl0DVfQ" hash="qdG1Gg">I am also talking about teachers and nurses and farmers and others who do the good work of the world, who teach and feed and clothe, but who also, in addition, do the work of the Lord—those who lift and love. I am referring to those who are honest and kind and hardworking in their daily work, but who are also servants of the Master and shepherds of his sheep.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p12" pid="d4KOPK-8q0qHs2CJlJzw_Q" hash="GS8qzA">Now, I do not mean to discount too much the great accomplishments of the world that have given us so many opportunities and which provide culture and order and excitement to our lives. I am merely suggesting that we try to focus more clearly on the things in life that will be of greatest worth. You will remember that it was the Savior who said, <span class="emphasis">“He that is greatest among you shall be your servant.”</span> (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/23.11" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 23:11</a>; italics added.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p13" pid="bLZd53GnLU2lLaFjFWc0vQ" hash="5dx2Lw">Listen to the words of President Joseph F. Smith as he goes on in his remarks to help us place in proper perspective the achievements and accomplishments that lead to worldly success and recognition. Notice that he refers to worldly achievements—that is, those that may bring the fame and fortune of the world—as “secondary.” He said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p14" pid="T4dxAc_MBU-wkYGKLzlscg" hash="9mpxww">“It is true that such secondary greatness may be added to that which we style common-place; but when such secondary greatness is not added to that which is fundamental, it is merely an empty honor, and fades away from the common and universal good in life, even though it may find a place in the … pages of history.” (<span class="emphasis">Juvenile Instructor,</span> p. 752.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p15" pid="dBGZjmQ4p0edrzxhx6cRPg" hash="a7p6-Q">With this definition of true greatness, how do we proceed to achieve it? The Lord has said, <span class="emphasis">“Out of small things proceedeth that which is great.” </span>(<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:33</a>; italics added.) Each of us has seen individuals become wealthy or successful almost instantaneously, almost overnight. But I believe that even though this kind of success may come to some without a prolonged struggle, there is no such thing as instant greatness. This is because the achievement of true greatness is a long-term process; it may involve occasional setbacks. The end result may not always be clearly visible, but it seems that it always requires regular, consistent, small, and sometimes ordinary and mundane steps over a long period of time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p16" pid="c4GDHcrWoEOegpiIwRxHXA" hash="Lod5lg">True greatness is never a result of a chance occurrence or a one-time effort or achievement. It requires the development of character. It requires a multitude of correct decisions for the everyday choices between good and evil that Elder Boyd K. Packer spoke about when he said, “Over the years these little choices will be bundled together and show clearly what we value.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1980, p. 21.) Those choices will also show clearly what we are.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p17" pid="1gV4A9adxkifrNpycnNmTg" hash="NlbRhg">As we evaluate our lives, it is important that we look, not only at our accomplishments, but also at the conditions under which we have labored. We are all different and unique individuals; we have each had different starting points in the race of life; we each have a unique mixture of talents and skills; we each have our own set of challenges and constraints to contend with. Therefore, our judgment of ourselves and our achievements should not merely include the size or magnitude and number of our accomplishments; it should also include the conditions that have existed and the effect that our efforts have had on others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p18" pid="3rbxWZt2rUS4iXNkfCjq7A" hash="FYii7A">It is this last aspect of our self-evaluation—the effect of our lives on the lives of others—that will help us understand why some of the common, ordinary work of life should be valued so highly. Frequently it is the commonplace tasks that have the greatest positive effect on the lives of others, as compared with the things that the world so often relates to greatness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p19" pid="K08BONyAs0a86tU-x2C3iQ" hash="L3f_lg">It appears to me that the kind of greatness that our Father in Heaven would have us pursue is within the grasp of all who are within the gospel net. We have an unlimited number of opportunities to do the many simple and minor things that will ultimately make us great. To those who have devoted their lives to service and sacrifice for others and for the Lord, the best counsel is simply to do more of the same.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p20" pid="djYc_b0s3k2ZyuOHIIfGig" hash="phSGQw">To those who are doing the commonplace work of the world but are wondering about the value of their accomplishments; to those who are the workhorses of this Church, who are furthering the work of the Lord in so many quiet but significant ways; to those who are the salt of the earth and the strength of the world and the backbone of each nation—to you we would simply express our admiration. If you endure to the end, and if you are valiant in the testimony of Jesus, you will achieve true greatness and will live in the presence of our Father in Heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p21" pid="JxNv7ZIiPk-DMRoFde1BZw" hash="yNe-2g">As President Joseph F. Smith has said, “Let us not be trying to substitute an artificial life for the true one.” (<span class="emphasis">Juvenile Instructor,</span> p. 753.) Let us remember that “out of small things proceedeth that which is great.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:33</a>.) Let us remember that doing the things that have been ordained by God to be important and needful and necessary, even though the world may view them as unimportant and insignificant, will eventually lead us to true greatness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/true-greatness.p22" pid="z7pxSg6dsUGHd9YaMmeUvQ" hash="TmA21Q">That we may never be discouraged in doing those daily tasks which God has ordained to the common lot of man is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Israelite history is filled with examples of covenants, which constitute one of the central themes of the Old Testament—the promises of God made in exchange for the commitments of the prophets and the people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p2" pid="4KG5SwCfsUqzvwc1Ivhwvw" hash="xhfA2A">The Lord made a covenant with Noah, and the rainbow became the token of that eternal covenant with all mankind. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/9.13" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 9:13</a>.) The covenant made with Abraham and his seed was sealed by the ceremony of circumcision as a sacrament. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/17.10-11" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 17:10–11</a>.) And the token or sign of the great covenant with all Israel made at Sinai was the Sabbath.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p4" pid="zRCBSgdezU2Sy97pjD0Gaw" hash="oQ2oVg">Joshua is remembered as the one who, on the death of Moses, took command and completed the task of giving leadership to the tribes of Israel. Perhaps to comfort Joshua, who now had the responsibility for the children of Israel, who didn’t yet have a homeland, and perhaps to comfort that large body of people who had just lost their leader of more than forty years, the Lord spoke to Joshua and said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p5" pid="ajMYsYq6iku_mEck0zqHYw" hash="YF2qmA">“As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p12" pid="aqZqweOeG0ePaiganMpwqw" hash="SyIvyA">“Have not I commanded thee?

He would need the Lord’s help at every step. Here is a commitment of the Lord to provide that help. With faith in the Lord, Joshua could now go forward, knowing that the Lord would direct him in the way he should go. Joshua knew that his obedience would bring success, and although he did not know exactly how he would succeed, he now had confidence in the result.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p14" pid="NwcIp00rmkGzUgdCGHOZGw" hash="aD-Tlg">The record tells us that the tribes of Israel moved to the Jordan River and encamped for three days, preparing to cross at a point near the city of Jericho. At that time Joshua gave his people this interesting counsel. He said, “Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/3.5" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 3:5</a>.)</p>

Then the Lord said unto Joshua, “This day will begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 3:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p16" pid="u1x51GnwOUOMWe3EnnpiCQ" hash="ND7vSA">Joshua now knew that the miracles of the Lord would continue, just as when Moses had been the leader of Israel. And so it was that when the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people touched the water of the Jordan, it dried up, “and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 3:17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p17" pid="Lu0bazca8kqaK55y6_mC8A" hash="YaB3Xw">Soon after, when Joshua was directed to destroy the city of Jericho that lay before them, the great walls of the city stood as an imposing and physically impossible barrier to Israel’s success—or at least so it seemed. Not knowing the means, but assured as to the end, Joshua carried out the instructions he had been given by a messenger of the Lord. His commitment was to complete obedience. His concern was to do precisely as he was instructed, that the promise of the Lord would be fulfilled. The instructions no doubt seemed strange, but his faith in the outcome urged him on. The result, of course, was another in a long series of miracles experienced by the Israelites as they were led over many years by Moses, by Joshua, and by many other prophets who were committed to follow the commandments and the directives of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p18" pid="GSVJ54a8rEqC2jZur8ytOg" hash="9_W1NA">As Joshua and his people approached Jericho, the instructions of the Lord were followed precisely, and according to the scriptural account, “the waIl fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/6.20" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 6:20</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p19" pid="yamW_mWBnUqVaglAE8x0zA" hash="zwXw4Q">The record states that after Israel had rested from the wars with their enemies, Joshua, who was now very old, called all Israel together. In his farewell address he reminded them they had been victorious because God had fought for them, but if they now ceased to serve the Lord and keep his law they would be destroyed. He recalled how the Lord God of Israel had led Abraham throughout Canaan and had “multiplied his seed.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/24.3" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 24:3</a>.) He reminded them of how Jacob and his children had gone down into Egypt. He told of how the Lord had been with Moses and Aaron and had brought their fathers out of Egypt; how, in all of the battles and conquests, they had prevailed, adding this significant statement: “But not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/24.12" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 24:12</a>.) They had been led by the Lord to victory. The battles had not been won by swords and bows. He then admonished them: “Fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/24.14" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 24:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p20" pid="HCLUC_HZ4kuiWz72MP_1Mw" hash="W8uGVQ">This great military and spiritual leader then urged a commitment, and made one himself and for his family: “Choose you this day whom ye will serve; … “but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/24.15" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 24:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p21" pid="j964-mnQFUasILiWnoSeHQ" hash="6g3SCA">Here was a great statement of full commitment of a man to God; of a prophet to the desires of the Lord; of Joshua the man to his God, who had many times previously blessed his obedience. He was telling the Israelites that regardless of how they decided, he would do what he knew was right. He was saying that his decision to serve the Lord was independent of whatever they decided; that their actions would not affect his; that his commitment to do the Lord’s will would not be altered by anything they or anyone else would do. Joshua was firmly in control of his actions and had his eyes fixed on the commandments of the Lord. He was committed to obedience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/commitment-to-god.p22" pid="oHlqI79jsE6-g1i2wM-nmg" hash="RCPXBQ">Surely the Lord loves, more than anything else, an unwavering determination to obey his counsel. Surely the experiences of the great prophets of the Old Testament have been recorded to help us understand the importance of choosing the path of strict obedience. How pleased the Lord must have been when Abraham, after receiving direction to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, did as he was instructed, without question and without wavering. The record states that God said unto Abraham:</p>

The reply of Rachel was simple and straightforward and indicative of her commitment: “Whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/31.16" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 31:16</a>.)</p>

On this Sunday morning, when the complications and temptations of life are somewhat removed, and when we have the time and more of an inclination to take an eternal perspective, we can more clearly evaluate what will bring us the greatest happiness in life. We should decide now, in the light of the morning, how we will act when the darkness of night and when the storms of temptation arrive.</p>

It is not a new message. If you are a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints you have heard it many times. If you are not a member, you may have heard the words before, but perhaps today, because of additional evidence, you may be more impressed by its truthfulness and more inclined to make it a motivating belief.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/evidences-of-the-resurrection.p2" pid="hnPVwW2rV0GUxgumwgppWg" hash="Y9CB6Q">The message I speak of has been part of all the addresses you have heard previously today. It is simple and beautiful and magnificent. I may not present it in a perfect way, and there may be many who will not completely understand it. We may have difficulty responding to it in an appropriate manner, but the message itself has been referred to as the greatest, the most exciting, the most significant and important that we will ever hear. It has to do with the “good news”—the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/evidences-of-the-resurrection.p3" pid="FgvIMPLwrEqDCwbMjT6V-A" hash="hHs9mQ">Specifically, it is that Jesus of Nazareth, the same who was born of Mary in Bethlehem some two thousand years ago, is the Savior of all mankind. We know, and testify to the world, that he lived a truly perfect and exemplary life, that he suffered for our sins in the Garden of Gethsemane, that he gave his life for us by being crucified on a cross, and that he was resurrected after three days—as he said he would be. The final part of this good news is that he will return at some future time to gather in his own.</p>

I’m speaking of those events which followed the crucifixion of the Savior. The Gospel writers described the hurried burial of the Lord because of the onset of the Sabbath day; the early-morning discovery of the empty tomb by Mary and other faithful women; the announcement of the angel, “He is not here: for he is risen, as he said” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:6</a>); the message, delivered by Mary to Peter and John, that the body had been removed from the sepulcher; the realization on the part of Peter and John that the tomb truly was empty; and finally, the two brief conversations Mary had—first, with the two personages in white in the sepulcher, and second, with the one whom she thought was the caretaker of the garden, but soon realized when he spoke to her that he was in fact the Master himself.</p>

It is to these events that Christians look for support of the hope that there is life after death. In our modern world, where life is so different and so far removed from the events of that first Easter morning, many have a difficult time believing and identifying with these things. For those who are struggling, we have additional good news. There is a way to know of a surety, and there are many evidences that can help those seeking truth to know and understand. May I briefly share with you, first, some of the evidences, and then, second, a course of action that, if followed, can bring about a knowledge of the truthfulness of these things.</p>

These Saints have enjoyed the great blessings and comfort that can come from looking back, as parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents, over long and successful parenting efforts. Surely this is something each of us would like.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p2" pid="GHK-jGy5yEuOangOaXVFZQ" hash="l2hD9g">However, there are many in the Church and in the world who are living with feelings of guilt and unworthiness because some of their sons and daughters have wandered or strayed from the fold. My remarks today are directed primarily to those mothers and fathers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p3" pid="gwtnEUU62keBKlz5e9Y5fQ" hash="SPtd_w">At the outset we understand that conscientious parents try their best, yet nearly all have made mistakes. One does not launch into such a project as parenthood without soon realizing that there will be many errors along the way. Surely our Heavenly Father knows, when he entrusts his spirit children into the care of young and inexperienced parents, that there will be mistakes and errors in judgment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p4" pid="IPsvAlv-zECrkDy9tTI6sg" hash="PN7AKQ">For every set of parents there are many “first-time” experiences that help to build wisdom and understanding, but each such experience results from the plowing of new ground, with the possibility that errors might be made. With the arrival of the first child the parents must make decisions about how to teach and train, how to correct and discipline. Soon there is the first day at school and the first bicycle. Then follows the first date of the first teenager, the first problem with school grades, and possibly, the first request to stay out late or the first request to buy a car.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p5" pid="oHRFBMASpkqw60rsbRFJ6w" hash="z2pvww">It is a rare father or mother indeed who travels the difficult path of parenting without making errors along the way, especially at these first-time milestones when experience and understanding are somewhat lacking. Even after the parent has gained experience, the second-time and third-time occurrences of these milestones are sometimes not much easier to handle, nor do they come with much less chance of error.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p6" pid="gDKGNMp-IU-ZsaAFdWMXBg" hash="OWwT0g">What more challenging responsibility is there than working effectively with young people? There are numerous variables that determine the character and the personality of a child. It is probably true that parents are, in many or perhaps most cases, the greatest influence in shaping the life of a child, but sometimes there are other influences that also are very significant. No one knows the degree to which heredity influences lives, but certainly brothers and sisters, friends and teachers, neighbors and Scoutmasters have significant effects.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p7" pid="42dSAJ6v5UaAMS5CqjJK4Q" hash="9Q_Z3Q">We know, too, that the influences on a child are not restricted to heredity or to people; certainly, things in the physical surroundings will have their effect—such as the house and the playthings, the yard and the neighborhood. Playgrounds and basketballs, dresses and cars—or the lack of these—all have their influence on the child.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p8" pid="OAIma9Mh_0a8zvWcTmTecA" hash="55YKfQ">One must conclude that—with the multitude of influences and the innumerable decisions, each with so many alternatives to consider and evaluate—even though parents strive to choose wisely, an unwise choice will sometimes be made. It is almost impossible to always say and do the right thing at every point along the way. I think we would agree that as parents we have made mistakes which have had a negative effect on the attitude of the child or on his progress. On the other hand, parents usually do the right thing or make the right decision under the circumstances, yet boys and girls often have negative responses to right or correct decisions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p9" pid="7OdFhzSctEO3bwde02uFUg" hash="X-PFkA">If a parent has made what could be considered an error—or, on the other hand, has never made a mistake, but still the lamb has wandered from the fold—in either case there are several thoughts I would like to share with you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p10" pid="_-hYvZjuVk-G8s5pyEDLqg" hash="zf0Rcw">First, such a father or mother is not alone. Our first parents knew the pain and suffering of seeing some of their children reject the teachings of eternal life. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.27" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:27</a>.) Centuries later Jacob came to know of the jealousy and ill feelings of his older sons toward his beloved Joseph. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/37.1-8" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 37:1–8</a>.) The great prophet Alma, who had a son named Alma, prayed at length to the Lord regarding the rebellious attitude of his son and no doubt was overwhelmed with concern and worry about the dissension and the wickedness his son was causing among those who were within the Church. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.14" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 27:14</a>.) Our Father in Heaven has also lost many of his spirit children to the world; he knows the feelings of your heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p11" pid="pMatWBr0iEqTJ2BlAQz4VA" hash="oCA_CQ">Second, we should remember that errors of judgment are generally less serious than errors of intent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p12" pid="OxYMFkTpcE--sLq3sv93Iw" hash="t9Pl3g">Third, even if there was a mistake made with full knowledge and understanding, there is the principle of repentance for release and comfort. Rather than constantly dwelling on what we perceive as a mistake or a sin or a failure to the detriment of our progress in the gospel or our association with family and friends, it would be better for us to turn away from it. As with any mistake, we may repent by being sorrowful and by attempting to correct or rectify the consequences, to whatever extent possible. We should look forward with renewed faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p13" pid="lzH0FWqTbU-n19qX6mpOUQ" hash="_Kli4g">Fourth, don’t give up hope for a boy or a girl who has strayed. Many who have appeared to be completely lost have returned. We must be prayerful and, if possible, let our children know of our love and concern.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p14" pid="9QwAzg4UQUOZqJQCrqRgxw" hash="_Hfk0w">Fifth, remember that ours was not the only influence that contributed to the actions of our children, whether those actions were good or bad.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p15" pid="b5A5yrvjBECwGkZXI9EpwA" hash="lbNA9Q">Sixth, know that our Heavenly Father will recognize the love and the sacrifice, the worry and the concern, even though our great effort has been unsuccessful. Parents’ hearts are ofttimes broken, yet they must realize that the ultimate responsibility lies with the child after parents have taught correct principles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p16" pid="m-WB8uFn1kKVx1I_Iouq5A" hash="J8eWHQ">Seventh, whatever the sorrow, whatever the concern, whatever the pain and anguish, look for a way to turn it to beneficial use—perhaps in helping others to avoid the same problems, or perhaps by developing a greater insight into the feelings of others who are struggling in a similar way. Surely we will have a deeper understanding of the love of our Heavenly Father when, through prayer, we finally come to know that he understands and wants us to look forward.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p17" pid="cG286o8wmUaGuq31GbR3Pg" hash="W1OVgA">The eighth and final point of reminder is that everyone is different. Each of us is unique. Each child is unique. Just as each of us starts at a different point in the race of life, and just as each of us has different strengths and weaknesses and talents, so each child is blessed with his own special set of characteristics. We must not assume that the Lord will judge the success of one in precisely the same way as another. As parents we often assume that, if our child doesn’t become an overachiever in every way, we have failed. We should be careful in our judgments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p18" pid="3-PInKNMy0yPz5X8ZtlVJg" hash="X7Z7pw">Let us not misunderstand. The responsibilities of parenthood are of the greatest importance. The results of our efforts will have eternal consequences for us and the boys and girls we raise. Anyone who becomes a parent is under strict obligation to protect and love his children and assist them to return to their Heavenly Father. All parents should understand that the Lord will not hold guiltless those who neglect these responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/parents-concern-for-children.p19" pid="x6_MgvrZrEuMF_ixS4ymDQ" hash="WvsH5g">After the Exodus and while Israel was in the wilderness, Moses, in teaching his people, instructed them that the commandments of the Lord should be taught by parents to their children in the home. He said to them:</p>

There is nothing in all literature equal to the parables of Christ. His teachings were as impressive to his listeners then as they are today to those who read his words. They are so simple a child can understand, yet profound enough for the sage and philosopher. The similitudes he used were taken from pictures of human life and commonplace incidents that could be understood by every listener—the sower, the lost sheep, a woman baking bread, the fig tree, a good Samaritan, the prodigal son.</p>

Some of these are faith, repentance, baptism, development of talents, forgiveness, perseverance in doing good, being a profitable steward, charity, mercy, and obedience. These parables were usually given by him to add to the knowledge of persons already spiritually enlightened, particularly the disciples, although they were sometimes directed to other persons and audiences.</p>

Even though the subject matter was a Pharisee and a publican, it was not intended for Pharisees or publicans expressly, but for the benefit of the self-righteous who lack the virtues of humility and who use self-righteousness as a claim to exaltation. In this parable the Savior spoke few words, yet the lesson taught is clear. This is the whole story he told, as recorded by Luke:</p>

It is interesting that the Master selected a Pharisee and a publican as the actors in the story, representing the two religious extremes in Jewish society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-pharisee-and-the-publican.p11" pid="dCyieFP92USeJSnnHKFJ2A" hash="FrAwRw">The Pharisees were the largest and most influential of the three sects of Judaism at the time of Christ. The Pharisaic movement in the Jewish state rose from the ranks of the lay lawyers of the Greek period to become the leading religious and political party. The main characteristics of the Pharisees were their legalism and their legalistic inflexibility. They were known for their strict accuracy in the interpretation of the law and their scrupulous adherence to living the law in every minute detail. This caused them to be known as the strictest of Jewish sects in observing their tradition. They shunned the non-Pharisee as being unclean, thereby keeping themselves separated from those they considered to be the common people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-pharisee-and-the-publican.p12" pid="kXX0cNl3tEWz-MtdBkyDbg" hash="K-VLBQ">Paul was a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee, and he was educated by Gamaliel, a Pharisee. On three different occasions he declared himself to be a member of the sect. The first was at the time he was on trial, then in his plea before Agrippa, and later in writing to the Philippians. This training as a Pharisee made him an extremist in his devotion to the Jewish law, which answers the question as to why he was such a zealous persecutor of the Christians prior to his experience on Damascus Road.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-pharisee-and-the-publican.p13" pid="1E9WNAl5b0qLyIQg_AL6NA" hash="pZN5tw">Publicans were tax collectors and were looked down upon with contempt. Ordinary taxes, such as land taxes, were collected by the Roman officials; but toll taxes for transporting goods were usually collected by Jews under contract with the Romans. These collectors, or publicans, made a profit on the transactions. Their fellow countrymen had no higher regard for them than for thieves and robbers. The trade lent itself to graft and extortion, and the publicans had the reputation of having some of the tax money stick to their own fingers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-pharisee-and-the-publican.p14" pid="4r_-5dJ1mkeNsKNIRDxPIw" hash="G4rNRA">The Jews were smarting under Roman occupation and domination, and they considered the payment of taxes as a tribute to Caesar. Jews who made such collections for the Romans were regarded as traitors and as despicable for selling their services to a foreign conqueror. Publicans and members of their families were considered so contemptible that they were not allowed to hold public office or give testimony in a Jewish court. We remember that Matthew was a publican, a gatherer of taxes, until his calling to be a disciple, and, of course, he too was despised by the Jews, as were the others who followed that occupation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-pharisee-and-the-publican.p15" pid="eWOUItzsIEuf_9GHCgsaEQ" hash="CQ1J-w">To know the background of these two men who came from the opposite extremes of Jewish society helps us to understand this parable of the Pharisee and tax collector and why they prayed as they did in the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-pharisee-and-the-publican.p16" pid="V2MYWmyUIkyasriQtpOCvA" hash="IKtLgQ">After the two men entered the temple, the Pharisee stood by himself, apart from the tax collector, and thanked God that he was “not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers” who fail to live the commandments of the law, “or even as this publican,” he said. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/18.11" class="scriptureRef">Luke 18:11</a>.) Though he was in form thanking God, his self-centered thoughts were on his own self-righteousness. In justification he added: “I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/18.12" class="scriptureRef">Luke 18:12</a>.) His prayer was not one of thankfulness, but of boastfulness. The boastful spirit and pride of this Pharisee is not unlike that of Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, mentioned in the Talmud, who said: “If there were only thirty righteous persons in the world, I and my son should make two of them; but if there were but twenty, I and my son would be of the number; and if there but ten, I and my son would be of the number; and if there were but five, I and my son would be of the five; and if there were but two, I and my son would be those two; and if there were but one, myself should be that one.” (Bereshith Rabba, s. 35, vol. 34.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-pharisee-and-the-publican.p17" pid="glHIztEC4EyzdUwKQAcM9w" hash="OoSrcg">The tax collector standing afar off, feeling the weight of his iniquities pressing down upon him, and being conscious of his sins and unworthiness to stand before God, cast his eyes to the ground and “would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven” when he prayed. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/18.13" class="scriptureRef">Luke 18:13</a>.) In deep distress he beat upon his breast and pleaded, “God be merciful to me a sinner.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/18.13" class="scriptureRef">Luke 18:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-pharisee-and-the-publican.p18" pid="mqJrISGjxUakFpROSDnONA" hash="7FCCrA">Could there be greater contrast in the prayers of two men? The Pharisee stood apart because he believed he was better than other men, whom he considered as common. The publican stood apart also, but it was because he felt himself unworthy. The Pharisee thought of no one other than himself and regarded everyone else a sinner, whereas the publican thought of everyone else as righteous as compared with himself, a sinner. The Pharisee asked nothing of God, but relied upon his own self-righteousness. The publican appealed to God for mercy and forgiveness of his sins.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-pharisee-and-the-publican.p19" pid="6Ws1lJnBAU2-ge5e277Lcg" hash="B4_9Uw">Continuing the story, Jesus then said: “I tell you, this man,” referring to the publican, the despised tax collector, “went down to his house justified, rather than the other.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/18.14" class="scriptureRef">Luke 18:14</a>.) In other words, the Lord said he was absolved, forgiven, or vindicated.</p>

These are almost the same words spoken by him in the house of one of the chief Pharisees. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/14.11" class="scriptureRef">Luke 14:11</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-pharisee-and-the-publican.p22" pid="u6kjfFlWb0G5V_-URUWO8A" hash="BaeU9Q">Humility is an attribute of godliness possessed by true Saints. It is easy to understand why a proud man fails. He is content to rely upon himself only. This is evident in those who seek social position or who push others aside to gain position in fields of business, government, education, sports, or other endeavors. Our genuine concern should be for the success of others. The proud man shuts himself off from God, and when he does he no longer lives in the light. The Apostle Peter made this comment:</p>

It may be that one of them bears our name.</p>

It is a freshwater inland lake a little over twelve miles long and seven miles wide. The River Jordan flows through it, from north to south, on its journey toward the Dead Sea.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p" pid="wgVEjrvuQ0aje7wfPkp7mA" hash="vt0k4w">This was the lake Jesus knew as a child and as a young man, its western shores lying just twelve or fifteen miles from his boyhood home of Nazareth. It was to this lake and the neighboring Galilean hills that Jesus returned so often during those demanding years of his public ministry.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p" pid="EwGkN0YHrkao6tD2HamlFw" hash="ef0sQg">On one journey to Galilee, the Savior taught the multitudes crowded near the water’s edge. With the people pressing ever closer, Jesus sought a better teaching circumstance by stepping into a boat and pushing out a few yards into the sea. There, a short distance from the eager crowd, he could be seen and heard by those straining for sight and words of the Master.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p" pid="gqmjSNIaaECVAjrbmjKvlw" hash="o5NiRA">Following his discourse, the Savior invited his disciples to join him, and they set out together for the other side of the lake. The Sea of Galilee is quite low, about 680 feet below sea level, and the heat becomes quite great. The hills surrounding the water rise up very sharply and to considerable height. The cold air rushing down from the hills meets the warm air rising from the lake in such a way that sudden and temporarily violent storms can occur on the surface of that inland sea. It was just such a storm as this that Jesus and his disciples found as they crossed the lake at evening time. This is the way Mark described it:</p>

A few of them, though temporary like these on the Sea of Galilee, can be violent and frightening and potentially destructive.

This great Jehovah, in whom we say we trust and whose name we have taken upon us, is he who said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.6" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:6</a>.) And he is also the one who said, “Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.9" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:9</a>.) Furthermore, it was he who parted the Red Sea, allowing the Israelites to pass through on dry ground. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/14.21-22" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 14:21–22</a>.) Certainly it should be no surprise that he could command a few elements acting up on the Sea of Galilee. And our faith should remind us that he can calm the troubled waters of our lives.</p>

Her beloved and only brother suffered from the same respiratory disease that had taken their parents’ lives, and he left their home in Chicago to find a warmer climate in the southern part of the United States.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/master-the-tempest-is-raging.p" pid="PMsNn3PA0kuUcz1R3W2V2A" hash="4pLCJg">For a time he seemed to be improving, but then a sudden turn in his health came and he died almost immediately. Mary Ann and her sister were heartbroken. It only added to their deep grief that neither their own health nor their personal finances allowed them to claim their brother’s body or to finance its return to Chicago for burial.</p>

On the Sea of Galilee, the stirring of the disciples’ faith was ultimately more important than the stilling of the sea, and so it was with her.</p>

It is the oldest of the Jewish festivals, celebrating an event in advance of receiving the traditional Mosaic Law. It reminds every generation of the return of the children of Israel to the promised land and of the great travail in Egypt which preceded it. It commemorates the passage of a people from subjection and bondage to freedom and deliverance. It is the Old Testament festival of springtime when the world of nature awakens to life, growth, and fruition.</p>

The Passover in the Old Testament and Easter in the New Testament testify of the great gift God has given and of the sacrifice that was involved in its bestowal. Both of these great religious commemorations declare that death would “pass over” us and could have no permanent power upon us, and that the grave would have no victory.</p>

Luke’s account tells us that Jesus remained behind in the temple after his parents had departed for home. They returned with fear and anxiety to find him among the doctors of the law “both hearing them, and asking them questions.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.46" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:46</a>.) Luke records that all who “heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.47" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:47</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/christ-our-passover.p16" pid="EVQFiUloKEi_byAfhmK-wg" hash="M4b27g">Could it have been possible that Jesus was teaching these older and formally trained men about the meaning of the Passover just celebrated? Would it have surprised them that one so young and seemingly inexperienced would have known so much about the meaning of that fateful night in Egypt so long ago and so far away? Would they have been amazed at his knowledge of the lamb and the blood and the firstborn and the sacrifice? The scriptures are silent on such questions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/christ-our-passover.p17" pid="7FSZKtEtCEe5MvMW0zXkTQ" hash="s1ycJw">As the Gospel of John makes clear, the feast of the Passover marked significant milestones during the mortal ministry of Christ. At the first Passover in his ministry, Jesus made his mission known by purifying the temple when he drove from its portals the money changers and those who sold animals. In the second Passover Jesus manifested his power by the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Christ here introduced the symbols that would later have even greater meaning in the Upper Room. “I am the bread of life,” he said. “He that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.35" class="scriptureRef">John 6:35</a>.)</p>

By that final week of his mortal ministry, Jesus knew clearly what this particular Passover would mean to him. Trouble was already in the air. Matthew records:</p>

Jesus sat down with his disciples and, after the eating of the sacrificial lamb and of the bread and wine of this ancient feast, he taught them a newer and holier meaning of that ancient blessing from God.</p>

With the suffering of Gethsemane, the sacrifice of Calvary, and the resurrection from a garden tomb, Jesus fulfilled the ancient law and ushered in a new dispensation based on a higher, holier understanding of the law of sacrifice. No more would men be required to offer the firstborn lamb from their flock, because the Firstborn of God had come to offer himself as an “infinite and eternal sacrifice.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p1" pid="5pXQhPue8U-5nGYPf3gUfw" hash="051_qA">If it were not for general conference, we would be attending fast day services in our own wards today because it is the first Sunday of the month. Not only would we be attending the service, but we would be fasting in compliance with the established practice of members of the Church. In this respect, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is unique, although the principle of fasting has been observed down through ecclesiastical history.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p2" pid="n9SH0S9moE6JfNtcrI7Zcg" hash="ZUmTNQ">It seems to be impossible to determine, from the records that are available to us, the circumstances under which fasting originated in ancient times, or what its purpose was in the beginning. Nevertheless, we find reference to it as having been practiced in the earliest of times as an expression of grief or emotion. It was associated with serious and heartfelt sorrow for sin, with times of mourning, and with occasions of strong emotion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p3" pid="fZJ0zZ9lJUmLO4NUc_sqYA" hash="ObCiLw">The early Israelites practiced fasting, although there are very few references to it. Usually such references as are made are associated with some particular occasion or in connection with attempts to receive communications from God, as was the case of the fasting of Moses and Elijah. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/34.28" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 34:28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.8" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 19:8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p4" pid="r59u9gbtHkO2QCR93gYMtA" hash="XUuKGw">Prior to the period of the exile, there are few records of fasting by the people of Israel as a whole, except those fasts held for the needs of special occasions such as the deaths of Saul and Jonathan. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/31.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 31:13</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/2-sam/1.12" class="scriptureRef">2 Sam. 1:12</a>.) There were other public fasts to seek divine assistance before wars or battles. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/judg/20.26" class="scriptureRef">Judg. 20:26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/2-sam/14.24" class="scriptureRef">2 Sam. 14:24</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/2-chr/20.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Chr. 20:3</a>.) It can be presumed that Moses fasted because he mentioned fasting, without advocating any particular fast in his writings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p5" pid="Ct8DWJLob0SHy7_PQHLVQg" hash="sc5BdA">After the period of the exile, however, both public and private fasts began to be observed, sometimes accompanied by weeping and wearing sackcloth and ashes. The most prominent fast was the annual Day of Atonement. It also became a custom of the pious in Judaism to fast on two days of the week—the second and fifth days, which were the days Moses went up and came down from Mount Sinai.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p6" pid="tTYaFULyN0OVzIF-8l7Ylw" hash="gqbq6w">Approaching the Christian era, we find a great devotion to fasting among the extreme groups of the Jews, particularly the Pharisees; but Jesus did not instruct his disciples by setting down any specific requirements regarding the nature or frequency of fasting. In his Sermon on the Mount, however, he said: “When ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.16" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:16</a>.) This would indicate that there should be sincerity when fasting was observed. He himself had fasted forty days and forty nights. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p7" pid="hcjRc9pWcE6OQpdzv74vcQ" hash="gsV73w">Many of the things established by the early Church during the time of Christ were changed and corrupted after the death of the last of the Apostles. Fasting and prayer had been matters of voluntary observance, but eventually they became subject to ecclesiastical rules and regulations which all communicants were expected to follow and observe under pain of excommunication for the disobedient.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p8" pid="cE-qIuNXdEScvmMNzLcJdQ" hash="e81XOA">When the early colonists settled the eastern seaboard of this country, they did not follow the customary fasts of the churches from which they had departed. They established their own fast days, many of which have been perpetuated to the present time. Some of these fast days were supported by legislative bodies or public officials.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p9" pid="5tTN6bB2ZUW9ZMfI5GbVCw" hash="FM0qjw">Many of the early members of this Church were from New England or had a background of the religious culture of the colonists, and fasting was part of their religious beliefs. Because of this background, it may be that many of them felt the need of close communion with their Heavenly Father. They followed the teaching of the Lord by fasting in secret (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.17-18" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:17–18</a>), but no mention is made of this principle in the early history of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p10" pid="C6sav71kJ0mIghXgNYL6KQ" hash="3JOLgg">Modern revelation as contained in the Doctrine and Covenants makes little mention of fasting and gives no specific instructions regarding it. A year and a half after the Church was organized, the Prophet Joseph Smith received a revelation which mentions observance of the Lord’s day and incidentally refers to fasting, without additional comment. This is the portion of the revelation that makes mention of it:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p11" pid="n9mm5GdMNUmMTG5sM704Cg" hash="bYlaRA">“And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy may be full.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p12" pid="AaiArTuYtUSdyQV6b3Mj7w" hash="rK_ijg">“Verily, this is fasting and prayer, or in other words, rejoicing and prayer.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.13-14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:13–14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p13" pid="Ib1mmloTREOtIjdMU2ubXg" hash="XWHEUA">This is an echo from Old Testament times, and the principle of fasting in the spirit of prayer is confirmed in this dispensation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p14" pid="4n0Xnt0GGE-6uRpE-o825w" hash="UEl19g">The following year came a more explicit revelation on the subject from the Lord in which he said, “Also, I give unto you a commandment that ye shall continue in prayer and fasting from this time forth.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.76" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:76</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p15" pid="bLXvQ53sREyqLbpGUD-nzA" hash="4pJffw">Prior to this time there had been no observance of a fast in the Church on any regular basis. The wording of this revelation that “ye shall continue in prayer and fasting from this time forth” would seem to suggest the institution of fast meetings, but apparently there were none until the building of the Kirtland Temple in 1836.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p16" pid="yejBvxmsoUWp10e7aKtCQA" hash="3O0hUA">The only other mention of fasting in modern revelation is in reference to the building of the Kirtland Temple and in the prayer of dedication, in which the temple is referred to as “a house of prayer, a house of fasting.” (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.119" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:119</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/95.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 95:7</a>, 16; and <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.8,16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 109:8, 16</a>.) There is frequent mention in the Book of Mormon of fasting, but these are ancient writings, as are those in the Bible. The scriptures of this dispensation give us little information.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p17" pid="WMY1hRhEVUyJANrXJre34A" hash="aUPOmw">We do not know when fasting was adopted in the Church as a regular observance, but there are records that indicate that some fast meetings were held in the Kirtland Temple on the first Thursday of each month in the year 1836. There is no indication that these fasts were associated with donations to the poor, except a remark made by Brigham Young more than thirty years later in the Old Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. He had this to say:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p18" pid="qGxr0MIHK0K_M28B1kMLPA" hash="lcvRWQ">“You know that the first Thursday in each month we hold as a fast day. How many here know the origin of this day? Before tithing was paid, the poor were supported by donations. They came to Joseph and wanted help, in Kirtland, and he said there should be a fast day, which was decided upon. It was to be held once a month, as it is now, and all that would have been eaten that day, of flour, or meat, or butter, or fruit, or anything else, was to be carried to the fast meeting and put into the hands of a person selected for the purpose of taking care of it and distributing it among the poor” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 12:115.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p19" pid="gHFPSBnxok2ahAVQBJeDPw" hash="TMGP4Q">Although Brigham Young indicated that this was the decision that was made, there is no record that it was ever observed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p20" pid="QsvWix8OLU6rn8tPWgb3pg" hash="XqrwAA">There were occasional fasts held in Nauvoo with some special objective in view, but no fasts on a regular basis. It was not until 1845 that a fast was held in Nauvoo to provide for the poor. In the <span class="emphasis">History of the Church</span> we find this notation made by Brigham Young:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p21" pid="SwJ4aI2b90SvxnpdreMKUg" hash="kHtEPw">“Thursday, 15 … <span class="emphasis">Fast Day:</span> all works were stopped. Meetings were held in the several wards and donations made to the bishops for the poor; enough was contributed to supply the wants of the poor until harvest.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 7:411.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p22" pid="knOVgITdZ0Or_iNXzB9dCQ" hash="V-K8PQ">Special fast days for various purposes were held during the exodus from Nauvoo, and after the Saints arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, some fasts were held on the first Thursday of the month. It cannot be determined with any certainty when fast days became established on a regular basis, but during the difficult years of 1855 and 1856, because of prolonged drought and famine, the exceptionally hard winter, and the plague of grasshoppers, many of the Saints were in desperate circumstances. This is what Brigham H. Roberts wrote of it:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p23" pid="C6NeOqkvNE2nmNJyRkKxNw" hash="3FtNNQ">“To meet the very great demands of charity upon Latter-day Saints in those trying years, our fast day came into existence; the servants of the Lord instituted the first Thursday in every month as fast day, with a view of taking what was saved by this sacrifice and minister unto those who otherwise would be in want. This plan of meeting that emergency became an established institution.” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1913, p. 120.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p24" pid="E7Vjtrb6sEaiICmU_U92Gw" hash="68_cOw">Prior to this time the poor had been sustained by donations, but now the care of the poor became associated with fast day and what was donated became known as fast offerings, which were brought to the monthly fast meetings. From this early period when the Saints came to the valleys of the mountains to 1896, a regular fast day was held on the first Thursday of each month, and offerings were brought and given largely in kind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p25" pid="W02JKnrEWU60tL7cVGesHQ" hash="xw7vAA">In the early days when the membership of the Church was small, the holding of fast day on Thursday was not a problem, but as time went on it caused employees to take time from their work to attend fast meeting, merchants had to close their businesses, and many other difficulties resulted from weekday observance. A decision was made by the First Presidency and the Twelve that the monthly fast meeting should be held on the first Sunday of each month. The first Sunday of December, 1896, was the date set for the change. From that time to the present—nearly a century—the fast day has been observed, in most instances, on the first Sunday of the month as a religious practice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p26" pid="ZKXd2s-W3UCDoNTOVR-ipA" hash="HQl2ww">Members of the Church may fast at any time as they have a need, but the fast contemplated on the day referred to as fast day, as defined by President Joseph F. Smith, “is that food and drink are not to be partaken of for twenty-four hours, ‘from even to even.’” From even to even has been given the meaning of going without two meals—from the evening meal on the night before to evening meal on fast day. President Smith went on to say:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/fast-day.p27" pid="spnwAycC80GsfuTlHXalVA" hash="RR0O2Q">“In addition, the leading and [principal] object of the institution of the fast among the Latter-day Saints, was that the poor might be provided with food and other necessities. It is, therefore, incumbent upon every Latter-day Saint to give to his bishop, on fast day, the food that he or his family would consume for the day, that it may be given to the poor for their benefit and blessing; or, in lieu of the food, that its equivalent amount, or, if the person be wealthy a liberal donation, in money be so reserved and dedicated to the poor.” (<span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> Dec. 1902, p. 148.)</p>

After years of exercising military pomp and prowess and after extending his kingdom from Macedonia to Egypt and from Cyprus to India, he wept when there seemed to be no more world to conquer. Then, as evidence of just how ephemeral such power is, Alexander caught a fever and died at thirty-three years of age. The vast kingdom he had gained virtually died with him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/an-apostles-witness-of-the-resurrection.p2" pid="8tyE20IY5kCqiKTJKzcrTg" hash="-k6uGA">Quite a different young leader also died at what seems such an untimely age of thirty-three. He likewise was a king, a pupil, and a conqueror. Yet he received no honors from man, achieved no territorial conquests, rose to no political station. So far as we know, he never held a sword nor wore even a single piece of armor. But the Kingdom he established still flourishes some two thousand years later. His power was not of this world.</p>

But the greatest difference is in their ultimate victories. Alexander conquered lands, peoples, principalities, and earthly kingdoms. But he who is called the Perfect Leader, he who was and is the Light and Life of the world—Jesus Christ the Son of God—conquered what neither Alexander nor any other could defeat or overcome: Jesus of Nazareth conquered death. Against the medals and monuments of centuries of men’s fleeting victories stands the only monument necessary to mark the eternal triumph—an empty garden tomb.</p>

In our great general conference of the Church, we lengthen the Easter season today to remember him and honor this pivotal event in the lives of all mankind. As Easter in the Northern Hemisphere ushers in an awakening of life following the barrenness of winter, so Christ’s resurrection ushers in the blessing of immortality and the possibility of eternal life. His empty tomb proclaims to all the world, “He is not here, but is risen.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.6" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:6</a>.) These words contain all the hope, assurance, and belief necessary to sustain us in our challenging and sometimes grief-filled lives.</p>

Though all will die as part of the eternal plan of growth and development, nevertheless we can all find comfort in the Psalmist’s statement, “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/30.5" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 30:5</a>.)</p>

Christ’s answer rings down through time to this very hour: “Because I live, ye shall live also.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.19" class="scriptureRef">John 14:19</a>.)</p>

No, the ultimate triumph is in the ultimate miracle: for the first time in the history of mankind, one who was dead raised himself into living immortality. He <span class="emphasis">was</span> the Son of God, the Son of our immortal Father in Heaven, and his triumph over physical and spiritual death is the good news every Christian tongue should speak.</p>

The first accounts which reached their ears ‘seemed to them as idle tales’ (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.11" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:11</a>) as well they might, for millions of men had lived and died before that day.

And if an ox, how much more should one be willing to help a brother in need. But as Elder James E. Talmage wrote, “Excuses [not to do so] are easy to find; they spring up as readily and plentifully as weeds by the wayside” (<span class="emphasis">Jesus the Christ,</span> 3d ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916, p. 431).</p>

He had compassion; he went to the man who had been injured by the thieves and bound up his wounds. He took him to an inn, cared for him, paid his expenses, and offered more if needed for his care. This is a story of the love of a neighbor for his neighbor.</p>

The key is to love our neighbor, including the neighbor that is difficult to love. We need to remember that though we make our friends, God has made our neighbors—everywhere. Love should have no boundary; we should have no narrow loyalties. Christ said, “For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.46" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:46</a>).</p>

To be justified before God we must love one another: we must overcome evil; we must visit the fatherless and the widow in their affliction, and we must keep ourselves unspotted from the world: for such virtues flow from the great fountain of pure religion. Strengthening our faith by adding every good quality that adorns the children of the blessed Jesus, we can pray in the season of prayer; we can love our neighbor as ourselves, and be faithful in tribulation, knowing that the reward of such is greater in the kingdom of heaven. What a consolation! What a joy! Let me live the life of the righteous, and let my reward be like this!” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 2:229).</p>

Surely they were in the heart of Elder Willard Richards. While in Carthage Jail on the afternoon of the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum, the jailer suggested that they would be safer in the cells. Joseph turned to Elder Richards and asked, “If we go into the cell will you go with us?”</p>

But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for ‘treason,’ I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free.”</p>

It is a battle being fought for the souls of men. Its outcome likewise depends on the steadiness of the soldiery. The clarion call of the chieftain is heard above the fierce artillery of the archenemy, “Stand firm! Be true!”</p>

Like Helaman’s stripling warriors, “they stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has made them free; and they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their faith is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/58.40" class="scriptureRef">Alma 58:40</a>). I am referring to those members of the Church who live their Christian beliefs in the quiet commonplace of their daily lives.</p>

This should raise a question in our minds of eternal significance: We know that this is the true and living church institutionally, but am I a true and living member individually?</p>

When I ask, “Am I a true and living member?” my question is, am I deeply and fully dedicated to keeping the covenants I have made with the Lord? Am I totally committed to live the gospel and be a doer of the word and not a hearer only? Do I live my religion? Will I remain true? Do I stand firm against Satan’s temptations? He is seeking to cause us to lose our way in a storm of derision and a tide of sophistry. We can have victory, however, by responding to that inner voice calling “stand firm!”</p>

It means that we now and always will love God and our neighbors as ourselves. It means our actions will reflect who we are and what we believe. It means that we are every day Christians, walking as Christ would have us walk.</p>

We especially welcome those of you throughout the world who have recently taken upon yourselves these covenants. We express our love for you and want you to know of our concern for you and all members everywhere. We welcome you into the brotherhood and sisterhood of the Latter-day Saints. The word <span class="emphasis">saint</span> does not mean that any of us is perfect. What it does mean is that we are all trying, all serving, and all vowing to stand firm in the faith.</p>

That keeps him on a true course. If, however, he happens to look back to see where he has been, his chances of straying are increased. The results are crooked and irregular furrows. We invite those of you who are new members to fix your attention on your new goal and never look back on your earlier problems or transgressions except as a reminder of your growth and your worth and your blessings from God. If our energies are focused not behind us but ahead of us—on eternal life and the joy of salvation—we assuredly will obtain it.</p>

They constantly seek its direction. They pray for strength and overcome difficulties. Their hearts are not set upon the things of this world but upon the infinite. Spiritual renewal is not sacrificed for physical gratification.</p>

There is a tendency for man to put himself in the center of the universe and expect others to conform to his wants and needs and desires. Yet nature does not honor that erroneous assumption. The central role in life belongs to God. Instead of asking him to do our bidding, we should seek to bring ourselves in harmony with his will, and thus continue our progress as a living member.</p>

In order to love him we need to do the things he has asked us to do. We need to show that we are willing to become like him.</p>

They are anxious to share their joy with others, and they never lose this desire. Patrick Henry said at the closing scene of his life: “I have now disposed of all my property to my family. … There is one thing more I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion. … If they had that, and I had not given them one shilling, they would have been rich, and if they had not that, and I had given them all the world, they would be poor” (as quoted in Tryon Edwards, comp., <span class="emphasis">The New Dictionary of Thoughts,</span> Garden City, New York: Standard Book Co., 1961, p. 561).</p>

These Saints are anxiously engaged in bringing to pass many good and noble works of their own free will and accord. President Heber J. Grant once observed that “the power is in us wherein we are agents unto ourselves, and that we should not wait to be commanded in all things, and he that is compelled in all things is a slothful and not a wise servant. We should have the ambition, we should have the desire, we should make up our minds that, so far as the Lord Almighty has given to us talent, we will do our full share in the battle of life. It should be a matter of pride that no man shall do more than you will do, in proportion to your ability, in forwarding the work of God here upon the earth” (<span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> Oct. 1939, p. 585).</p>

Young David, in response to Goliath’s challenge, courageously spoke to the men near him, “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17.26" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 17:26</a>). Jeremiah likewise referred to the Lord as the true and living God (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/10.10" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 10:10</a>).</p>

We have all had those experiences from time to time, and I suppose we always will.</p>

But it was he who, from this very pulpit a few years ago, said that all men and women, including the most faithful and loyal, would find adversity and affliction in their lives because, in the words of Joseph Smith, “Men have to suffer that they may come upon Mount Zion and be exalted above the heavens” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:556; see Conference Report, Oct. 1969, p. 57).</p>

Obviously, prophets of an earlier day have known adversity and difficulty as well. They were not spared these challenges any more than our generation has been spared. The great Book of Mormon patriarch, Lehi, spoke encouragingly to his son Jacob, a son born in the wilderness in a time of travail and opposition. Jacob’s life was not as he might have expected it to be and not as the ideal course of experience might have outlined. He had suffered afflictions and setbacks, but Lehi promised that such afflictions would be consecrated for his son’s gain (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.2" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:2</a>).</p>

From out of the dark, damp confinement of Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph Smith learned that if we are called to pass through tribulation, it is for our growth and experience and will ultimately be counted for our good (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.5-8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:5–8</a>).</p>

We all have moments when we are overwhelmed by circumstances or confused by the counsel we get from others, and we feel a great need to receive spiritual guidance, a great need to find the right path and do the right thing. In the scriptural preface to this latter-day dispensation, the Lord promised that if we would be humble in such times of need and turn to him for aid, we would “be made strong, and [be] blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:28</a>.) That help is ours if we will but seek it, trust in it, and follow what King Benjamin, in the Book of Mormon, called “the enticings of the Holy Spirit.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p2" pid="17lXQJlmtkqiRDSixCA2vw" hash="QP5kFQ">Perhaps no promise in life is more reassuring than that promise of divine assistance and spiritual guidance in times of need. It is a gift freely given from heaven, a gift that we need from our earliest youth through the very latest days of our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p3" pid="xkh0T5JSvUeGmzfQvJSViA" hash="0ZZkpw">Allow me to use three examples this morning of such spiritual experiences, examples that recall the anxious moments of the very young as well as the possibility of continued spiritual growth for those who are not so young.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p4" pid="Fvq2KXc2jE2hCNHSm8Sobw" hash="HHah-g">My first example is the well-known and dearly loved account of the boy-prophet Joseph Smith as he sought to know the mind and will of the Lord at a time of confusion and concern in his life. As every Latter-day Saint knows, the area near Palmyra, New York, had become a place of “unusual excitement on the subject of religion” during young Joseph’s boyhood years there. Indeed, the entire district appeared to him to be affected by it, with “great multitudes,” he wrote, uniting themselves to the different religious parties and causing “no small stir and division” among the people. (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.5" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:5</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p5" pid="SwuBXCUZikGHiO2FL2SV8g" hash="_JLYiA">For a boy who had barely turned fourteen, his search for the truth was made even more difficult and confusing because members of the Smith family differed in their religious preferences at the time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p6" pid="UY1VRlyJT0qvT8VQtVnBuw" hash="420-dw">Now, with that familiar background and setting, I invite you to consider these rather remarkable thoughts and feelings from a boy of such a tender age. He wrote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p7" pid="PFz6X5Oa9U-a6U5Sw8JzKg" hash="3VddIg">“During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these [factions] … ; so great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p8" pid="7f1-a1IDH0qXcCsIRdFK0g" hash="-2g44w">“My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. …</p>

Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p10" pid="TmtWnYBhn0qr6UdHAp0wyA" hash="P2dFcA">“While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: <span class="emphasis">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p11" pid="1hlF0uzmpkKzdNdVlgNkNA" hash="_xvVmg">“Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.8-12" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:8–12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p12" pid="YtpJ9o-UkEKbb0XJzLog6Q" hash="liHJQQ">Of course, what happened next changed the course of human history. Determining to “ask of God,” young Joseph retired to a grove near his rural home. There, in answer to his fervent prayer, God, the Eternal Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, visited Joseph and counseled him. That great manifestation, of which I humbly testify, answered many more questions for our dispensation than simply which church young Joseph should or should not join.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p14" pid="cB9b2pSCQ0S7LkNlfjaOGw" hash="KEx4Xw">How many of us, at fourteen or any age, could keep our heads steady and our wits calm with so many forces tugging and pulling on us, especially on such an important subject as our eternal salvation? How many of us could withstand the emotional conflict that might come when parents differ in their religious persuasions? How many of us, at fourteen or fifty, would search within our souls and search within holy writ to find answers to what the Apostle Paul called “the deep things of God”? (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:10</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p15" pid="mmg8QxbPyku4JdD_1Bd6RQ" hash="z_nSkQ">How remarkable—at least it may seem remarkable to us in our day—that this lad would turn profoundly to the scriptures and then to private prayer, perhaps the two greatest sources of spiritual insight and spiritual impression that are available universally to mankind. Certainly he was torn by differing opinions, but he was determined to do the right thing and determined to find the right way. He believed, as you and I must believe, that he could be taught and blessed from on high, as he was.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p16" pid="aWk7yHmLy0-Yxp_lCMbwqA" hash="07ezPw">But, we may say, Joseph Smith was a very special spirit, and his was a special case. What about the rest of us who may now be older—at least older than fourteen—and have not been destined to open a dispensation of the gospel? We also must make decisions and sort out confusion and cut through a war of words in a whole host of subjects that affect our lives. The world is full of such difficult decisions, and sometimes as we face them, we may feel our age or our infirmities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/blessed-from-on-high.p17" pid="sze9HqauZUGXKWX_nteGXQ" hash="D5vzZg">Sometimes we may feel that our spiritual edge has grown dull. On some very trying days, we may even feel that God has forgotten us, has left us alone in our confusion and concern. But that feeling is no more justified for the older ones among us than it is for the younger and less experienced. God knows and loves us all. We are, every one of us, his daughters and his sons, and whatever life’s lessons may have brought us, the promise is still true: “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a>.)</p>

Joseph Smith’s view of what to do was certainly a dim one until he found the illumination of the scriptures and the searchlight of prayer.</p>

Like Mrs. Howell’s reference to Milton, the blind poet, “on bended knee” we can all recognize God’s “purpose clearly shown” if we will rely on spiritual resources, letting our age and experience—yes, and even our infirmities—turn us yet closer to God.</p>

Of course, developing spirituality and attuning ourselves to the highest influences of godliness is not an easy matter. It takes time and frequently involves a struggle.</p>

There may be a few wintry days left, but the sun has begun its vernal return, the buds are appearing on the flowers and trees, and luxuriant greenery is sprouting to the surface.</p>

With you, I welcome this season of the year which reminds us that God is a God of miracles, that his Only Begotten Son is “the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in [him], though he were dead, yet shall he live.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/11.25" class="scriptureRef">John 11:25</a>.)</p>

I testify that after every winter’s season there is the miracle of springtime ahead—in our personal journey through life as well as in nature. These restorations and renewals are a gift from the Lord Jesus Christ, the ultimate “man for all seasons.” I wish to speak briefly of some of those divine moments in our lives when the Savior reaches out to redeem and make whole and strengthen us.</p>

In the scriptures these divine acts and special blessings are variously referred to as miracles or signs or wonders or marvels.</p>

But startling and wonder-filled as they were, Christ’s many miracles were only reflections of those greater marvels which his Father had performed before him and continues to perform all around us. Indeed, the Savior’s humble performance of such obviously divine acts may be just one very special application of the declarations he made:</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/2.1-11" class="scriptureRef">John 2:1–11</a>.) But poor, indeed, was the making of the wine in the pots of stone, compared with its original making in the beauty of the vine and the abundance of the swelling grapes. No one could explain the onetime miracle at the wedding feast, but then neither could they explain the everyday miracle of the splendor of the vineyard itself.</p>

But surely that great blessing is no more startling than the wondrous combination of bones and skin and nerves that lets our ears receive the beautiful world of sound. Should we not stand in awe of the blessing of hearing and give glory to God for that miracle, even as we do when hearing is restored after it has been lost?</p>

The original creations of the Father constitute a truly wonder-filled world. Are not the <span class="emphasis">greatest</span> miracles the fact that we have life and limb and sight and speech in the first place? Yes, there will always be plenty of miracles if we have eyes to see and ears to hear.</p>

Once we start to recognize the many miraculous and blessed manifestations of God and Christ in our lives—the everyday variety as well as restored sight to the blind and restored hearing to the deaf—we may be truly bewildered at the unexplainable principles and processes that bring about such wonders.</p>

Talmage, who, as both a scientist and an Apostle of the Lord, had uniquely strong qualifications for examining such phenomena. (See <span class="emphasis">Jesus the Christ,</span> 3d ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916, p. 149.) Science and the unaided human mind, he said, have not advanced far enough to analyze and explain these wonders. But, he cautioned, to deny the reality of miracles on the ground that the results and manifestations <span class="emphasis">must</span> be fictitious simply because we cannot comprehend the means by which they have happened is arrogant on the face of it. (Ibid.) Indeed, those who have been the beneficiaries of such miracles are the most compelling witnesses of all. It is hard to argue with results.</p>

When we are personal witnesses to these wonders which God performs, it should increase our respect and love for him; it should improve the way we behave. We will live better and love more if we will remember that. We are miracles in our own right, every one of us, and the resurrected Son of God is the greatest miracle of all.

However, I am aware that by means of modern television technology and the courtesy of a number of television stations, I am privileged also to speak to many who are not members of our church and who may not be familiar with all of its doctrines and beliefs.</p>

It is our freedom, our agency, our inalienable and divine right to choose what we will believe and what we will not believe, and to choose what we want to be and what we want to do. I wish to speak of our responsibility and our opportunity to choose God, and the good, and eternal life; or to select evil, the destructive, and that which leads to painful misery and despair.</p>

To some that will be a new thought, but the Bible teaches clearly just such an eternal view of life, a life stretching back before this world was and stretching forward into the eternities ahead.</p>

At another time God reminded Job that “all the sons of God shouted for joy” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/38.7" class="scriptureRef">Job 38:7</a>) before there was yet any man or woman on the earth God was creating.

Well, it happened long before man’s mortal birth. It happened in a great premortal existence where we developed our identities and increased our spiritual capabilities by exercising our agency and making important choices. We developed our intelligence and learned to love the truth, and we prepared to come to earth to continue our progress.</p>

He also wanted us to exercise our faith and our will, especially with a new physical body to master and control. But we know from both ancient and modern revelation that Satan wished to deny us our independence and agency in that now-forgotten moment long ago, even as he wishes to deny them this very hour. Indeed, Satan violently opposed the freedom of choice offered by the Father, so violently that John in the Revelation described “war in heaven” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/12.7" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 12:7</a>) over the matter. Satan would have coerced us, and he would have robbed us of that most precious of gifts if he could: our freedom to choose a divine future and the exaltation we all hope to obtain.</p>

In that crucial, premortal setting, a major milestone was passed, a monumental victory was won. As a result, we would be allowed to continue to pursue what President David O. McKay once described as the “eternal principle of progress.” Later Christ himself would come to earth, President McKay noted, “to perfect society by perfecting the individual, and only by the exercising of Free Agency can the individual even approach perfection.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1940, p. 118.)</p>

With Christ’s triumph in heaven in overcoming Lucifer, and later his triumph on earth in overcoming the effects of Adam’s fall and the death of all mankind, “the children of men” continue “free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not be acted upon. …</p>

He acts by gentle solicitation and by sweet enticement. He always acts with unfailing respect for the freedom and independence that we possess. He wants to help us and pleads for the chance to assist us, but he will not do so in violation of our agency. He loves us too much to do that, and doing so would run counter to his divine character.</p>

He will, however, stand by us forever to help us see the right path, find the right choice, respond to the true voice, and feel the influence of his undeniable Spirit. His gentle, peaceful, powerful persuasion to do right and find joy will be with us “so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.36" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:36</a>.)</p>

And sometimes we do just that, but that is where the mission and mercy of Jesus Christ comes into full force and glory. He has taken upon himself the burden of all the world’s risk. He has provided a mediating atonement for the wrong choices we make. He is our advocate with the Father and has paid, in advance, for the faults and foolishness we often see in the exercise of our freedom. We must accept his gift, repent of those mistakes, and follow his commandments in order to take full advantage of this redemption. The offer is always there; the way is always open. We can always, even in our darkest hour and most disastrous errors, look to the Son of God and live.</p>

These are all valued and all necessary, but they do not constitute our full offering to God. Ultimately, what our Father in Heaven will require of us is more than a contribution; it is a total commitment, a complete devotion, all that we are and all that we can be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/standing-as-witnesses-of-god.p2" pid="NFarsAJbAEyI9FdCkoDtxQ" hash="Yw7LpQ">Please understand that I do not speak only of a commitment to the Church and its activities, although that always needs to be strengthened. No, I speak more specifically of a commitment that is shown in our individual behavior, in our personal integrity, in our loyalty to home and family and community, as well as to the Church. Of course, all of these loyalties are interrelated and closely linked because it is the teaching and example of the Lord Jesus Christ that shapes our behavior and forms our character in all areas of our life—personally, within the home, in our professions and community life, as well as in our devotion to the Church that bears his name.</p>

Whether at home or in the marketplace, whether at school or long after school is behind us, whether we are acting totally alone or in concert with a host of other people, our course will be clear and our standards will be obvious. We will have determined, as the prophet Alma said, “to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that [we] may be in, even until death.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>.)</p>

The king was full of “rage and fury” and demanded that they be brought before him. (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/3.13" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 3:13</a>.) He informed them that if they did not fall down before the golden image at the appointed moment, “ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.” Then with some self-satisfaction he asked, “And who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/3.15" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 3:15</a>.)</p>

Then he commanded that these three valiant young men be thrown fully clothed into the midst of the fire. Indeed, the king was so insistent and the flame so hot that the soldiers who carried Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego fell dead from the heat of the furnace as they cast their captives forward.</p>

We need to try harder to live the gospel in our family circles. Our homes deserve our most faithful commitments. A child has the right to feel that in his home he is safe, that there he has a place of protection from the dangers and evils of the outside world. Family unity and integrity are necessary to supply this need. A child needs parents who are happy in their relationship to each other, who are working happily toward the fulfillment of ideal family living, who love their children with a sincere and unselfish love, and who are committed to the family’s success.</p>

Ultimately it requires commitment—whole souled, deeply held, eternally cherished commitment to the principles we know to be true in the commandments God has given. We need such loyalty to the Church, but that must immediately be interpreted as a loyalty in our personal habits and behavior, integrity in the wider community and marketplace, and—for the future’s sake—devotion and character in our marriages and homes and families.</p>

He healed a leper, cured the servant of a centurion, stilled a tempest, cast out devils, healed a paralytic, opened the eyes of the blind, and restored a young woman to life who had died.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p2" pid="KoCTwjnXWUKL9Utc_IxRXA" hash="At7MBg">Most of the people of his home region would not truly believe. “Is not this Joseph’s son?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/4.22" class="scriptureRef">Luke 4:22</a>) they asked of Jesus, refusing to acknowledge his divine heritage. Jesus wept over these people who should have known better. Because of their skepticism and unbelief and refusal to repent, he upbraided the cities where most of his mighty works had been done. In severely criticizing and finding fault with the wicked cities of Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, he said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p3" pid="AoxICctUBU6rKOaxfmbakA" hash="SC4IlQ">“For if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p5" pid="gGRQp3UMzEqYbjiXUHEotw" hash="e2VMLw">While anguishing over the wickedness and lack of faith among so many in his home area, the Savior voiced his prayer of gratitude for the humble and plain people who did hear his teachings and did believe. These lowly learners needed him, and they needed his message. They demonstrated that the humble, the needy, and the sorrowing would hear the word of God and cherish it. With reassurance to these new believers and concern for those not choosing to follow him, Christ issued a profound invitation in what Elder James E. Talmage has appropriately called “one of the grandest outpourings of spiritual emotion known to man.” (<span class="emphasis">Jesus the Christ,</span> 3d ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916, p. 258.) These are the words of the Master used in making this appeal:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p6" pid="ifxUoPxjlEaUtN31HpQNqQ" hash="MLNUqA">“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p7" pid="2xY2EIradEmvfOMPj8eysg" hash="NJrEVg">“Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p8" pid="07weRR73Z0WFqzysHcgnJg" hash="lNKnWw">“For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:28–30</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p9" pid="v97xVAid4UGWYbXSaWbyaA" hash="ShbadQ">This invitation and promise is one of the most oft-quoted of all scripture and has been of untold comfort and reassurance to millions. Yet there were those among his hearers that day whose vision was so limited that they could see only a carpenter’s son speaking of a wooden yoke. A yoke which, from time to time, he had undoubtedly hewn and shaped from heavy wooden timbers for the oxen of these same men who were listening.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p10" pid="cyMx-oFS0UCMJ8oNeD2ytQ" hash="tyeABg">Elder Talmage added: “He invited them from drudgery to pleasant service; from the well-nigh unbearable burdens of ecclesiastical exactions and traditional formalism, to the liberty of truly spiritual worship; from slavery to freedom; but they would not.” (<span class="emphasis">Jesus the Christ,</span> p. 259.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p11" pid="nHwnb0-AmUmxtqsl-HL5dg" hash="wd1PPw">Here was a prophetic appeal and magnificent promise to a troubled people facing great peril, but they could not understand it. He knew what lay ahead for them even if they did not, and he was inviting them to come unto him to find rest and safety for their troubled souls. Had he not already shown them that he could give rest to those who labored with profound illness and disease? Had he not already relieved the burden of those who were heavily laden with sin and the cares of the world? Had he not already raised one from the dead, proving that he possessed the divine power to relieve even that greatest of all universal burdens? And yet most would still not “come unto [him].”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p12" pid="BlB8L7nx4EuGxvrngSR5Tg" hash="PPI4uA">Unfortunately, a refusal to accept his miracles and his glorious invitation is still seen today. This marvelous offer of assistance extended by the Son of God himself was not restricted to the Galileans of his day. This call to shoulder his easy yoke and accept his light burden is not limited to bygone generations. It was and is a universal appeal to all people, to all cities and nations, to every man, woman, and child everywhere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p13" pid="HwLgK6BgVk629WoZ9C1z7A" hash="yWRlrA">In our own great times of need we must not leave unrecognized this unfailing answer to the cares and worries of our world. Here is the promise of personal peace and protection. Here is the power to remit sin in all periods of time. We, too, must believe that Jesus Christ possesses the power to ease our burdens and lighten our loads. We, too, must come unto him and there receive rest from our labors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p14" pid="htI9LJ91aUm7IsgnX68aOA" hash="f_CxZQ">Of course, obligations go with such promises. “Take my yoke upon you,” he pleads. In biblical times the yoke was a device of great assistance to those who tilled the field. It allowed the strength of a second animal to be linked and coupled with the effort of a single animal, sharing and reducing the heavy labor of the plow or wagon. A burden that was overwhelming or perhaps impossible for one to bear could be equitably and comfortably borne by two bound together with a common yoke. His yoke requires a great and earnest effort, but for those who truly are converted, the yoke is easy and the burden becomes light.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p15" pid="8xkrOIulXUS7p4Cl242sVQ" hash="wY3TCg">Why face life’s burdens alone, Christ asks, or why face them with temporal support that will quickly falter? To the heavy laden it is Christ’s yoke, it is the power and peace of standing side by side with a God that will provide the support, balance, and the strength to meet our challenges and endure our tasks here in the hardpan field of mortality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p16" pid="kRD92Ajd_k2oWpbj6kT2_Q" hash="gEPzzQ">Obviously, the personal burdens of life vary from person to person, but every one of us has them. Furthermore, each trial in life is tailored to the individual’s capacities and needs as known by a loving Father in Heaven. Of course, some sorrows are brought on by the sins of a world not following the counsel of that Father in Heaven. Whatever the reason, none of us seems to be completely free from life’s challenges. To one and all, Christ said, in effect: As long as we all must bear some burden and shoulder some yoke, why not let it be mine? My promise to you is that my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:28–30</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p17" pid="tKv4gHf11Ei-hnUVdwbxCg" hash="qPhNzw">“Learn of me,” he continued, “for I am meek and lowly in heart.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.29" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:29</a>.) Surely the lessons of history ought to teach us that pride, haughtiness, self-adulation, conceit, and vanity contain all of the seeds of self-destruction for individuals, cities, or nations. The ashes and rubble of Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum are the silent witnesses of the Savior’s unheeded warnings to that generation. Once majestic and powerful cities, they no longer exist. Would we add our names or the names of our families to such a list? No, of course not; but if we would not, we must be truly meek and lowly. By taking the yoke of Jesus upon us and feeling what he felt for the sins of the world, we learn most deeply of him, and we especially learn how to be like him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p18" pid="RUTkpkd6Pkyf3yQxcGZmrQ" hash="Mza_Ug">President Ezra Taft Benson has said:</p>

This has nothing to do with earthly wealth, power, or prestige. The only true test of greatness, blessedness, joyfulness is how close a life can come to being like the Master, Jesus Christ. He is the right way, the full truth, and the abundant life.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Dec. 1988, p. 2.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p20" pid="ytB6cQi5CUKeIdYXbHfdpA" hash="_U2t8g">The call to come unto him has continued throughout time and is being renewed in our day. Modern scriptures are replete with the same invitation. It is an urgent, pleading call to everyone. Indeed, the calm but urgent appeal is still from the Son of God himself. He is, in fact, the Anointed One who will lift the greatest of burdens from the most heavily laden. The conditions for obtaining that assistance are still precisely the same. We must come unto him and take his yoke upon us. In meekness and lowliness, we must learn of him in order to receive eternal life and exaltation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/come-unto-me.p21" pid="njLH2fGt8E6fDB2FJZkjPw" hash="ycenPQ">May we do so in appreciation for the loving gift of eternal joy he offers us I pray—as I leave with you my personal witness that God our Heavenly Father lives and that Jesus is the Christ, having suffered and given his life that we may have life everlasting—in his holy name, amen.</p>

This church, in whose annual worldwide conference we are gathered today and that had been prophesied to be a latter-day marvelous work and a wonder, has come forth from the most humble of beginnings.</p>

None of them laid any claim to special learning or significant leadership. They were honorable people and respectable citizens but were virtually unknown outside of their own immediate neighborhood.</p>

The history states that he “owned a farm, a grist mill and carding machine. He was not rich, yet he possessed enough of this world’s goods to secure to himself and family, not only the necessaries, but also the comforts of life. … [He] was a sober, honest man, generally respected and beloved by his neighbors and acquaintances. He did not belong to any religious sect, but was a believer.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 1:47.) Of such ordinary, honest people was the group composed who assembled in Peter Whitmer’s house in Fayette, Seneca County, New York, more than a century and a half ago.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-sixth-day-of-april-1830.p4" pid="YR_kv4CcPEidOQtPxhbCLA" hash="Qq_zEQ">Most of life’s momentous hours are recorded, but what these men did on that humble occasion would not have given the world much reason to take note. What they did, however, ranks among the most important events ever to have transpired since the death of Jesus and his Apostles in the meridian of time.</p>

He declared to them and all others who would listen that he had received profound and repeated heavenly communications, including an open vision of God the Father and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. As a result of these revelatory experiences, Joseph Smith had already published the Book of Mormon, a record of Christ’s dealings with the ancient inhabitants of America. Furthermore, the Lord had commanded this young man, by now only twenty-four years of age, to reinstitute the Church that had existed in New Testament times and that in its restored purity should again be designated by the name of its chief cornerstone and eternal head, the Lord Jesus Christ himself.</p>

A humble beginning, yes, but the claim that God had spoken, that Christ’s Church was again organized and its doctrines reaffirmed by divine revelation, was the most outstanding declaration made to the world since the days of the Savior himself when he walked the paths of Judea and the hills of Galilee.</p>

Yet the fact remains that Paul, in that earlier experience, was the only man in that great city of learning who knew that a person may pass through the portals of death and live. He was the only man in Athens who could clearly delineate the difference between the formality of idolatry and the heartfelt worship of the only true and living God. The Epicureans and Stoics, with whom he had conversed and argued, called Paul a babbler, a setter forth of strange gods. The record states:</p>

Yet something made him very bold in his declarations against the false doctrines pertaining to infant baptism, self-appointed priesthood, predestination, and other erroneous teachings of the day.</p>

Others loved him and felt as Willard Richards did when he said: “Brother Joseph you did not ask me to cross the river with you—you did not ask me to come to Carthage—you did not ask me to come to jail with you—and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 6:616.)</p>

Even as Jesus was persecuted, stoned, condemned, and finally crucified, some of his disciples felt as Thomas did when he said, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/11.16" class="scriptureRef">John 11:16</a>.)</p>

His greatness consists in one thing—the truthfulness of his declaration that he saw the Father and the Son and that he responded to the reality of that divine revelation. Part of the divine revelation was instruction to reestablish the true and living Church, restored in these modern times as it existed in the day of the Savior’s own mortal ministry. The Prophet Joseph Smith said the Church of Jesus Christ was “organized in accordance with commandments and revelations given by Him to ourselves in these last days, as well as according to the order of the Church as recorded in the New Testament.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 1:79.)</p>

Furthermore, the Father and the Son demonstrated the undeniable truth that they are separate and distinct personages. Indeed, the relationship of the Father and the Son was reaffirmed by the divine introduction to the boy prophet, “This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>.) Those who were baptized into the Church on the sixth of April, 1830, believed in the existence of a personal God; they believed that his reality and the reality of his Son, Jesus Christ, constitute the eternal foundation upon which this church is built.</p>

Christ said, “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.9" class="scriptureRef">John 14:9</a>.) Faith in the existence of a divine and real and living personal God was the first element that contributed to the perpetuity of the Church of Jesus Christ in ancient times, and it is the everlasting foundation upon which The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is built today.</p>

That action was largely unknown to the world at that time and would only come to be known to the extent that it contained and radiated eternal principles that harmonize with all other truth coming from God, the author of all truth. Only thus, through its truthfulness, could it and would it ever become a marvelous work and a wonder.</p>

The marvelous progress in transportation and communication has made possible the promulgation of these truths of the restored gospel to the children of men nearly everywhere in the world. Millions in America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the islands of the sea not only have been able to hear but, in millions of cases, to accept and commit to these saving principles of the gospel of truth.</p>

I bear you my testimony that the church organized in obscurity 161 years ago yesterday is indeed the church of Jesus Christ. I declare that God lives, that he is a personal God who hears and answers our prayers, that he is the Father he has always declared himself in scripture to be. He is undoubtedly more than we can fully understand him to be, but he is certainly not less than we understand.</p>

On this anniversary season of the organization of the Church, I bear testimony of its truthfulness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p1" pid="5A9YcgUq_UKRMDStF4dDRw" hash="wEFU-A">The gospel of Jesus Christ, which gospel we teach and the ordinances of which we perform, is a global faith with an all-embracing message. It is neither confined nor partial nor subject to history or fashion. Its essence is universally and eternally true. Its message is for all the world, restored in these latter days to meet the fundamental needs of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people on the earth. It has been established again as it was in the beginning—to build brotherhood, to preserve truth, and to save souls.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p2" pid="1Ka5zNpeUkiGrGQZsQV3mg" hash="nnHiZg">Brigham Young once said about such a broad and stimulating concept of religion: “For me, the plan of salvation must … circumscribe [all] the knowledge that is upon the face of the earth, or it is not from God. Such a plan incorporates every system of true doctrine on the earth, whether it be ecclesiastical, moral, philosophical, or civil: it incorporates all good laws that have been made from the days of Adam until now; it swallows up the laws of nations, for it exceeds them all in knowledge and purity; it circumscribes the doctrines of the day, and takes from the right and the left, and brings all truth together in one system, and leaves the chaff to be scattered hither and thither.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 7:148.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p3" pid="oC9uBPFpV0iZEZvk-PaRGw" hash="7X_UHA">As members of the Church of Jesus Christ, we seek to bring all truth together. We seek to enlarge the circle of love and understanding among all the people of the earth. Thus we strive to establish peace and happiness, not only within Christianity but among all mankind.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p4" pid="YmjXIDpOM0uMedSlXF-Yqg" hash="yFsKhA">In the message of the gospel, the entire human race is one family descended from a single God. All men and women have not only a physical lineage leading back to Adam and Eve, their first earthly parents, but also a spiritual heritage leading back to God the Eternal Father. Thus, all persons on earth are literally brothers and sisters in the family of God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p5" pid="jscnilRMBUSLMlj-ziXl8A" hash="y1R_6Q">It is in understanding and accepting this universal fatherhood of God that all human beings can best appreciate God’s concern for them and their relationship to each other. This is a message of life and love that strikes squarely against all stifling traditions based on race, language, economic or political standing, educational rank, or cultural background, for we are all of the same spiritual descent. We have a divine pedigree; every person is a spiritual child of God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p6" pid="3jo5baSIhk2qnvIBD1cx4A" hash="A2S9_A">In this gospel view there is no room for a contracted, narrow, or prejudicial view. The Prophet Joseph Smith said: “Love is one of the chief characteristics of Deity, and ought to be manifested by those who aspire to be the sons of God. A man filled with the love of God is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:227.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p7" pid="uyzIK1tL1EiIhtLoOoCxhg" hash="Kqd7gQ">In 1907 the First Presidency presented to the general conference a declaration which includes this statement: “Our motives are not selfish; our purposes not petty and earth-bound; we contemplate the human race, past, present and yet to come, as immortal beings, for whose salvation it is our mission to labor; and to this work, broad as eternity and deep as the love of God, we devote ourselves, now, and forever.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1907, appendix, p. 16.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p8" pid="aPwV4qye-UWLI0exiQz1rg" hash="K9-Bbw">In the gospel view, no man is alien. No one is to be denied. There is no underlying excuse for smugness, arrogance, or pride. Openly scorning the pettiness and intolerance of rival religious groups, the Prophet Joseph Smith said in an editorial:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p9" pid="LTwqAFsT00WxSkokF4pxuQ" hash="1mM9CA">“While one portion of the human race is judging and condemning the other without mercy, the Great Parent of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard; He views them as His offspring, and without any of those contracted feelings that influence the children of men, causes ‘His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.’ He holds the reins of judgment in His hands; He is a wise Lawgiver, and will judge all men, not according to the narrow, contracted notions of men, but, ‘according to the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil,’ or whether these deeds were done in England, America, Spain, Turkey, or India.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:595–96.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p10" pid="eb4EiEgWVU2e_pKZEVudYw" hash="GpXakA">Mormonism, so-called, is a world religion, not simply because its members are now found throughout the world, but chiefly because it has a comprehensive and inclusive message based upon the acceptance of all truth, restored to meet the needs of all mankind.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p11" pid="9PKyfobEBk2q-AnntDNGeQ" hash="vuzxPw">We believe there is a spiritual influence that emanates from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:12</a>.) All men share an inheritance of divine light. God operates among his children in all nations, and those who seek God are entitled to further light and knowledge, regardless of their race, nationality, or cultural traditions.</p>

Whitney, in a conference address, explained that many great religious leaders were inspired.

This primary religious message was beautifully expressed in a statement of the First Presidency on February 15, 1978, as follows:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p15" pid="tEsPPNjsYEG8aRXI8ociCA" hash="COAjDA">“Based upon ancient and modern revelation, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints gladly teaches and declares the Christian doctrine that all men and women are brothers and sisters, not only by blood relationship from common mortal progenitors but also as literal spirit children of an Eternal Father.” (In J.

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p16" pid="ITXrDJio7E6HO24u5uG6PA" hash="uoOzbg">Latter-day Saints have a positive and inclusive approach toward others who are not of our faith. We believe they are literally our brothers and sisters, that we are sons and daughters of the same Heavenly Father. We have a common genealogy leading back to God. But more than that, we also seek the true and the beautiful wherever it may be found. And we know that God has blessed all his children with goodness and light, in accordance with the conditions in which they find themselves.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p17" pid="0HKjO0ybBkC19AkS7FOwSw" hash="jirnrQ">In our humble efforts to build brotherhood and to teach revealed truth, we say to the people of the world what President George Albert Smith so lovingly suggested:</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p19" pid="l8CBkAStmUGykbyr-YtilQ" hash="nVD9tQ">In summary, then, the validity, the power, of our faith is not bound by history, nationality, or culture. It is not the peculiar property of any one people or any one age. As Joseph Smith once said, it is “above the kingdoms of the world.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:526.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-gospel-a-global-faith.p20" pid="tMAd5dWqI0mVsPLE-IQvdA" hash="8c5MhQ">Ours is a perennial religion based on eternal, saving truth. Its message of love and brotherhood is lodged in scripture and in the revelations of the Lord to his living prophet. It embraces all truth. It circumscribes all wisdom—all that God has revealed to man, and all that he will yet reveal. Of that eternal revelation, I bear testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We need to “pause to help and lift another” and surely we will find “strength beyond [our] own.” If we would do more to learn “the healer’s art,” there would be untold chances to use it, to touch the “wounded and the weary” and show to all “a gentle[r] heart.” Yes, Lord, we should follow thee.</p>

This love that we should have for our brothers and sisters in the human family, and that Christ has for every one of us, is called charity or “the pure love of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>.) It is the love that prompted the suffering and sacrifice of Christ’s atonement. It is the highest pinnacle the human soul can reach and the deepest expression of the human heart.</p>

It distinguishes both the beginning and the end of the plan of salvation. When all else fails, charity—Christ’s love—will <span class="emphasis">not </span>fail. It is the greatest of all divine attributes.</p>

He ministered to the poor, the hungry, the deprived, the sick. He blessed the lame, the blind, the deaf, and other people with physical disabilities. He drove out the demons and evil spirits that had caused mental or emotional illness. He purified those who were burdened with sin. He taught lessons of love and repeatedly demonstrated unselfish service to others. All were recipients of his love. All were “privileged the one like unto the other, and none [were] forbidden.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.28" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:28</a>.)

It is without envy or pride. It is selfless because it seeks nothing in return. It does not countenance evil or ill will, nor rejoice in iniquity; it has no place for bigotry, hatred, or violence. It refuses to condone ridicule, vulgarity, abuse, or ostracism. It encourages diverse people to live together in Christian love regardless of religious belief, race, nationality, financial standing, education, or culture.</p>

Some customers occasionally took unfair advantage of the young man, and parts were disappearing from the lot overnight. Vern was angry and vowed to catch someone and make an example of him. Vengeance would be his.</p>

It was nearly dark. In a distant corner of the property, he caught sight of someone carrying a large piece of machinery toward the back fence. He ran like a champion athlete and caught the young thief. His first thought was to take out his frustrations with his fists and then drag the boy to the front office and call the police. His heart was full of anger and vengeance. He had caught his thief, and he intended to get his just dues.</p>

Can I handle this?” He then walked over to the young would-be thief and put his arm around his shoulder, looked him in the eye for a moment, and said, “Son, tell me, why are you doing this? Why were you trying to steal that transmission?” Then Mr. Crowley started walking toward the office with his arm around the boy, asking questions about the young man’s car problems as they walked. By the time they had arrived at the office, the father said, “Well, I think your clutch is gone and that’s causing your problem.”</p>

Get him a throwout bearing, too. And get him a pressure plate. That should take care of it.” The father handed all of the parts to the young man who had attempted robbery and said, “Take these. And here’s the transmission, too. You don’t have to steal, young man. Just ask for it. There’s a way out of every problem. People are willing to help.”</p>

The young man came back to the lot often. Voluntarily, month by month, he paid for all of the parts Vic Crowley had given him, including the transmission. During those visits he asked Vern why his dad was the way he was and why he did what he did. Vern told him something of their Latter-day Saint beliefs and how much his father loved the Lord and loved people. Eventually the would-be thief was baptized. Vern later said, “It’s hard now to describe the feelings I had and what I went through in that experience. I, too, was young. I had caught my crook. I was going to extract the utmost penalty. But my father taught me a different way.”</p>

Remember the promise of the Savior that kindly deeds done in secret shall one day be openly rewarded by our Father in Heaven.

We hear many voices espousing causes and clamoring for converts to their way of thinking.

He said some were crying, “‘Lo, here!’ and others, ‘Lo, there!’” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.5" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:5</a>.) Many today struggle with the challenges of life. Given the perplexities, turmoil, and evils that are about us, it is natural for us to reach out for someone who can help. Some women long for that inspiration which can comfort the heart, bind the wounds, and give knowledge sufficient to point the way when there seems no reliable way to turn.</p>

He enjoyed the company of women and had close friends among them. One of his great parables was about ten virgins. He blessed children. He honored the poor widow who gave two mites. He taught the woman of Samaria and revealed to her that he was the Messiah. He cast out seven devils from Mary Magdalene and forgave the woman taken in adultery. He healed the daughter of the Greek woman, the one stooped and bent for eighteen years, and healed Peter’s mother of a fever.</p>

As he hung on the cross, his heart went out to his mother, and he placed her in the care of his beloved disciple, John. Women prepared his body for burial.

Together we must stand faithful and firm in the faith against superior numbers of other-minded people. It seems to me that there is a great need to rally the women of the Church to stand with and for the Brethren in stemming the tide of evil that surrounds us and in moving forward the work of our Savior. Nephi said, “Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men, [women, and children].” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>.)

His suffering on behalf of our sins, shortcomings, sorrows, and sicknesses should motivate us to similarly reach out in charity and compassion to those around us. It is most appropriate that the motto of the longest-standing women’s organization in the world—the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—is “Charity Never Faileth.”</p>

Don’t be overly concerned with status. Do you recall the counsel of the Savior regarding those who seek the “chief seats” or the “uppermost rooms”? “He that is greatest among you shall be your servant.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/23.6,11" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 23:6, 11</a>.) It is important to be appreciated. But our focus should be on righteousness, not recognition; on service, not status. The faithful visiting teacher, who quietly goes about her work month after month, is just as important to the work of the Lord as those who occupy what some see as more prominent positions in the Church. Visibility does not equate to value.</p>

Kimball counseled: “Bear in mind, dear sisters, that the eternal blessings which are yours through membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are far, far greater than any other blessings you could possibly receive. No greater recognition can come to you in this world than to be known as a woman of God. No greater status can be conferred upon you than being a daughter of God who experiences true sisterhood, wifehood, and motherhood, or other tasks which influence lives for good.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1972, p. 102.)</p>

Surely our prayer is to see the world made a better place in which to live, to see more care and concern for one another, and to see the cause of peace and reassurance increased in every direction and extended to all people.</p>

He said: “[In order to make the world] a better place … to live, … the first and most important step is to choose as a leader one whose leadership is infallible, whose teachings when practiced have never failed. In … [any] tempestuous sea of uncertainty, the pilot must be one who through the storm can see the beacon in the harbor of peace” (David O. McKay, <span class="emphasis">Man May Know for Himself,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1967, p. 407.)</p>

That light is Jesus Christ, the light and life of the world, the light which one Book of Mormon prophet described as “a light that is endless, that can never be darkened.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 16:9</a>.)</p>

He is the one who said of his mission, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.6" class="scriptureRef">John 14:6</a>.)</p>

Because many reject those teachings, that is all the more reason why sincere believers in the gospel of Jesus Christ should proclaim its truth and show by example the power and peace of a righteous, gentle life.</p>

He said, “Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.44" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:44</a>.)</p>

I realize this doctrine poses a significant challenge, but surely it is a more agreeable challenge than the terrible tasks posed for us by the war and poverty and pain the world continues to face.</p>

For example, we can all be a little more forgiving. In latter-day revelation the Lord said: “My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.</p>

He taught with a grandeur and authority that filled with hope the educated and the ignorant, the wealthy and the poor, the well and the diseased.</p>

Christ’s voice was pure and pervaded with sympathy. Even the severity of his sternest injunctions was expressed with an unutterable love. (Frederic W. Farrar, <span class="emphasis">The Life of Christ,</span> Portland, Oreg.: Fountain Publications, 1964, p. 215.)</p>

As Christ’s disciples had set out on one of their frequent journeys across the Sea of Galilee, the night was dark and the elements were strong and contrary. The waves were boisterous and the wind was bold, and these mortal, frail men were frightened. Unfortunately there was no one with them to calm and save them, for Jesus had been left alone upon the shore.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p17" pid="MZatN54JM0yorEQEaFXkqA" hash="65a2FA">As always, he was watching over them. He loved them and cared for them. In their moment of greatest extremity they looked and saw in the darkness an image in a fluttering robe, walking toward them on the ridges of the sea. They cried out in terror at the sight, thinking that it was a phantom that walked upon the waves. And through the storm and darkness to them—as so often to us, when, amid the darknesses of life, the ocean seems so great and our little boats so small—there came the ultimate and reassuring voice of peace with this simple declaration, “It is I; be not afraid.” Peter exclaimed, “Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.” And Christ’s answer to him was the same as to all of us: “Come.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p18" pid="B2RKejt3UUWsTKhd-Dp0pQ" hash="T-AJNw">Peter sprang over the vessel’s side and into the troubled waves, and while his eyes were fixed upon the Lord, the wind might toss his hair and the spray might drench his robes, but all was well. Only when with wavering faith he removed his glance from the Master to look at the furious waves and the black gulf beneath him, only then did he begin to sink. Again, like most of us, he cried, “Lord, save me.” Nor did Jesus fail him. He stretched out his hand and grasped the drowning disciple with the gentle rebuke, “O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/the-beacon-in-the-harbor-of-peace.p19" pid="xZMXBOrUwE-xeawFCkgzmA" hash="5zcPTw">Then safely aboard their little craft, they saw the wind fall and the crash of the waves become a ripple. Soon they were at their haven, their safe port, where all would one day hope to be. The crew as well as his disciples were filled with deep amazement. Some of them addressed him by a title which I declare today: “Truly thou art the Son of God.” (Adapted from Farrar, <span class="emphasis">The Life of Christ,</span> pp. 310–13; see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/14.22-33" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 14:22–33</a>.)</p>

He was their king; these were his subjects. “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they shouted. “Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/21.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 21:9</a>.)</p>

After stops at the home of Annas, the court of Caiaphas, and the Roman headquarters of Pilate, it would, of course, lead on to Calvary. But it would not end there. The path would lead to the garden tomb and the triumphant hour of resurrection that we celebrate each year on Easter Sunday, one week from today.</p>

Indeed, Easter, along with perhaps Christmas, may be the only time in the whole year that some of our brothers and sisters in Christ’s flock find their way to church. That is admirable, but we wonder if thoughts of Jesus, which “with sweetness [fill our] breast,” ought not to be far more frequent and much more constant in all times and seasons of our lives. How often do we think of the Savior? How deeply and how gratefully and how adoringly do we reflect on his life? How central to our lives do we know him to be?</p>

Is there one among us, in any walk of life, who does not need hope and seek for greater joy?

Sooner or later, and we pray sooner <span class="emphasis">than</span> later, everyone will acknowledge that Christ’s way is not only the <span class="emphasis">right</span> way, but ultimately the <span class="emphasis">only</span> way to hope and joy.

To a group of disciples in the New World, a group anxious to be taught by him and even more anxious because he would soon be leaving them, he asked, “What manner of men ought ye to be?” Then in the same breath he gave this answer: “Even as I am” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>).</p>

History provides many examples of good men and women, but even the best of mortals are flawed in some way or another. None could serve as a perfect model nor as an infallible pattern to follow, however well-intentioned they might be.</p>

He honored the poor widow who gave two mites. He taught the woman of Samaria and revealed to her that he was the Messiah. He cast out seven devils from Mary Magdalene and forgave the woman taken in adultery. He healed the daughter of the Greek woman, he healed the woman stooped and bent for eighteen years, and he healed Peter’s mother when she was sick with a fever.</p>

Together we must stand firm in the faith against greater numbers of other-minded people. Nephi said, “Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>). When we are obedient to God, we are a majority. But only together can we accomplish the work he has given us to do and be prepared for the day when we shall see him.</p>

His suffering in behalf of our sins, shortcomings, sorrows, and sicknesses should motivate us to similarly reach out in charity and compassion to those around us.

Perhaps only they, watching from the other side of the veil, can fully understand the weight of responsibility and the deep dependence on the Lord that I feel in accepting this sacred calling.</p>

Jesus Christ is the head of this church. He leads it in word and deed. I am honored beyond expression to be called for a season to be an instrument in his hands to preside over his church. But without the knowledge that Christ is the head of the Church, neither I nor any other man could bear the weight of the calling that has come.</p>

He has repeatedly spared my life and restored my strength, has repeatedly brought me back from the edge of eternity, and has allowed me to continue in my mortal ministry for another season. I have wondered on occasion why my life has been spared. But now I have set that question aside and ask only for the faith and prayers of the members of the Church so we can work together, I laboring with you, to fulfill God’s purposes in this season of our lives.</p>

Those years have been rich in preparation. I have met the Saints and borne testimony in North and South America; in Europe and Eastern Europe; in Asia, Australia, and Africa; and in the islands of the sea. Many times have I been to the Holy Land and walked where Jesus walked. My walk is slower now, but my mind is clear, and my spirit is young.</p>

Each man who is ordained an Apostle and set apart as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve is sustained as a prophet, seer, and revelator. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, called and ordained to hold the keys of the priesthood, have the authority and responsibility to govern the Church, to administer its ordinances, to teach its doctrine, and to establish and maintain its practices.</p>

Any major questions, policies, programs, or doctrines are prayerfully considered in council by the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. No decision emanates from the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve without total unanimity among all concerned.</p>

I have always held, and do hold, and trust I always shall hold, that it is wrong for one man to exercise all the authority and power of presidency in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I dare not assume such a responsibility, and I will not, so long as I can have men like these to stand by and counsel with me in the labors we have to perform and in doing all those things that shall tend to the peace, advancement and happiness of the people of God and the building up of Zion.”</p>

Parenthood is a sacred obligation and privilege, with children welcomed as a “heritage of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/127.3" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 127:3</a>).</p>

The world’s councils and deliberations will succeed only when they define the family as the Lord has revealed it to be. “Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/127.1" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 127:1</a>).</p>

The priesthood is the greatest brotherhood on the earth. I feel great strength in seeing your faithfulness and feeling your love and sustaining vote. We are particularly grateful to have so many of our Aaronic Priesthood brethren here with their fathers or advisers.</p>

All of you who hold the Aaronic Priesthood will soon arrive at the years of marriage and fatherhood. Therefore, what I say tonight has application to all present.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/being-a-righteous-husband-and-father.p3" pid="i25pMVJFBEm0A4ga28zdgw" hash="H_Esig">I wish to speak of the relationship that a man holding the priesthood should have with his wife and children. With a knowledge of the plan of salvation as a foundation, a man who holds the priesthood looks upon marriage as a sacred privilege and obligation. It is not good for man nor for woman to be alone. Man is not complete without woman. Neither can fill the measure of their creation without the other (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 11:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.18" class="scriptureRef">Moses 3:18</a>). Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49.15-17" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 49:15–17</a>). Only through the new and everlasting covenant of marriage can they realize the fulness of eternal blessings (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.1-4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 131:1–4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.15-19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 132:15–19</a>). As a matter of priesthood responsibility, a man, under normal circumstances, should not unduly postpone marriage. Brethren, the Lord has spoken plainly on this matter. It is your sacred and solemn responsibility to follow his counsel and the words of his prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/being-a-righteous-husband-and-father.p4" pid="q_t0YWLJ3k6Tpzc2sPpA0Q" hash="eqORxA">The prophets of the past have spoken also of those who may not have opportunity to marry in this life. President Lorenzo Snow said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/being-a-righteous-husband-and-father.p5" pid="Wvklq0hlpkmonEJbvez5cA" hash="voWqGA">“There is no Latter-day Saint who dies after having lived a faithful life who will lose anything because of having failed to do certain things when opportunities were not furnished him or her. In other words, if a young man or a young woman has no opportunity of getting married, and they live faithful lives up to the time of their death, they will have all the blessings, exaltation, and glory that any man or woman will have who had this opportunity and improved it. That is sure and positive” (<span class="emphasis">The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow,</span> comp. Clyde J. Williams, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1984, p. 138).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/being-a-righteous-husband-and-father.p7" pid="zVsvRzg9qEmMAEgdv_DSAA" hash="KRH2KA">A man who holds the priesthood shows perfect moral fidelity to his wife and gives her no reason to doubt his faithfulness. A husband is to love his wife with all his heart and cleave unto her and none else (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.22-26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:22–26</a>). President Spencer W. Kimball explained:</p>

The spouse then becomes pre-eminent in the life of the husband or wife and neither social life nor occupational life nor political life nor any other interest nor person nor thing shall ever take precedence over the companion spouse” (<span class="emphasis">The Miracle of Forgiveness,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969, p. 250).</p>

Infidelity on the part of a man breaks the heart of his wife and loses her confidence and the confidence of his children (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.35" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:35</a>).</p>

Pornography, flirtations, and unwholesome fantasies erode one’s character and strike at the foundation of a happy marriage. Unity and trust within a marriage are thereby destroyed. One who does not control his thoughts and thus commits adultery in his heart, if he does not repent, shall not have the Spirit, but shall deny the faith and shall fear (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:23</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 63:16</a>).</p>

Mothers are given a sacred privilege to “bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of [the] Father continued, that he may be glorified” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.63" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 132:63</a>).</p>

It is the highest, holiest service to be assumed by mankind” (in James R. Clark, comp., <span class="emphasis">Messages of the First Presidency,</span> 6 vols., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75, 6:178). The priesthood cannot work out its destiny, nor can God’s purposes be fulfilled, without our helpmates. Mothers perform a labor the priesthood cannot do. For this gift of life, the priesthood should have love unbounded for the mothers of their children.</p>

We are under divine commandment to multiply and replenish the earth and to bring up our children and grandchildren in light and truth (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/2.28" class="scriptureRef">Moses 2:28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.40" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:40</a>). You share, as a loving partner, the care of the children. Help her to manage and keep up your home. Help teach, train, and discipline your children.</p>

Your leadership of the family is your most important and sacred responsibility. The family is the most important unit in time and in eternity and, as such, transcends every other interest in life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/being-a-righteous-husband-and-father.p16" pid="QCnZ_VZjjk-dAvGLYMy6wQ" hash="SBasWg">We reiterate what was stated by President David O. McKay: “No other success [in life] can compensate for failure in the home” (David O. McKay quoting J. E. McCulloch, “Home: the Savior of Civilization,” in Conference Report, Apr. 1935, p. 116) and President Harold B. Lee: “The most important of the Lord’s work you and I will ever do will be within the walls of our own homes” (Harold B. Lee, <span class="emphasis">Stand Ye in Holy Places,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974, p. 255). Effective family leadership, brethren, requires both quantity and quality time. The teaching and governance of the family must not be left to your wife alone, to society, to school, or even the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/being-a-righteous-husband-and-father.p17" pid="1cbNHcjQxEO4ngARqGiJLw" hash="QRqPOQ">A man who holds the priesthood accepts his wife as a partner in the leadership of the home and family with full knowledge of and full participation in all decisions relating thereto. Of necessity there must be in the Church and in the home a presiding officer (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:21</a>). By divine appointment, the responsibility to preside in the home rests upon the priesthood holder (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.22" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:22</a>). The Lord intended that the wife be a helpmeet for man (<span class="emphasis">meet</span> means equal)—that is, a companion equal and necessary in full partnership. Presiding in righteousness necessitates a shared responsibility between husband and wife; together you act with knowledge and participation in all family matters. For a man to operate independent of or without regard to the feelings and counsel of his wife in governing the family is to exercise unrighteous dominion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/being-a-righteous-husband-and-father.p18" pid="dF9th88AIE67df_KKeERpg" hash="Q9AuvA">Keep yourselves above any domineering or unworthy behavior in the tender, intimate relationship between husband and wife. Because marriage is ordained of God, the intimate relationship between husbands and wives is good and honorable in the eyes of God. He has commanded that they be one flesh and that they multiply and replenish the earth (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/2.28" class="scriptureRef">Moses 2:28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.24" class="scriptureRef">Moses 3:24</a>). You are to love your wife as Christ loved the Church and gave himself for it (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/5.25-31" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 5:25–31</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/being-a-righteous-husband-and-father.p19" pid="PB1D4y4glEusKezU6v2v5w" hash="bQV6Pw">Tenderness and respect—never selfishness—must be the guiding principles in the intimate relationship between husband and wife. Each partner must be considerate and sensitive to the other’s needs and desires. Any domineering, indecent, or uncontrolled behavior in the intimate relationship between husband and wife is condemned by the Lord.</p>

Differences should be worked out in love and kindness and with a spirit of mutual reconciliation. A man should always speak to his wife lovingly and kindly, treating her with the utmost respect. Marriage is like a tender flower, brethren, and must be nourished constantly with expressions of love and affection.</p>

Earn the respect and confidence of your children through your loving relationship with them. A righteous father protects his children with his time and presence in their social, educational, and spiritual activities and responsibilities. Tender expressions of love and affection toward children are as much the responsibility of the father as the mother. Tell your children you love them.</p>

No man can shift the burden of responsibility to another, not even to his wife. The Lord has commanded that women and children have claim on their husbands and fathers for their maintenance (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/83.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 83</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/5.8" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 5:8</a>). President Ezra Taft Benson has stated that when a husband encourages or insists that his wife work out of the home for their convenience, “not only will the family suffer in such instances, … but [his] own spiritual growth and progression will be hampered” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1987, p. 49).</p>

We further emphasize that men who abandon their family and fail to meet their responsibility to care for those they have fathered may find their eligibility for a temple recommend and their standing in the Church in jeopardy. In cases of divorce or separation, men must demonstrate that they are meeting family support payments mandated by law and obligated by the principles of the Church in order to qualify for the blessings of the Lord.</p>

If you are to enjoy the blessings of the Lord, you must set your own homes in order. Together with your wife, you determine the spiritual climate of your home. Your first obligation is to get your own spiritual life in order through regular scriptural study and daily prayer. Secure and honor your priesthood and temple covenants; encourage your family to do the same.</p>

As patriarch in the home, exercise your priesthood through performing the appropriate ordinances for your family and by giving blessings to your wife and children. Next to your own salvation, brethren, there is nothing so important to you as the salvation of your wife and children.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p3" pid="uysy4TXk7kaTKb-rZlnpxw" hash="_xvobw">As I have pondered the messages of the conference, I have asked myself this question: How can I help others partake of the goodness and blessings of our Heavenly Father? The answer lies in following the direction received from those we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators, and others of the General Authorities. Let us study their words, spoken under the Spirit of inspiration, and refer to them often. The Lord has revealed his will to the Saints in this conference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p4" pid="suXvcG0_LU-ekselzc_DzQ" hash="JQyR5A">I bear solemn and grateful witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. Certainly he is the center of our worship and the key to our happiness. Let us follow the Son of God in all ways and all walks of life. Let us make him our exemplar and our guide.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p5" pid="DFU87yF2LEyAAlx2kLajYA" hash="V3uuQA">We are at a time in the history of the world and the growth of the Church when we must think more of holy things and act more like the Savior would expect his disciples to act. We should at every opportunity ask ourselves, “What would Jesus do?” and then act more courageously upon the answer. We must be about his work as he was about his Father’s. We should make every effort to become like Christ, the one perfect and sinless example this world has ever seen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p6" pid="dANV3_GO5UKwgy0NlCBaeA" hash="Ebc5sg">And we again emphasize the personal blessings of temple worship and the sanctity and safety that are provided within those hallowed walls. It is the house of the Lord, a place of revelation and of peace. As we attend the temple, we learn more richly and deeply the purpose of life and the significance of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let us make the temple, with temple worship and temple covenants and temple marriage, our ultimate earthly goal and the supreme mortal experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p7" pid="qdVSc84XxkKiv3O9ALk8yg" hash="tTkf-Q">Let us share with our children the spiritual feelings we have in the temple. And let us teach them more earnestly and more comfortably the things we can appropriately say about the purposes of the house of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p8" pid="LJ5b3brCaka1fIes4_gwNg" hash="lrIJOQ">Let us prepare every missionary to go to the temple worthily and to make that experience an even greater highlight than receiving the mission call. Let us plan for and teach and plead with our children to marry in the house of the Lord. Let us reaffirm more vigorously than we ever have in the past that it does matter where you marry and by what authority you are pronounced man and wife.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p9" pid="vAQ5CVgt90OZWjSLvCsftw" hash="_2yrRg">All of our efforts in proclaiming the gospel, perfecting the Saints, and redeeming the dead lead to the holy temple. This is because the temple ordinances are absolutely crucial; we cannot return to God’s presence without them. I encourage everyone to worthily attend the temple or to work toward the day when you can enter that holy house to receive your ordinances and covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p10" pid="VunTSiKRqECHPIyUSaap-g" hash="u7Ejbw">May you let the meaning and beauty and peace of the temple come into your everyday life more directly in order that the millennial day may come, that promised time when “they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more … [but shall] walk in the light of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/2.4-5" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 2:4–5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p11" pid="reWWeSTHqEa2zzLbZyxQLg" hash="Bv29rg">Again and again during his mortal ministry, our Lord issued a call that was both an invitation and a challenge. To Peter and Andrew, Christ said, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:19</a>). We are in the work of saving souls, of inviting people to come unto Christ, of bringing them into the waters of baptism so that they may continue to progress along the path that leads to eternal life. This world needs the gospel of Jesus Christ. The gospel provides the only way the world will ever know peace. As followers of Jesus Christ, we seek to enlarge the circle of love and understanding among the people of the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p12" pid="bwEc2xFanUmAHcafWTJf8Q" hash="nG6iGg">Earlier prophets have taught that every able, worthy young man should serve a full-time mission. I emphasize this need today. We also have great need for our able, mature couples to serve in the mission field. Jesus told his disciples, “The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.2" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:2</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p13" pid="jJ1XgdRGaEKPcKZpYy2gGw" hash="BHJZcQ">And now, my beloved brothers and sisters, through the power and authority of the priesthood vested in me and by virtue of the calling which I now hold, I invoke my blessings upon you. I bless you in your efforts to live a more Christlike life. I bless you with an increased desire to be worthy of a temple recommend and to attend the temple as frequently as circumstances allow. I bless you to receive the peace of our Heavenly Father in your homes and to be guided in teaching your families to follow the Master.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/follow-the-son-of-god.p14" pid="qacH4GSM9UqTUd9jnuvCuw" hash="T9dtjQ">I again testify that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is true. I feel very deeply my dependence on the Lord for the guidance and direction of his kingdom. I thank you again for your sustaining vote and your faith and prayers in behalf of myself and my Brethren, and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
