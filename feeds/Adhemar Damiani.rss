      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/serving-the-lord.p2" pid="kzkftYsACESsqn_8ZestdQ" hash="I_6USg">Because of the kind of life they were living, Joshua admonished them and said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/serving-the-lord.p3" pid="BGOeIBgNlUG6kfRYk6gfZA" hash="DvveLg">“Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/serving-the-lord.p4" pid="yPELTo8CWESURYFeCBpFtA" hash="dUsdnQ">“And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; … but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/serving-the-lord.p5" pid="IDWi5jDMI024QCdeCvquOw" hash="3JmNiQ">In our day, we are being admonished in the same manner through apostles and prophets. We are to fear the Lord, serve the Lord, put away worldly gods, and choose whom we will serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/serving-the-lord.p6" pid="awmACgILkEyCgSMZa68VtQ" hash="1yTZ1w">Fearing the Lord means to be reverent and to love Him and to keep His commandments.</p>

For others, it may mean giving up serious sins they are committing. For others still, it may mean forgetting sad events which happened earlier in their lives. Whatever the situation, in each one of us there is the power to change our life, the power to transform the bad feelings we have in our hearts. The Lord Jesus Christ will give us this power and will help us. All He asks from us is that we have faith in Him, follow His example, and obey His commandments.</p>
