The other thanked him and commended him and said, “That was a great sermon. I wish I had given it.” The other said, “You will.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p2" guid="e646b7fa-f57c-4877-a522-8ce40dd86de3" pid="4rJZP413r0a8xs_bL_YDtA" hash="gxK35A">I suspect many of us will be giving some of the great sermons we have heard at this conference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p3" guid="bfe69221-2301-4963-b9e0-eab7cf5cf75c" pid="wAkMaOKEnkup15dBpCCAng" hash="TXxdpA">My theme this morning is practicing what we preach. I suppose everyone understands what that means. Last Sunday in Logan I heard a choice teacher report her conversation with a little girl in a class. She had asked the little girl, “What does it mean to practice what you preach?” “Oh,” said the youngster, “that means writing your talk and saying it over and over again before you give it in church.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p4" guid="cbc22bea-09f9-41ed-820b-4b0bb0c6056c" pid="oyI4U-BDV0Gpxd4IHZiRMw" hash="ZpzMoA">I would like to say a few words this morning about the more conventional interpretation of practicing what we preach.</p>

Her husband and family were surrounding her bed, holding their family home evening, led by their fourth missionary son just returned from foreign fields. I joined them, and then went home rejoicing and thanking God for that kind of example, and met my own family who were waiting, and prayed that we might do a better job of practicing what we preach.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p6" guid="5e233c4e-e1f6-40cd-9bed-a52ff2872d8a" pid="Ok3FJB_YoU6FUZOYcSuX8w" hash="wnw3bA">I visited her this morning and talked with her to the Lord, and in the spirit of that sobering experience offer my testimony this morning.</p>

What is our duty? What are we commanded? What do we preach?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p8" guid="6e826b8c-54e1-48ae-aa58-7ef4379fea74" pid="co3G1JEPR0SLF26d14aY0g" hash="Do7pyw">Well, one important thing we preach is that parents are to love and teach their children and set an honorable example before them, and that children are to honor and obey their parents. Parents are to love and cleave to each other; and children, as Benjamin said, are to “love one another and serve one another.” We are taught to meet together in a weekly family home evening, to pray together as families, to give an account together of the tithes we pay, to attend sacrament meeting and worship together as a family. We are expected to fast together and to give an amount equivalent to the cost of what we did not eat to the bishop for the care of those who have needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p9" guid="3cfde06d-0fd1-4431-9d25-6c655bb2864a" pid="qEY0gCPhd02YoOqzFPNNcg" hash="2W3OhQ">As a family we are to greet the home teachers and respond to their instructions and inquiries. Motivated by the lofty stature of the family in Church belief, we should be reading and learning together, working together, having pleasant, happy occasions at our mealtimes, supporting each other in school, church, and civic involvements. We should be planning and enjoying projects together, building our customs and traditions into a continuity of generations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p10" guid="61867124-18c5-45c5-9283-a45d83b30566" pid="DT2zpTam1Eu3692LfYX5Iw" hash="2uHWOA">All of this we are taught and encouraged to do.</p>

I would like instead to speak of invitation, of opportunity, of privilege, of love, of gratefully taking time while there is time to enjoy the blessing of our family and home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p12" guid="c33b99dd-3754-4114-abd8-a50ac6de6137" pid="vmYh3kUDzUiDbTHqIohqLQ" hash="TrhLTA">How much joy are we missing that we could be having and are meant to have, joy that we could experience only in our own home and no other place, only with our own family and with no other group?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p13" guid="6a8da6aa-f63f-49c2-ba88-cd71529cd886" pid="prbL-8mqgkuHaLmjREIKMg" hash="4Og_oA">It is instructive to look at the music we sing. Our little ones sing “I am a child of God, and he has sent me here, Has given me an earthly home With parents kind and dear.” Our wonderful young people sing as they have sung in testimony this morning, and they sing other songs: “We’ll build on the rock they planted … The rock of honor and virtue, Of faith in the living God.” From our singing mothers comes the great strain “Love one another,” and all of us sing “Love at home.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p14" guid="678ad8d2-2f3b-41f8-8bc0-4ac328ee9b1d" pid="jY52iAFsJESjX79dJoqGuQ" hash="KNwcmw">Our ties with God and each other are everlasting. Our homes are sanctuaries from the things and cares of this world. Our family is the heart of our eternal hopes. Our love is the tender thread that ties us to an endless, creative, increasing union. These are the things we believe and preach. Can we do more to enjoy the blessings of such concepts in our lives, in our homes, in our families? Can we do better while there is time at practicing what we preach?</p>

He asked me to come to the hospital to administer with him to his infant son, just born and fighting for his life. We reached our hands into the incubator and laid them on this tiny boy and prayed, and then sat and waited with Larry’s mother while he took a turn for the better. We were there when the pediatrician came to announce that he was going to make it. He came through that difficult ordeal with a fine mind and a strong, indomitable spirit. Only a pair of legs that are not quite as strong as they one day will be remain to remind Larry how blessed he is to be alive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p18" guid="1901c671-cfc1-4af0-b3c2-68425bc8b40a" pid="WKC_PhLR0U-bd-MzntD8VA" hash="VU5dvg">Recently this little boy’s big brother returned from having served an honorable mission for the Lord abroad. A perceptive uncle, observing the reunion at the airport, wrote a letter to Larry that I had the privilege of reading. I asked if I might have permission to quote it and have been given that permission. I would like you to know about a Latter-day Saint boy just ordained a deacon who tries to practice what we preach.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p19" guid="8075e435-73ac-432f-8dcf-f77cff613133" pid="ad2HwT4L_kuoyrnCLl_gmw" hash="8CjFCg">“Dear Larry,” the letter said. “Yesterday I got a lump in my throat without even swallowing a frog; and I got a tear in my eye without even inhaling a hippy’s breath! More than that, I got a picture tatooed on my memory that I’ll never forget.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p20" guid="0181a77a-cf3f-4a68-8165-172dcf27bee7" pid="IJ7GqzVZqkOTp7tOpE10hA" hash="SQw-Jg">“It’s only right that I thank you for the lump, the tears, and the picture, for a handsome boy named Larry Ellsworth gave me all three of them … and he didn’t even know it or ask me for a receipt.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p21" guid="30075a89-6f24-4a25-9d45-989776ba2bf7" pid="bOqrjqZrf0C2wD1yMNZLIw" hash="lyZHRw">“It started when he stood waiting for his brother to return from serving our Heavenly Father as a missionary for two years in a far-off land named Chile. You could see that the two years had been longer for this boy than for anyone else. He was so intense, so pale, so absorbed with just watching and waiting.</p>

He wouldn’t let anyone else contribute. It was his idea and his gift … the best way, out of money he could have spent for himself but chose not to because he loved someone else so much!</p>

I’m sure that you’ll be a great man … for you have a big heart and a tender conscience. Some can run faster, jump higher, walk farther, play longer just because they had an easier time getting born into this world. That’s no credit to them. But you have more than most to be thankful for, because Heavenly Father sent one of his favorite sons to live in your body … and it’s who lives in a house that makes all the difference. Thanks, Larry, for the lesson an old dumb uncle learned yesterday just by watching. Love, Uncle Dick.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/practicing-what-we-preach.p27" guid="b87a7dd8-6342-4bbc-a010-c4ed4a6ce8a3" pid="DA3TgSR2_E2A6uD1jBSe7g" hash="zRpgjw">A few weeks ago I listened to a stake president exhort his people to build strong families and to enjoy them. It was a great sermon, and the high point of it for me was his account of the family skiing trip when a four-year-old wanted to go to the top with the rest of the family and ski down. When they arrived it was discovered that he had to snowplow all the way down because it was just a bit too tough a run for his age and experience. The mother started to accompany her four-year-old son down the hill, but her teenage son voluntarily took over and lovingly shepherded his little brother down instead of swooping down himself as he could have done. He cheerfully sacrificed one swift run down the mountain and blessed a whole family with a sweet spirit of love and concern and appreciation.</p>

To our home periodically over the past several years has come a special kind of man as our home teacher. He has brought with him a dear son who, like Larry of the letter, had a difficult time getting born and has had some major problems to contend with. The father and son have sat many times side by side in our home, hands gently clasped or arms intertwined, or a hand on a knee, communicating, always expressing without language, an exchange of love. How we admire this man and his beloved son.</p>

Kindness, consideration, courtesy, care, laughter, unselfishness, prayer, thoughtfulness, doing things for each other, forgiving each other, sustaining each other, loving each other—these are notes that form a family symphony happily enjoyed and eternally remembered.</p>

Whatever changes are said to have occurred in our time, there is left to the family the most important purpose of all—the satisfaction of the basic emotional and spiritual needs of its members. In any era, one has written, society is a “web of which the family forms the central strands.” In home, family, and love lie the resources that fulfill the life of the individual and the life of the community; indeed, the resources that would redeem our troubled world and bring it lasting peace. Children must be safeguarded and reared. Only in the home can children be assured of the love and direction they need to live life, and only parents who genuinely love can meet those needs. But it must be more than a preached or pronounced love; it must be love that takes time, makes the effort, listens patiently, gives freely, forgives generously, “provides the amenities that will grace and adorn and make beautiful the relationships of family life.”</p>

I know them to be true because I have experienced them, I have lived them, I have been there.</p>

I hope and pray that our happy home has done as well. Of course, I have said what I have said today in part for myself and our own family, for we still have the privilege and blessing of seeking to improve. I am grateful to thank the Lord for that. I do not know a greater accolade in this life, and believe there is none, than a note from a six-year-old who writes: “Guess what, Mom, I love you,” or a teenager’s gracious gift: “Dad, you are my friend and I will love you forever,” or from a dad or mom to a choice son or daughter: “I love you. I am proud of you.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/love-unconditional.p2" guid="8b4c90a1-474d-4ec3-92b5-4a227646e7dd" pid="0ebUvuAddEWU6Ds4etlhtA" hash="UjkCSg">The story, Brother Stapley, was mythical. It was reportedly the statement of a man who golfed with you and Brother Tanner and who, when he came back, said, “Have you ever played golf and been the <span class="emphasis">only one rained on?” </span>I can testify to you that Brother Stapley gets rained on, and was snowed on two days ago, as I observed. As we went from the place where he had snow deposited on him from a tree limb, just as we came out from a meeting into that beautiful storm, I drove up streets that were littered with limbs of magnificent trees. I was fearful of what I would find when I got home, and my apprehensions were justified. Some of our lovely trees were broken. In our backyard a fence we had built to protect the neighbors while our children grew up was flattened. And I would like to tell you something serious and truthful. I haven’t worried a minute about that. I have been thinking about tonight and what we are here discussing.</p>

I read again with joy what Alma the prophet wrote about some people who were far from the fold, who had once been in. He took three of the sons of Mosiah, two of his own sons, and two other converts and went to teach the Zoramites, who are described as having fallen into great error, for “they would not observe to keep the commandments of God, and his statutes. … Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation. Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and his brethren went into the land to preach the word unto them.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.9-11" class="scriptureRef">Alma 31:9–11</a>.)</p>

Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them are our brethren [I suppose we might parenthetically assume he was thinking that many of them are the wives and children of our brethren now and in the future]; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.34-35" class="scriptureRef">Alma 31:34–35</a>.)</p>

In the <span class="emphasis">Documentary History of the Church </span>(vol. 5, pp. 320–21) is “A Short Sketch of the Rise of the ‘Young Gentlemen and Ladies Relief Society’ from the <span class="emphasis">Times and Seasons.” </span>You will observe, as the annotator says, that this has more to do with youth than with the Relief Society, but that was the heading.</p>

Kimball [you realize that the Prophet Joseph Smith is writing this] who warned them against the various temptations to which youth is exposed, and gave an appointment expressly for the young at the house of Elder Billings; and another meeting was held in the ensuing week, at Brother Farr’s school-room, which was filled to overflowing. Elder Kimball delivered addresses, exhorting the young people to study the scriptures, and enable themselves to ‘give a reason for the hope within them,’ and to be ready to go on to the stage of action, when their present instructors and leaders had gone behind the scenes; also to keep good company and to keep pure and unspotted from the world.”</p>

I advised them to organize themselves into a society for the relief of the poor, and recommended to them a poor lame English brother … who wanted a house built, that he might have a home amongst the Saints; that he had gathered a few materials for the purpose, but was unable to use them, and he has petitioned for aid. I advised them to choose a committee to collect funds for this purpose, and perform this charitable act as soon as the weather permitted. I gave them such advice as I deemed was calculated to guide their conduct through life and prepare them for a glorious eternity.”</p>

They are about the same, motivated with about the same sense of their need, and certainly by the same spirit that directed those of old. This statement of the Prophet moved me because I have had that same feeling when I have stood before them. As a teacher for years, I have pondered their future as I taught them, and I have lived long enough to see the fulfillment of my fondest hopes, or the beginning of the fulfillment of them, for many of them, and, I am sorry to say, the realization of some of my apprehensions. They are, in fact, a great and remarkable generation, yet like many of you I am well aware of the major problems confronting all of our young people, and that many of them desperately need help.</p>

It is just a few days ago that I deplaned at a major airport, met some of you leaders there, and a beautiful young college-age lady who was waiting for me. She had left her home against the wishes of her parents and others and had hitchhiked to a rock festival. On her way home from that adventure, hitchhiking now with a male companion, she was picked up by officers of the law, arrested for possession of drugs, tried, and sentenced to five years in prison. Through the intervention of our local brethren, who were reached by a distraught mother through the bishop, she was given parole freedom, but the record has been made and her life is hanging in the balance. She has some decisions to make.</p>

Three times the words are repeated, “Please help me.” Within hours there has been a call, another call, from a disturbed young man seeking guidance for his friend who questions a Church position which he feels he cannot accept, which he thinks makes his position in the Church tenuous or untenable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/love-unconditional.p14" guid="ac758347-109b-475f-994f-79e9276c2971" pid="ACrnm1UtlEaWEXvqkmuDWg" hash="yNj6WQ">In my hand I hold a letter received two days ago from a faithful, brokenhearted father whose son, about the same age as the others, took his own life, notwithstanding the efforts of loving parents and a fine, wholesome family. I wish there were time to read a description of how hard these marvelous parents have tried. This is a missionary family, a committed family, a stay-together family; yet this boy, convinced of his own worthlessness, that he was a failure and that the mistakes he had made were disqualifying, took his own life. His father sent a copy of the note he left, and asked me to make such use of his letter and this letter as judgment and my feelings suggested.</p>

How can we help this great young generation meet the challenges of their time? I am certain that we must thoughtfully examine not only their needs and their problems, and what we have to give them, but <span class="emphasis">how </span>we undertake to give it, and what we appear to them <span class="emphasis">to be </span>as they observe it. I have been rethinking my own experience and will give you just an example or two quickly. May I do it in the spirit of a statement that to me for a long time has been very choice: “Neither laugh nor weep, nor loathe, but understand.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/love-unconditional.p16" guid="249b9351-0e9d-40ca-9f37-34a7fb2899e0" pid="FWD6dzUbjEyWDCuc0aVlVQ" hash="0lZLZA">What are some of their problems? These basic observations have come from experience with youth and from their own lips and lives. I can sum them up in four or five needs.</p>

They need to believe. They need to know the doctrines, the commandments, the principles of the gospel. They need to grow in understanding and conviction. They need to worship and to pray, but they live in a time when all of this is so seriously questioned, when doubt is encouraged.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/love-unconditional.p18" guid="f6705adb-94c2-4827-9a05-3f6319131547" pid="30M3RBUakE6vJd-C2Yov-w" hash="Imgeyg">Two, they need to be accepted as they are, and to be included. They need a family, the most important social unit in this world; and even if they have a good family, they need the supportive influence outside their home of others, of neighbors, of friends, of bishops, of brothers, of human beings.</p>

I think she wouldn’t mind my telling you that after we had laughed and wept and remembered, she was asked to pray. I don’t recall much of her prayer, the tears and the joy and the sweetness, but I remember one thought: she thanked God for the unconditional love she had received. This life doesn’t give one very many chances to feel exultant and a little successful, but I felt wonderful that night, and thank God that she really believes and understands what she said. We cannot, my dear brethren, condition our love by a beard or beads or habits or strange viewpoints. There have to be standards and they must be enforced, but our love must be unconditional.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/love-unconditional.p22" guid="ed4142b3-2a94-435f-ad08-92b0577b036f" pid="qqEbI5O5GUqnCUguEx0skg" hash="xkkYLQ">I read you just a sentence from the letter left by the boy who ended his own life: “I have no hope, only dreams that have died. I was never able to obtain satisfactory interpersonal relationships. I feared the future and a lot of other things. I felt inferior. I have almost no will to achieve, perseverance, or sense of worth, so goodbye. I should have listened to you but I didn’t. I started using acid last summer. It’s purgatory.” What a tragic story!</p>

They need to learn the gospel. They need to be accepted, to be involved, to be loved; and they need, my brethren—my fifth and final point—the example of good men, good parents, good people, who really care.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/love-unconditional.p24" guid="9b4e6d84-1543-4e1e-9ded-510cac199c2a" pid="LLUZ8GkS10e6RDU11mmiPQ" hash="CrS2Qg">I went to the funeral of my cousin a few weeks ago, and I pass on to you something that touched me deeply there. Maybe it is the message I can share with those of us who can do something, if we will, for our great young generation. A man who served as his counselor, now himself the bishop, said of my cousin: “Every boy in his lifetime has the right to know a man like Ivan Frame.”</p>

Amen.</p>

One who comes to mind was a well-dressed, good-looking young man, sharp, well-spoken, and contemporary in every constructive way, but he was obviously deeply distressed as he rose to offer a greeting in behalf of the university student body of which he was president. His audience was made up of regents and trustees of institutions of higher education meeting in conference at his school. The group had listened to a series of speeches from educators, noting with approval the abandonment on college and university campuses of the doctrine of <span class="emphasis">in loco parentis, </span>a term that means, as you may know, “standing in the place of a parent.” The schools, the speakers said, no longer accept the responsibility of standing in the place of a parent to the students who attend them.

Now in many institutions all of this has changed. Revolutionary and rebellious behavior seems to have toned down, but many rules formerly enforced have all but disappeared.</p>

Outside Chattanooga, Tennessee, is a place known as Missionary Ridge. During the Civil War a numerically superior Southern force was dug in on the Ridge, protecting it against Northern attack. The defenders were well fortified and strongly entrenched, holding strategic positions that would seem to make them invulnerable. Yet the hill was lost. Why? The soldiers on Missionary Ridge were so isolated from each other that they had lost touch with each other. They could not hear their leaders through the din. Plainly visible to them were the large numbers of the enemy coming up the hill to attack them. Feeling alone and frightened, a few individual defenders panicked and surrendered and were soon joined by large numbers of their fellows. The battle was lost. They were not cowards; they thought they were alone.</p>

God’s choice young sons and daughters are being subjected to the new social arrangements and pressures currently in vogue. Many are cut off from any supportive roots. They feel alone, abandoned, unloved. Some panic and surrender to the advancing enemy. They sin, and then let their sins become habits. What if they have no place to turn to for refuge, for strength, encouragement, instruction? What if they have no parents to whom they feel they can go for reassurance, forgiveness, unconditional love?</p>

No one of them should ever fall for the false proposition that a human being can have his mind unbraided from his heart, sinews, and spirit—the rest of him conveniently stored away while the mind is disciplined and filled like a silo with grains of knowledge—and then the whole braided together again, with the expectation that the individual will now function in the moral, ethical, spiritually strong way we would like in our teacher or doctor or carpenter or lawyer or banker or son-in-law.</p>

How well are we doing with what we have, with what we know? I am only hours away from a sobering interview with another beautiful young person who has apparently experienced failure of relationship at every level—with family, friends, leaders, teachers, even with God, she felt. She seemed so alone in the presence of great pressures that she surrendered to the enemy for a time. Now she has some help. She has learned that Christ the Lord has the answer; she will be liberated because she is looking to him who is strengthening her in this and all things.</p>

The boy had been blind and for most of his 12 years had lived a sad existence, thought to be uneducable, incapable of learning. Then he was given a chance, thank the Lord, and a marvelous spirit and fine mind were discovered. He told his friend that he had thought all his life that being blind was the worst thing that could happen to one—until he met Campy. Campy was Roy Campanella, great athlete, who at the height of his career was rendered physically helpless in an automobile accident. The blind boy said he had decided after meeting Campy that his condition was worse than not being able to see. “But there is something even worse than that,” he said. He talked of feeling his way down the hall at the hospital, hearing the scuff of feet as people passed him by. “There is something worse than being blind or crippled, and that is to have people not understand you,” he said. “I guess they think that because I am blind I can’t hear or speak either.”</p>

We are never really alone when we love God and accept the friendship of his loving Son.

Envy, arrogance, unrighteous dominion—these canker the soul of one who is guilty of them. It is true also if we fail to forgive. Even if it appears that another may be deserving of our resentment or hatred, none of us can afford to pay the price of resenting or hating, because of what it does to us. If we have felt the gnawing, mordant inroads of these emotions, we know the harm we suffer.</p>

It was then explained that there are two courses of action to follow when one is bitten by a rattlesnake. One may, in anger, fear, or vengefulness, pursue the creature and kill it. Or he may make full haste to get the venom out of his system. If we pursue the latter course we will likely survive, but if we attempt to follow the former, we may not be around long enough to finish it.</p>

Before I left that small community the next day I had a visit from a man who had heard the message and understood it. Later a letter came from him. He had gone home that night and prayed and prepared himself and had then made a visit to the place of a man in his community who had years before imposed upon the sanctity of his home. There had been animosity and revenge in his heart and threats made. That evening when it was made known that he was at the door, his frightened neighbor appeared with a weapon in his hand. The man quickly explained the reasons for his visit, that he had come to say that he was sorry, that he did not want hatred to continue to consume his life. He offered forgiveness and sought forgiveness and went his way in tears, a free man for the first time in years. He left a former adversary also in tears, shaken and repentant.</p>

He said, “I came to ask your forgiveness.

A famous surgeon received a phone call one night from a doctor friend who said he had a young child on the operating table and needed the surgeon’s help in order to save the child. It was a long drive across town to the hospital and the surgeon drove as fast as he could with safety. As he pulled up to a stop sign, a man wearing a brown leather jacket opened the door and slid in beside him with his hand in his pocket as though he had a gun. The man was excited, demanded the surgeon’s car, and obviously was in no mood to discuss it. The surgeon stood helplessly on the highway as the man in the brown leather jacket sped away in his car.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p2" pid="D8Gxp5jFhkiVW43ZDVgVtg" hash="S7wM_w">By the time the surgeon finally arrived at the hospital, it was too late. The child had died only moments before. The other doctor asked the surgeon to come with him to meet the child’s father in the hope that together they might offer him words of comfort. As they entered the waiting room, the father came forward—he was the man in the brown leather jacket.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p3" pid="r7a0murbg0miecThXmKEfQ" hash="9bytCg">It occurs to me to wonder whether any of us here tonight are, in a different sense, men in brown leather jackets, who, through our lack of wisdom, perhaps not knowing it, certainly not wishing it, keep spiritual help from reaching our children when they need it. Or if we are young, we are tempted to follow a course that could damage the children that we will one day have.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p4" pid="ODphvbm-eU-zBQF_zoot7g" hash="6Zo2NQ">This great meeting tonight is not only exciting and encouraging in its evidence of the tremendous priesthood potential in the kingdom of God, it also manifests the capacity of the Church to exercise a powerful influence in helping to meet one of the most vital needs in the world today, and that is supplying models of true manhood for boys who are on their way to becoming men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p5" pid="iHN13cAZ8km-pZp-GPiiJQ" hash="hBVDUA">The absence of fathers from their homes, for one reason or another, and the lack of father-image and influence in the lives of boys are obvious factors in the large troubles that face our society. My firmly-held conviction is that in the homes of the Church, and through priesthood leadership in the Church, the problem is correctable; the challenge can be met, if we will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p6" pid="M_kAznUYt0abfDKoPu8tqA" hash="egleEQ">Only God knows the worth of a boy, but we too are fathers, and we have an inkling. A boy is priceless not only for himself, but every individual is a kind of an omnibus carrying with him all the past that has gone into his making, all the potential in him for influencing the present, and he has, in addition, the sobering reality to face that he carries within himself the seeds of the future. Under every normal circumstance there will be one day those who call him father, and to them and their future he has a great and solemn responsibility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p7" pid="H04ykCOGukiDrIcpZEgTzQ" hash="buplGg">Boys need men to learn from, men to be with who understand their need for activities that are challenging and socially and spiritually constructive and that stretch them and give them a chance to learn manly skills, men to love and who love them, men who are models of what a man ought to be. The father should be the first line of strength, and a boy blessed with such a father is fortunate indeed. But of course even such a family can use all the supportive influence they can get from good men who genuinely care. But what of the boy who has no father, or whose father is not presently supplying what a father uniquely can give? To help him, the Lord has provided what I believe to be the finest program the world has ever known—a program of bishops and counselors, advisers, teachers, Scoutmasters, leaders, home teachers, coaches—strong men who really care. If the Lord’s program is effectively operating, literally no boy in the whole Church should be without the blessing of choice men in his life, and every boy will, in fact, have several good men actively concerned for his well-being. I rejoice in the wonderful ward in which we live and in the great men who are interested in my son and the other lads they lead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p8" pid="hy4mbvTj1UeuDPx0zTolPQ" hash="HZzUkA">Now, it should be said that we have no lack of appreciation for the wonderful influence of mothers and other noble women in guiding boys—and no one in all the world is better qualified than I to understand that—but it takes men to make men. Even mothers cannot do it by themselves, and certainly none should have to undertake the effort alone; nor can schools or other institutions supply the need. Boys need men!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p9" pid="_FYMGKcCTE-lSm724-VElA" hash="pI8ReA">The implications of this for fathers and for men who hold the priesthood are clear indeed. In many homes, in every neighborhood, in every community, in every ward and branch of the Church, there are boys who need the help of men, mothers who need men to help their boys.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p10" pid="jxgL30IIsE6UwwNfOL5p6w" hash="SUXhSg">Is it fair to ask what will happen if boys don’t get what they need from good fathers or conscientious men whose blessing it is to help them? The answer is that they must improvise or learn from other youth as ignorant and inexperienced as themselves. They will learn on street corners or in school corridors where success may be measured in terms of physical, sexual, or economic prowess instead of in terms of character and quality relationships.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p11" pid="Ww51wm2-MUSquDAj7oY1JA" hash="4Z359Q">Now, brethren, if we need to do better than we are doing, and wish to do better, what program shall we follow? There is time here tonight to consider only the beginning of one answer among many, but that is a vital answer, and it needs to be understood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/boys-need-men.p12" pid="DgohXn6itUa6MXVnl6Ldag" hash="z3tzXQ">In chapter 36 of the book of Alma in the Book of Mormon is a remarkable lesson for every father, or for those who stand in place of a father. [<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.title" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36</a>] To his son Helaman, Alma bore a strong testimony of faith and repentance. Remember that Alma, in youthful rebelliousness, had made some serious mistakes. He wanted his sons to avoid those mistakes and to find what he, Alma, had discovered of the tender mercies of God, without the terrible, painful experiences through which he had gone. In this deeply honest account Alma bore record of the torment through which he had passed and shared with Helaman three great messages which every father would want to deliver to his own son. I deliver them tonight to my son and invite you to join me:</p>

Nephi, you will remember, had himself been blessed with marvelous spiritual experiences, but he loved his father so much that, instead of criticizing or taking over, he helped him regain his self-respect and confidence by going to his father and asking Lehi to inquire of God where he, Nephi, should hunt. With that support, the older man found his faith and was again able to lead his people. The story itself is a minor incident in the Book of Mormon, but the lesson is not minor. It is no small thing to reestablish confidence and faith in a man at a critical point in his life when he has failed and is full of self-doubt.</p>

Early in his life, while he was a magistrate, a man was convicted of theft in his courtroom. The young judge felt compelled to impose a sentence of imprisonment. But when the man explained that he had stolen food to feed his impoverished family, the judge suspended the sentence and then levied a fine on every person in the courtroom for living in a city where a man had to steal bread to feed his family.</p>

So he went with sensible people, and did sensible things, and prepared himself, hoping almost beyond hope for the big day. It arrived. He looked out the window of the house and saw the car of his dreams sitting there. It had everything on it which he in his imagination had conceived. He could scarcely contain himself with love and appreciation. He ran from the house, looked it over, and then went back to his dad for the key.</p>

He took the boy into the study and showed him the card. “What do you see on this card?” he said sternly. “Well, Dad, I see three A’s,” the boy said. I suppose a father has to be aware of the C’s and that it is in the nature of the boy to see the A’s. In understanding this, both will be additionally blessed.</p>

He is a little frightened, so I’ll just speak to you for a moment and then I know he’ll be ready.” The father stood by his boy with his arm around him, and in a moment the lad gave his talk.

Jay’s father thus assisted his son from row to row as he passed the sacrament. Jay did a great job as a deacon collecting fast offerings too. His dad carried him from door to door.

The unspoken sermon is heard most clearly and learned most strongly by those near at hand. It is not through definition or diatribe that young men acquire values. “They do not learn ethical principles; they emulate ethical (or unethical) people. They do not analyze or list attributes they wish to develop; they identify with people who seem to have them.” (John Gardner, <span class="emphasis">Self-Renewal,</span> p. 124.) What boys need is not lectures about notions of love, human relationships, or God—but to be exposed to unconditional love, unselfish service, to the reality of God in reverence, and worship, and humble prayer. And that is why they need models of what a man at his best can be. Will you young men, as I sit down, hear these words of Moroni:</p>

There, mingled with the ordinary reports of trouble, were several heart-warming accounts of human concern and unselfishness: a high school group giving hard-earned vacation money to an ill classmate; two workmen suffering serious injury to save the life of a colleague; blood donations oversubscribed for a stricken mother; a noble young follower of Christ giving his life attempting to rescue a companion.</p>

The news media, like history, often emphasizes that which is unusual or sensational. But it was a historian who reminded us that “history as usually written is quite different from history as usually lived. …” If the whole story were told, “we should have a duller but juster view of the past and of man.” Behind what he called “the red facade of war and politics, misfortune and poverty, adultery and divorce, murder and suicide, were millions of orderly homes, devoted marriages,” strong, loving families, and inspiring examples of goodness, courage, and kindness. In our own communities—in our own neighborhoods there are many such instances, unsung and unreported.</p>

And while I’m talking about principles this morning, I am not really thinking in the abstract, but I’m thinking of many noble souls who have met difficulties with courage, like my mother and many others who had little to rely upon—who had little but ingenuity and will and courage and faith. I’m thinking too of a more recent scene—a beautiful young face whiter than the hospital sheet upon which she lay, her sorrowing parents nearby grieving, as a relentless disease consumed her life. Comfort came to them in the quiet knowledge of the nearness of a Savior who himself had not been spared the most keen and intense suffering, who himself had drunk of the bitter cup.</p>

He had gone to the fields to talk with the Lord, to tell him that he had no more material possessions to sell or sacrifice or to use as collateral for borrowing. He needed to know how he could help his daughter go on a mission. The Lord, he said, told him to plant onions. He thought he had misunderstood. Onions would not likely grow in this climate, others were not growing onions, he had no experience growing onions. After wrestling with the Lord for a time, he was again told to plant onions. So he borrowed money, purchased seeds, planted and nurtured and prayed. The elements were tempered, the onion crop prospered. He sold the crop, paid his debts to the bank and the government and the Lord, and put the remainder in an account under her name—enough to supply her wants on a mission.</p>

I have a father just like that.”</p>

The solutions that we wish and pray for do not always come about. The power that remade Paul, that poured in love and washed out hostility and hate, did not save him from the great travails, from Nero’s dungeon or a martyr’s death. Christ lived in him, he said, he had found the peace of God that passed all comprehension. Nothing, not tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword, death, life, angels, principalities, powers, things present, things to come, height, depth, nor any other creature, could separate him from the love of Christ—the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord. Christ died on a cross, and won his victory; his disciples and followers also have been subject to the brute forces and foibles of this world, yet through enduring faith they have shared and will share in that victory.</p>

The ancient prophet learned that the righteous live by faith and that faith is not an easy solution to life’s problems. Faith is confidence and trust in the character and purposes of God.</p>

It will be with us in the fiery furnace and the deep pit. It will accompany us to the hospital room and to the place of bereavement. It can guarantee us the presence of a Captain on the rough voyage. It is, in short, not the path to easy disposition of problems, but the comforting assurance of the eternal light, by which we may see, and the eternal warmth, which we may feel. “The Lord is good: Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/34.8" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 34:8</a>.) In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

They acquire the quality of integrity not so much from pronouncements as from observing and associating with people in whom integrity is the established norm. Young people are apt to imitate what we really are, not what we say we are or even what we may believe we are. No lesson is more important than the example of a life of integrity, of solid honesty, of responsible citizenship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/you-too-must-know.p2" pid="cKr7Lg3DPE2og4xA-bl_3Q" hash="iEZjtA">But this is not to question the vital importance of the privilege we have as parents and adults to share our knowledge and understanding, our deeply held convictions, with our children and others of the young generation, nor does it excuse us from the sacred obligation to do so. The lessons we learned at mother’s knee remain clear and dear to us. The understanding gained from father’s counsel sinks deep in the soul.</p>

From his experiences, good and bad (for he had both, like the rest of us), there were certain crucial convictions which he was anxious to teach. Of three such matters this humble man speaks in a strong and tender testimony to his son Helaman (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.title" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36</a>), and repeats the witness to his other children.</p>

Probably they had not been guilty of killing, but had they been angry with a brother without cause? “It was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.27" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:27</a>).

There was a serenity of spirit and a sweet radiation of peace about her that made me think of parables of lost sheep and coin and son, and the language in them concerning the joy and rejoicing in heaven over “one sinner that repenteth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.7" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:7</a>.)</p>

Playmates had called her names that reflected on her physical condition and caused her pain and tears. When she reached home her father held her in his lap in his big strong arms and wept with her as he explained that he had anticipated that day, and that it would be a crucial one for her, and could be an opportune one if she would learn the lesson that could make her life fruitful and happy. “Sweetheart,” he said, “what the children said about you is true, but it wasn’t fair and it wasn’t kind. You do have a hump on your back and some other serious problems. But that isn’t your fault. It isn’t your parents’ fault or Heavenly Father’s fault. It is one of those things that happen in this yet imperfect world. What the boys and girls said is true, but it wasn’t fair and it wasn’t kind. If all your life you will try to be more fair and more kind to others than some of them may sometimes be to you, then you will be happy, and your life will be full and useful.”</p>

He taught these principles with courage and compassion perhaps never excelled. Himself the son of the great prophet, he and other youthful companions were guilty of serious sins. Through angelic intervention, they were turned to a better way; and Alma, repentant and restored, became a strong leader for the Lord. “Wickedness never was happiness”—he declared, and gratefully testified also of the “plan of mercy” that brings forgiveness to the truly penitent (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.10,15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:10, 15</a>). As the leader of his people he was uncompromising in defense of righteousness, and warm and compassionate with those who had repented and turned from unrighteousness. With his own children, including one son who had been guilty of serious moral error, he shared the anguish that follows transgression and the unspeakable joy that accompanies repentance and forgiveness:</p>

The harmless action involved was the result of a misunderstanding for which the young man had sincerely apologized. I was fully satisfied with the resolution. My friend was not. He insisted on some form of punishment, public punishment, that assured humiliation. The young man must pay, and I must see to it.</p>

His position was that justice demands payment and that mercy cannot rob justice. I agreed and reminded him that the words he had quoted came from a Book of Mormon incident wherein a choice servant of God, who early in his life had desperately needed mercy had received it, and was now teaching an unrepentant son who was seeking to justify his own serious sin. Alma, the father, taught Corianton the meaning and consequences of the Atonement, in the course of which, acknowledging the place of justice, he three times testified of God’s “plan of mercy,” brought about through Christ’s holy gift.</p>

So many are burdened with earthly care, the stain of sin, poverty, pain, disability, loneliness, bereavement, rejection. The promise of Christ’s mercy is sure and certain to those who find him and trust him. He who stilled the winds and waves can bring peace to the sinner and to the suffering saint. And we as his agents are not alone to declare his word, but to represent him in doing unto the least of his brethren that which he himself would do were he now here.</p>

She had been viciously violated to the point where she had vowed never to speak again in this depraved world. It was her way of protesting against the wickedness imposed upon her and countless others. For more than five years she spoke not a word. Then one day she came into the influence of some of our Church representatives who are performing daily miracles of love in several refugee camps. They had no medical magic, these selfless young ladies representing us there, no professional competence to deal with a tortured mind and spirit. They prayed for her, took her hand, and spoke words of love to her; and she answered! For the first time in five years she spoke, and she has been speaking since. The Spirit of him who said, “Peace be still” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/4.39" class="scriptureRef">Mark 4:39</a>), reached out through faithful instruments, touched the storm center of a troubled soul, stilled the winds and waves of torment, and brought faith and hope again.</p>

Every line would be jammed and every telephone booth besieged by people trying to reach someone to say “I love you.” There would be other messages also. “I’m so sorry,” would be one of them, or “How foolish I have been.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p6" pid="885W_vhDCEeflyfefVsKtA" hash="4azVGg">The condition of the world about us assures us that the unthinkable could happen; but it is not of such a cataclysm that I am thinking, but of our daily walk and our everyday relationships. They who love should manifest their love while there is a chance to do so. If we are waiting for some later time, some period when all imperfections are corrected and when all frustrations pass away, we are not wise. Resentment or pride or selfishness or impatience can lead us to miss what life is meant to be, and can be, and is for those who love and serve. To postpone loving and giving until some time of perfect freedom from distress or discomfort is a great mistake; it will not happen. It is not for this world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p7" pid="UE9q0-DsYEi1-zgXfoCG0Q" hash="qGuB7w">But we should be earnestly seeking and striving to correct and improve our own attitude and our own behavior. God has so ordained it. He loves us and believes in us and has done and will do anything he can to help us, but he will not impose on our free agency. “We love him,” says the scripture, “because he first loved us.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 4:19</a>.) He does not love us because we love him; he loves us unconditionally. But his love does not take the course of negating or smothering our privilege to choose, or our responsibility to account for what we choose and to experience the consequences. Indeed, it is written that he weeps for the bad judgment of some of his willful and disobedient children:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p8" pid="o3BM5TkjB0ebXpPG_noniA" hash="rMlueg">“Behold these thy brethren … are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.32" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p9" pid="TTokEvq110arXSbOlfdViQ" hash="JlnuEQ">“And … the God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people, and he wept.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.28" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p10" pid="Z-qt1VxDBUKUEPIUuixlKQ" hash="KH2JOQ">We had that agency with God before this world was. In the heavenly council of which the scriptures teach, there was another plan than God’s presented: Lucifer was permitted to offer his program. It is vital for us in our leadership and our relationships to remember that God so loved that he would not shield us from the perils of freedom, from the right and responsibility to choose. So deep is his love and so precious that principle that he, who was conscious of the consequences, required that we choose. Lucifer had no love in his heart, no real concept of freedom or respect for it. He had no confidence in the principle or in us. He argued for forced salvation, for imposed survival, for an agencyless round trip to the earth and back again. None would be lost, he insisted. But he seemed not to understand that none would be any wiser, either, or any stronger or more compassionate or humble or grateful or more creative, under his plan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p11" pid="nY8mMKRQckWipJ_USLuaGQ" hash="cPhraw">We understood before we left that premortal state that freedom is precarious, difficult. We knew that to love would make us vulnerable to heartbreak and pain and disappointment. But we had learned that the alternatives to love and freedom of choice cannot provide the climate for growth and creative capacity that can eventually lead us to a stewardship like our Father’s. The unselfish love of our Father’s Firstborn in the spirit helped us understand when he, knowing the personal cost ahead for him but also the eternal significance for all of us, volunteered for his role of redemption.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p12" pid="qEJZz10ek0efn5ehTEuNcw" hash="26it3w">We chose then, and we are, in consequence, on this earth still choosing.</p>

She had never known a true family of her own. She had experienced many temporary homes, made many mistakes, had much heartache and hopelessness. Then an older Church couple found her, and loved her, and taught her. Her prepared talk was witty and interesting, but when she laid it down and bore witness through tears, it became magic:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p14" pid="j71urDWfe0WBdkFelxs5AA" hash="uWJ76A">“No one ever helped me to understand that I was worth anything,” she said, “that I was special in any way. And then the missionaries taught me about Jesus Christ and his love and the God who sent him. They taught me that Jesus died for me—for <span class="emphasis">me.</span> I am valuable! I am valuable! He died for me.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p15" pid="fYABGK4QEUugPllYgeXP6A" hash="MLtv7A">The lesson of God’s great love and wisdom seems lost on many who are on this earth because of their choice but we do not understand. Our responsibility is to help them. But we must ourselves pray and strive earnestly that we do not obscure its meaning. If we do not really love and really believe in free agency, we may be inclined to impose our will on others for what we think is their best good. If we love enough, we will not do that, even at the risk of failure. Instruction and rules and training and discipline are essential, of course. From our Father’s example of godly love and patience, we should be motivated to stretch to any lengths to teach, to persuade, to encourage, to help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p16" pid="fSq5AKlrp06Mo-D0TBzulQ" hash="X583QA">But in matters of conscience and faith, if we truly love we will never seek to impose our will and deprive others of their agency. That is, after all, Satan’s way. He is still permitted in this world to pursue his own rebellious approach. Since his encounter with earth’s first family, he has waged war unceasingly upon God’s children.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/agency-and-love.p39" pid="v6uDF8Z0fk-aLZJ-Mm7E3A" hash="tVPbuw">About the time of his anticipated arrival home, I telephoned. There was a brief delay, then the sound of my wife’s voice, quiet and subdued. “Your four sons-in-law are standing around your son administering to him,” she said. “Paul has anointed him, and John is about to give him a blessing. He was worried because you’re not here. This will be the first administration he’s had from anyone but his father—but he’s comforted now.” I joined them in that prayer of blessing on my knees in a lonely hotel room half a world away, a room suddenly made sweet and warm.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="eWnL-G0T2kuWsErdbZl6rQ" hash="SRs6nw">Honorable marriage is approved of the Lord. Indeed, the scriptures teach that “marriage is ordained of God” for His children (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 49:15</a>), and also “whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/eccl/3.14" class="scriptureRef">Eccl. 3:14</a>.) His way of everlasting marriage is filled with hope and promise, and is designed to lead to happiness here and to an eternal stewardship like that of God himself.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="gA9oAhBq1EqhCD6PWAmX4g" hash="ML_7Fg">In the beginning, after the earth was prepared, God brought man and woman together in the Garden, and the first wedding occurred. They were not yet subject to mortal death, and no time limitations were placed upon their marriage. God declared, “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/2.24" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 2:24</a>.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="f9eDOE98JUeFeYEZU1vU4w" hash="Du-f0g">When Christ lived on the earth, He quoted this commandment and added, “What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.4-6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 19:4–6</a>.) He gave His disciples power to bind in heaven that which is bound on earth. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.18" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:18</a>.) Paul declared that “neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 11:11</a>.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="gUrEuknEl0WenGztFwgNsg" hash="o9qjaA">When the gospel was restored there came a renewed understanding of temples and temple worship. The power to bind and seal on earth and in heaven has again been entrusted to authorized servants of God. Eternal marriage, marriage of highest promise, is again performed for time and for all eternity by qualified officiators in the holy temples of the Lord.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="lhiSc9-FUU2MDXFr40Q6eQ" hash="jn_TKA">But a marriage designed to last forever will be a good marriage, growing and gracious. Sometimes the distinctive elements of temple marriage are thought of as being exclusive in duration and authority. Of course, everyone who comes to the temple to be married understands that the ceremony is performed by God’s authority for time and eternity. But the remarkable revealed ceremony at the altar in a temple contemplates <span class="emphasis">much more</span> than this. The quality of the relationship thus established is of highest importance. Wonderful promises are sealed upon a man and woman in temple marriage, and the realization of the promised blessings is related directly to their understanding and keeping the solemn commitments they make to each other and the Lord.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="-H3eHhHRD06ozjONLYt0qQ" hash="lP0kFg">Those commitments in a temple are total and permanent—involving the whole person, <span class="emphasis">as is,</span> for the whole journey. Neither will remain as he or she is, of course; they will both grow and develop in a multitude of ways. But this marriage ceremony is without condition or reservation, save only the faithfulness of those who make it. On this solid foundation the newly formed family joyfully undertakes to learn how to live happily forever, to build a strong and loving union that will grow more wholesome and more glorious everlastingly. How do we ensure success in such a vital and great undertaking?</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="RV8swwSPBU2a7H3v9ZvpnA" hash="0hYRhg">Many new and enduring relationships spring into being with marriage—relationships all of which are vital to the happiness of the family.</p>

Whether in the same room or a world apart, they are married twenty-four hours a day. They care about the whole person, the whole future of each other. With good humor and good disposition and genuine consideration of the needs of the other, they set out to <span class="emphasis">make</span> it a happy life. They laugh a lot and cry a little. They are warm and considerate and thoughtful: the note, the telephone call, the kind word, the sensitive response, the excitement of heading home to her, of having him come home.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="6NCvPzAip0GKmGxR16sMdg" hash="jYxKeQ">Married people are <span class="emphasis">sweethearts,</span> in a special creative union, blessed with that powerful chemistry that draws two together, sometimes from next door, sometimes from a world away. This divinely designed power must be sustained by other qualities—by respect and loyalty and integrity—to be what it is meant to be. To be able to give oneself fully with confidence and trust, and to fully receive the other joyfully and gratefully—this is a blessing that grows in meaning year by year and forever.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="AJqOr0PTWE-L_HZKUL5LRg" hash="I75p6w">In six sad words, a brokenhearted wife years ago summed up the disintegration of a marriage and the foolishness of believing that the physical union can stand alone—is enough without kindness and consideration and other essential qualities. She said, “We have nothing left to express.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="ZWjkcdOtgU6pTip5pv4kag" hash="d9YnoQ">And married people should be <span class="emphasis">best friends;</span> no relationship on earth needs friendship as much as marriage.</p>

It was written in 1848 in Honeycreek, Missouri, to her husband’s mother and sister in England. He had died on the sailing vessel en route, leaving her and the two boys to make their way west with the Saints, heartsick and alone. She wrote the letter that changed my life a little. Maybe it will yours.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="S1bI-vecqkCUIWemW1JTXA" hash="tq-0mA">She began, “Dear Mother and dear Hannah, your dearly beloved son and my best friend has gone the way of all the earth. Dearer to me in life than life itself, he’s gone. Oh Mother, Mother, what am I to do?”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="8t_1PkeJlEGE4_Zc-Q8BjQ" hash="YbbRtQ">And then she told of her love for this, her <span class="emphasis">best friend,</span> and that she would rear these two boys in the kingdom and in his image and in the admonition of the Lord.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="RKtgKUaazkCxIHP8d9nLCA" hash="drIZ2Q">Friendship in a marriage is so important. It blows away the chaff and takes the kernel, rejoices in the uniqueness of the other, listens patiently, gives generously, forgives freely. Friendship will motivate one to cross the room one day and say, “I’m sorry; I didn’t mean that.” It will not pretend perfection nor demand it. It will not insist that both respond exactly the same in every thought and feeling, but it will bring to the union honesty, integrity. There will be repentance and forgiveness in every marriage—every good marriage—and respect and trust.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="mRD2riCNQU-a7gPtM2eW5Q" hash="JHbO1Q">And all these and other elements we are not able to mention eloquently declare that such a union doesn’t just <span class="emphasis">happen.</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="eMBrBnBO9U2x0bcq6IblTA" hash="EDwQ_g">So the need becomes clear for careful, thoughtful preparation, selection, and courtship. No one should be unwise enough to count on an across-the-crowded-room romanticized live-happily- ever-after marriage made without proper thoughtfulness, preparation, and prayer. Marriage is an everyday and every-way relationship in which honesty and character and shared convictions and objectives and views about finances and family and life-style are more important than moonlight and music and an attractive profile.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="04huouqaUEqiUay32zbymg" hash="RTfywQ">The surest basis for all of this is to be worthily married in the temple. But temple marriage is not an isolated ordinance. It serves both as a culmination of other ordinances and the foundation for family and the eternal future.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="jrQ3oDFogkSaoy-ILRne1A" hash="3SWzvA">Perhaps some of you young men do not know that no one can enter into a temple marriage until he or she has been to the temple previously to receive his or her own blessings. Two who desire an eternal marriage cannot establish that relationship until each has personally made sacred covenants with the Lord. These covenants center in principles that are basic in a truly Christian life and in the foundation of a good marriage and family.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="b6tRe9PwU02f4dE-JxCHGg" hash="ChsCHQ">You see, the covenants we make in the temple, like the other sacred ordinances in the kingdom, relate us to and center in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="j589Gg57CkOjXc1HatFstg" hash="5rQQxw">In the temple we make commitments to follow Him in doing God’s will and keeping His commandments, in valuing others and in unselfishly serving, in loving God and our fellowmen. Sexual purity and complete fidelity to moral principle are promised, with a sense of self-worth and self-control and whole-souled devotion to the cause of righteousness and truth.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="RvzkZqsDcEywCTsDkNu84Q" hash="oK_gnw">All of this happens through the priesthood, the Holy Priesthood after the Order of the Son of God. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.1-3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:1–3</a>.) A thoughtful understanding of this should automatically eliminate any false perceptions of superiority or inferiority. Men and women are of equal value before God and must be equally valuable in the eyes of each other. A true devotion to following the example of the Son of God will never permit notions of domination or dictatorship or possession or control. It will never justify unrighteousness or abuse or filth or discourtesy. Christ’s way is the way of persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, love unfeigned. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41-44" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:41–44</a>.)</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="4IQeq9-TZEeAOvfZp3HIwA" hash="QwhFXg">It is simple to see, isn’t it, that the kind of marriage we’re talking about doesn’t just happen? The foundation is laid in the House of the Lord. The marriage is pronounced by authority of God. And then it is fashioned by two who are wholesome, prepared emotionally and practically, and who are honest. It requires being <span class="emphasis">ready</span> to go to a temple, being mature enough to make promises and keep them and to receive holy promises and qualify for them.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="-ohXs3ZNnUmK1eB39-KrYQ" hash="PUD7Lg">So wherever we are with respect to marriage—years from it, close to it, or deeply committed in it—we must be wise, be faithful to the commandments of God, be true. Marriage is the closest and most intimate relationship one makes in this life, and the most serious and sacred decision. If you haven’t been to the Lord’s house, get ready, be clean, prepare to come to establish the foundation for a special, happy, eternal marriage.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="zJcjrLGcT06DPaCG53NOtg" hash="AKAUwA">And the inspiration for all of this is the sweet assurance—deeply rooted in the heart of every decent man who is living as he should with his sweetheart wife, or who has so lived, or who is planning and preparing such a union—that heaven will be heaven for us because we know we will be there with the one we love the best. Parley P. Pratt said after he met the Prophet in Philadelphia that “it was from him that I learned that the wife of my bosom might be secured to me for time and all eternity; and that the refined sympathies and affections which endeared us to each other emanated from the foundation of divine eternal love. It was from the Prophet that I learned that we might cultivate these affections, and grow and increase in the same to all eternity.” (<span class="emphasis">Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, pp. 297–98.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/eternal-marriage.p" pid="QJp3g572qU-x5SssyfO6zA" hash="GCasyA">We sat in a room the other night with our five children and their eternal partners, and with their sixteen children. Twenty-eight of us joined in a circle of affection and appreciation. That circle, established with the two of us in a holy house of the Lord only a few short years ago, has expanded miraculously. Our last child was born twenty-four years ago, but the circle continues to expand and grow. God being willing, we may live to see another generation of wonderful children entering the world. We are grateful to know that our family will relate with us eternally, even as we will with those who gave us mortal life, and all of us together will find a loving place ultimately and a continuing relationship under the holy influence of Him whose spirit children we are and of Him whose holy sacrifice brought us the blessings of eternal life. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In the constructive spirit of that directive, I desire to bear my testimony this morning about the vital effect in our lives and the lives of others of the day-by-day decisions all of us are making—and where we can find help in making them.</p>

We didn’t really ever intend those consequences, but we followed the paths that led to them. “He who chooses the beginning of a road chooses the place it leads to,” he said. “He who picks up one end of a stick, picks up the other.” And it is not only our own course we are affecting when we choose the beginning of a road; we inevitably travel with others, and sometimes we bring anguish and distress to those we love and to other innocent persons.</p>

The ancient Psalmist surely seems to be singing to our time: “Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/31.9" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 31:9</a>).</p>

Opposition, tribulation, afflictions, the refining fire are part of the eternal plan.</p>

But much of the pain we suffer and inevitably impose upon others is self-induced through our own bad judgment, through poor choices. Where can we look for help?</p>

Some of us have perhaps experienced a measure of the deep disappointment he felt because of Israel’s rebelliousness when he declared that “the good man is perished out of the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/micah/7.2" class="scriptureRef">Micah 7:2</a>). He spoke of princes and judges asking for rewards, and of great men uttering “mischievous desires” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/micah/7.3" class="scriptureRef">Micah 7:3</a>). For Micah, the source of help was clear and sure: “Therefore I will look unto the Lord,” he said. “I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/micah/7.7" class="scriptureRef">Micah 7:7</a>).</p>

Other prophets have similarly spoken.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/i-will-look-unto-the-lord.p11" pid="0VfWpLADXkqAHulSqQECCQ" hash="CCdTiA">Does this mean that we may never have confidence in the integrity of others? Must we never trust parents or friends or caring counselors or humble servants of God? This is obviously not the meaning of the scriptures, which themselves are the record of revelation and inspired instruction; what they are emphasizing is the <span class="emphasis">care</span> we must exercise in <span class="emphasis">choosing</span> counsel or example.</p>

A, p. 9). And a columnist, in quoting her, added an interesting line: “Our society still sanctions the use of alcohol. There is really no more dangerous drug—and certainly none that has done more damage or wrecked more lives over the years—than alcohol” (Sperling, <span class="emphasis">Deseret News, </span>24 Sept. 1986, p. A9).</p>

There is great power in trust and love, and, of course, we must learn to trust because our confidence in the integrity of man supports our confidence in God. Yet, in matters of lasting importance, one must not rely only on “the arm of flesh” at the expense of looking to the Lord in scripture and in prayer.</p>

These associates had life-styles and a view of values that were far removed from those to which this choice lad was accustomed. Gradually, the circumstances and the daily pressures began to take their toll on a not yet fully stable young man.</p>

In his immaturity, he rebelliously chose the beginning of a road without thinking where that road would lead him. The place at which he arrived in the next few hours was one which he would never in his right mind have chosen.</p>

I cannot forget his tearful anguish as he awaited his ordeal. He could not even remember anything of the most serious of the tragedies that had occurred to him. All he could recall was lifting a glass they pressed on him, not knowing that they had drugged the drink, and then all was blank. They had proceeded to take him on their rounds with them.</p>

For him, in his life and teachings, it was not an option. Indeed, he declared that without it one could not qualify for the greatest of eternal blessings—eternal life (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.31-46" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:31–46</a>). The scriptures consistently so teach—acts of Christian service are expressions of Christian love. My observation and experience confirm the truth of it for me.</p>

It is not principles and ordinances or missionary work or leadership as an end in themselves. It is manifested by the kind of people we are, by our relationship with our Heavenly Father and his Son and all of the commandments, by the measure in which we qualify for the approval of our own Spirit-guided conscience, and by the way we treat other people.</p>

And it is sad to think that some may, in a joyless version of “the gospel,” miss the special blessings awaiting on the path established by our Savior and leading to the <span class="emphasis">highest</span> joy through Christian service and sacrifice. An ancient rabbinical aphorism comes to mind: “God will hold us responsible for all the wonderful things on earth that we refused to enjoy.”</p>

It is an inevitable element of mortality, and all of us have some share in it ultimately. But our religion, centering in the life and mission of the Lord Jesus Christ, helps us comprehend that. God and Christ love us with a mature, perfect love. The plan by which they lead requires mortal instruments of their love. We have the great honor to be invited to be such instruments. We need them, but they also need us. In this service we find the roots of most of those blessings that God wants us to enjoy.</p>

These birth difficulties, he had assured her, were no one’s fault—they were the consequence of problems not yet solved in this imperfect and sometimes unfair world. “But,” said he, “if you will always be more fair and more kind to others than a few of them may sometimes be to you, you will enjoy every sweet blessing life affords.”</p>

To those who so serve he promised eternal life (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.46" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:46</a>), while to those who fail to minister to the needy he said, “Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.45" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:45</a>.)</p>

Thereafter, I received a special letter from a wonderful mother who, with her husband, a bishop, had accompanied their fourteen-year-old son, with some of his friends, to the meeting. These are the last few words of her letter:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/changing-channels.p2" pid="LmbcVXq1hk2JGiH-S24VIQ" hash="3TvDjA">“Please accept my thanks. … You spoke seriously to a group of youth who are used to being told how wonderful they are. They <span class="emphasis">are</span> wonderful, but they needed to do some heavy thinking for a change. You helped them do that. Thank you!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/changing-channels.p3" pid="TH3jw5kyKkme4cx5ou4dJQ" hash="RuSjEw">I was pleased that the meeting had encouraged some serious thinking and consideration among at least some of those present. We referred, as we began, to the aimless habit some of us have of channel-hopping or dial-switching as we sit in front of a television set or radio, and suggested that in preparation, I had done a similar kind of searching through my memory and notes. I was seeking to select, out of many observations and experiences and thoughts, a few that might make a difference to those who were seriously listening and might thereafter think about what they had heard. I would like to do the same with you in these few moments this evening.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/changing-channels.p4" pid="Pv9adt1gA0WaXxDdp0Fr0A" hash="ibSRHA">A picture forms on my monitor involving a father aboard an airplane on a short business trip. He has with him his five-year-old son and is almost wishing his son were not there because it is a very rough trip. There are downdrafts and updrafts and head winds alternating with tail winds, and some passengers are feeling a bit queasy. Apprehensively, the father glances at his son and finds him grinning from ear to ear. “Dad,” he says, “do they do this just to make it fun for the kids?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/changing-channels.p5" pid="skQsWGFFv0yfAXlUeWPFRg" hash="KJtBPA">Good parents and family and leaders and friends do go to great lengths to make it fun for the kids, but the fun they are thinking of is wholesome fun; it hurts no one, and it lifts the spirit and is good to remember tomorrow and through a lifetime and forever. It never detracts from the real, long-term joy we came into this world to experience.</p>

Says Lehi, “I have spoken these few words unto you … in the last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part, according to the words of the prophet. And I have none other object save it be the everlasting welfare of your souls.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.30" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:30</a>.)</p>

They are central principles of the gospel, encompassing “all the law and the prophets” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:40</a>), as Jesus said of the commandments to love God and love our neighbor, and they emphasize the individual responsibility and accountability in our choices with respect to all other virtues and values (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.36-40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:36–40</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/changing-channels.p9" pid="j9fpoOtcA0eX92qO5aXemg" hash="PDgaEA">The Bible teaches us that “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16</a>.) The Doctrine and Covenants teaches that “Jesus Christ your Redeemer … so loved the world that he gave his own life.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/34.1,3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 34:1, 3</a>.)</p>

John wrote: “My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/3.18" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 3:18</a>.)</p>

Decency and honor and unselfishness, good manners and good taste are expected of us. What really matters, after all, is what kind of people we are and <span class="emphasis">that</span> we are daily, hourly, deciding and manifesting. Jesus said, “Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up—that which ye have seen me do.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.24" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 18:24</a>.)</p>

A grieving young father and his two children sit before a television set in their home after a makeshift dinner. The children have been staying with Grandmother while their mother has slowly slipped away in a lingering illness; now they and their father are home again after her funeral. The little girl drops off to sleep and is carried to her bed. The little boy fights off sleepiness until he finally asks his father if tonight, just tonight, he can sleep with him in his bed. As the two lie silently in the dark, the lad speaks: “Daddy, are you looking at me?” “Yes, son,” the father replies, “I am looking at you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/changing-channels.p16" pid="6dFhF9cr0kG9iWfHqW_mHw" hash="-V4o4w">The boy sighs and, exhausted, sleeps. The father waits a time and then, weeping, cries out in the dark, in anxious anguish: “God, are you looking at me? If you are, maybe I can make it. Without you, I know I can’t.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/changing-channels.p17" pid="Keo8Xf3YT0mkfqXg7U2j6w" hash="f-SgHA">Our Heavenly Father <span class="emphasis">is</span> looking at us. He loves us and he wants us to choose the path that leads us to happiness here and eternal life hereafter. In his plan he authorizes us to act for him, to be instruments of his concern for his children. But he won’t force any of us to make choices that lead to happiness. He has given each of us the right and responsibility to make personal choices, individual decisions, and has made us accountable for them. He not only affects our lives, he is affected by our lives, and sometimes he weeps for us.</p>

He and his dad and Tom and his dad are going snowmobiling and shooting tomorrow morning, and they want to know if I can go with them.” The mother seems startled at the question and uncertain as she answers. (Later, she explains that she was strongly tempted to respond sharply to her boy, reminding him that he had duties on Sunday morning, that in their family they went to church together, and that when Dad returned later that night he would not consider such a thing.) But instead, she says to her son, “Richard, you are twelve years old. You hold the priesthood. You are president of the deacons quorum. I am sure Dad would want you to make up your own mind and answer Bob yourself.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/changing-channels.p22" pid="Ogx5Nm7vNU-_-reZpNB3sg" hash="o9peyw">The boy goes back to the telephone, and the mother goes to her room and prays that their son will give the right answer. Nothing more is said about the matter, and on Sunday morning the lad and his parents go into town to church, park in the lot across the street, and are crossing, arm-in-arm, when a pickup truck passes. Two men and two boys are in the seat, snowmobiles in the truck bed, guns slung in the rear window. The boys wave to Richard as they pass. He pauses a moment and says, “Gee, I wish …” The mother catches her breath a bit, and then Richard finishes: “Gee, I wish I had been able to talk Bob and Tom into coming to priesthood meeting this morning.”</p>

His initial mistakes were understandable; he was young and away from home and friends and familiar standards, and he wanted to be independent. His intentions were not evil, but because he was a little arrogant and proud, he rejected good counsel and let himself be led away by individuals who were described perfectly in the Book of Mormon, thousands of years ago, in their sinful persuasion of others. It is written of them that “they do it for a token of bravery.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.10" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 9:10</a>.)</p>

She said that since her baptism, things had not really materially changed in her own home; there were still abuse and argument and alcohol and foul language. “But,” she said, “there is one room at my house where I can go and shut the door and read the scriptures and listen to good music and pray and feel the Spirit of the Lord.

Three men had their hands on the head of another who sat on a chair. All four were dressed in battle gear; two had returned from air strikes to the north just in time for the meeting, and one was shortly to go.

In that visitors’ center is visible through a wide, beautiful two-story window a Thorvaldsen Christus, carved after the pattern, a replica, of the original, which is in Copenhagen, Denmark, and is well known throughout the world as a classic representation of the Lord Jesus Christ. At the base of that statue are the words in Danish: <span class="emphasis">Kommer Til Mig, </span>“Come unto Me.”</p>

We know that he is “the way, the truth, and the life: [and that] no [one] cometh unto the Father, but by [him].” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.6" class="scriptureRef">John 14:6</a>.)</p>

The Savior taught precepts of spiritual perfection, and he <span class="emphasis">practiced </span>and <span class="emphasis">applied </span>them with perfection. He could with authority declare that he was the light and example the people should follow: “I have set an example for you. … I am the light which ye shall hold up—that which ye have seen me do.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.16,24" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 18:16, 24</a>.)</p>

Matthew also recorded that, as he approached the final events of his earthly ministry, Jesus taught his followers the parable of the sheep and the goats, representing the judgment to come, in which he clearly identified those who will inherit “life eternal” and those who will “go away into everlasting punishment.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.46" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:46</a>.) The key difference was that those who should inherit the kingdom with him had developed the habit of helping, had experienced the joy of giving and the satisfaction of serving—they had responded to the needs of the hungry, thirsty, homeless, the naked, the sick, and those in prison. Well known are his words, the words of comfort to them: “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>), while to those who were condemned to “everlasting punishment” he made the sad pronouncement, “Inasmuch as ye did it <span class="emphasis">not </span>to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.45" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:45</a>; italics added).</p>

Reuben Clark, Jr., in Conference Report, Apr. 1937, p. 22.)</p>

It is the center of our considerations at this conference, of our religion, of our lives. The Book of Mormon declares plainly that “it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:12</a>.)</p>

The Atonement, free gift that it is, requires that the gift be received in the way <span class="emphasis">he </span>prescribed, and he gave us the pattern. John writes that “Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/1.9" class="scriptureRef">Mark 1:9</a>.) The sacred ordinance was confirmed by the Spirit, and the Father spoke from heaven, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 3:17</a>.) As he commenced his public ministry, “Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.17" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:17</a>.) He said to Nicodemus the Pharisee: “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.5" class="scriptureRef">John 3:5</a>; see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.1-9" class="scriptureRef">John 3:1–9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-royal-law.p13" pid="fe4bwhejv0Kfu2FMrGAEpg" hash="Yr2ARw">The scriptures plainly teach that there is more to Christ’s gospel plan than is frequently declared. Peter and the others understood these truths very well. After those at Pentecost had been touched in their hearts by the Spirit and by Peter’s powerful testimony, they said, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.37" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:37</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-royal-law.p14" pid="9eqdouzCn0-tCsW0Fr6lyg" hash="AvWp5w">Peter’s answer was plain and understandable: “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.38" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:38</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-royal-law.p15" pid="4z-ZbvpvoEevSeHvV7PoKw" hash="rAnxZA">President Clark in the statement earlier quoted referred to the vital second mission of Christ—that unselfish work “for the relief of the ills and the sufferings of humanity,” which the Master plainly declared to be as important as the other elements of his message in our qualifying for eternal life. In the Sermon on the Mount and throughout his teachings he made it clear that he and our Father are concerned with <span class="emphasis">what kind of people we are! </span>The sermon concluded, you will remember, with the parable about a house built on a foundation of stone and another built on sand. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.24-27" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:24–27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-royal-law.p16" pid="0cuRUITsekyI9bwqy31UxQ" hash="w7V3RA">Jesus referred repeatedly to the old law by which they had been governed—and then fitted those teachings into the higher and holier context of the law of love he had come to invoke among God’s children. He was not content with the old levels of concept and conduct. He wanted those who were the salt of the earth, the light of the world, to rise to nobler heights than the old law had required: “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, … But I say unto you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.21-22" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:21–22</a>.) He taught them that “except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.20" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:20</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-royal-law.p17" pid="2klddxeGKEG792Gyrg5Y6w" hash="R-0gpg">Then came the direct question: “What do ye more than others?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.47" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:47</a>.) His teachings explain the kind of people we are expected to be, in our relationships not only with the Almighty but with our families and others, and with ourselves.</p>

Jesus said that love of God with heart, soul, and mind is “the first and great commandment” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.38" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:38</a>), and love of neighbor the second like unto it and added, “On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:40</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-royal-law.p19" pid="E4ZETfh1AE2iv6B9O1nMuQ" hash="Ked1fA">The Apostle James called the second great commandment the “royal law” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/2.8" class="scriptureRef">James 2:8</a>), and Paul told the Galatians that “all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 5:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/the-royal-law.p20" pid="WLRkfBk6i0OmBqog92I6zA" hash="1KlKxA">The parable of the good Samaritan supplied the answer to the lawyer’s next question, the one that followed, “And who is my neighbour?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.29" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:29</a>.) The Samaritan alone of three passersby mentioned gave the help he did because that was the kind of man he was. He had acquired the habit of helpfulness through persistent experience helping, noticing needs, and reaching out in response to them.</p>

It is seen in help being offered in compassionate service in every ward and stake in the Church through our Relief Society ladies, Young Women’s and children’s groups, priesthood quorums, home and visiting teachers, Boy Scouts; in the fact that every missionary across the earth, as part of his calling, is committed to regular community service, Christian service. It is seen in the great work of our young representatives in the refugee camps. The Church itself has responded to large-scale needs locally and nationally and internationally, and as Christian individuals and families we are striving to understand and carry out our heaven-mandated responsibilities to “walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another … according to … needs and … wants.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.29" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:29</a>.)</p>

They arranged themselves in choir grouping, some of them literally leaning for support against each other. The sight was one that will linger in memory. Many were blind and many halt and lame. They literally supported each other as they sang hymns of praise and thanksgiving to God.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p2" pid="VLoZxzWE10ikxrj-u8V42Q" hash="g_OAOg">The Bible declares that God is the Father and the God of the spirits of all mankind. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/num/16.22" class="scriptureRef">Num. 16:22</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.9" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:9</a>.) The Apostle Paul taught the people at Athens that we are God’s “offspring” and the Romans that “the Spirit … beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/17.28-29" class="scriptureRef">Acts 17:28–29</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.16-17" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:16–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p3" pid="q1E4O5JjL06Y3-HCu6qvOg" hash="tVV4uA">Because of our Father’s great love for his children and because of his commitment to freedom of choice for them, mankind has from the beginning enjoyed the opportunity to choose for themselves. John declares in the first few verses of his gospel that Christ “was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.9" class="scriptureRef">John 1:9</a>.) Scripture also records that “the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.16" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:16</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.45-46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:45–46</a>.) There is an accompanying significant scripture that explains why not every person walks by the light and why some do not choose good over evil: “The Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that <span class="emphasis">hearkeneth</span> to the voice of the Spirit.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:46</a>; emphasis added.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p4" pid="hTqwP1lZW0ONamxcLCyxbQ" hash="EvfxEg">Our Heavenly Father desires that all mankind be led by the light, but that blessing will not be imposed upon anyone. Christ stands at the door and knocks; those who wish to have him enter and sup with them must hear his voice and “open the door.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/3.20" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 3:20</a>.) Thus two great principles on which the gospel is centered, love and agency, are plainly taught. Each of us is here to learn to love and give and hearken to the Spirit and choose to do the will of the Father. God wants his offspring and heirs to become all that we can be, to qualify for our inheritance. But we must choose; we are the decision makers, and he will not relieve that responsibility. As early as the book of Deuteronomy, it is written:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p5" pid="6w1hWWnXsEOUV4sj-1tSgg" hash="WtcFQQ">“I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; … therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and … obey his voice.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/30.15,19-20" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 30:15, 19–20</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p6" pid="NC0YRHctc0eoWQuVx360QA" hash="MAs5_g">Through the light of the Lord, truth in some measure has reached many avenues and elements and levels of life. It has been a great satisfaction to me to find so much that is so good in so many places and from so many sources. President Joseph F. Smith spoke of the united members of the Godhead as the “fountain of truth” and said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p7" pid="Sryj7GT54ka-uIpBfIX1Lw" hash="_424Ug">“From this fountain all the ancient learned philosophers have received their inspiration and wisdom—from it they have received all their knowledge. If we find truth in broken fragments through the ages, it may be set down as an incontrovertible fact that it originated at the fountain, and was given to philosophers, inventors, patriots, reformers, and prophets by the inspiration of God.” (<span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> June 1907, p. 629.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p8" pid="3DCV1MSM70Ooeq_cDn5BIA" hash="08Tr4g">Earlier and subsequent leaders of the Church have similarly testified. In every field of activity in which I have been involved, I have had the privilege of association with people of character and quality who shared much of value with me. Consider this special example of the wisdom of a beloved Quaker teacher and writer, Rufus Jones, who said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p9" pid="UMWHGfUxzkaDmV0L_R8zOQ" hash="q2X11w">“Vital religion cannot be maintained and preserved on the theory that God dealt with our human race only in the far past ages, and that the Bible is the only evidence we have that our God is a living, revealing, communicating God. If God ever spoke, He is still speaking. He is the great I Am, not the great He Was.” (<span class="emphasis">A Flash of Eternity</span>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p10" pid="feSJstuNskehGlyGXVPm7A" hash="NCPHkw">This is a significant expression of fundamental truth. Our own understanding of that principle is that God communicates with his children, and that he has revealed, does now reveal, and will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to his kingdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p11" pid="HRMn5JqneEi0-2X34z5kPA" hash="0LMXUQ">Jewish tradition helps us further appreciate the nature of our Heavenly Father in the tender practice of the Half Hallels offered at Passover in celebration of the historic exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt and their passing through the Red Sea. When they reached the sea, the pursuing Egyptian armies overtook them. Through Moses, God divided the waters, “And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/14.22" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 14:22</a>.) The Egyptians went in after them. Then Moses stretched his hand again over the sea, and the waters returned. The Israelites were safe, and the Egyptian armies were drowning. Triumphantly the people began to sing hymns of praise to the Lord. But the Almighty stopped them and said, “How can you sing hymns of praise and jubilation when so many of my children are drowning in the sea?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p12" pid="5SNVsXKohEOHeCcH15Q_FA" hash="OB08pw">In remembrance of that event, Jewish people during the latter period of Passover include abridged or shortened psalms of praise, Half Hallels, as part of the celebration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p13" pid="nLLmQpSdoU2f7OIZZynSZA" hash="otvGdQ">Truly, light from the Source has shone through all the world. We rejoice in this and have a humble witness to bear: God <span class="emphasis">is</span> a living, revealing, communicating Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p14" pid="USuXu4EdcEKSlHBLZUqT9A" hash="zDe9-w">When there are joined with the rich resources of ancient prophets and writers in the Bible the supporting and enhancing truths available in the scriptures of the Restoration, those welded treasures bring clarifying light and knowledge to the most important questions mankind has asked through the ages, and now asks, and in the future will continue to ask with increasing concern as populations and interpretations multiply. They deal with the truth about God and Christ and the Holy Spirit—the Godhead; about man himself; about mortal life and its meaning and purposes; and about eternity and its promises.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-loving-communicating-god.p15" pid="GuvD-_-Mk0aSeFPyf1zkXw" hash="541YWg">A significant example of this fuller light is in response to the expanding catalog of concerns that face mankind—individuals, institutions, countries, civilization. The Psalmist thousands of years ago cried, “Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/31.9" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 31:9</a>.) He then spoke of problems, some of which sound strangely familiar to a modern ear. This very hour in our troubled world, calamity and destruction, fear, starvation, and conflict beleaguer the earth; afflictions and adversities burden many lives. Books multiply dealing with personal and family and societal troubles. Often they seem to agree that the right question to ask is not why good people have trials, but how shall good people respond when they are tried? The scriptures help us to answer some important questions:</p>

The Sermon on the Mount speaks to those who mourn, who are poor in spirit, who are reviled and persecuted, who have evil spoken against them, falsely.

Knowing what God has promised can provide the courage and faith we need. We are assured in the scriptures that we may know of a surety that the Lord does visit his people in their afflictions. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.13-14" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 24:13–14</a>.)

With his wife’s ordeal, however, harsh as it was for her and in a measure for her family, his anger sublimated into a closer spiritual relationship with the Lord, and he was able more gracefully to share her burden.</p>

They both wept as he laid his hands on her head and talked with the Lord, “and,” he said, “I felt the spiritual presence of our Father in Heaven.
