      <description>As I thanked Brother Hinckley this morning for his great sermon Sunday, I mentioned a recollection of two men, one of whom had just given a great talk. The other thanked him and commended him and said, “That was a great sermon. I wish I had given it.</description>

      <description>Just before this meeting started, Brother Stapley, with a twinkle in his eye, asked me to answer for a story he heard I had told to the All-Americans at BYU last night; and in keeping with my inward response to Brother Petersen’s great sermon on hone</description>

      <description>The motivation for my preparation this morning came from a recent brief excursion through the pages of the day’s newspapers. There, mingled with the ordinary reports of trouble, were several heart-warming accounts of human concern and unselfishness: </description>

      <description>The poet has supplied a line that will suffice me today, though there is much I would wish to say. “We shall not cease from exploration,” he wrote, “And the end of all our exploring/Will be to arrive where we started/And know the place for the first </description>

      <link>http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1981/10/my-specialty-is-mercy?lang=eng</link>
      <description>My theme today is mercy. The poet wrote that mercy is “twice blest; / It bless[es] him that gives and him that takes,” and added that “earthly power doth then show likest God’s / When mercy seasons justice.” ( act 4, sc. 1, lines 186–87, 96–97.)</description>
