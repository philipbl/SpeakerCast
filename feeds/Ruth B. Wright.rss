As I look at them, I feel the spirit of noble prophets and leaders who made choices to be obedient to the Lord in spite of earthly trials. The examples of their faith, courage, love, humility, service, and endurance sustain me and give me strength to face challenges in my own life.</p>

The stories are familiar, yet the precepts we learn from them may be different each time we read them. The scriptures have the power to speak to our particular situations wherever we are in life. The insights you gain may be entirely different from the ones that I gain, but they all can strengthen us personally.</p>

With complete faith that the Lord would guide him day by day, Lehi turned from the security and comfort of his home in Jerusalem and began his journey in the wilderness facing an unknown future.</p>

I don’t know anything about building a ship. I haven’t had any training!” Instead, he faced his challenge with courage. He said:</p>

Wicked men persecuted them, imprisoned them, and allowed them to suffer great afflictions because they were testifying of the truth. We know that God’s children, since time began, have suffered for righteousness’ sake and will continue to be tried. I gain strength from reading about Alma and Amulek as I endeavor to meet my individual trials.</p>

These young men, who were taught correct principles by their mothers, “were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all—they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.20" class="scriptureRef">Alma 53:20</a>.)</p>

Remembering the example of these faithful young men strengthens me in my effort to be steadfast in obeying gospel principles.</p>

She was physically weakened, emotionally distraught, and spiritually drained. Every day seemed harder for her to face than the day before. She was desperate for comfort. While lying in a hospital bed anticipating an unwanted but necessary surgery, she felt utterly alone. Her thoughts turned to Joseph Smith and his sufferings in Liberty Jail. Then she thought about our Savior, Jesus Christ. She asked her husband to read to her from 3 Nephi. The Nephites had gathered at the temple in the land Bountiful and twice heard a voice they didn’t understand that seemed to come from heaven.</p>

For the first time in months she felt relief. Her fears were calmed. She gained strength to carry on.</p>

Many times we have laughed; cried; shared feelings, hopes, and dreams; sorted out differences; solved the problems of the world; and recognized our strengths and weaknesses into the wee hours of the morning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p2" pid="AJcyJh6DTE6Vj8vs3Vv23A" hash="pyRbKw">I suppose that some of you are asking, “What does the Wright family’s kitchen table have to do with this talk?” Nothing! I just wish we all could be surrounding it right now. It certainly would be more comfortable for me. Then we could reflect with one another, share our ideas and feelings, and come to some conclusions together. Since we can’t do that, I invite you to mentally sit at my kitchen table as I share with you some of my thoughts and ideas.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p3" pid="XwwEvcTgbUS8CU0qXsV_DQ" hash="jwtoTQ">I am grateful for the beautiful message we have just heard from the choir. I too feel our Savior’s love. His spirit warms my soul. I have been encircled with his love and recognize the blessings he has given me. It is my desire to follow him as I strive to serve him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p4" pid="zyXB-vTTY0GQ8hw0M8Qcfw" hash="VYbp5w">One way we can feel Christ’s love is through the example of others as they emulate his life. My grandfather Broadbent was such a man. He taught by example. He never sent his ten children out to work without his working with them, side by side.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p5" pid="mexe-RES2kGwPqsyTPTyEQ" hash="CkKhng">He showed my father how to dig postholes by making a game of it. They would race with one another to see who could finish the task first. He subscribed to the principle that once a job was begun, it was done well, and it was finished. Not only did he work hard, he was committed to living the gospel well. He accepted the gospel plan without question. When it was time for tithing settlement, the whole family attended and accounted for their increase. He sent his sons on missions when there was no money during the Depression. He loved the Lord and his word. I remember countless times as a teenager visiting him in his home. There I would see him seated in his black leather chair reading the scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p6" pid="I6BfcbjSoUSAyhshQrr1ZA" hash="iN25yg">He was devoted to his family and loved to have us meet together often. At the end of these family gatherings he would call us together and talk with us. No matter what else he said, he always told us the most important things in life were the family and the gospel. He bore a strong witness of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, told us that he loved us and that Heavenly Father loved us, too. There was no doubt in my mind he was telling us the truth. His legacy has been perpetuated. Although he died before I was married, my children know him as a man who loved the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p7" pid="X5esU0cXh0mRNlJ15CJyLw" hash="_r5x0g">When I was a young child, my grandmother Richards lived in the upstairs bedroom of our home. Although she was in her nineties and failing in health, her mind was alert, and her hands spent most of the day crocheting trim around flannel baby blankets. Grandma was such a part of our lives that I can’t ever remember her not being in our home. She was very patient. My younger brother, Rich, and I spent many hours taking Grandma “for pretend rides” in her hospital bed. The crank at the foot of the bed could be rotated so that the head or the foot could be raised or lowered. When she was resting, we would come into her room and ask her if we could crank her up or down. Once, when we tired of this game, we ran off to play, leaving Grandma with both her head and her feet in the air in a “V” position.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p8" pid="Ik1C9SsrF0eKzYqN8k8SkA" hash="Yx_oGw">She never scolded us for doing this, nor would she allow our mother to, either. She understood that we were children. She simply picked up the gold bell by her side and rang it until one of our older sisters or parents came to her rescue.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p9" pid="PBkizmfcp0K9CE_uqrEBnQ" hash="CltejA">Every evening, rocking in her chair, she would call us to her side and ask that we say our prayers with her. She taught us a sweet little verse which we would repeat: “Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.” Afterward we offered our individual prayers to Heavenly Father. She would listen carefully and tell us that she loved us. Through her example, she taught me about patience. She taught me about prayer. She taught me about love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p10" pid="dAwQguMz1UCY6p0BWya0eA" hash="C5xJiw">In Timothy, we are admonished to be an example of the believers. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 4:12</a>.) A believer is someone who follows and knows the teachings of Christ not only in his mind but also in his heart and whose actions are a witness of that belief. It isn’t easy to be an example of the believers. We don’t usually wake up in the morning and say, “Today I’m going to be an example of the believers!” Yet we can say, “Today I will be kind and thoughtful, or considerate, or honest, or whatever quality I need to work on.” And <span class="emphasis">then</span> we will try hard all day to make a conscious effort to do so. That we can do!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p11" pid="ofZJOF7GCUGzaayNGZr-ww" hash="5fzYvQ">We can live in such a way that people can look to us as their examples.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p12" pid="mLrZdcw2TUWRQyQ8B6lITw" hash="iTUNiw">To be a good example of a principle, we must not only understand it but we must live that principle. It should become such a part of our everyday living that without consciously thinking about it, the principle is reflected in the way we live.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p13" pid="HYzF7rTvKkmk5FfOeg1MSQ" hash="gsjV7Q">Children are especially sensitive to the power of pure example. Ten-year-old Andrea stood at the pulpit. Her dark eyes looked around the room. She took a deep breath and began, “I would like to tell you about some people that I love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p14" pid="f_amD4tnwEuZ3k3n_PoodQ" hash="KCq0ow">“I love my older sister, Amy. She is always happy and cheerful. She encourages me when things are hard. I like the way Amy is kind to her friends. She is a good big sister.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p15" pid="Wbm0fxxZlEucy03Q6s1uVQ" hash="j1K_vg">“My aunt Elaine is a cheerful mother. She wants everyone to be happy. She shows concern and love for others. I want to be just like her.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/be-thou-an-example.p17" pid="FWcz8cuOW0-DISj645evlg" hash="ejDs6A">Andrea’s sister, aunt, and grandmother each lived Christlike principles in such a way that Andrea was drawn to them.

The purpose of “Focus on Children” is to direct the attention and efforts of adult members to care for children in a way that will enable them to have a strong foundation of testimony and faithfully live the gospel of Jesus Christ (see “Focus on Children, Guidelines and Suggestions”). When we consider all the eager young Claytons, we realize that this is an important and exciting responsibility. The First Presidency has suggested four goals to help us focus on children. The goals are one, to recognize the worth of our children; two, to activate children who are not participating in the blessings of the gospel; three, to teach children the gospel in such a way that they will understand and live it; and four, to ensure that children are prepared for and given the opportunity for baptism and ordination. I would like to focus my remarks on the third goal, teaching children the gospel in such a way that they will understand and live it.</p>

Parents have been instructed to “teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:28</a>).</p>

The word <span class="emphasis">upright</span> is defined as honest, honorable, straightforward. Thus, to walk uprightly, our children need to choose to live in an honest, honorable, straightforward manner. Children who understand and live the gospel today can walk with assurance and joy and someday will enter the presence of the Lord, walking uprightly.</p>

It is essential that we teach them the gospel of Jesus Christ. “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.6" class="scriptureRef">John 14:6</a>). I believe the scriptures are the main source to help us teach our children to walk uprightly.</p>

They can know that each person is a literal child of God, that each is born with a divine birthright and unlimited potential. When my nephew was four years old, his father took great delight in asking him to repeat his name. Rich would ask, “Mark, what is your name?” Mark would stand up tall and answer with a happy grin, “My name is Mark Andrew Broadbent, Child of God.” When our children understand that Heavenly Father is real and that He loves and cares about each of them, they will want to walk uprightly.</p>

A mother I know has taught her children to pray from the moment they began to utter their first words. Not only did she teach each child to express sincere gratitude for his blessings but also to seek Heavenly Father’s guidance by specifically asking Him to “help me choose the right.”</p>

I remember a time when I was in high school and wanted to drop out of a type class because it was too hard for me. I hated that class. I begged my parents to sign the form giving their permission for me to drop the class from my schedule. My father explained over and over all the reasons why he thought I should stay in the class. He said, “It’s important to stay with something once you begin it, especially when it’s hard. You need to work and try to do your best.” Finally in desperation he said, “I’ve told you how I feel, and now, Ruth, the decision is up to you. I’ll sign the paper if you want me to.” After spending a sleepless night fighting off my desire to do what I wanted, I finally chose to stay in the class. Although I struggled with typing for the rest of the year, I’m glad I stayed, and I’m especially glad for the counsel of my father. He helped me to understand my options. He was clear on how he felt about the matter, but he didn’t force me.</p>

The best place to teach our children the gospel is in our homes. A mother of eleven children once said to me, “The gospel needs to be in the air of our homes. Our children should almost be able to feel it. We can provide a safe, comfortable environment for them so they can feel free to learn and to develop their own personal testimonies.”</p>

We have opportunities many times a day to teach them as we walk together, drive in the car, work side by side, kneel in prayer, talk at the dinner table, and even when we change diapers. It didn’t take me long to realize soon after our first child, Natalie, was born that changing diapers was not on my list of favorite things to do. So to help me survive this recurring ordeal, I sang Primary songs to her to make it nicer for both of us. Soon the routine of changing diapers became second nature and didn’t bother me anymore. However, I continued to sing to Natalie and the rest of our children as I performed this duty, because I realized I had an opportunity many times a day to teach my child.</p>

We teach by example. Our children will learn far more by observing us walk uprightly than any other way. Blair’s parents showed him, by their example, the importance of prayer. He remembers many times as a child walking down the hall to his parents’ bedroom and seeing them kneeling at the side of their bed, holding hands as they prayed to Heavenly Father.</p>

I know of a mother who has her children repeat this simple yet powerful statement as they leave home: “The gospel is true, I love you, and I am a child of God, no matter what!” The words “Return with honor” written on a sign hung above the doorway of a home are a constant reminder to all who walk through the door how they should return.</p>

In the eighth chapter of Moroni, the prophet Mormon is deeply concerned about a dissension that has arisen among the members of the Church. He has written a letter giving counsel to his son, Moroni, regarding the matter. But before he addresses this problem, Mormon expresses his devotion to his son: “My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice exceedingly that your Lord Jesus Christ hath … called you to his ministry, and to his holy work.</p>

First, Mormon reaffirmed his love for Moroni, and then he taught him. When our children first know they are loved, they are more likely to listen and be taught.</p>

While traveling in the car with her mother and younger sister, five-year-old Clara sensed that her mother was deeply troubled about something. “Mommy, what’s the matter? You seem so sad.”</p>

Then you need to pray all the time and read the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon. You need to bless other people. Just think about the good things people do for you and the good things in your life, not the bad.” Young Clara is beginning to understand how to walk uprightly before the Lord.</p>
