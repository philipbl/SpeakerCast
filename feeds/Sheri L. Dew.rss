We went everywhere together—to the bank, the doctor, the Early Bird Garden Club, and to an endless procession of Church meetings. When it came to the gospel, Grandma was zealous. She would talk about the Church anytime and with anyone—including her eldest granddaughter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p2" pid="lJMPBH9be0u0JFLjauGvbA" hash="viWbOA">I’ll never forget an interchange she and I had one night as we drove home from yet another meeting. It began when I blurted out a question that flashed through my eight-year-old mind: “Grandma, what if the gospel isn’t true and we’ve been going to all of these meetings for nothing?” Charming little eight-year-old, wasn’t I? “Sheri, you don’t need to worry about that,” she answered, “because I know that the gospel is true.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p3" pid="RhXoyiHA8ka-RlpdaDS5mA" hash="f3Vr-Q">I challenged her: “<span class="emphasis">How</span> can you know for sure?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p4" pid="k6aqOvH3Vke7ztiRRI9-6g" hash="dApwXg">Several seconds passed before she said slowly, “I <span class="emphasis">know</span> for sure that the gospel is true because the Holy Ghost has told me that Jesus Christ is our Savior and that this is His Church.” She paused and then she added something I will never forget: “And, Sheri, He’ll tell you too, and when He does, your life can never be the same again.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p5" pid="eKFCkrTOiUW5KgDee6ojRw" hash="3K2GaA">I still vividly remember what happened next. A sensation unlike any I had ever experienced charged through my body, and then I began to cry. Though I didn’t understand the reason for my outburst, I’m sure Grandma realized exactly what was happening—that the Spirit was bearing witness to me that what she had said was true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p6" pid="ontim85bpUaXsODeMhOVWw" hash="ve77LQ">Tonight I am grateful to testify that during the intervening years I<span class="emphasis"> have</span> come to know for myself that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and our Redeemer. And with that knowledge, my life has been changed forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p7" pid="ylPfdOsKfE2H9XfZy0m2Vw" hash="-cLOJA">Prophets, ancient and modern, have urged us to come unto Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.30" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:30</a>). President Gordon B. Hinckley declared that “[Jesus Christ] is the pivotal figure of our theology and our faith. Every Latter-day Saint has the responsibility to know … with a certainty beyond doubt that Jesus is the resurrected, living Son of the living God” (“‘Fear Not to Do Good,’” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1983, 80).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p8" pid="A-hdSWGt20-A2ONMjjcfkg" hash="ojgLeQ">The admonition to “come unto Christ” is the hub around which everything in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and thus the Relief Society, revolves—and for good reason. The verb <span class="emphasis">come</span> implies action on <span class="emphasis">our</span> part. In the familiar New Testament passage about the hereafter in which many plead their case with the Lord by listing all of their good deeds, Christ responds, “I never knew you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.23" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:23</a>). Joseph Smith’s inspired translation of that same passage, however, notes a profound distinction—“<span class="emphasis">[You]</span> never knew me” (JST, Matt. 7:33; emphasis added)—placing responsibility for coming unto the Savior squarely upon our shoulders. Jesus Christ Himself has promised, “Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.63" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:63</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p9" pid="XCSo_h4MPkeAN4G9zzsDUQ" hash="n6TLkw">There are no disclaimers or exceptions in His invitation. <span class="emphasis">We</span> are the ones who determine whether or not we will come unto Him. The drawing near, seeking, asking, and knocking are up to us. And the more we know about the Lord—meaning the more we experience His mercy, devotion, and willingness to guide us even when we may not feel worthy of His direction—the more confident we become that He <span class="emphasis">will</span> respond to our petitions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p10" pid="euO8gKixLUGuKUy9m8vNAg" hash="zCN3KA">As we increase our interaction with Him, we learn for ourselves that He will never betray us, never turn away, never change His criteria for coming unto Him. His attention is riveted on us, His brothers and sisters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p11" pid="c3RMmFFPD0C_pDdjJktJ6w" hash="LH0mUg">There are many ways to draw near, seek, ask, and knock. If, for example, your prayers offered to Heavenly Father in the name of Christ have become a little casual, would you recommit yourself to meaningful prayer, offered in unrushed solitude and with a repentant heart? If you have not yet come to appreciate the peace and the power of temple worship, would you partake of the ordinances of the house of the Lord as often as your circumstances allow? If you have not yet found that immersion in the scriptures increases your sensitivity to the Spirit, would you consider incorporating the word of God into your life more consistently? Tonight would be a wonderful time to begin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p12" pid="Gx-dcz5pC0il3geqgPN_Jg" hash="qZXh3w">These efforts and many others increase our connection with Jesus Christ. As our testimony of Him expands and matures, we begin to care more about life forever than life today, and we have no desire but to do what He needs us to do and to live as He has asked us to live. President Ezra Taft Benson taught that “when you choose to follow Christ, you choose to be changed” (“Born of God,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1985, 5). It is a lot like what Grandma told me: “When you have a testimony of Jesus Christ, your life can never be the same again.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p13" pid="4y8IxesafEO-ZwPrc24A1A" hash="Y92IIg">Not long ago I visited a ward on the exquisite Oregon coast. At the conclusion of sacrament meeting I was a little surprised when a woman approached me and asked, “Are you the woman I think you are?” Her question referred to my identity, but it is one that has haunted me. <span class="emphasis">Am</span> I the woman I think I am, the woman I want to be? More importantly, am I the woman the Savior needs me to be?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p14" pid="HWEDlILXv0a2p9pBRnkcBw" hash="O2z7yA">There is a connection between my Oregon friend’s question and the lesson I learned from Grandma. For there is a direct relationship between how we feel about Jesus Christ and how we see ourselves. We cannot increase our devotion to the Savior without also obtaining a greater sense of purpose, identity, and conviction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p15" pid="EEXUHpusTEe3nzU8dO2DLQ" hash="sYOU2g">I <span class="emphasis">love</span> Nauvoo. And every time I visit the City of Joseph, I walk to the end of Parley Street, where the Saints lined their wagons as they prepared to evacuate the city. There I try to imagine how our pioneer sisters must have felt as they loaded what little they could into a wagon, glanced a final time at their homes, and then followed their faith into the wilderness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p16" pid="wVIoqyjwgk683jcAoLbA5w" hash="jAg0hQ">I always weep on Parley Street, because I can’t help but wonder, Would I have loaded that wagon? Would my testimony of a modern-day prophet and Jesus Christ have been strong enough that I would have given up everything and gone anywhere?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p17" pid="GZNE4vBIJkOs3WVLfxq-UQ" hash="6X9EKQ">Perhaps none of us in this congregation will be called upon to suffer deprivation because of what we believe. But we have been called to live in a time when the chasm between the philosophies of men and the teachings of the Master gapes wider than ever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/are-you-the-woman-i-think-you-are.p18" pid="mFuCdS_i_UupAZd3IfZlqA" hash="sxImDw">This is a day when the adversary has launched an all-out attack against womanhood, because he knows—he absolutely knows—that the influence of a righteous woman is enormous and that it spans generations. He would have us be disinterested in marriage and motherhood, confused by the world’s view of men and women, too harried by the pace of life to really live the gospel and to let it penetrate our souls. At all costs, he wants to keep us at arm’s length from Jesus Christ. For if we don’t come unto Christ, meaning that we never turn our lives over to Him, we will go through our probation here on our own rather than experiencing what the Savior promised when He said, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:28</a>).</p>

The Lord needed the strength of the women of this Church as the seeds of the Restoration were planted and nourished. And He needs us today. He needs us to speak up for what is right, even when doing so is unpopular. He needs us to develop the spiritual maturity to hear the voice of the Lord and detect the deceptions of the adversary. He delights in women who keep their covenants with precision, women who reverence the power of the priesthood, women who are willing to “lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 25:10</a>). He needs us to be everything we can be, to “arise and shine forth, that [our] light may be a standard for the nations” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 115:5</a>).</p>

In response to a question about my calling, I said, “I love getting out with the women of the Church. They are <span class="emphasis">so good.”</span> At that, he immediately corrected me: “No, Sheri. They aren’t good. <span class="emphasis">They are great!”</span></p>

He believes in our spiritual strength and our resilience, in our faith as well as our faithfulness. Regardless of your marital status, your age, or the language you speak, you are a beloved spirit daughter of Heavenly Father who is destined to play a critical part in the onward movement of the gospel kingdom. Eliza R. Snow proclaimed that “it is the <span class="emphasis">duty</span> of each one of us to be a holy woman. … There is no sister so isolated, and her sphere so narrow but what she can do a great deal towards establishing the Kingdom of God upon the earth” (<span class="emphasis">Woman’s Exponent,</span> 15 Sept. 1873, 62; emphasis added).</p>

Though she died when I was just 11, I was profoundly influenced by this one faithful woman. In like manner, each of us is vital to the Lord’s cause. How much good might we do if at this very hour we rededicated ourselves to Him who is our Redeemer and our Rescuer? How much righteous influence might we have if we joined the Young Women in their pledge to “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>)?</p>

When we come to know that Jesus is the Christ, our lives can never be the same again. With Grandma, I bear testimony that the Savior is the one source of strength and comfort that we can count on. He came to succor us in our infirmities and to heal our broken hearts. He is eager to lift us up if we will come unto Him.</p>

Answers to prayer haven’t always come easily or quickly. But they have always come. Time and again, I have been the beneficiary of the Lord’s mercy and guiding hand. Jesus Christ knows the way because He is the way. “For I will go before your face,” He promised. “I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:88</a>).</p>

My younger brother Steve had suffered a massive heart attack and died during the night. In an instant, and without warning, my most trusted friend was gone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p2" pid="lyuPogM4uEWdYMn-zBT-_Q" hash="uNaD1A">During the next few days many who loved Steve and his wife and children traveled to their home in Colorado. But it wasn’t until <span class="emphasis">after</span> the funeral that I realized that seven dear friends of mine had made the long trip from Salt Lake City to attend the service. Not one of them had ever met my brother. They had come to support me. You can imagine my emotions as they encircled me and one of them said, “We just didn’t want you to be alone today.” In word and deed, they taught a divine principle. It is not good, nor is it intended, for any of us to be alone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p3" pid="krpmxlhsIUGNXfuxcG_3Jg" hash="WUyv8Q">The pain of loneliness seems to be part of the mortal experience. But the Lord in His mercy has made it so that we need never deal with the challenges of mortality alone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p4" pid="tw9hZ8xxs0idMynbJ62GLg" hash="Wq5XBw">I was thinking about this recently as I sat through a meeting where the speaker seemed preoccupied with how <span class="emphasis">hard</span> it is to live the gospel. By the end of the meeting, I was depressed. He had made living the gospel seem like a sentence to life on the rock pile. It’s not living the gospel that’s hard. It’s <span class="emphasis">life</span> that’s hard. It’s picking up the pieces when covenants have been compromised or values violated that’s hard. The gospel is the Good News that provides us the tools to cope with the mistakes, the heartaches, the disappointments we can expect to experience here. Membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has its privileges. Here are just a few: We are led by those holding the priesthood of God, the most powerful and holy force on earth. We are members of the Relief Society, the <span class="emphasis">only</span> organization for women founded by a prophet of God. And tonight we will be taught by a <span class="emphasis">living</span> prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, who is the Lord’s anointed in <span class="emphasis">this</span> day. I testify that he is a prophet in every dimension of that word and that he receives revelation to bless the lives of all who have ears to hear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p5" pid="vrFhKi0wDkyTh4NTbsWusA" hash="8H3gZQ">To these remarkable privileges I add one other. Nephi taught this: “If ye will … receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.5" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 32:5</a>). What a remarkable privilege and promise! Lorenzo Snow said that it is the “grand privilege of every Latter-day Saint … to have the manifestations of the spirit every day of our lives … [so] that we may know the light, and not be groveling continually in the dark” (in Conference Report, April 1899, 52). And his sister Eliza R. Snow declared: “You may talk to the [Saints] about the follies of the world … till dooms day, and it will make no impression. But … place them in a position where they will get the Holy Ghost, and that will be a sure protection against outside influences” (<span class="emphasis">Woman’s Exponent,</span> 15 Sept. 1873, 63). <span class="emphasis">We</span> have been promised the constant companionship of the third member of the Godhead and hence the privilege of receiving revelation for our own lives. We are <span class="emphasis">not</span> alone!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p6" pid="IAsnbbwDiU6q4dzBKxqBjg" hash="YL4GmQ">The Holy Ghost enlarges our minds, our hearts, and our understanding; helps us subdue weaknesses and resist temptation; inspires humility and repentance; guides and protects us in miraculous ways; and gifts us with wisdom, divine encouragement, peace of mind, a desire to change, and the ability to differentiate between the philosophies of men and revealed truth. The Holy Ghost is the minister and messenger of the Father and the Son, and He testifies of both Their glorious, global reality and Their connection to us personally. Without the presence of the Spirit, it is impossible to comprehend our personal mission or to have the reassurance that our course is right. No mortal comfort can duplicate that of <span class="emphasis">the</span> Comforter. Said President Hinckley, “There is <span class="emphasis">no greater blessing</span> that can come into our lives than … the companionship of the Holy Spirit” (Boston Massachusetts Regional Conference, 22 Apr. 1995; emphasis added). And yet Brigham Young lamented: “[We] may have the Spirit of the Lord to … direct [us]. … I am satisfied, however, that, in this respect, we live far beneath our privileges” (<span class="emphasis">Deseret News Semi-Weekly,</span> 3 Dec. 1867, 2).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p7" pid="iCL9fGM9SEqT_Mio61YBlg" hash="vas1jg">Is it possible that in this twilight season of the dispensation of the fulness of times, when Satan and his minions roam the earth inspiring deceit, discouragement, and despair, that we who have been armed with the most potent antidote on earth—the gift of the Holy Ghost—don’t always fully partake of that gift? Are we guilty of spiritually just “getting by” and not accessing the power and protection within our reach? Are we satisfied with far less than the Lord is willing to give us, essentially opting to go it alone here rather than partner with the Divine?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p8" pid="pK6JabztREiwrgogBIMSgQ" hash="GItY-w">This Church is a Church of revelation. Our challenge is not one of getting the Lord to speak to us. Our problem is hearing what He has to say. He has promised, “As often as thou hast inquired thou hast received instruction of my Spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p9" pid="bC2QdCFbqE-UCT9iJHQOwA" hash="IXBARA">It is vital that we, the sisters of Relief Society, learn to hear the voice of the Lord. Yet I worry that too often we fail to seek the guidance of the Spirit. Perhaps we don’t know how and haven’t made it a priority to learn. Or we’re so aware of our personal failings that we don’t feel worthy, don’t really believe the Lord will talk to <span class="emphasis">us,</span> and therefore don’t seek revelation. Or we’ve allowed the distractions and pace of our lives to crowd out the Spirit. What a tragedy! For the Holy Ghost blesses us with optimism and wisdom at times of challenge that we simply cannot muster on our own. No wonder that one of the adversary’s favorite tactics among righteous LDS women is busyness—getting us so preoccupied with the flurry of daily life that we fail to immerse ourselves in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Sisters, we can’t afford <span class="emphasis">not</span> to seek the things of the Spirit! There is too much at stake. Too many people are depending on us as mothers, as sisters, leaders, and friends. A woman led by the Lord knows where to turn for answers and for peace. She can make difficult decisions and face problems with confidence because she takes her counsel from the Spirit, and from her leaders who are also guided by the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p10" pid="85K1ViplGUODUzdDw598Qw" hash="fF1Whw">Our responsibility, therefore, is to learn to hear the voice of the Lord. One day while reading about Nephi’s instructions to build a ship, I found myself thinking, <span class="emphasis">But how did Nephi understand so clearly what the Lord was telling him?</span> That question launched me on a search for every scriptural evidence I could find of direct communication between God and man. At each one I made a little red <span class="emphasis">x</span> in the margin of my scriptures. Now, many years later, my scriptures are littered with little red <span class="emphasis">x</span>s, each an indication that the Lord does indeed communicate with His people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p11" pid="3G6lyo4bp06JDZ8tF2vN_Q" hash="AkqhKA">I have experienced this for myself. I remember a time when a personal disappointment had left me exquisitely lonely. One day while searching the scriptures for consolation, I had the impression that I needed to focus on one particular verse. That verse led me to hundreds of others in what became a period of intense searching. But it wasn’t until three years later that another passage leaped out at me as if in neon. Only then was I given to understand what the Lord had been trying to teach me all that time about the power of the Atonement to ease our burdens. Some of the clearest promptings I have ever received have come while being immersed in the scriptures. They are a conduit for revelation. They teach us the language of the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p12" pid="qzwzW2SZ7U-kzciqJl9CgA" hash="yEXgjQ">Our ability to hear spiritually is linked to our willingness to work at it. President Hinckley has often said that the only way he knows to get anything done is to get on his knees and plead for help and then get on his feet and go to work. That combination of faith and hard work is the consummate curriculum for learning the language of the Spirit. The Savior taught, “Blessed are all they who do <span class="emphasis">hunger</span> and <span class="emphasis">thirst</span> after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.6" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:6</a>; emphasis added). Hungering and thirsting translate to sheer spiritual labor. Worshiping in the temple, repenting to become increasingly pure, forgiving and seeking forgiveness, and earnest fasting and prayer all increase our receptivity to the Spirit. Spiritual work <span class="emphasis">works</span> and is the key to learning to hear the voice of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p13" pid="Ob8NnEXJ-EezEJVDoVgzYQ" hash="HQ3Vxg">Elder Bruce R. McConkie said, “There is no price too high … no sacrifice too great, if out of it all we … enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost” (<span class="emphasis">A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</span> [1984], 253). What <span class="emphasis">are</span> we willing to do, what weaknesses and indulgences will we give up, to have as our personal protector and guide the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p14" pid="X7G2hUB-aEeHY1pHSxOFzA" hash="Vskrwg">It is a question worth asking, for let us be clear: The adversary <span class="emphasis">delights</span> in separating us, the sisters of this Church, from the Spirit. Because he knows how vital our influence and our presence is in the latter-day kingdom of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p15" pid="5AXrJMacPEalvnMVE9Oncw" hash="1EEM6w">Where may the people of the world look to find women of virtue and integrity—women who are beacons of goodness because their countenances radiate the light of Christ? To us, the sisters of Relief Society. This is not hyperbole. It is our mandate. There is no group of women anywhere whom the Lord is relying on more than us—women who can hear, and who will heed, the voice of the Lord. The Lord loves the women of this Church! And He is counting on the women of this Church, all over the world, to make the difference that only we can make.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p16" pid="7FZGQr9u9kCALkRSgdUETQ" hash="XGAAvA">This past spring I spent a day in Siberia. As I walked into a rented hall to meet with the sisters there, the Spirit absolutely overwhelmed me. I knew that I was in the presence of women who were beloved of the Lord—our sister pioneers in Russia. I wondered if that is what it would have felt like to be with Emma and Eliza in Nauvoo. I wasn’t the only one who felt it. Near the meeting’s end, Sister Efimov, the mission president’s wife, leaned over and, in what few English words she knew, whispered, “Very Holy Ghost.” Very Holy Ghost indeed! The Spirit simply cannot be restrained among righteous women who are doing their best.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p17" pid="PKqkfCXMRUSDdI6nXHv3mA" hash="nnZoHg">We will hold only one more general Relief Society meeting this century. The Lord trusted us enough to place us on stage during this pivotal era in the world’s history. We <span class="emphasis">must</span> arise as the women we were prepared to be during aeons of premortal training. We don’t have the luxury of living beneath ourselves or being casual about seeking the gifts of the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/we-are-not-alone.p18" pid="QOf2dQAnAU2KVlyMTvo6ew" hash="Z75tjQ">But we are up to the challenge. Tonight may each one of us resolve that <span class="emphasis">nothing</span> will stand between us and the Spirit of the Lord. May we recommit to stretch ourselves spiritually and to work a little harder at seeking the inspiration of heaven to guide our lives. It is the Holy Ghost who leads us to the Lord, who binds us to Him, and who irrevocably seals our testimony of Him.</p>

As my friends supported me in a time of great need, so may we have the Holy Ghost to strengthen and to guide us. May we seek with all of the energy of our souls to hear and heed the voice of the Lord so that we may do what we have been sent here to do. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

On this beautiful Easter morning, I testify with the prophet Alma “that there is no other way … whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.9" class="scriptureRef">Alma 38:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p2" pid="cCdSn4vJEUGM_jfqTfY1JQ" hash="nptxUw">The Savior’s Atonement is stunningly inclusive! “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall <span class="emphasis">all</span> be made alive” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:22</a>; emphasis added). Come one, come all, the Lord has invited. The gospel of Jesus Christ is for every man and woman, boy and girl. He doesn’t change the rules for the rich or the poor, the married or unmarried, the Portuguese or the Chinese. The gospel is for <span class="emphasis">every one</span> of us, and the spiritual requirements and rewards are universal. In matters pertaining to salvation, “<span class="emphasis">all</span> are alike unto God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:33</a>; emphasis added). The Lord’s motives stand in stark contrast to those of Lucifer, who is obsessed with attempting to make us feel less than who we are as sons and daughters of God. He despises a consecrated people and delights at obscuring our vision and enticing us away from the path that leads back to our heavenly home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p3" pid="1BWerhJ3ZUS3fxlJysrqDQ" hash="_pQtvg">As a young BYU student I learned a little something about staying on course when heading home. One Christmas Eve my brother and I left to drive home to Kansas. But early in our journey we learned that a huge snowstorm was heading our way, so we pulled out a map, identified a detour that would skirt the edge of the storm, and headed into parts unknown. Our creative navigating proved dangerous. Our new route was unfamiliar, and we still ran right into the blizzard. To make matters worse, late that night as we were creeping along in blinding snow on an obscure highway, our old Ford quit. We were stranded. And we had absolutely no idea where we were.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p4" pid="kMhnlrsXAUWEq63UPV6iGQ" hash="SaSAIw">Eventually we caught a ride to the nearest town, where we found that we were still hours from home and marooned in Last Chance, Colorado. At that point there was only one thing to do. We called home for help. In the middle of the night our father left to come and rescue us. By the next afternoon we were all safely home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p5" pid="lXw-koX2a0O_TIj98h6Rxw" hash="MT77WQ">I’ll never forget Christmas Eve in Last Chance, where we were immobilized by a problem largely of our own making and one we were unequipped to solve. That day our father did for us what we could not do for ourselves. Now, each one of us is on the path towards our eternal home. And for various reasons we all need rescue—rescue from loneliness and heartache, from despair and disillusionment, from the consequences of innocent mistakes and blatant sin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p6" pid="bsbTVDk8eEmIlj47nYy4_A" hash="PHrASw">Where do we turn for help? “In the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.11" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:11</a>). The Savior isn’t our last chance; He is our only chance. Our only chance to overcome self-doubt and catch a vision of who we may become. Our only chance to repent and have our sins washed clean. Our only chance to purify our hearts, subdue our weaknesses, and avoid the adversary. Our only chance to obtain redemption and exaltation. Our only chance to find peace and happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p7" pid="iaERbRtlhE62Ex4HleJBCw" hash="3JTrCg">Left to his own devices, the natural man inevitably succumbs to Satan (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>), who abandons his prey once he lures them from the straight and narrow path. But the Savior will guide those who follow Him <span class="emphasis">all</span> the way home. Lehi’s family endured an intense wilderness experience designed to teach, test, and sanctify them. Likewise, the path from our former home to eternal life runs right through this earthly wilderness, where we may expect similar challenges and difficulties. But in our journey we are not alone, for the Lord’s promise to Lehi is the same to us: “I will prepare the way before you [and] inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land. … After ye have arrived … ye shall know that … I, the Lord, did deliver you” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.13-14" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:13–14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p8" pid="BTnwOItq70-6SZU_0lPL4A" hash="xesfPQ">The Lord knows the way because He <span class="emphasis">is</span> the way and is our only chance for successfully negotiating mortality. His Atonement makes available all of the power, peace, light, and strength that we need to deal with life’s challenges—those ranging from our own mistakes and sins to trials over which we have no control but we still feel pain.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p9" pid="GX4_AamHtUSzkxds3BGkYQ" hash="CgsdIQ">The Lord has promised to heal our broken hearts and “to set at liberty them that are bruised” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/4.18" class="scriptureRef">Luke 4:18</a>); to give power to the faint, to heal the wounded soul, and to turn our weakness into strength (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/40.29" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 40:29</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.8" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:27</a>); to take upon Him our pains and sicknesses, to blot out our transgressions if we repent, and loose the bands of death (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-13" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–13</a>). He promised that if we will build our lives upon His rock, the devil will have no power over us (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:12</a>). And He has vowed that He will never leave us or forsake us (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/13.5" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 13:5</a>). There is simply no mortal equivalent. Not in terms of commitment, power, or love. He is our only chance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p10" pid="r7_krB4VVE6184YUVa_2Qg" hash="nWirlQ">Our responsibility is to learn to draw upon the power of the Atonement. Otherwise we walk through mortality relying solely on our own strength. And to do that is to invite the frustration of failure and to refuse the most resplendent gift in time or eternity. “For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed … and he receive not the gift?” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:33</a>). My brother and I would have been foolish to not seek or accept our father’s help when we were stranded. Likewise, the Lord is our advocate, and He “knoweth the weakness of man and how to succor them who are tempted” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/62.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 62:1</a>). In other words, He knows how to succor <span class="emphasis">all</span> of us. But <span class="emphasis">we</span> activate the power of the Atonement in our lives. We do this by first believing in Him, by repenting, by obeying His commandments, by partaking of sacred ordinances and keeping covenants, and by seeking after Him in fasting and prayer, in the scriptures, and in the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p11" pid="HREgTD0U30iPswzvExS6xQ" hash="Vp8gAw">All of which requires our faith in the Lord. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said that “if there is any one thing you and I need … it is faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> To have faith in Christ is to believe in Him, follow Him, and rely on Him. And it is to be blessed with the peace of conscience and mind that the Apostle Paul spoke of when he said, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 4:13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p12" pid="Us8rwakLSE6V0IAtOWzN0w" hash="xGYkoQ">Not long ago the Relief Society general presidency was asked to meet with two journalists from eastern Europe who were intrigued about service performed by our sisters in their country. We explained that from its earliest days this grand organization of righteous women has sought to not only “relieve the poor but to save souls.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> When they asked if we help women with their “emotional problems,” explaining that many in their country were discouraged, we responded that in Relief Society we study the doctrines of the gospel, and the gospel teaches us how to be happy even when life is hard. One of the reporters was incredulous: “Is it possible?” she asked. “Is it possible to be happy when life is hard?” Her question tugged at me, for I knew that she did not know where to turn for peace.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Is</span> it possible to be happy when life is hard? To feel peace amid uncertainty and hope in the midst of cynicism? Is it possible to change, to shake off old habits and become new again? Is it possible to live with integrity and purity in a world that no longer values the virtues that distinguish the followers of Christ?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p14" pid="aHaE5AjqlkGGKtrUv3zLSg" hash="Zi1NUA">Yes. The answer is yes because of Jesus Christ, whose Atonement ensures that we need not bear the burdens of mortality alone. There is nothing this confused world needs more, nothing that inspires a greater sense of well-being, nothing that has greater power to strengthen families than the gospel of Jesus Christ. President Howard W. Hunter said, “Whatever Jesus lays his hands upon lives. If Jesus lays his hands upon a marriage, it lives. If he is allowed to lay his hands on the family, it lives.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> The Savior will do for <span class="emphasis">each</span> of us what He has promised to do—<span class="emphasis">if</span> we will have faith in Him and receive His gift.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p15" pid="TnuhqzmJ9EmvdGQuK6GPnQ" hash="PoZrvQ">Through the years I, like you, have experienced pressures and disappointments that would have crushed me had I not been able to draw upon a source of wisdom and strength far greater than my own. He has never forgotten or forsaken me, and I have come to know for myself that Jesus <span class="emphasis">is</span> the Christ and that this is His Church. With Ammon I say, “[For] who can glory too much in the Lord? Yea, who can say too much of his great power, and of his mercy … ? Behold, … I cannot say the smallest part which I feel” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:16</a>). I testify that in this, the twilight of the dispensation of the fulness of times, when Lucifer is working overtime to jeopardize our journey home and to separate us from the Savior’s atoning power, the only answer for <span class="emphasis">any</span> of us is Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/our-only-chance.p16" pid="nOG4D6V3nE-SGj7jzh5LMw" hash="tTuOMg">May we recommit to seek after this Jesus, of whom the prophets have testified. May we yoke ourselves to Him, draw liberally upon the matchless power of His Atonement, and rise up as sons and daughters of God and shake off the world. To “those who will have him to be their God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.40" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:40</a>), the Lord has extended a magnificent promise: “I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:88</a>). Jesus Christ is our only chance. He will show us the way because He <span class="emphasis">is</span> the way, to which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

But I felt such a foreboding about the trip that prior to leaving I sought a priesthood blessing. I was warned that the adversary would attempt to thwart my mission and that physical and spiritual danger lay ahead. I was also counseled that this was not to be a sight-seeing or a shopping trip and that if I would focus on my assignments and seek the direction of the Spirit, I would return safely home.</p>

But as I proceeded, pleading for direction and protection each step of the way, I realized that my experience wasn’t all that unique. Might not our Father have said to you and to me as we left His presence: “The adversary will attempt to thwart your mission, and you will face spiritual and physical danger. But if you will focus on your assignments, if you will heed my voice, and if you will refuse to reduce mortality to a sight-seeing or a shopping trip, you will return safely home”?</p>

Satan baits us with perishable pleasures and preoccupations—our bank accounts, our wardrobes, even our waistlines—for he knows that where our treasure is, there will our hearts be also (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:21</a>). Unfortunately, it is easy to let the blinding glare of the adversary’s enticements distract us from the light of Christ. “For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.26" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:26</a>).</p>

Said President Spencer W. Kimball, “If we insist on spending all our time and resources building up … a worldly kingdom, that is exactly what we will inherit” (“The False Gods We Worship,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> June 1976, 6). How often are we so focused on pursuing the so-called good life that we lose sight of eternal life? It is the fatal spiritual equivalent of selling our birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>

The only way that <span class="emphasis">we</span> may overcome the world is by coming unto Christ. And coming unto Christ means walking away from the world. It means placing Christ and Christ only at the center of our lives so that the vanities and philosophies of men lose their addictive appeal. Satan <span class="emphasis">is</span> the god of Babylon, or this world. Christ is the God of Israel, and His Atonement gives us power to overcome the world. “If you expect glory, intelligence and endless lives,” said President Joseph F. Smith, <span class="emphasis">“let the world go” </span>(<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph F. Smith</span> [1998], 243; emphasis added).</p>

No wonder he tempts us to settle for earthly pleasures rather than to seek for eternal glory. A 45-year-old mother of six told me recently that when she stopped poring over magazines that plagued her with images of how her home and wardrobe should look, she began to feel more at peace. She said, “I may be chubby, gray, and wrinkled, but I am a chubby, gray, wrinkled daughter of God, who knows me and loves me.”</p>

In that spirit, I join Sister Smoot and Sister Jensen in declaring who we are and in rejoicing in the announced refinements in Relief Society’s focus. We no longer have the luxury of spending our energy on anything that does not lead us and our families to Christ. That is the litmus test for Relief Society, as well as for our lives. In the days ahead, a casual commitment to Christ will not carry us through.</p>

Somehow they outlasted the Dust Bowl, the Depression, and the tornadoes that terrorize the Great Plains. I’ve often wondered how Grandma put up with years of meager income and hard work and how she went on when her oldest son died in a tragic accident. Grandma’s life wasn’t easy. But do you know what I remember most about her? Her total joy in the gospel. She was never happier than when she was working on family history or teaching with her scriptures in hand. Grandma <span class="emphasis">had</span> laid aside the things of this world to seek for the things of a better.</p>

But to me, she represents the unsung heroines of <span class="emphasis">this</span> century who lived up to their premortal promises and left a foundation of faith upon which we may build. Grandma wasn’t perfect, but she was a woman of God. Now it is for you and for me to carry forward the banner into the next century. <span class="emphasis">We are not women of the world. We are women of God.</span> And women of God will be among the greatest heroines of the 21st century. As President Joseph F. Smith proclaimed, it is not for us “to be led by the women of the world; it is for [us] to lead … the women of the world, in everything that is praise-worthy” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings,</span> 184).</p>

We are endowed with power and gifted with the Holy Ghost. We have a <span class="emphasis">living</span> prophet to guide us, ordinances that bind us to the Lord and to each other, and the power of the priesthood in our midst. We understand where we stand in the great plan of happiness. And we know that God is our Father and that His Son is our unfailing Advocate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/we-are-women-of-god.p11" pid="bc3UJAJlyE-FoBJ_NV6vHg" hash="eNftSg">With these privileges comes great responsibility, for “unto whom much is given much is required” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:3</a>), and at times the demands of discipleship are heavy. But shouldn’t we expect the journey towards eternal glory to stretch us? We sometimes rationalize our preoccupation with this world and our casual attempts to grow spiritually by trying to console each other with the notion that living the gospel really shouldn’t require all that much of us. The Lord’s standard of behavior will always be more demanding than the world’s, but then the Lord’s rewards are infinitely more glorious—including true joy, peace, and salvation.</p>

The Lord rewards “them that diligently seek him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.6" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:6</a>). We seek Him not only by studying and searching, by pleading and praying and watching always lest we enter into temptation, but by giving up worldly indulgences that straddle the line between God and mammon. Otherwise we risk being called but not chosen because our “hearts are set so much upon the things of this world” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:35</a>).</p>

What the Lord requires first is our hearts. Imagine how our choices would be affected if we loved the Savior above all else. How we would spend our time and money, or dress on a hot summer day, or respond to the call to visit teach and take care of one another, or react to media that offend the Spirit.</p>

We were born for eternal glory. Just as faithful men were foreordained to hold the priesthood, we were foreordained to be women of God. We <span class="emphasis">are</span> women of faith, virtue, vision, and charity who rejoice in motherhood and in womanhood and in the family. We are not panicked about perfection, but we <span class="emphasis">are</span> working to become more pure. And we know that in the strength of the Lord we can do all righteous things because we have immersed ourselves in His gospel (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:12</a>). <span class="emphasis">I repeat, we cannot be women of the world, for we are latter-day women of God. </span>As President Kimball taught, “No greater recognition can come to [us] in this world than to be known as [women] of God” (“The Role of Righteous Women,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1979, 102).</p>

As I sat on the Mount of Beatitudes overlooking the Sea of Galilee, I saw in the distance a city built on a hill. The visual image of a city that cannot be hid was stunning, and as I pondered the symbolism I had an overwhelming impression that we as women of God are like that city, that if we will leave behind the things of the world and come unto Christ so that the Spirit radiates through our lives and from our eyes, our uniqueness will be a light unto the world. As sisters of Relief Society, we belong to the most significant community of women on this side of the veil. We <span class="emphasis">are</span> a spectacular city on a hill. And the less we look and act like the women of the world, the more they will look to us as a wellspring of hope, peace, virtue, and joy.</p>

We can no longer be content to just quote President Kimball. We are the sisters who must and will make his prophecy a reality. But we can do it. I know we can.</p>

Sisters, this is a call to arms, it’s a call to action, a call to arise. A call to arm ourselves with power and with righteousness. A call to rely on the arm of the Lord rather than the arm of flesh. A call to “arise and shine forth, that [our] light may be a standard for the nations” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 115:5</a>).

Towering over my friends was the bane of my adolescence. I didn’t want to stand out—at least not that way—so I compensated by slouching. As a result, Mother was constantly urging me to “stand up straight.” Well, I didn’t want to stand up straight then, but I do now. For we have all been admonished to “stand up” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/8.17" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 8:17</a>) and to stand as a witness (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>) so that we may “stand blameless before God at the last day” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:2</a>). I can find absolutely no scriptural injunction to slouch in Zion. Instead, we are repeatedly told to get on our feet, to “arise and stand up” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20.2" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 20:2</a>).</p>

Nor is it yours. For as women of God we must stand tall so that we will stand out from the rest of the world. Only in doing so may we hope to find joy. For finding joy and standing tall, not in feet or inches but as ambassadors for the Lord, are directly connected.</p>

I have 17 nieces and nephews, who are a pure delight. We have hiked and biked and fasted and prayed together. And recently we have cried together. A few weeks ago we suffered a crushing loss when an accident took the lives of two of my sister’s children—Amanda, who was 11, and Tanner, who was 15. Because we have lived together in love, we have truly wept for the loss of them that died (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:45</a>).</p>

So we dedicated the funeral entirely to testifying of Christ and the restored gospel. Afterwards many told us how moved they were by what they heard and by what they felt. Some have even asked to learn more. Now, we don’t know if anyone affected by our children’s deaths will join the Church. But this we do know—that standing up for what we believe and teaching the gospel to friends who had never before been willing to listen helped soothe our pain and bring us joy as a family.</p>

Recently my 11-year-old niece Aubrey, whose father died five years ago, was asked by a nonmember friend why she wasn’t sad about the deaths of her father and, recently, her cousins. Aubrey’s reply was classic: “Not sad? Trust me, we are sad, but we know that we will be together again, so we don’t worry as much.” As a family we’ve no doubt cried as much, but we don’t worry as we would if we hadn’t felt the transcendent reach and healing power of Jesus Christ. The gospel is “beauty for ashes” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/61.3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 61:3</a>); it is “the oil of gladness” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/1.9" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 1:9</a>); it is such good news!</p>

But what about our Father’s children, our brothers and sisters, who are lost and who face not only physical but spiritual death? The gospel of Jesus Christ is all about people. It’s about leaving the ninety and nine and going into the wilderness after those who are lost. It’s about bearing one another’s burdens, with the ultimate burden anyone can bear being walking through this life without light. Hence the Lord’s latter-day plea:</p>

That day has come. And it is our turn to thrust in our sickles and help with the harvest. That we are here now is no accident. For aeons of time our Father watched us and knew He could trust us when so much would be at stake. We have been held in reserve for this very hour. We need to understand not just who we are but who we have always been. For we are women of God, and the work of women of God has always been to help build the kingdom of God.</p>

The Prophet Joseph charged the Relief Society with the work of saving souls (see <span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:25), for it is our very nature to nurture and to search after those who are lost. And yet, President Spencer W.

For all the good it has done in the past, Relief Society has yet to help move this latter-day work forward as it must. Sisters, the time has come to unleash the power of righteous happiness that exists among women of God. The time has come for us to be anxiously engaged in the work of saving souls. The time has come for the sisters of Relief Society to stand with and for the prophet in helping build the kingdom. The time has come for us each to stand tall and to stand together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/stand-tall-and-stand-together.p12" pid="OL8MWv99fUi-FkQFg7Zgaw" hash="-GpNtQ">Standing tall begins with our own conversion, for when we taste the gospel’s “exceeding joy” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.24" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:24</a>) we want to share it. The casseroles and quilts we have made to relieve suffering are splendid acts of kindness, but no service—I repeat, no service—compares with that of leading someone to Christ. Do you want to be happy? I mean really happy? Then nurture someone along the path that leads to the temple and to Christ.</p>

When we live like disciples of Christ should live, when we aren’t just good but happy to be good, others will be drawn to us because we are “distinct and different—in happy ways,” as President Kimball prophesied (“The Role of Righteous Women,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1979, 104). Happy about the way we’ve chosen to live, happy because we’re not constantly reshaping ourselves in the world’s image, happy because we have “the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.37" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 13:37</a>), happy to stand tall so that we will stand out.</p>

Every time we mentor a newly baptized sister or befriend a wandering soul without judging her or invite a nonmember family to home evening or give a Book of Mormon to a colleague or lead a family to the temple or stand up for modesty and motherhood or invite the missionaries into our homes or help someone discover the power of the word, we build the kingdom of God. Imagine how it lifted my sister’s spirits when she read this journal entry Tanner had made just before he died: “Thanks, Mom and Dad, for teaching me about Christ.” What builds the kingdom more than raising up a child to the Lord?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/stand-tall-and-stand-together.p15" pid="0HkUBxjp-0e7ESxzqg3toA" hash="YwPJ3w">With the exception of those serving full-time missions, we needn’t don name badges or knock on doors to help build the kingdom. For though some would portray us as dowdy and dominated rather than the dynamic, radiant women we are, no woman is more persuasive, no woman has greater influence for good, no woman is a more vibrant instrument in the hands of the Lord than a woman of God who is thrilled to be who she is. I like to think of us as the Lord’s secret weapon. If we did have name tags, I would want mine to read: “Sheri Dew, Woman of God, Busy Building the Kingdom of God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/stand-tall-and-stand-together.p16" pid="fFfudT0GEEOYUggID9SRhQ" hash="mGsl6A">Imagine what would happen in this Church if every morning 4.5 million of us got on our knees and asked our Father who He needed us to reach out to that day. And then imagine if we did it! Imagine if we consecrated our energy and our focus en masse to the greatest service of all, that of leading our sisters and brothers to Christ. Imagine what will happen when we mobilize the sisters of Relief Society to stand together to help build the kingdom. We will see the awakening and arising of a sleeping, slouching giant.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/stand-tall-and-stand-together.p17" pid="kZR0ZWUPT0Scaa_0bMBr9g" hash="atSQ5w">Tonight I invite you to stand tall, to thrust in your sickle and join in this work with vigor. I invite you to rededicate your life to building the kingdom. To reach out to someone who has wandered. To take a new member under your wing. To consider serving a mission with your husband. To look and pray for missionary moments. To make a difference in someone’s life spiritually, especially the members of your own family. None of us have to reach everyone. But what if we all reached someone? And then someone else? And so on. President Hinckley has asked us to “become a vast army with enthusiasm for this work” (“Find the Lambs, Feed the Sheep,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>May 1999, 110). As we do so, we will become one of the mightiest forces for good this world has ever seen. For we, the sisters of Relief Society, are women of God. And the work of women of God and the work of the Relief Society has always been to help build the kingdom of God. I believe that we can do more to help our priesthood leaders than we have ever done before.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/stand-tall-and-stand-together.p18" pid="rQLvGdeE_kO8KMU4ZinKNw" hash="GbWvng">In my nephew’s priesthood quorum, just a few hours before he died, Tanner said this: “You know, if I were to die soon, I would want my funeral to be a missionary farewell.” My prayer tonight is that we can be equally clear about our mission as women of God. This isn’t just a really nice church that teaches really nice ideas so that we can live really nice lives. This is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, endowed with His power and charged with carrying His truth to the ends of the earth. I love our Father. And I love His Son. And I have come to know for myself that this is Their work and Their glory and that we are the most blessed of all women to have such a vital part in it. May we lift our “voices as with the sound of a trump” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:6</a>). May we find joy as we stand tall and stand together. And may we “cheerfully do all things that lie in our power” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.17" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 123:17</a>), and then stand still to see the arm of God revealed as His work goes forward boldly and nobly until “it has … swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:540). In the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I had made that walk many times, but that evening we suddenly found ourselves engulfed by an enormous mob of drunken parade-goers. It was no place for four teenage girls, or their aunt, I might add. But with the streets closed to traffic, we had no choice but to keep walking. Over the din, I shouted to the girls, “Stay right with me.” As we maneuvered through the crush of humanity, the only thing on my mind was my nieces’ safety.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p2" pid="uV9PGSG6f0qrZ9UT4AqYHg" hash="QD4-_g">Thankfully, we finally made it to the chapel. But for one unnerving hour, I better understood how mothers who forgo their own safety to protect a child must feel. My siblings had entrusted me with their daughters, whom I love, and I would have done anything to lead them to safety. Likewise, our Father has entrusted us as women with His children, and He has asked us to love them and help lead them safely past the dangers of mortality back home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p3" pid="36HEd7zCbEar4jPqnVvNpg" hash="dMekHQ">
        <span class="emphasis">Loving</span> and <span class="emphasis">leading</span>—these words summarize not only the all-consuming work of the Father and the Son, but the essence of our labor, for our work is to help the Lord with His work. How, then, may we as Latter-day women of God best help the Lord with His work?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p4" pid="-GhwDRQrJUGLiHePytk-dQ" hash="rYBXTQ">Prophets have repeatedly answered this question, as did the First Presidency six decades ago when they called motherhood “the highest, holiest service … assumed by mankind.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p5" pid="NHrnelG-IU-SDPiF4_qwSw" hash="9vrlMA">Have you ever wondered why prophets have taught the doctrine of motherhood—and it <span class="emphasis">is</span> doctrine—again and again? I have. I have thought long and hard about the work of women of God. And I have wrestled with what the doctrine of motherhood means for <span class="emphasis">all</span> of us. This issue has driven me to my knees, to the scriptures, and to the temple—all of which teach an ennobling doctrine regarding our most crucial role as women. It is a doctrine about which we must be clear if we hope to stand “steadfast and immovable”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> regarding the issues that swirl around our gender. For Satan has declared war on motherhood. He knows that those who rock the cradle can rock his earthly empire. And he knows that without righteous mothers loving and leading the next generation, the kingdom of God will fail.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p6" pid="-rFPBZlPkEu7X6GANxqvkw" hash="Qr7lMg">When we understand the magnitude of motherhood, it becomes clear why prophets have been so protective of woman’s most sacred role. While <span class="emphasis">we</span> tend to equate motherhood solely with maternity, in the Lord’s language, the word <span class="emphasis">mother</span> has layers of meaning. Of all the words they could have chosen to define her role and her essence, both God the Father and Adam called Eve “the mother of all living”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span>—and they did so <span class="emphasis">before</span> she ever bore a child. Like Eve, our motherhood began before we were born. Just as worthy men were foreordained to hold the priesthood in mortality,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> righteous women were endowed premortally with the privilege of motherhood.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Motherhood is more than bearing children, though it is certainly that. It is the essence of who we are as women. It defines our very identity, our divine stature and nature, and the unique traits our Father gave us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p7" pid="Y8STZGXvF0ijuyf-sfBiDQ" hash="FFrbPg">President Gordon B. Hinckley stated that “God planted within women something divine.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> That something is the gift and the gifts of motherhood. Elder Matthew Cowley taught that “men have to have something given to them [in mortality] to make them saviors of men, but not mothers, not women. [They] are born with an inherent right, an inherent authority, to be the saviors of human souls … and the regenerating force in the lives of God’s children.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p8" pid="B2gowS3JckmnY8Jzp9Op0g" hash="zsFsbQ">Motherhood is not what was left over after our Father blessed His sons with priesthood ordination. It was the most ennobling endowment He could give His daughters, a sacred trust that gave women an unparalleled role in helping His children keep their second estate. As President J. Reuben Clark Jr. declared, motherhood is “as divinely called, as eternally important in its place as the Priesthood itself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p9" pid="5GXJaeLnRUicuVG_kzIX9Q" hash="Xh-44Q">Nevertheless, the subject of motherhood is a very tender one, for it evokes some of our greatest joys and heartaches. This has been so from the beginning. Eve was “glad” after the Fall, realizing she otherwise “never should have had seed.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> And yet, imagine her anguish over Cain and Abel. Some mothers experience pain because of the children they have borne; others feel pain because they do not bear children here. About this Elder John A. Widtsoe was explicit: “Women who through no fault of their own cannot exercise the gift of motherhood directly, may do so vicariously.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p10" pid="QAVMbjLIfUGFr0bIvQj8tQ" hash="DNuLQw">For reasons known to the Lord, some women are required to wait to have children. This delay is not easy for any righteous woman. But the Lord’s timetable for each of us does not negate our nature. Some of us, then, must simply find other ways to mother. And all around us are those who need to be loved and led.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p11" pid="QRZop0udo06N5A8672TeNw" hash="tABjPQ">Eve set the pattern. In addition to bearing children, she mothered all of mankind when she made the most courageous decision any woman has ever made and with Adam opened the way for us to progress. She set an example of womanhood for men to respect and women to follow, modeling the characteristics with which we as women have been endowed: heroic faith, a keen sensitivity to the Spirit, an abhorrence of evil, and complete selflessness. Like the Savior, “who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Eve, for the joy of helping initiate the human family, endured the Fall. She loved us enough to help lead us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p12" pid="5jvrcvolQ0yWs1rAzKeXIg" hash="LfS2RQ">As daughters of our Heavenly Father, and as daughters of Eve, we are all mothers and we have always been mothers. And we each have the responsibility to love and help lead the rising generation. How will our young women learn to live as women of God unless they see what women of God look like, meaning what we wear, watch, and read; how we fill our time and our minds; how we face temptation and uncertainty; where we find true joy; and why modesty and femininity are hallmarks of righteous women? How will our young men learn to value women of God if we don’t show them the virtue of our virtues?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p13" pid="2rVwY40FcEqXYQz7_SwbDA" hash="B2UR0w">Every one of us has an overarching obligation to model righteous womanhood because our youth may not see it anywhere else. Every sister in Relief Society, which is the most significant community of women on this side of the veil, is responsible to help our young women make a joyful transition into Relief Society. This means our friendship with them must begin long before they turn 18. Every one of us can mother someone—beginning, of course, with the children in our own families but extending far beyond. Every one of us can show by word and by deed that the work of women in the Lord’s kingdom is magnificent and holy. I repeat: <span class="emphasis">We are all mothers in Israel,</span> and our calling is to love and help lead the rising generation through the dangerous streets of mortality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p14" pid="_9lPQisxkk-CIVmxRfv5Aw" hash="2aqJnQ">Few of us will reach our potential without the nurturing of both the mother who bore us and the mothers who bear with us. I was thrilled recently to see one of my youth leaders for the first time in years. As a teenager who had absolutely no self-confidence, I always sidled up to this woman because she would put her arm around me and say, “You are just the best girl!” She loved me, so I let her lead me. How many young men and women are desperate for <span class="emphasis">your</span> love and leadership? Do we fully realize that our influence as mothers in Israel is irreplaceable and eternal?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p15" pid="LGWHyKKDgE-X7p-HpYjn5A" hash="STGuZg">When I was growing up, it was not uncommon for Mother to wake me in the middle of the night and say, “Sheri, take your pillow and go downstairs.” I knew what that meant. It meant a tornado was coming, and I was instantly afraid. But then Mother would say, “Sheri, everything will be OK.” Her words always calmed me. Today, decades later, when life seems overwhelming or frightening, I call Mother and wait for her to say, “Everything will be OK.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p16" pid="zEauR9TYDkmsR4CyIjjPLw" hash="VUKYVQ">Recent horrifying events in the United States have underscored the fact that we live in a world of uncertainty. Never has there been a greater need for righteous mothers—mothers who bless their children with a sense of safety, security, and confidence about the future, mothers who teach their children where to find peace and truth and that the power of Jesus Christ is always stronger than the power of the adversary. Every time we build the faith or reinforce the nobility of a young woman or man, every time we love or lead anyone even one small step along the path, we are true to our endowment and calling as mothers and in the process we build the kingdom of God. No woman who understands the gospel would ever think that any other work is more important or would ever say, “I am <span class="emphasis">just</span> a mother,” for mothers heal the souls of men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p17" pid="uJPwq8s9pEqVP4prdD-RYQ" hash="8cN_xQ">Look around. Who needs you and your influence? If we really want to make a difference, it will happen as we mother those we have borne and those we are willing to bear with. If we will stay right with our youth—meaning, if we will <span class="emphasis">love</span> them—in most cases they will stay right with us—meaning, they will let us <span class="emphasis">lead</span> them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p18" pid="zxRFNsDR_EKOAzeix_NqrA" hash="gEVyyg">As mothers in Israel, we are the Lord’s secret weapon. Our influence comes from a divine endowment that has been in place from the beginning. In the premortal world, when our Father described our role, I wonder if we didn’t stand in wide-eyed wonder that He would bless us with a sacred trust so central to His plan and that He would endow us with gifts so vital to the loving and leading of His children. I wonder if we shouted for joy<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> at least in part because of the ennobling stature He gave us in His kingdom. The world won’t tell you that, but the Spirit will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p19" pid="pKIvQKv7CEOR2lY70K59hg" hash="LC9Imw">We just can’t let the Lord down. And if the day comes when we are the only women on earth who find nobility and divinity in motherhood, so be it. For <span class="emphasis">mother</span> is the word that will define a righteous woman made perfect in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom, a woman who has qualified for eternal increase in posterity, wisdom, joy, and influence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/are-we-not-all-mothers.p20" pid="osKf3GAHI0iDu7FGtbADXg" hash="gLuveA">I know, I absolutely know, that these doctrines about our divine role are true, and that when understood they bring peace and purpose to all women. My dear sisters, whom I love more than I know how to express, will you rise to the challenge of being mothers in these perilous times, though doing so may test the last ounce of your endurance and courage and faith? Will you stand steadfast and immovable as a mother in Israel and a woman of God? Our Father and His Only Begotten Son have given us a sacred stewardship and a holy crown in their kingdom. May we rejoice in it. And may we be worthy of Their trust. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

He is still stinging from his banishment into eternal exile after Michael led the hosts of heaven, comprised of valiant men and women united in the cause of Christ, against him. In the chilling words of Peter, “The devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Lucifer is determined to devour marriages and families, because their demise threatens the salvation of all involved and the vitality of the Lord’s kingdom itself. Thus, Satan seeks to confuse us about our stewardships and distinctive natures as men and women. He bombards us with bizarre messages about gender, marriage, family, and all male-female relationships. He would have us believe men and women are so alike that our unique gifts are not necessary, or so different we can never hope to understand each other. Neither is true.</p>

He made us enough alike to love each other, but enough different that we would need to unite our strengths and stewardships to create a whole. Neither man nor woman is perfect or complete without the other. Thus, no marriage or family, no ward or stake is likely to reach its full potential until husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, men and women work together in unity of purpose, respecting and relying upon each other’s strengths.</p>

You will not find them on a TV sitcom or even, sadly, in some homes and wards. But they are not lost to the Lord, who has given us “a pattern in all things, that [we] may not be deceived.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> The Lord’s pattern for couples and in large measure men and women serving together in His kingdom was established by our first parents. Together Adam and Eve labored,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> mourned,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> were obedient, had children,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> taught their posterity the gospel,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> called upon the name of the Lord, “heard the voice of the Lord,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> blessed the name of God,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> and dedicated themselves to God. Repeatedly the scriptures about Adam and Eve refer to the pronoun <span class="emphasis">they.</span></p>

Their unique roles were interconnected. They counseled with one another, lifted burdens neither could have lifted alone, and then faced the wilderness, with all of its uncertainty, together. This is the Lord’s pattern for righteous men and women.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/it-is-not-good-for-man-or-woman-to-be-alone.p8" pid="3FyXC3lxWkqhb7s_CWgCHg" hash="8pNFIg">Now, some of us encounter life circumstances that are less than ideal. I understand this. I personally deal with this. And yet, my dear young friends, in whose hands rests the future of the Church and its families, I must tell you that your understanding of this divine pattern will affect your marriage, your family, your ability to help build the kingdom, and your eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/it-is-not-good-for-man-or-woman-to-be-alone.p9" pid="Bsxj1zZGRUGpv1v2-4yOvQ" hash="DFtCpQ">My young sisters, some will try to persuade you that because you are not ordained to the priesthood you have been shortchanged. They are simply wrong, and they do not understand the gospel of Jesus Christ. The blessings of the priesthood are available to every righteous man and woman. We may all receive the Holy Ghost, obtain personal revelation, and be endowed in the temple, from which we emerge “armed” with power.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> The power of the priesthood heals, protects, and inoculates all of the righteous against the powers of darkness. Most significantly, the fulness of the priesthood contained in the highest ordinances of the house of the Lord can only be received by a man and woman together.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Said President Harold B. Lee: “Pure womanhood plus priesthood means exaltation. But womanhood without priesthood, or priesthood without pure womanhood doesn’t spell exaltation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/it-is-not-good-for-man-or-woman-to-be-alone.p11" pid="zZuGTjJXJUOhHfAZe3yMtw" hash="DphLOA">Your future husbands and the men with whom you serve will need the support only you can give. You have an inner spiritual strength that President James E. Faust said equals and even surpasses that of men.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Do not abdicate your spiritual responsibility. Your faith will preach compelling sermons. No amount of time in front of the mirror will make you as attractive as having the Holy Ghost with you. Bless your family and the Church as only a woman of God can—with virtue, faith, integrity, and constant compassion.</p>

Be unfailingly worthy to exercise this godly power, which is given you to be of service. A man is never more magnificent than when he is guided by the Spirit to honor the priesthood he holds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/it-is-not-good-for-man-or-woman-to-be-alone.p13" pid="yru8zua7CUiH1Czh2YNWjg" hash="TBWRtA">If you will marry a virtuous woman who can hear the voice of the Lord, she will bless your life every day of your life. Consider Eve. She was the first to see that the fruit of the tree was good, and after partaking, she “gave unto her husband … , and he did eat.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> Were it not for Eve, our progression would have ceased. Elder Dallin H. Oaks stated that her act was “a glorious necessity [that opened] the doorway toward eternal life. Adam showed his wisdom by doing the same.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

But be humble enough to listen to and learn from the women in your life. They will provide insight, balance, and unique wisdom. And when challenges come, you will see how resilient a woman committed to God the Father and Jesus Christ is.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/it-is-not-good-for-man-or-woman-to-be-alone.p15" pid="uo46RHA0CEiasIZsvG1u1g" hash="u82FHQ">This divine pattern for men and women that strengthens marriages and families also fortifies the Church. For the Church cannot achieve the full measure of its creation unless both faithful men who bear the priesthood and righteous women who rejoice in serving under the direction of the priesthood work together. Time and again I have experienced this joy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/it-is-not-good-for-man-or-woman-to-be-alone.p16" pid="PPrk2vwhrEO2q-i34dUr-Q" hash="TcqQpw">I think of a meeting in Brazil where I had a translator who was unsure of her ability to convert my English into Portuguese. But as it turned out, she and I communicated with ease. After the meeting I found out why. I learned that not only had the General Authority who presided been literally on the edge of his seat behind us the entire meeting, prompting the translator when necessary, but he had also assigned another priesthood leader to pray for both of us throughout the meeting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/it-is-not-good-for-man-or-woman-to-be-alone.p17" pid="UMb8O-kRMkarJ7EdYPq3QQ" hash="gwmh3w">That General Authority created a safety net of support so that I could fulfill the assignment he had given me. Such a circle of support has no end, because there is no end to the good works of righteous men and women who respect each other and who thrust in their sickles and reap, side by side, in the Lord’s vineyard. If we are going to build the kingdom of God, we as men and women of God must build each other. There is no challenge—with activation, retention, families, or anything—that we can’t solve when we counsel together in councils and help each other lift the load.</p>

Ponder the scriptural accounts of Adam and Eve and see what the Lord will teach you that will strengthen your marriage, your family, and your Church service. Recent devastating events in the United States seem to indicate difficult days ahead. But they are days that will be filled with confidence and courage if the men and women of your generation unite in righteousness as never before. There is no limit to what you can accomplish if you will work together, equally yoked, under the guidance of the priesthood.</p>

Look to the Lord and not to the world for your ideas and ideals about men and women. For, my young friends, you are the mothers, fathers, and leaders who were reserved for this unprecedented time because our Father knows you, and He knows you have what it takes to face the world and to be fearless in building the kingdom. Do it together, for it is not good for man or woman to be alone. Lift each other, and together you will be able to lift the beautiful burdens of mortality and have glory added upon your heads forever.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> The Lord must have righteous men and righteous women to build His kingdom. I know that this is so. God is our Father. His Only Begotten Son is the Christ. This is Their work and Their glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
