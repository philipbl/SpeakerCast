      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p1" pid="shQKia61zUeb9wZs_H1zzA" hash="8YtlcA">My beloved brothers and sisters, this is my first opportunity to address you since the call to this new assignment. There is no way to express either the sense of responsibility or the feelings of inadequacy that I have experienced, but I want you to know how grateful I am for the privilege of serving the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p2" pid="PkOYm0Lvk0S-ZvjJLWoLEw" hash="db9tGw">The chorus of one of my favorite hymns entreats, “Lift up your heart! Lift up your voice! Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!” (“Rejoice, the Lord Is King!” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 66). The text of the hymn is taken from Paul’s writings to the Philippians: “Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.4" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 4:4</a>). The dictionary defines <span class="emphasis">rejoice</span> as “to feel joy or great delight” (<span class="emphasis">Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary,</span> 10th ed., s.v. “rejoice”).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p3" pid="CCRkZV7MukKwXDr2Tu9fmw" hash="cls8eg">The source of the kind of joy which causes us to rejoice is an understanding of the plan of salvation. The Savior in the Gospel of John was approaching the closing hours of His mortal life when He would take upon Himself the sins of the world. As He prepared His disciples for what He knew was to come, He told them, “A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.16" class="scriptureRef">John 16:16</a>). They were not yet ready to comprehend the Resurrection. Instead the Savior explained in gentle terms that He would leave and return and told them what they would feel: sorrow at His leaving, “but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.22" class="scriptureRef">John 16:22</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p4" pid="MJthflq4W0ihqIsziKCVhQ" hash="Gz0hcg">Just as the Savior’s death brought sorrow, the vicissitudes of life, like death, disease, poverty, and injury, can and often will bring unhappiness. Separation from those we love invariably brings sorrow and mourning. Life is not easy, and it would be improper to diminish in any way the trials and tribulations that most experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p5" pid="wvtjxq34LUGpNe6VQiS6Aw" hash="CX4iOg">That having been said, the Resurrection and Atonement wrought by the Savior and the promise of eternal life with our loved ones are of such overwhelming significance that to not rejoice would demonstrate a lack of understanding of the Savior’s gift.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p6" pid="B0hlVdOnQEqCDsGwmIUuyw" hash="-GfFNA">Joy comes when we have the Spirit in our lives (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:15</a>). When we have the Spirit, we rejoice in what the Savior has done for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p7" pid="c9BoyW-pZkeDwQ1RJ7UgtQ" hash="zL2PEA">What do we need to do to have this kind of joy? In addition to attaining saving ordinances and following the living prophet, we need to live in accordance with certain fundamental spiritual principles, such as prayer, scripture study, righteous living, and service to others. It is well understood that if we engage in sinful conduct, we must repent. Let me suggest three other areas or distractions we need to avoid in order to maintain joy and rejoice more fully in the Savior’s gift: (1) avoid distractions which keep us from doing what we ought to do, (2) avoid the magnification of small imperfections, and (3) avoid unfavorable comparisons with others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p8" pid="V8ytt75Gg0SI7ho8Vn6psA" hash="-l0zVg">We are often unaware of the distractions which push us in a material direction and keep us from a Christ-centered focus. In essence we let celestial goals get sidetracked by telestial distractions. In our family we call these telestial distractions “Saturday Morning Cartoons.” Let me explain.</p>
      <div class="figure" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.f2">
	<p pid="Ahqs0eVw5UGpLaSqQF77Ww" hash="8LTLYQ">When our children were small, my wife, Mary, and I decided to follow a tradition which my father taught when I was a child. He would meet with us individually to help us set goals in various aspects of our lives and then teach us how Church, school, and extracurricular activities would help us achieve those goals. He had three rules:</p>
	<ol class="number">
	  <li pid="_oHz8kFu0Ua5QAW2jcWz2g" hash="10xexA">
          <span class="label">1.</span>
          <p pid="5zTfVAXh2EW85uPz1NyXVw" hash="1OaoAg">We needed to have worthwhile goals.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="39NatNmQBEq48wsFMxunrQ" hash="TG5gKg">
          <span class="label">2.</span>
          <p pid="5A8vuVKTwkuTnNuhNttVIg" hash="BXH-GA">We could change our goals at any time.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="eJgQA7ceTU2F1dnonGLYYw" hash="ybIPlA">
          <span class="label">3.</span>
          <p pid="FgzwTDIaSEqBntv-tWhrkg" hash="-45ZiA">Whatever goal we chose, we had to diligently work towards it.</p>
        </li>
	</ol>
      </div>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p9" pid="dIcvCF2VOUWr7iPo6nJd0w" hash="WcIiqQ">Having been the beneficiary of this tradition, I had the desire to engage in this practice with my children. When our son, Larry, was five years old, I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He said he wanted to be a doctor like his Uncle Joe. Larry had experienced a serious operation and had acquired great respect for doctors, especially his Uncle Joe. I proceeded to tell Larry how all the worthwhile things he was doing would help prepare him to be a doctor.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p10" pid="k-U0tMRymUW7sqh7A-VjvA" hash="M0y3rw">Several months later, I asked him again what he would like to be. This time he said he wanted to be an airline pilot. Changing the goal was fine, so I proceeded to explain how his various activities would help him achieve this goal. Almost as an afterthought I said, “Larry, last time we talked you wanted to be a doctor. What has changed your mind?” He answered, “I still like the idea of being a doctor, but I have noticed that Uncle Joe works on Saturday mornings, and I wouldn’t want to miss Saturday Morning Cartoons.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p11" pid="HPY63s-Ym0GTAM1V2mzeDA" hash="34x1hw">Since that time our family has labeled a distraction from a worthwhile goal as a Saturday Morning Cartoon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p12" pid="KD0luyGyQkugJhNTYmRz1g" hash="f5Svtg">What are some of the Saturday Morning Cartoons that distract us from attaining the joy that we desire? Some want to be married in the temple but only date those who do not qualify for a recommend. Others want to be a good home teacher or visiting teacher but are distracted by the constant parade of TV programs, catalogs, and other material maintenance and don’t find time to minister to those they are assigned to teach. Still others want to have family prayer but allow little matters to build into discord that make it harder for the family to kneel together. If we examine the reasons we don’t do what we ought to do, we find that the list of Saturday Morning Cartoons is almost endless.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p13" pid="5SHlGXp8r0mRmSc9ztDZ6A" hash="2z_XPg">Speaking of those who will not inherit a kingdom of glory, the Lord said, “For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:33</a>). The greatest gift to all mankind is the Atonement of Jesus Christ. If we are to rejoice in this gift, we need to avoid the Saturday Morning Cartoons of life which distract our focus from the Savior and the celestial goal for which we strive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p14" pid="ZVFAkWyIiESVhtKpFKy9Pg" hash="83a6VQ">A second group who do not find joy are distracted by magnifying small areas of imperfection so as to drive out happiness. Some have allowed their own perceptions of imperfection to cloud the reality of their lives. An objective outsider observing them would conclude that they should be joyful. But they do not feel to rejoice. They are like the couple who have been invited to visit a beautiful garden. Instead of celebrating the visual feast, they see only the few wilted flowers and weeds and the relatively small areas which are not beautiful to behold. They do not feel the garden meets their expectations. In like manner, they are unduly critical of themselves and of others. They have become accustomed to exaggerating small imperfections and underestimating great blessings and have lost the capacity to rejoice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p15" pid="cSyaOqdDYEOzieM5K0aKjA" hash="x14oJg">The Savior in Luke mildly cautioned Martha about this approach when she complained that her sister Mary was spending too much time listening to the Savior instead of serving temporal needs. He said, “Martha, Martha, thou art … troubled about many things” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.41" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:41</a>). The Savior then indicated that Mary was focused on what really mattered.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p16" pid="tMhTifuHtkeWxihGvfwidw" hash="nckojA">A third area of distraction that can destroy joy is comparing our talents and blessings with others. The growth in our own talents is the best measure of personal progress. In recent years the concept of “personal best” has become widely accepted. This has great merit. Remember we usually judge others at their best and ourselves at our worst. In the parable of the talents, the servants who received five talents and two talents were praised by the Lord for increasing their talents and told to “enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” The servant who was rebuked was the servant who buried the talent given him. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.14-30" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:14–30</a>.) Comparing blessings is almost certain to drive out joy. We cannot be grateful and envious at the same time. If we truly want to have the Spirit of the Lord and experience joy and happiness, we should rejoice in our blessings and be grateful. We should especially rejoice in the blessings that are available through the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p17" pid="PC37Q5GcSE25SLR3z7nNYQ" hash="pSuJBQ">On April 3, 1836, the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were engaged in sacred spiritual worship in the Kirtland Temple. After a solemn and silent prayer, the Lord appeared to them and accepted the Kirtland Temple as His house.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p18" pid="oX2Q5t4uTE-1g0lL1WFqyw" hash="hb2cjw">The marvelous description of the Savior and the appearance of ancient prophets who restored essential keys make the 110th section of the Doctrine and Covenants one of the most sacred and profound of all the communications the Lord has given us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p19" pid="v6sLZD4N-UGzrOc8Xaipiw" hash="zDTWkg">Some of the most beautiful words in this section, or that any of us could ever hope to hear, are contained in verses 5 and 6:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p20" pid="wnlAtHk5Z0a7hykRwIP4eQ" hash="Tl_9VA">“Behold, your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me; therefore, lift up your heads and rejoice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p21" pid="hSmFUAaj_0aW6FMSztr5Sw" hash="XkQaZQ">“Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all my people rejoice, who have, with their might, built this house to my name.” [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.5-6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 110:5–6</a>]</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/rejoice.p22" pid="RH2SwM-hfEKAB6dogQjrPg" hash="j7nWmA">Brothers and sisters, let us avoid the Saturday Morning Cartoons of life, particularly those that would keep us from the temple. Let us rejoice in the promise that is ours through the Atonement of the Savior and through Christlike living adhere to the counsel of the Psalmist: “This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/118.24" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 118:24</a>). That each of us may do this is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p1" pid="Kk6phUZCwkKlrBPizg9ceg" hash="KXs_kQ">A number of years ago I was in Atlanta, Georgia, as an attorney representing a man who was buying a business. After several days of negotiations we reached an agreement and signed the closing documents. That evening one of the sellers invited us to a dinner to celebrate the closing. When I arrived, he offered me an alcoholic drink, which I declined. He then said, “Are you a Saint?” I didn’t fully understand what he meant, and he repeated, “Are you a Latter-day Saint?” I responded, “Yes, I am,” and he said he had been observing my personal habits during our negotiations and had concluded that I was either LDS or had a stomach problem. We both chuckled. He then informed me that he had only known one member of the Church on a personal basis, David B. Haight. They were both executives in Chicago with a large retail chain following World War II. He told me of the significant influence Elder Haight had been in his life and that he held him in the highest regard.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p2" pid="rbjbXwCPxU6ZUFI6UUWCpg" hash="PWIryQ">As I flew back home to San Francisco, I thought about what had occurred, especially in two respects: I was surprised at how it felt to be asked if I was a Saint, and I was impressed with the positive influence one outstanding example—Elder Haight—had on this good man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p3" pid="aiRuX8QKuU64UPnPVUtUxA" hash="KmA--A">What does it mean to be a Saint? In the Lord’s Church, the members are Latter-day Saints, and they attempt to emulate the Savior, follow His teachings, and receive saving ordinances in order to live in the celestial kingdom with God the Father and our Savior Jesus Christ.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> The Savior said, “This is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p4" pid="0FTSJmEo6kGuNYU9rU1vFw" hash="MDQgNg">It is not easy to be a Latter-day Saint. It was not meant to be easy. The ultimate goal of living in the presence of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, is a privilege almost beyond comprehension.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p5" pid="EkeDl8Iglki3nIZ7ftvorg" hash="lw_gpQ">Among the greatest trials the Church has ever faced were the Martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith and then ultimately the expulsion of the Saints from Nauvoo. When they were making their way across the plains under very adverse circumstances, William Clayton penned the great hymn “Come, Come, Ye Saints.” It was a hymn that stirred their souls and helped them remember their sacred mission. Who among us does not become emotional as we feel their sacrifice, courage, and commitment when we sing: “And should we die before our journey’s through, / Happy day! All is well!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p6" pid="Hn__53uVbEKcAVc0vGfdpQ" hash="kmHZVg">This hymn gave them comfort, solace, and hope in a time of great difficulty with almost insurmountable obstacles. It buoyed them up and highlighted the fact that this mortal life is a journey between premortal life and eternal life to come—the great plan of happiness. Brother Clayton’s inspiring hymn emphasizes sacrifices and what it really means to be a Saint. Our pioneer members met the challenges of their day to be Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p7" pid="dVyzZ22zO0mZbnItipleeQ" hash="QSfu0A">The word <span class="emphasis">saint</span> in Greek denotes “set apart, separate, [and] holy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> If we are to be Saints in our day, we need to separate ourselves from evil conduct and destructive pursuits that are prevalent in the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p8" pid="yGLRFSJu3UChKJ9jFnqNpA" hash="rTkEmg">We are bombarded with visual images of violence and immorality. Inappropriate music and pornography are increasingly tolerated. The use of drugs and alcohol is rampant. There is less emphasis on honesty and character. Individual rights are demanded, but duties, responsibilities, and obligations are neglected. There has been a coarsening of dialogue and increased exposure to that which is base and vulgar. The adversary has been relentless in his efforts to undermine the plan of happiness. If we separate ourselves from this worldly conduct, we will have the Spirit in our lives and experience the joy of being worthy Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p9" pid="wyYoQoGcm0mTpCHvHHGtFA" hash="XAuxBA">As Saints, we also need to avoid the worship of worldly gods. President Hinckley has expressed the desire that “everyone might have some of the good things of life” but has cautioned, “It is the obsession with riches that cankers and destroys.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p10" pid="FhmyoKKZ3U2nsjNYilF7Ng" hash="Ihf4tQ">In 1630 John Winthrop set forth a vision for the new land (America) on behalf of his fellow passengers as he sailed on board the <span class="emphasis">Arbella.</span> It has become known as “The City upon a Hill” sermon. In the final paragraph, Winthrop references Deuteronomy 30 [<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/30.title" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 30</a>] and warns against worshiping and serving other gods—particularly emphasizing “pleasures, and profits.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> In the recent past President Kimball counseled that even homes, boats, credentials, titles, and other similar pursuits can be worshiped as idols when they entice us away from love and service to God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p11" pid="nCh6uR9rYUe6TDUrJQkdHw" hash="FYUbMg">The prophet Moroni, speaking of our day, warned about the love of money and substance and suggested that we would love them more than we “love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p12" pid="4HLsRbKlsEeo955FITFjFA" hash="01TyIw">If we are to be worthy Saints, we should minister to others and adhere to the Savior’s admonition to love God and our fellowmen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/are-you-a-saint.p13" pid="FfI3GTCxVUGkolVHdEqjWw" hash="uuFWTw">Separation from the evils of the world needs to be accompanied by holiness. A Saint loves the Savior and follows Him in holiness and devotion.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Evidence of this kind of holiness and devotion is exemplified by consecration and sacrifice. President Hinckley has taught, “Without sacrifice there is no true worship of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Sacrifice is the crowning test of the gospel. It means consecrating time, talents, energy, and earthly possessions to further the work of God. In Doctrine and Covenants 97, verse 8 [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 97:8</a>], it concludes, “All … who … are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice—yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command—they are accepted of me.”</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="70"></span>Dear brothers and sisters, I join with you in expressing my love and sustaining support to President Eyring and his family. President Hinckley extended this call to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve late Thursday afternoon. I cannot possibly articulate the kaleidoscope of feelings I have experienced since then. There have been sleepless nights and much prayer. My spirits have been buoyed, however, by the knowledge that President Hinckley is the prophet and that the membership of the Church will be praying for me and my family.</p>

When I was called as a General Authority in April of 1996, I also felt unequal to the calling. Elder Neal A. Maxwell reassured me then that the most important qualification for all of us serving in the kingdom is to be comfortable in bearing witness of the divinity of the Savior. A peace came over me at that time and has stayed with me since because I love the Savior and have had spiritual experiences that allow me to testify of Him. I rejoice in the opportunity to bear witness of Jesus Christ in all the world (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:23</a>), notwithstanding my inadequacies.</p>

We served for two years in the Philippines. In April of 1961, President Hinckley, then an Assistant to the Twelve, sent the first missionaries to Manila. There was only one Filipino priesthood holder in the Philippines. Today there are almost 600,000 members. Their lives are not easy, and they lack many material things, but they love the Savior. The gospel is having a tremendous impact in improving their lives. What a blessing to serve in their midst.</p>

It is significant that almost 25 percent of all the Polynesians in the world are members of the Church. Their faith and spirituality are legendary. Sister Cook and I were in Vava‘u in the Tongan islands on one occasion. I had just spoken about following the prophet in the general session of stake conference. At the luncheon following the conference, I sat next to a distinguished elderly patriarch. He indicated how grateful he was to hear what the prophet was teaching. He gave me the following account. Vava‘u, which is a relatively small island, usually has sufficient rain, but periodically there are severe droughts. The island has long inlets or bays, almost like sounds, which curl into the island below steep hills. When drought conditions left the village without water, there was only one way they could obtain fresh water and stay alive. Over the centuries they had found that fresh water traveled down through rock formations inside <span class="pageBreak" page-number="72"></span>the mountains and came up in a few spots in the sea.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p" pid="UkiFtMkSIkGFMI4NxLQiPQ" hash="_NaGYA">The Tongan men would set off in their small boats with a wise elder standing at one end of the boat looking for just the right spot. The strong young men in the boat stood ready with containers to dive deep into the seawater. When they reached the appropriate spot, the wise man would raise both arms to heaven. That was the signal. The strong young men would dive off the boat as deep as they could and fill the containers with fresh springwater. This old patriarch likened this lifesaving tradition to the living waters of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the wise man to God’s prophet here on earth. He noted that the water was pure, fresh, and, in their drought condition, lifesaving. But it was not easy to find. It was not visible to the untrained eye. This patriarch wanted to know everything the prophet was teaching.</p>

The world is in desperate need of the fresh springwater, which is the gospel of Jesus Christ. We should listen intently to the prophet as we make choices. My own informal records indicate that President Hinckley has continually emphasized faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. That has been followed by his emphasis on strengthening families and having family religious observance in the home. Over and over again he has told us that if we would live a principle, we would gain a testimony of the truthfulness of that principle, which would in turn increase our faith.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service</span> was first introduced in October 2004.

Elder Ballard and I felt that the windows of heaven were opened and the Lord’s inspiration poured out to bring forth this great resource. Over 1.5 million copies of <span class="emphasis">Preach My Gospel</span> have been acquired by the members of the Church.

We must take upon us His name and receive His image in our countenance so that when He comes we will be more like Him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/3.2" class="scriptureRef">1 John 3:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>). When we choose to follow Christ in faith rather than choosing another path out of fear, we are blessed with a consequence that is consistent with our choice (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.34-36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:34–36</a>).</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="47"></span>My dear brethren of the priesthood, I am grateful to be with you at this session of general conference on this historic day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p2" pid="sFxve9XH-kSK7dYfUYc04g" hash="qQiJ0Q">We admire those who risk their lives to rescue those in danger.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> When I visited Southern California during the devastating Santa Ana wind fires late last year, I came away with two impressions. The first was how the Church members came to the assistance of those in need. The second was how appreciative they were to the firefighters. One homeowner described what he saw the firefighters do. He pointed out that the Santa Ana winds blow from the warm desert toward the ocean. Once a fire starts, these hot desert winds carry the flames at a speed of up to 60 or 70 miles (97–113 km) per hour. The homeowner described his gratitude and admiration as he watched the firefighters standing with their hoses behind a cleared area, facing a wall of fire up to 10 feet (3 m) high descending upon them at this enormous speed. These brave men and women were able to rescue both people and homes while in constant personal danger.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p3" pid="C-ovEN-woUmq_3hWEsS1hg" hash="8l72DA">From time to time, as individuals and as a church, we go through periods of crisis and danger. Some arise quickly like a fire. Others are subtle and go almost undetected before they are upon us. Some require heroic action, but most are less spectacular. The way we respond is crucial. My purpose this evening is to reemphasize to priesthood holders the importance of heeding the words of the prophets. This is one sure way to respond to physical and spiritual dangers of all kinds. Some illustrations may be helpful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p4" pid="EI-2a0L_AU6QTJNhQaH0UA" hash="-pm_mw">Many of you have participated in treks to experience and appreciate the dramatic rescue of the Willie and Martin handcart companies. I first became aware of this rescue when I was a teenager. My mother gave me a book written by Orson F. Whitney, who would later be an Apostle.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Elder Whitney’s book acquainted me with the heroic effort directed by Brigham Young to rescue the handcart companies. They had been overtaken by winter storms on the high plains of Wyoming. Some had died and many others were on the verge of death. Brigham Young became aware of their plight, and at the October 1856 general conference he instructed the Saints to drop everything and rescue those stranded on the plains.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p5" pid="KRFlIfalKUytulOPE9LPmA" hash="8CVmrA">The response was dramatic. Elder Whitney reported, “Brave men by their heroism—for it was at the peril of their own lives that they thus braved the wintry storms on the plains—immortalized themselves, and won the undying gratitude of hundreds who were undoubtedly saved by their timely action from perishing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p6" pid="jWP7CyJVfUqiEHPflOmjyg" hash="GSVQdg">One reason my mother had given me the book was Elder Whitney had made special mention of my great-grandfather David Patten Kimball, who had participated in the rescue when he was 17 years old. All the rescuers battled deep snow and freezing temperatures during much of the rescue of the handcart companies. At great personal sacrifice, David and his associates helped carry many of the pioneers across the freezing, ice-filled Sweetwater.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p7" pid="arKRRhGky0qYIHWNObSUFA" hash="aKkn6A">This true account greatly impressed me. I wanted to prove my devotion to the Lord through some dramatic act. However, in a visit with my grandfather, he explained that when President Brigham Young sent his father, David, and the other young men on their rescue mission, President Young instructed them to do everything they possibly could to save the handcart companies, even at the peril of their own lives.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Their acts of bravery were specifically to “follow the prophet Brigham Young” and by so doing express their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. My grandfather told me that consistent, faithful dedication <span class="pageBreak" page-number="48"></span>to the counsel of a prophet is the real lesson I should learn from my great-grandfather’s service. As heroic as it was for David and his associates to help rescue the pioneers, it is also valiant today to follow the counsel of our prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p8" pid="0RkXAD0Ge0-OfEE0X91FuA" hash="AFeQKg">An often-told account from the Old Testament illustrates this principle. Naaman, a prominent leader in Syria, was afflicted with leprosy. He became aware that the prophet Elisha in Israel might be able to heal him. Elisha sent word by a messenger that Naaman should wash himself in the river Jordan seven times. Initially, Naaman was upset with this counsel. However, his servants said, “If the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it?” Then Naaman followed the counsel of the prophet Elisha, and he was made clean.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/give-heed-unto-the-prophets-words.p9" pid="A4liYxt4e06fsZJbNee-Rg" hash="XuhmGQ">Like Naaman, you young priesthood holders might aspire to “do some great thing” or participate in something dramatic like the handcart rescue. However, your resolve should be to follow the counsel of the prophet. The First Presidency has reaffirmed its commitment to increasing the worthiness of young people who are recommended for missionary service. Keeping yourselves free from the sins of the world and meeting the high standards for missionary service should be one goal. Preparing yourselves to proclaim the gospel and rescue some of Heavenly Father’s children spiritually would be both significant and heroic. You can meet this challenge.</p>

Monson as our prophet, seer, and revelator and as the 16th President of the Church in this dispensation. Later in this priesthood session of conference we will be blessed to hear his first general conference address as President of the Church. We will want to sustain him with our hearts and our actions as we pay careful attention to what he teaches and what we feel.</p>

As an example, President Heber J. Grant, the prophet from 1918 to 1945, was inspired to emphasize adherence to the Word of Wisdom,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> the principle with a promise revealed by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> He stressed the importance of not smoking or drinking alcoholic beverages and directed the bishops to review these principles in temple recommend interviews.</p>

The medical profession accepted smoking with little concern because the scientific studies linking cigarette smoking with several kinds of cancer were far in the future. President Grant counseled with great vigor, and we became known as a people who abstained from drinking and smoking.</p>

Unfortunately, there appears to be a resurgence of drug use in our own day. Living the Word of Wisdom today will free you from some of the most serious dangers you can face in this life.</p>

As an example, President David O. McKay was the prophet from 1951 to 1970. One area of significant focus was his emphasis on the family. He taught that no success in life can compensate for failure in the home.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> He encouraged members to strengthen families by increasing religious observance. His teachings were a protection from the disintegration of the institution of marriage that came after his death.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Because of President <span class="pageBreak" page-number="49"></span>McKay’s teaching, the Latter-day Saints strengthened their commitment to family and eternal marriage.</p>

Monson has been prepared by the Lord from his youth to be the prophet.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> After serving in the navy at the close of World War II, he was ordained as a bishop at age 22 and then served in a stake presidency. At 32 years of age he served as a mission president in Canada with his sweetheart and companion, Frances Monson. He was called to be an Apostle by President McKay when he was only 36 years old. He is the youngest man called as an Apostle in the past 98 years and has served for over 44 years. The last 22 years he has served as a counselor to Presidents Ezra Taft Benson, Howard W. Hunter, and Gordon B. Hinckley.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>

It contains important priesthood principles. The first instruction is to be “faithful in counsel.” President Monson has faithfully counseled with each of the three prophets under whom he has served. The unity of the First Presidency in all of their important decisions has been an example to all of us as priesthood holders in the exercise of Church government.</p>

His personal missionary effort, his supervisory work of the Missionary Department, and his calling and training of mission presidents have been undertaken with enthusiasm. He made significant contributions to the new missionary guide, <span class="emphasis">Preach My Gospel.</span> In addition to valuable content contributions, he inspired the inclusion of true accounts to make the guide come alive. With his printer’s eye, he improved the design and layout. He is indeed a great missionary.</p>

It is in our Christlike outreach to them that we as priesthood leaders, parents, friends, and home teachers can be like the handcart company rescuers.</p>

As a bishop he learned to <span class="pageBreak" page-number="5"></span>minister to the members of his ward. He has kept in touch with and served their children and grandchildren.

His long years of oversight of humanitarian efforts have blessed people all over the world, both members and those not of our faith. His personal ministry has been Christlike and has given comfort and peace to countless numbers of people. One friend of mine who lost a grandson in a tragic accident told me that his grief was almost beyond comprehension. President Monson’s ministering to him turned almost overwhelming grief to the peace that surpasses understanding. His effort to personally minister to those who are sick and afflicted has been extraordinary.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="102"></span>Last winter my daughter had a white-knuckle experience driving in a severe snowstorm. She reminded me of a similar situation I had with my two sons many years ago. My youngest son, Joe, was three years old, and my son Larry was six. We were traveling by car from San Francisco to Utah in June. The weather had been very good.</p>

None of the drivers was prepared. A semitruck in front of us had jackknifed and was spread across two lanes. Other trucks and cars had slid off the freeway. One lane was open, and many vehicles, including ours, were desperately trying to gain traction to avoid the other vehicles. All traffic then came to a halt.</p>

However, many of the trials and hardships we encounter in life are severe and appear to have lasting consequences. Each of us will experience some of these during the vicissitudes of life. Many listening to this conference are experiencing situations of a most serious nature at this very moment.</p>

Brigham Young captured this somewhat humorously in February 1856 when he stated: “I might say something with regard to the hard times. You know that I have told you that if any one was afraid of starving to death, let him leave, and go where there is plenty. I do not apprehend the least danger of starving, for until we eat up the last mule, from the tip of the ear to the end of the fly whipper, I am not afraid of starving to death.”</p>

The recent economic crisis has caused significant concern throughout the world. Employment and financial problems are not unusual. Many people have physical and mental health challenges. Others deal with marital problems or wayward children. Some have lost loved ones. Addictions and inappropriate or harmful propensities cause heartache. Whatever the source of the trials, they cause significant pain and suffering for individuals and those who love them.</p>

Regardless of the challenges, trials, and hardships we endure, the reassuring doctrine of the Atonement wrought by Jesus Christ includes Alma’s teaching that the Savior would take upon Him our infirmities and “succor his people according to their infirmities.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>

He proclaims, “If ye are prepared ye shall not fear.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> Part of the trauma I experienced crossing the Sierras in that blizzard many years ago occurred because I was not prepared for this sudden, unexpected event. One of the great blessings of the scriptures is that they warn us of challenges that are unexpected but often occur. We would do well to be prepared for them. One form of preparation is to keep the commandments.</p>

Despite the obvious nature of the hardships the pioneers were experiencing, President Brigham Young talked about the significance of gratitude. He stated, “I do not know of any, excepting the unpardonable sin, that is greater than the sin of ingratitude.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span></p>

Early in October, 10 years ago, she kissed her husband, Leon, good-bye as he left to go to work in Salt Lake City. This would be the last time she would see Leon alive. He had a collision with a young man 20 years of age who was late for his first job and had tried to pass a slower vehicle, resulting in a head-on collision that killed them both instantly. Sister Yates said that after two compassionate highway patrolmen told her the news, she plunged into shock and grief.</p>

The bishop called Sister Yates and told her that the young man’s mother, Jolayne Willmore, wanted to talk with her. She remembers “being shocked because I was so centered on my grief and pain that I had not even thought about the young man and his family. I suddenly realized that here was a mother who was in as much or more pain than I was. I quickly gave my permission … for a visit.”</p>

Sister Yates says, “When times become too hard to bear, I look at this picture and remember that Christ knows me personally. He knows my loneliness and my trials.” One scripture that comforts Sister Yates is “Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span></p>

Sister Yates concludes, “Through this trial, I have felt the love of my Father in Heaven and my Savior in greater abundance than I had ever felt before.” She testifies that “there is no grief, no pain, no sickness so great that the Atonement of Christ and the love of Christ cannot heal.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span> What a wonderful example of love and forgiveness these two sisters have demonstrated. It has allowed the Atonement of Jesus Christ to be efficacious in their lives.</p>

His purpose was to report on the Latter-day Saint converts who were emigrating to build up the Church in the American West. There had been thousands of converts who had already emigrated, and much had been written, particularly in the British media, about them and their beliefs. Most of what was written was unfavorable.</p>

For instance, with respect to the doctrine that revelation still exists, some very good people have been confident that the Church could not be true because they have been taught, and therefore believe, that the heavens are closed and there will be no additional revelation, no scripture, and no pronouncements from heaven. Let me emphasize that this widely held belief is not scriptural, but it is a stumbling block to some.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

It wasn’t until the discovery of Australia that swans of a different color were discovered. The author uses this analogy to help explain events which have actually occurred but were not expected.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> As I thought about this analogy, I realized that many people have refused to seriously investigate the Church because they believe there can be no revelation in this dispensation. One convert, who is now serving as a mission president, describes how difficult this was for him when he was investigating the Church. He said, “I had been taught all my life that there would never again be prophets and apostles here upon the earth. So to accept Joseph Smith as a prophet created a large stumbling block.” However, when he prayed, he states, “I received a witness that in fact the gospel had been restored to the earth and that Joseph Smith was truly a prophet of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

He was born in 1820 in Connecticut. In his diary he notes that he had made a covenant with the Lord to serve Him if he could find the right way. He attended many churches and at one was asked to “testify [and] join the church [and] be a Christian.” His response was he “could not tell which one to join, there were so many.” He continued to investigate several churches. One doctrine was of particular significance to him. He explained: “Sometimes they found fault with me because I wanted a more liberal salvation for the family of man. I could not believe the Lord had made a part to be saved and a great part to be damned to all eternity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Because of this doctrine, he allowed his name to be taken off the records of one Protestant religion. When the LDS missionaries taught him the true doctrine of the plan of salvation in 1844, he was baptized.</p>

When I was a small boy, I would visit my grandparents at their ranch during the summer. There was no electrical power, running water, or indoor plumbing. There was, however, a spring of water next to their small ranch house. The spring created a little pond of clear, pure water, where several times a day I would help my grandmother carry water to the house for drinking, cooking, bathing, and washing clothes. My grandparents loved this life-giving spring and took special precautions to protect it.</p>

He was upset with the damage and the pollution. To him, it was a violation of a trust he had observed all his working life.

A loving Father in Heaven has provided us with the means to bring His spirit children into this world to fulfill the full measure of their creation.

Those who rationalize remind us of little children who cover their eyes, convinced that if they can’t see us, we can’t see them. I would suggest that if we think about giving an accounting of our actions to the Savior, our rationalizations will be seen in their true light.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="83"></span>It is a significant responsibility to speak on Easter Sunday to Latter-day Saints across the world, who love our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. We celebrate this morning His victory over death. We cherish our understanding and feel heartfelt appreciation for the Savior’s willing atoning sacrifice on our behalf. His acquiescence to the will of His Father won the supernal victory over death and is the transcendent event in the history of mankind. I appreciate this opportunity to speak about following the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p2" pid="jwEmsgF2X0CLbpocIRaaxA" hash="zuBiXg">The final two days of the Savior’s mortal ministry prior to His Crucifixion are profoundly important and in some ways beyond comprehension. So much of what is essential to our eternal destiny occurred on Thursday and then Friday, the day Christ was crucified. The Last Supper, a Passover supper, the “established memorial of Israel’s deliverance from bondage,” was commenced Thursday evening.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Ordinances and doctrines of great importance were initiated at the Last Supper. I will mention just three. First, the Savior introduced the ordinance of the sacrament. He took bread, broke it, prayed over it, and passed it to His disciples, saying, “This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> In this manner He instituted the sacrament. Second, His overwhelming emphasis was on doctrines teaching love as a preeminent principle. He taught, “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Third, through Christ’s intercession or direction, “the Holy Ghost was promised to the apostles” as another Comforter.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p3" pid="6Vd6FH5x8EetTjCeQkwMRw" hash="I5kJyg">The Savior subsequently accomplished the Atonement. He took upon Himself the “burden of the sins of mankind” and the “horrors that Satan … could inflict.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> In this process He endured the fraudulently concocted trials and the terrible, tragic events leading to His Crucifixion. This ultimately culminated in Christ’s triumphant Resurrection on Easter Sunday. Christ fulfilled His sacred mission as Savior and Redeemer. We will be resurrected from death and have <span class="pageBreak" page-number="84"></span>our spirits reunited with our bodies. Based on personal worthiness, we may through His grace have the glorious opportunity of entering back into the presence of God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p4" pid="ehdTPA83FUe2hUokjUIg-g" hash="rfPQ6Q">The Prophet Joseph Smith, speaking of these Easter events, said, “The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p5" pid="Mpq4jcRJGEqdozzShbPhPw" hash="xPN4UQ">While we rejoice in the supernal significance of Gethsemane and Calvary, our focus has always been on the resurrected Lord. Frederic Farrar, the English theologian and believer, testified that the earliest generation of believers in the primitive Christian Church celebrated the Savior as “the Risen, the Eternal, the Glorified Christ” and “contemplated Him, not as on the Cross, but as on the Throne.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p7" pid="rE6crA68m0umc7GFDZ0Urw" hash="At51iw">As we ponder what it means to be Christians today, think about what our path of discipleship will require of us. I suggest that we contemplate and in appropriate ways emulate what the Savior did in those last two days of His mortal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p8" pid="mf5mX3cLsk60YzJdkhh_5Q" hash="OvS-cw">First, consider the Savior’s introduction of the sacrament. The Savior knew what was about to befall Him. His sacred, atoning mission, beginning with the War in Heaven in the premortal existence, was about to unfold that evening and the next day. Yet with the trials by His adversaries imminently before Him, there is not the slightest evidence He was preparing a defense against the untrue accusations. The Savior instead introduced the sacred ordinance of the sacrament to His disciples. As I contemplate that solemn occasion, my feelings are deeply touched. Sacrament meeting is the most sacred and holy of all the meetings in the Church. After His Resurrection, the Savior instituted the sacrament among the Nephites.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> If we are to be His disciples and to be committed members of His Church, we must remember and reverence the sacrament. It allows each of us to express with broken hearts and contrite spirits our willingness to follow the Savior, to repent, and to become a Saint through the Atonement of Christ.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> The sacrament allows us to witness to God that we will remember His Son and keep His commandments as we renew our baptismal covenant.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> This increases our love and appreciation for both the Father and the Son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p9" pid="kapG0DrwHkSie-RQHl2j_A" hash="1aRGJQ">The Savior also emphasized love and unity and declared that we would be known as His disciples if we have love one to another. In the face of the eternity-shaping Atonement He was about to undertake, such a commandment requires our obedience. We manifest our love for God when we keep His commandments and serve His children. We don’t fully comprehend the Atonement, but we can spend our lives trying to be more loving and kind, regardless of the adversity we face.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p10" pid="5xLKtF5YN0WCgB5L9PA9DA" hash="d3ll1A">The Savior’s charge to His disciples to love one another—and the dramatic and powerful way He taught this principle at the Last Supper—is one of the most poignant and beautiful episodes from the last days of His mortal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p11" pid="3sLQfQKOjkaoL4zLDjzLDA" hash="VkoZsw">He was not teaching a simple class in ethical behavior. This was the Son of God pleading with His Apostles and all disciples who would come after them to remember and follow this most central of His teachings. How we relate and interact with each other is a measure of our willingness to follow Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p12" pid="2wEVnjOIe0eGjpFPrFRCTg" hash="dgXqAw">As we listen to the messages of this conference, we will be touched in our hearts and make resolutions and commitments to do better. But on Monday morning we will return to work, school, neighborhoods, and to a world that in many cases is in turmoil. Many in this world are afraid and angry with one another. While we understand these feelings, we need to be civil in our discourse and respectful in our interactions. This is especially true when we disagree. The Savior taught us to love even our enemies.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> The vast majority of our members heed this counsel. Yet there are some who feel that venting their personal anger or deeply held opinions is more important than conducting themselves as <span class="pageBreak" page-number="85"></span>Jesus Christ lived and taught. I invite each one of us individually to recognize that how we disagree is a real measure of who we are and whether we truly follow the Savior. It is appropriate to disagree, but it is not appropriate to be disagreeable. Violence and vandalism are not the answer to our disagreements. If we show love and respect even in adverse circumstances, we become more like Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p13" pid="5EhaDu2iAkOljxdfjRvUSA" hash="fbe6YQ">The Savior’s promise of the Holy Ghost to the Apostles is of supreme importance in recognizing the preeminent role of the Holy Ghost, the third member of the Godhead. The Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit, the Comforter, who bears witness of the Father and the Son, reveals the truth of all things, and sanctifies those who have repented and been baptized. He is referred to as the Holy Spirit of Promise and as such confirms as acceptable to God the righteous acts, ordinances, and covenants of each of us.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> They who are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise receive all that the Father has.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>

If we want to have the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, we must find time to slow down, ponder, pray, and live so we are worthy to receive and act upon His promptings. We will avoid major mistakes if we heed His warnings. It is our privilege as members to receive light and knowledge from Him even to the perfect day.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

He faced mental, physical, and spiritual afflictions that are beyond our comprehension. In the garden, He prayed to His Father, saying, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> As His disciples, there will be times when we will be tried and persecuted unjustly and mocked unfairly and face temporal and spiritual storms of a magnitude that will seem unbearable to us and experience bitter cups that we pray would pass from us. No one is exempt from the storms of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p16" pid="EwuyMAEBeEKVwMr47LPUsg" hash="qzspdQ">We are preparing for the Second Coming of the Savior. The scriptures are clear that no one knows when this will occur. The scriptures do tell us that in the last days, among the bitter cups we will face, there will be “earthquakes, in divers places”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> and the “waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/we-follow-jesus-christ.p17" pid="nKnET5CLwkaa7ZODMiKYRQ" hash="nVdm-A">Devastating earthquakes and tsunamis have recently occurred in diverse places, including Chile, Haiti, and the islands of the Pacific. A few weeks ago Presiding Bishop H. David Burton, Elder Tad R. Callister, and I were able to meet with the Saints who had lost family members as a result of the tsunami that hit the eastern side of Samoa last September. The chapel was full, and it was an emotional meeting. We were able to assure these choice members that because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, they can be reunited with the loved ones they have lost.</p>

He honked his horn and stopped <span class="pageBreak" page-number="86"></span>children on the road walking to school and warned them to run for higher ground and safety as fast as they could. The children followed his instruction. He frantically drove, reached his four-year-old daughter, put her in the car, and then tried to get to his mother. Before he could reach his mother, the wall of water picked up his car and swept it over 100 yards (91 m), where it lodged in a tree. He scrambled to secure his daughter on top of the car and then swam to rescue his mother, who was clinging to a branch of another tree near their house. With great effort he swam with her to the car and safety. Many were not as fortunate. They did not have time to get to higher ground and safety. Many lost their lives, particularly the young and the elderly.</p>

The Savior’s example and life teach us to spiritually avoid the low pathway, where the things of this world dominate. As I shook hands with the members after our meeting, one sister told me her family had not been to the temple and they had lost a daughter. She tearfully said their goal now was to prepare themselves for the sacred ordinances of the temple so they can be together eternally.</p>

For my birthday present, my wife, Mary, gave me a CD containing songs of hope and faith performed by a famous British singer named Vera Lynn, who inspired her listeners during the dark days of the Second World War.</p>

The bombing of London in September 1940 commenced the day before I was born.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> My mother, listening to the account of the London Blitz on the radio in her hospital room, decided to name me after the radio announcer, whose first name was Quentin.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/let-there-be-light.p4" pid="0ReZ8SxfdkyAmcuIdPlG7Q" hash="a5TstQ">One song, titled “When the Lights Go on Again (All over the World),” deeply touched me. The song brought two thoughts to my mind—first, the prophetic words by a British statesman: “The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our time”;<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> and second, the bombing raids conducted over British cities like London. To make it harder for the attacking bombers to find a target, blackouts were instituted. Lights were turned out, and windows were draped.</p>

For those of us who understand the role of the Savior and the Light of Christ<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> in the ongoing conflict between good and evil, the analogy between that world war and the moral conflict today is clear. It is by the Light of Christ that all mankind “may know good from evil.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

While our primary effort must be to seek light and truth, we would be wise to black out from our homes the lethal bombs that destroy spiritual development and growth. Pornography, in particular, is a weapon of mass moral destruction. Its impact is at the forefront in eroding moral values. Some TV programs and Internet sites are equally lethal. These evil forces remove light and hope from the world. The level of decadence is accelerating.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> If we do not black out evil from our homes and lives, do not be surprised if devastating moral explosions shatter the peace which is the reward for righteous living. Our responsibility is to be in the world but not of the world.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/let-there-be-light.p12" pid="CFsnKHuphEyhaVs3UWRpbA" hash="HFk-PA">This question is of monumental importance.

I believe that light and truth will be preserved in our time. In all nations there are large numbers who worship God and feel accountable to Him for their conduct. Some observers believe there is actually a global revival of faith.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> As Church leaders, we have met with leaders of other faiths and have found that there is a common moral foundation that transcends theological differences and unites us in our aspirations for a better society.</p>

But make no mistake: there are also people who are determined to both destroy faith and reject any religious influence in society. Other evil people exploit, manipulate, and tear down society with drugs, pornography, sexual exploitation, human trafficking, robbery, and dishonest business practices. The power and influence of these people is very large even if they are relatively small in number.</p>

The Light of Christ, which is distinct from the Holy Ghost, informs their conscience. We know from the scriptures that the Light of Christ is “the Spirit [which] giveth light to every man that cometh into the world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> This light is given “for the sake of the whole world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> President Boyd K. Packer has taught that this is a “source of inspiration, which each of us possesses in common with all other members of the human family.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> This is why many will accept moral values even when founded on religious convictions which they do not personally support. As we read in Mosiah in the Book of Mormon, “It is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right.” Mosiah then warns, “If the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span></p>

The bishop wrote that a member of his congregation, a former employee of my client, had taken materials from my client’s work site and had rationalized that they were surplus. But after becoming a committed Latter-day Saint and attempting to follow Jesus Christ, this employee recognized that what he had done was dishonest. Enclosed in the letter was a sum of money from the man to cover not only the cost of the materials but also interest. My client was impressed that the Church through lay leadership would assist this man in his effort to be reconciled to God.</p>

Think about the impact on society if youth didn’t cheat in school, if adults were honest in the workplace and were faithful to their marriage vows. For us the concept of basic honesty is grounded in the life and teachings of the Savior. Honesty is also a valued attribute in many other faiths and in historic literature. The poet Robert Burns said, “An honest man’s the noblest work of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> In almost every instance, people of faith feel accountable to God for being honest.

This friend was surprised at how critically important religion is to democracy. He pointed out that in societies where the citizens are taught from a young age to feel accountable to God for honesty and integrity, they will abide by rules and practices that, while unenforceable, promote democratic ideals. In societies where this is not true, there cannot be enough policemen to enforce honest behavior.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>

Women by divine nature have the greater gift and responsibility for home and children and nurturing there and in other settings. In light of this, the faith of the sisters in being willing to leave their homes to cross the plains for the unknown was inspiring. If one had to characterize their most significant attribute, it would be their unwavering faith in the restored gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

I am moved by the account of Elizabeth Jackson, whose husband Aaron died after the last crossing of the Platte River with the Martin handcart company. She wrote:</p>

The priesthood leadership of this Church at all levels gratefully acknowledges the service, sacrifice, commitment, and contribution of the sisters.</p>

Whether in the Church or in the home, it is a beautiful thing to see the priesthood and the Relief Society work in perfect harmony. Such a relationship is like a well-tuned orchestra, and the resulting symphony inspires all of us.</p>

Following the dance, a purse was found with no outside identification. I share with you part of what Sister Monica Sedgwick, the Young Women president in the Laguna Niguel stake, recorded: “We didn’t want to pry; this was someone’s personal stuff! So we gingerly opened it and grabbed the first thing that was on top—hopefully, it would identify her. It did, but in another way—it was a <span class="emphasis">For the Strength of Youth</span> pamphlet. Wow! This told us something about her. Then we reached in for the next item, a little notebook. Surely this would give us answers, but not the kind we were expecting. The first page was a list of favorite scriptures. There were five more pages of carefully written scriptures and personal notes.”</p>

They returned to that purse to identify its owner. They pulled out some breath mints, soap, lotion, and a brush. I loved their comments: “Oh, good things come out of her mouth; she has clean and soft hands; and she takes care of herself.”</p>

Out came a clever little homemade coin purse made from a cardboard juice carton, and there was some money in a zippered pocket. They exclaimed, “Ahh, she’s creative and prepared!” They felt like little children on Christmas morning. What they pulled out next surprised them even more: a recipe for Black Forest chocolate cake and a note to make the cake for a friend’s birthday. They almost screamed, “She’s a HOMEMAKER! Thoughtful and service minded.” Then, yes, finally some identification. The youth leaders said they felt greatly blessed “to observe the quiet example of a young lady living the gospel.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Many of these responsibilities do not provide economic compensation but do provide satisfaction and are eternally significant. Recently a delightful and very capable woman on a newspaper editorial board asked for a description of the role of women in the Church. It was explained that all of the leaders in our congregations are <span class="emphasis">unpaid.</span> She interrupted to say her interest had diminished significantly. She said, “I don’t believe women need any more <span class="emphasis">unpaid</span> jobs.”</p>

We of course told her about the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary organizations that are guided by women presidents. We noted that from our earliest history both men and women pray, perform the music, give the sermons, and sing in the choir, even in sacrament meeting, our most sacred meeting.</p>

They are incredible because of the way they face the trials of life. Despite the challenges and tests life has to offer—from marriage or lack of marriage, children’s choices, poor health, lack of opportunities, and many other problems—they remain remarkably strong and immovable and true to the faith. Our sisters throughout the Church consistently “succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

In this process I have experienced feelings of overwhelming appreciation for the essential role that sisters, both married and single, have historically played and now play both in the family and in the Church.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/lds-women-are-incredible.p23" pid="9Jhm4-cKqEG9gK4YQffVdQ" hash="pJulsQ">All members of the Church of Jesus Christ are “to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> “[The] work of salvation includes member missionary work, convert retention, activation of less-active members, temple and family history work, … teaching the gospel,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> and caring for the poor and needy.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> This is administered primarily through the ward council.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>

Members need to recognize that the bishop has been instructed to delegate. Members need to sustain and support him as he follows this counsel. This will allow the bishop to spend more time with the youth, young single adults, and his own family. He will delegate other important responsibilities to priesthood leaders, presidents of auxiliaries, and individual men and women. In the Church the role of women in the home is highly respected.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> When the mother receives a Church calling that requires significant time, the father will often be given a less-demanding calling in order to maintain balance in the lives of the family.</p>

Sunday morning the three front rows of the chapel were filled with men between 26 and 35 years of age. I assumed they were a men’s choir. But when the business of the conference was conducted, each of these men, 63 in total, stood up as their names were read and were sustained for ordination to the Melchizedek Priesthood. I was both pleased and stunned.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/lds-women-are-incredible.p26" pid="ktUpmHYWNU-cFSHNiS7AgA" hash="gHVx6A">After the session I asked President Mateaki, the stake president, how this miracle had been accomplished. He told me that in a stake council meeting reactivation was being discussed. His stake Relief Society president, Sister Leinata Va’enuku, asked if it would be appropriate for her to say something. As she spoke, the Spirit confirmed to the president that what she was suggesting was true. She explained that there were large numbers of wonderful young men in their late 20s and 30s in their stake who had not served missions. She said many of them knew they had disappointed bishops and priesthood leaders who had strongly encouraged them to serve a mission, and they now felt like second-class members of the Church. She pointed out that these young men were beyond missionary age. She expressed her love and concern for them. She explained that all of the saving ordinances were still available to them and the focus should be on priesthood ordinations and the ordinances of the temple. She noted that while some of these young men were still single, the majority of them had married wonderful women—some active, some inactive, and some not members.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/lds-women-are-incredible.p27" pid="Jk8ULL6Uk0Wcv_flHkUcNg" hash="fFqU_w">After thorough discussion in the stake council, it was decided that the men of the priesthood and the women of the Relief Society would reach out to rescue these men and their wives, while the bishops spent more of their time with the young men and young women in the wards. Those involved in the rescue focused primarily on preparing them for the priesthood, eternal marriage, and the saving ordinances of the temple. During the next two years, almost all of the 63 men who had been sustained to the Melchizedek Priesthood at the conference I attended were endowed in the temple and had their spouses sealed to them. This account is but one example of how critical our sisters are in the work of salvation in our wards and stakes and how they facilitate revelation, especially in family and Church councils.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

First, no woman should ever feel the need to apologize or feel that her contribution is less significant because she is devoting her primary efforts to raising and nurturing children. Nothing could be more significant in our Father in Heaven’s plan. Second, we should all be careful not to be judgmental or assume that sisters are less valiant if the decision is made to work outside the home. We rarely understand or fully appreciate people’s circumstances. Husbands and wives should prayerfully counsel together, understanding they are accountable to God for their decisions.</p>

It is a perfect example of the difficulty of looking only through the lens of this mortal life. The loss of life was catastrophic in its consequences but was of an accidental nature. With the carnage of two world wars and having just passed the 10th anniversary of the destruction <span class="pageBreak" page-number="105"></span>of the World Trade Center towers, we have seen in our own time a window into the shock, agony, and moral issues surrounding events resulting from the evil exercise of agency. There are terrible repercussions to family, friends, and nations as a result of these tragedies, regardless of the cause.</p>

The first is an example of being appreciative for the blessings we receive and the challenges we avoid. It involves Alma Sonne, who later served as a General Authority.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> He was my stake president when I was born in Logan, Utah. I had my mission interview with Elder Sonne. In those days all prospective missionaries were interviewed by a General Authority. He was a great influence in my life.</p>

They had numerous discussions about serving a mission, and eventually Alma Sonne convinced Fred to prepare and serve. They were both called to the British Mission. At the conclusion of their missions, Elder Sonne, the mission secretary, made the travel arrangements for their return to the United States. He booked passage on the <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span> for himself, Fred, and four other missionaries who had also completed their missions.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

Elder Sonne’s answer paraphrased the account of Joseph and his brothers in Egypt recorded in Genesis: “How can we return to our families and the lad be not with us?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> He explained to his companions that they all came to England together and they all should return home together. Elder Sonne subsequently learned of the <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span>’s sinking and gratefully said to his friend Fred, “You saved my life.” Fred replied, “No, by getting me on this mission, you saved my life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> All of the missionaries thanked the Lord for preserving them.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

Irene Corbett was 30 years old. She was a young wife and mother from Provo, Utah. She had significant talents as an artist and musician; she was also a teacher and a nurse. At the urging of medical professionals in Provo, she attended a six-month course of study on midwife skills in London. It was her great desire to make a difference in the world. She was careful, thoughtful, prayerful, and valiant. One of the reasons she chose the <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span> to return to the United States was because she thought the missionaries would be traveling with her and that this would provide additional safety. Irene was one of the few women who did not survive this terrible tragedy. Most of the women and children were placed in the lifeboats and were ultimately rescued. There were not enough lifeboats for everyone. But it is believed that she did not get in the lifeboats because, with her special training, she was attending to the needs of the numerous passengers who were injured from the iceberg collision.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>

Some give us necessary experiences. Adverse results in this mortal life are not evidence of lack of faith or of an imperfection in our Father in Heaven’s overall plan. The refiner’s fire is real, and qualities of character and righteousness that are forged in the furnace of affliction perfect and purify us and prepare us to meet God.</p>

The Savior stated in part, “If thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; … and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; … these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> The Savior concluded His instruction: “Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not … , for God shall be with you forever and ever.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span></p>

Agency is essential for individual spiritual growth and development. Evil conduct is an element of agency. Captain Moroni explained this very important doctrine: “The Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice and judgment may come upon the wicked.” He made it clear that the righteous are not lost but “enter into the rest of the Lord their God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span> The wicked will be held accountable for the atrocities they perpetrate.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span></p>

Often those who die early have demonstrated significant capabilities, interests, and talents. With our limited understanding, we lament the things that will not be accomplished and the songs that will not be sung. This has been described as dying with your music still inside you. Music in this case is a metaphor for unfulfilled potential of any kind. Sometimes people have made significant preparation but do not have the opportunity to perform in mortality.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span> One of the most quoted classical poems, “Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard,” by Thomas Gray, reflects on such missed opportunities:</p>

All of these were cut short in the case of Sister Corbett. There were songs she did not sing and potential she did not fulfill in this mortal life. But when we look through the wide and clear lens of the gospel instead of the limited lens of mere mortal existence, we know of the great eternal reward promised by a loving Father in His plan. As the Apostle Paul taught, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_30">30</span> A line from a beloved hymn provides comfort, solace, and the clear lens: “And Jesus listening can hear the songs I cannot sing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_31">31</span></p>

One principle that will help us accomplish this is to avoid being overly judgmental about conduct that is foolish or unwise but not sinful.

McKay, and met with missionaries. He informed them he was convinced the Book of Mormon was indeed a translation of “the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians” for the periods described in the Book of Mormon.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> One example among many he used was the conjunctive phrase “And it came to pass,” which he said mirrored how he would translate phraseology used in ancient Semitic writings.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> The professor was informed that while his intellectual approach based on his profession had helped him, it was still essential to have a spiritual testimony. Through study and prayer he gained a spiritual witness and was baptized. So what one famous humorist saw as an object of ridicule, a scholar recognized as profound evidence of the truth of the Book of Mormon, which was confirmed to him by the Spirit.</p>

Obsessive focus on things not yet fully revealed, such as how the virgin birth or the Resurrection of the Savior could have occurred or exactly how Joseph Smith translated our scriptures, will not be efficacious or yield spiritual progress. These are matters of faith. Ultimately, Moroni’s counsel to read and ponder and then ask God in all sincerity of heart, with real intent, to confirm scriptural truths by the witness of the Spirit is the answer.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span> In addition, when we inculcate into our lives scriptural imperatives and live the gospel, we are blessed with the Spirit and taste of His goodness with feelings of joy, happiness, and especially peace.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span></p>

I have discussed this with my own children. They have shared with me two observations. First, persistence in reading the scriptures daily as a family is the key. My daughter in a lighthearted way describes their early-morning efforts with mostly teenage children to consistently read the scriptures. She and her husband wake up early in the morning <span class="pageBreak" page-number="44"></span>and move through the blurry mist to grasp the iron railing that lines their staircase to where their family gathers to read the word of God. Persistence is the answer, and a sense of humor helps. It requires great effort from every family member every day, but it is worth the effort. Temporary setbacks are overshadowed by persistence.</p>

Two out of their four children are not old enough to read. For the five-year-old, they have five finger signals to which he responds in order for him to participate fully in the family scripture reading. The signal for finger 1 is for him to repeat, “And it came to pass” whenever it appears in the Book of Mormon. I have to admit that I love the fact that the phrase appears so often. Incidentally, for the interest of young families, finger signal 2 is “And thus we see”; fingers 3, 4, and 5 are chosen by the parents based on the words contained in the chapter they are reading.</p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="6"></span>President Monson, we love, honor, and sustain you! This historically significant announcement with respect to missionary service is inspiring. I can remember the excitement in 1960 when the age for young men serving was reduced from 20 years of age to 19. I arrived in the British Mission as a newly called 20-year-old. The first 19-year-old in our mission was Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, an incredible addition. He was a few months shy of being 20. Then over the course of a year, many more 19-year-olds arrived. They were obedient and faithful missionaries, and the work progressed. I am confident that an even greater harvest will be achieved now as righteous, committed missionaries fulfill the Savior’s commandment to preach His gospel.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p6" pid="Hjnyn1FlskGtGn1PgOVzAA" hash="Gvf7jw">In my view, those of you in the rising generation are better prepared than any previous generation. Your knowledge of the scriptures is particularly impressive. However, the challenges your generation faces as you prepare for service are similar to those faced by all members of the Church. We are all aware the culture in most of the world is not conducive to righteousness or spiritual commitment. Throughout history, Church leaders have warned the people and taught repentance. In the Book of Mormon, Alma the Younger was so concerned about unrighteousness and lack of commitment that he resigned as chief judge, the leader of the people of Nephi, and concentrated all his efforts on his prophetic calling.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p7" pid="U8OBXg4QVUG2vojpOKZo9g" hash="Cj6Ibw">In one of the most profound verses in all of scripture, Alma proclaims, “If ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p8" pid="y_3Lk0z2b0Otz7MffS9-_w" hash="T1z8ag">Local leaders across the world report that when viewed as a whole, Church members, especially our youth, have never been stronger. But they almost always raise two concerns: first, the challenge of increased unrighteousness in the world and, second, the apathy and lack of commitment of some members. They seek counsel about how to help members to follow the Savior and achieve a deep and lasting conversion.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p9" pid="cDJG1kLkck6mDUmKcYpeUg" hash="H52_uA">This question, “Can ye feel so now?” rings across the centuries. With all that we have received in this dispensation—including the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the outpouring of spiritual gifts, and the indisputable blessings of heaven—Alma’s challenge has never been more important.</p>

One prominent writer recently said, “Everyone knows the culture is poisonous, and nobody expects that to change.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> The constant portrayal of violence and immorality in music, entertainment, art, and other media in our day-to-day culture is unprecedented.

They do not “feel so now.” They feel they are in a spiritual drought. Others are angry, hurt, or disillusioned. If these descriptions apply to you,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> it is important to evaluate why you cannot “feel so now.”</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p13" pid="PVSdi2kSTk2yHFB8ZfBgfQ" hash="pX32-g">Many who are in a spiritual drought and lack commitment have not necessarily been involved in major sins or transgressions, but they have made unwise choices. Some are casual in their observance of sacred covenants. Others spend most of their time giving first-class devotion to lesser causes. Some allow intense cultural or political views to weaken their allegiance to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Some have immersed themselves in Internet materials that magnify, exaggerate, and, in some cases, invent shortcomings of early Church leaders. Then they draw incorrect conclusions that can affect testimony. Any who have made these choices can repent and be spiritually renewed.</p>

    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p15" pid="uYWQvjWtZkyna4-tGTGHzA" hash="mUlWNw">C. S. Lewis, the striving, pragmatic Christian writer, poignantly framed the issue. He asserted that Christianity tells people to repent and promises them forgiveness; but until people know and feel they need forgiveness, Christianity does not speak to them. He stated, “When you know you are sick, you will listen to the doctor.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p16" pid="IMISRUIKtEiY9TuyUCxNCQ" hash="bvUPBw">The Prophet Joseph pointed out that before your baptism, you could be on neutral ground between good and evil. But “when you joined this Church you enlisted to serve God. When you did that you left the neutral ground, and you never can [go] back.” His counsel was that we must never forsake the Master.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p17" pid="pPMvmFEhSkuoXm3fD7_h3g" hash="FW0cEQ">Alma emphasizes that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, “the arms of mercy are extended” to those who repent.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> He then asks penetrating and ultimate questions, such as: Are we prepared to meet God? Are we keeping ourselves blameless? We should all contemplate these questions. Alma’s own experience in failing to follow his faithful father and then coming to a dramatic understanding of how much he needed forgiveness and what it meant to sing the song of redeeming love is powerful and compelling.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p18" pid="MbvxP_MxvESejdjaKw3cIA" hash="bHBzDw">While anything that lessens commitment is of consequence, two relevant challenges are both prevalent and significant. The first is unkindness, violence, and domestic abuse. The second is sexual immorality and impure thoughts. These often precede and are at the root of the choice to be less committed.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p19" pid="s4EuzeINI0ikxcxRoQIXXA" hash="2moMag">How we treat those closest to us is of fundamental importance. Violence, abuse, lack of civility, and disrespect in the home are not acceptable—not acceptable for adults and not acceptable for the rising generation. My father was not active in the Church but was a remarkably good example, especially in his treatment of my mother. He used to say, “God will hold men responsible for every tear they cause their wives to shed.” This same concept is emphasized in “The Family: A Proclamation to the World.” It reads, “[Those] who abuse spouse or offspring … will one day stand accountable before God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> Regardless of the culture in which we are raised, and whether our parents did or did not abuse us, we must not physically, emotionally, or verbally abuse anyone else.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p20" pid="ZgbyYOpzm0m0ZTHweRfDaw" hash="ZyXePw">The need for civility in society has never been more important. The foundation of kindness and civility begins in our homes. It is not surprising that our public discourse has declined in equal measure with the breakdown of the family. The family is the foundation for love and for maintaining spirituality. The family promotes an atmosphere where religious observance can flourish. There is indeed “beauty all around when there’s love at home.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

Movies, TV, and the Internet often convey degrading messages and images. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf and I were recently in an Amazon jungle village and observed satellite dishes even on some of the small, simply built huts. We rejoiced at the wonderful information available in this remote area. We also recognized there is virtually no place on earth that cannot be impacted by salacious, immoral, and titillating images. This is one reason why pornography has become such a plague in our day.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p22" pid="rD-mBhY0dEu0Kx2vh91Asg" hash="HMhCgg">I recently had an insightful conversation with a 15-year-old Aaronic Priesthood holder. He helped me understand how easy it is in this Internet age for young people to almost inadvertently be exposed to impure and even pornographic images. He pointed out that for most principles the Church teaches, there is at least some recognition in society at large that violating these principles can have devastating effects on health and well-being. He mentioned cigarette smoking, drug use, and alcohol consumption by young people. But he noted that there is no corresponding outcry or even a significant warning from society at large about pornography or immorality.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p23" pid="hFOmYIIpfUqTuCiHawWo6w" hash="x3Vzdw">My dear brothers and sisters, this young man’s analysis is correct. What is the answer? For years, prophets and apostles have taught the importance of religious observance in the home.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p24" pid="K9pLUcpyskaFE_doTjwtpQ" hash="c8jshA">Parents, the days are long past when regular, active participation in Church meetings and programs, though essential, can fulfill your sacred responsibility to teach your children to live moral, righteous lives and walk uprightly before the Lord. With President Monson’s announcement this morning, it is essential that this be faithfully accomplished in homes which are places of refuge where kindness, forgiveness, truth, and righteousness prevail. Parents must have the courage to filter or monitor Internet access, television, movies, and music. Parents must have the courage to say no, defend truth, and bear powerful testimony. Your children need to know that you have faith in the Savior, love your Heavenly Father, and sustain the leaders of the Church. Spiritual maturity must flourish in our homes. My hope is that no one will leave this conference without understanding that the moral issues of our day must be addressed in the family. Bishops and priesthood and auxiliary leaders need to support families and make sure that spiritual principles are taught. Home and visiting teachers can assist, especially with children of single parents.</p>

    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now.p26" pid="ZNDC63FotUyGa9yApqtixg" hash="v_wjvw">Youth who have been exposed to immoral images at a very early age are terrified that they may have already disqualified themselves for missionary service and sacred covenants. As a result, their faith can be severely impaired. I want to assure you young people, as Alma taught, that through repentance you can qualify for all the blessings of heaven.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> That is what the Savior’s Atonement is all about. Please talk with your parents or a trusted adviser, and counsel with your bishop.</p>

They went to the roof of their apartment building and were horrified as they watched what they thought was some kind of terrible accident. Then they witnessed the second plane crash into the South Tower. They immediately realized that this was no accident and believed lower Manhattan was under attack.

I was relieved that they were safe but not surprised at their location.

We understood that this could leave us angry, bewildered, defenseless, and vulnerable. But we also knew that the Savior’s Atonement would overcome and compensate for all of the unfairness of mortal life <span class="pageBreak" page-number="34"></span>and bring us peace. Elder Marion D.

Some young people in the world say they are spiritual but not religious. Feeling spiritual is a good first step. However, it is in the Church that we are fellowshipped, taught, and nourished by the good word of God. More importantly, it is priesthood authority in the Church that provides for sacred ordinances and covenants that bind families together and qualify each of us to return to God the Father and Jesus Christ in the celestial kingdom. These ordinances bring peace because they are covenants with the Lord.</p>

Those who visit temple grounds or participate in temple open houses also feel this peace. One experience preeminent in my mind is the Suva Fiji Temple open house and dedication. There had been political upheaval resulting in rebels burning and looting downtown Suva, <span class="pageBreak" page-number="35"></span>occupying the houses of Parliament and holding legislators hostage. The country was under martial law. The Fiji military gave the Church limited permission to assemble people for the open house and a very small group for the dedication.

The opera includes the conquest of Jerusalem and the captivity and bondage of the Jews. <a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/137" class="scriptureRef">Psalm 137</a> is the inspiration for Verdi’s moving and inspiring “Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves.” The heading of this psalm in our scriptures is very dramatic: “While in captivity, the Jews wept by the rivers of Babylon—Because of sorrow, they could not bear to sing the songs of Zion.”</p>

At a time when I was the only member of the Church in our law firm, one woman lawyer explained to me how she always felt like a juggler trying to keep three balls in the air at the same time. One ball was her law practice, one was her marriage, and one was her children. She had almost given up on time for herself. She was greatly concerned that one of the balls was always on the ground. I suggested we meet as a group and discuss our priorities. We determined that the primary reason we were working was to support our families. We agreed that making more money wasn’t nearly as important as our families, but we recognized that serving our clients to the best of our abilities was essential. The discussion then moved to what we did at work that was not necessary and was inconsistent with leaving time for family. Was there pressure to spend time in the workplace that was not essential?<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> We decided that our goal would be a family-friendly environment for both women and men. Let us be at the forefront in protecting time for family.</p>

Substituting the philosophies of men for gospel truth can lead us away from the simplicity of the Savior’s message. When the Apostle Paul visited Athens, he tried to teach of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Of this effort we read in Acts, “For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear <span class="emphasis">some new thing.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> When the crowd realized the simple religious nature of Paul’s message, which was not new, they rejected it.</p>

If we are not careful, we can be captured by these trends and place ourselves in intellectual bondage. There are many voices now telling women how to live.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> They often contradict each other.

I was at home and answered the door. My wife, Mary, was in another room. In both cases, after a hug, they said almost the same thing. They looked around and then said, “I love to be in Grandma’s house. Where is Grandma?” I didn’t say it to them, but I was thinking, “Isn’t this Grandpa’s house too?” But I realized that when I was a boy, our family went to Grandma’s house. The words of a familiar song came into my mind: “Over the river and through the woods to Grandmother’s house we go.”</p>

I treasure the fact that the backbreaking work and domestic drudgery required of women has been reduced in much of the world because of modern conveniences and that women are making such magnificent contributions in every field of endeavor. But if we allow our culture to reduce the special relationship that children have with mothers and grandmothers and others who nurture them, we will come to regret it.</p>

If we are true to His light, follow His commandments, and rely on His merits, we will avoid spiritual, physical, and intellectual bondage as well as the lamentation of wandering in our own wilderness, for He is mighty to save.</p>

I suggest one way this might be done. Families could hold a “Family Tree Gathering.” This should be a recurring effort. Everyone would bring existing family histories, stories, and photos, including cherished possessions of grandparents and parents. Our young people are excited to learn about the lives of family members—where they came from and how they lived. Many have had their hearts turned to the fathers. They love the stories and photos, and they have the technological expertise to scan and upload these stories and photos to Family Tree and connect source documents with ancestors to preserve these for all time. Of course, the main objective is to determine what ordinances still need to be done and make assignments for the essential temple work. The <span class="emphasis">My Family</span> booklet can be utilized to help record family information, stories, and photos that can then be uploaded to Family Tree.</p>

For those who are looking for more fruitful use of the Sabbath day for the family as a whole, the hastening of this work is fertile ground. One mother glowingly tells how her 17-year-old son gets on the computer after church on Sunday to do family history work and her 10-year-old son loves to hear the stories and see pictures of his ancestors. This has blessed their entire family to experience the spirit of Elijah. Our precious roots and branches must be nourished.</p>

					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/choose-wisely.p15" pid="sQN_TdHO0EyYjrxznk9huQ" hash="yEOrCw">I recently met a fine teenage young man. His goals were to go on a mission, obtain an education, marry in the temple, and have a faithful happy family. I was very pleased with his goals. But during further conversation, it became evident that his conduct and the choices he was making were not consistent with his goals. I felt he genuinely wanted to go on a mission and was avoiding serious transgressions that would prohibit a mission, but his day-to-day conduct was not preparing him for the physical, emotional, social, intellectual, and spiritual challenges he would face.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> He had not learned to work hard. He was not serious about school or seminary. He attended church, but he had not read the Book of Mormon. He was spending a large amount of time on video games and social media.

In these areas, we need to emphasize moderation, balance, and especially wisdom. It is important to rise above rationalizations and make the best choices.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/choose-wisely.p17" pid="Q-xwmUnPwE-MPnStbSyh0g" hash="oxrH0g">A wonderful example of the need for moderation, balance, and wisdom is the use of the Internet. It can be used to do missionary outreach, to assist with priesthood responsibilities, to find precious ancestors for sacred temple ordinances, and much more. The potential for good is enormous. We also know that it can transmit much that is evil, including pornography, digital cruelty,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> and anonymous yakking. It can also perpetuate foolishness. As Brother Randall L.

They affect not just the youth but all of us. We live in a world that is literally in commotion.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> We are surrounded by obsessive portrayals of “fun and games” and immoral and dysfunctional lives. These are presented as normal conduct in much of the media.</p>

Bednar recently cautioned members to be authentic in the use of social media.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> A prominent thought leader, Arthur C. Brooks, has emphasized this point. He observes that when using social media, we tend to broadcast the smiling details of our lives but not the hard times at school or work. We portray an incomplete life—sometimes in a self-aggrandizing or fake way. We share this life, and then we consume the “almost exclusively … fake lives of [our] social media ‘friends.’” Brooks asserts, “How could it not make you feel worse to spend part of your time pretending to be happier than you are, and the other part of your time seeing how much happier others seem to be than you?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/choose-wisely.p20" pid="p8rAMoEvBkuAcG9kRTbY0w" hash="2u0bkQ">Sometimes it feels like we are drowning in frivolous foolishness, nonsensical noise, and continuous contention. When we turn down the volume and examine the substance, there is very little that will assist us in our eternal quest toward righteous goals. One father wisely responds to his children with their numerous requests to participate in these distractions. He simply asks them, “Will this make you a better person?”</p>

He appreciated that extracurricular activities like debate and student government might have a direct connection with some of my important goals. He was less certain about the extensive time I spent participating in football, basketball, baseball, and track. He acknowledged that athletics could build strength, endurance, and teamwork but asserted that perhaps concentrating on one sport for a shorter time would be better. In his view, sports were good but not the best <span class="emphasis">for me.</span> He was concerned that some sports were about building local celebrity or fame at the expense of more important long-term goals.</p>

Then our high school football coach informed me that the Stanford football coach wanted to have lunch with Merlin Olsen and me. Those of you who are younger may not know Merlin. He was an incredible all-American tackle on the Logan High School football team where I played quarterback and safety and returned kickoffs and punts. In high school Merlin was recruited by most football powers across the nation. In college he won the Outland Trophy as the nation’s best interior lineman. Merlin was ultimately the third overall pick in the National Football League draft and played in an amazing 14 consecutive Pro Bowls. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>

After we shook hands, he never once made eye contact with me. He talked directly to Merlin but ignored me. At the end of the lunch, for the first time, he turned toward me, but he could not remember my name. He then informed Merlin, “If you choose Stanford and want to bring your friend with you, he has good enough grades and it could probably be arranged.” This experience confirmed for me that I should follow my dad’s wise counsel.</p>

The wife may bear children, which blesses the entire family. The husband may receive the priesthood, which blesses the entire family. But in family council, wives and husbands, as equal partners, make the most important decisions. They decide how the children will be taught and disciplined, how money will be spent, where they will live, and many other family decisions. These are made jointly after seeking guidance from the Lord. The goal is an eternal family.</p>

I soon learned the history and meaning of the nautical phrase “shipshape and Bristol fashion.” At one time Bristol was the second busiest port in the United Kingdom. It had a very high tidal range of 43 feet (13 m), the second highest in the world. At low tide when the water receded, the old ships would hit bottom and fall on their sides, and if the ships were not well built, they would be damaged. In addition, everything that was not carefully stowed away or tied down would be thrown in a chaotic fashion and ruined or spoiled.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> After I understood what that phrase meant, it was clear that this leader was telling us that, as missionaries, we must be righteous, follow rules, and be prepared for difficult situations.</p>

I would describe being “shipshape and Bristol fashion” as being temple worthy—in good times and in bad times.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/shipshape-and-bristol-fashion-be-temple-worthy-in-good-times-and-bad-times.p11" pid="GQWilKJRhEuf8fbzcZPizw" hash="WksYYQ">While the fluctuation of the tide in the Bristol Channel is somewhat predictable and can be prepared for, the storms and temptations of this life are often unpredictable. But this we know: they will come! In order to overcome the challenges and temptations that each of us inevitably faces, it will require righteous preparation and the use of divinely provided protections. We must determine to be temple worthy regardless of what befalls us. If we are prepared, we shall not fear.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/shipshape-and-bristol-fashion-be-temple-worthy-in-good-times-and-bad-times.p12" pid="9C1T7aKOWESdtYBa7Mob0A" hash="sIlLvQ">Happiness in this life and happiness in the life to come are interconnected by righteousness. Even in the period between death and the Resurrection, “the spirits of those who are <span class="emphasis">righteous</span> are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/shipshape-and-bristol-fashion-be-temple-worthy-in-good-times-and-bad-times.p13" pid="iU1u0MepeECmThihj8GW4w" hash="qt-qvA">At the commencement of the Savior’s earthly ministry in Israel and later among the Nephites, the Savior addressed the issue of happiness both in this life and in eternity. He stressed ordinances, but He also placed great emphasis on moral behavior. For example, disciples would be blessed if they would hunger and thirst after righteousness, be merciful, be pure in heart, be peacemakers, and follow other basic moral principles. Clearly, our Lord Jesus Christ emphasized, as a foundational doctrinal message, both righteous attitudes and conduct in day-to-day living. His teachings not only replaced and transcended elements of the law of Moses<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> but also were a rejection of the false philosophies of men.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/shipshape-and-bristol-fashion-be-temple-worthy-in-good-times-and-bad-times.p14" pid="Ot5glMkiL0SygYnFPrK40A" hash="qaJNxQ">For many centuries the gospel of Jesus Christ has inspired beliefs and established standards of conduct as to what is righteous, desirable, and moral and results in happiness, felicity, and joy. However, the principles and basic morality the Savior taught are under serious attack in today’s world. Christianity is under attack. Many believe that what is moral has basically changed.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/shipshape-and-bristol-fashion-be-temple-worthy-in-good-times-and-bad-times.p15" pid="yDSpn7Ztb0-kzekQYBEnVg" hash="XEFNDQ">We live in difficult times. There is an increased tendency to “call evil good, and good evil.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> A world that emphasizes self-aggrandizement and secularism is cause for great concern. One prominent writer, not of our faith, has put it this way: “Unfortunately I see little evidence that people are actually happier in the emerging dispensation, or that their children are better off, or that the cause of social justice is well-served, or that declining marriage rates and thinning family trees … promise anything save greater loneliness for the majority, and stagnation overall.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/shipshape-and-bristol-fashion-be-temple-worthy-in-good-times-and-bad-times.p16" pid="HroBFILiK0KFa1b43nG39A" hash="SUxkSQ">As disciples of the Savior, we are expected to plan and prepare. In the plan of happiness, moral agency is a central organizing principle and our choices matter.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> The Savior emphasized this throughout His ministry, including in His parables of the foolish virgins and the talents.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> In each of these, the Lord commended preparation and action and condemned procrastination and idleness.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/shipshape-and-bristol-fashion-be-temple-worthy-in-good-times-and-bad-times.p17" pid="54_-5loWj0GUDKL6Zw8ncg" hash="FlDMLw">I recognize that, despite the overwhelming happiness embodied in God’s divine plan, sometimes it can feel far away and disconnected from our current circumstances. It may feel beyond our reach as struggling disciples. From our limited perspective, current temptations and distractions can seem attractive. The rewards for resisting those temptations, on the other hand, can feel distant and unattainable. But a true understanding of the Father’s plan reveals that the rewards of righteousness are available right now. Wickedness, such as immoral conduct, is never part of the answer. Alma said it clearly to his son Corianton: “Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

Uchtdorf gave in 2010<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> about the famous marshmallow experiment conducted at Stanford University in the 1960s. You will remember that four-year-olds were given a single marshmallow. If they could wait for 15 or 20 minutes without eating it, they would receive a second marshmallow. Videos have been produced showing the contortions that many children used to avoid eating the marshmallow. Some did not succeed.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

He was particularly concerned after the U.S. Surgeon General’s report of 1964 concluded that smoking caused lung cancer.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> After years of study, one of his professional colleagues reported that “self-control is like a muscle: the more you use it, the stronger it gets. Avoiding something tempting once will help you develop the ability to resist other temptations in the future.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span></p>

This is true both in the spiritual realm and in temporal matters.</p>

They develop Christlike attributes and emphasize obedience and spirituality. They are expected to adhere to a rigorous schedule and spend their days in the service of others. They have a modest, conservative appearance instead of the casual or immodest manner of dress so prevalent today. Their conduct and appearance convey a moral, serious message.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>

They have developed remarkable spiritual strength and self-discipline that need to be continually exercised, or these qualities will atrophy just like muscles that are not used. All of us need to develop and demonstrate conduct and appearance that declare we are true followers of Christ. Those who abandon either righteous conduct or a wholesome, modest appearance expose themselves to lifestyles that bring neither joy nor happiness.</p>

Other basic sacred purposes of the Sabbath remained unchanged. For Jews and Christians, the Sabbath symbolizes the mighty works of God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>

The focus was honoring God as the Creator. It began by blessing the family and singing a Sabbath hymn.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span> We joined in the ceremonial washing of hands, the blessing of the bread, the prayers, the kosher meal, the recitation of scripture, and singing Sabbath songs in a celebratory mood. We listened to the Hebrew words, following along with English translations. The most poignant scriptures read from the Old Testament, which are also dear to us, were from Isaiah, declaring the Sabbath a delight,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span> and from Ezekiel, that the Sabbath “shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span></p>

As I thought about this event, I reflected on the extreme persecution that the Jews have experienced over centuries. Clearly, honoring the Sabbath has been “a perpetual covenant,” preserving and blessing the Jewish people in fulfillment of scripture.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span> It has also contributed to the extraordinary family life and happiness that are evident in the lives of many Jewish people.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span></p>

The Sabbath can help separate us from that which is frivolous, inappropriate, or immoral. It allows us to be in the world but not of the world.</p>

This has been in the response of the members to renewed emphasis on the Sabbath by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve and to President Russell M. Nelson’s challenge to make the Sabbath a delight.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_27">27</span> Many members understand that truly keeping the Sabbath day holy is a refuge from the storms of this life. It is also a sign of our devotion to our Father in Heaven and an increased understanding of the sacredness of sacrament meeting. Still, we have a long way to go, but we have a wonderful beginning. I challenge all of us to continue to embrace this counsel and improve our Sabbath worship.</p>

The sweet blessings of peace, happiness, and joy, along with the blessings of eternal life and celestial glory with our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, will be realized.

When President Monson was called as an Apostle in 1963, there were 12 operating temples in the world.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; With the dedication of the Provo City Center Temple, there are now 150, and there will be 177 when all announced temples are dedicated.

Sister Shelly Senior, wife of the then-president of the Thailand Bangkok Mission, David Senior, emailed family and friends to say that after she and her husband had listened to President Monson announce that temple, there had been “12 sleepless hours and lots of tears of happiness.” They called their mission assistants at 11:30 p.m. and informed them. The assistants called all the missionaries. The report came back that the “whole mission was awake in the middle of the night jumping on their beds.” Sister Senior humorously admonished family and friends, “Please don’t tell the Missionary Department!”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I am confident there have been spiritual preparations in hearts and homes and manifestations from heaven preparing the Saints where these newly announced temples will be located.&lt;/p&gt;

President Monson has stated: “Until you have entered the house of the Lord and have received all the blessings which await you there, you have not obtained everything the Church has to offer. The all-important and crowning blessings of membership in the Church are those blessings which we receive in the temples of God.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Please don’t see the temple as some distant and perhaps unachievable goal. Working with their bishop, most members can achieve all righteous requirements in a relatively short period of time if they have a determination to qualify and fully repent of transgressions. This includes being willing to forgive ourselves and not focus on our imperfections or sins as disqualifying us from ever entering a sacred temple.&lt;/p&gt;

The gospel plan is about exaltation and encompasses making and keeping sacred covenants with God.

They help us recognize the sacred covenants that connect us to all generations that follow. This is incredibly significant, and it starts when you see yourself in the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

As they concluded and faced those mirrors, she noticed there was a face in the mirror that was not in the room.

Eyring at the rededication of the Suva Fiji Temple two months ago. It was a special, sacred occasion. President Eyring’s courage and strong spiritual impressions allowed the rededication to proceed in the face of the worst cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere. Physical and spiritual protections were provided to youth, missionaries, and members.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_29"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt; The hand of the Lord was clearly evident.

After we explained the proposed dedication, they were supportive but concerned about the safety of President Gordon B. Hinckley. They recommended a small dedication with no events outside the temple, like the cornerstone ceremony. They emphasized that anyone outside the temple could be a potential target for violence.&lt;/p&gt;

The vistas across the meadows were exceptional. When the walls were framed in for the cabin, I made a visit. I was surprised that the window with the view focused directly on a power pole that was a short distance from the house. To me, it was a huge distraction from the magnificent view.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p7" pid="dtaNNDjpJkSO4XxcS77NEg" hash="E8Yjqw">Personal foundations, like many worthwhile pursuits, are usually built slowly—one layer, one experience, one challenge, one setback, and one success at a time. A most cherished physical experience is a baby’s first steps. It is magnificent to behold. The precious look on the face—a combination of determination, joy, surprise, and accomplishment—is truly a seminal event.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p8" pid="6ZmDRiX_RkSa6dVQUbI00g" hash="bOiMTg">In our family, there is one event of a similar nature that stands out. When our youngest son was about four years old, he came into the house and gleefully announced to the family with great pride: “I can do everything now. I can tie, I can ride, and I can zip.” We understood he was telling us that he could tie his shoes, he could ride his Big Wheel tricycle, and he could zip his coat. We all laughed but realized that for him they were monumental achievements. He thought he had truly arrived and was grown up.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p9" pid="72aJsEbBGU2NIgjIQIdvMg" hash="CmGa2Q">Physical, mental, and spiritual development have much in common. Physical development is fairly easy to see. We begin with baby steps and progress day by day, year by year, growing and developing to attain our ultimate physical stature. Development is different for each person.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p10" pid="IGn_8iYiOECQIyPaaNyLug" hash="oDNumw">When we watch a great athletic or musical performance, we often say that the person is very gifted, which is usually true. But the performance is based upon years of preparation and practice. One well-known writer, Malcolm Gladwell, has called this the 10,000-hour rule. Researchers have determined that this amount of practice is necessary in athletics, musical performance, academic proficiency, specialized work skills, medical or legal expertise, and so on. One of these research experts asserts “that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert—in anything.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p11" pid="sgz6zM0fbUGKEPdvQSPGRw" hash="yegB4Q">Most people recognize that to obtain peak physical and mental performance, such preparation and practice are essential.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p12" pid="TlU6B9u56UGBjqMtQDxi0Q" hash="tnSyAg">Unfortunately, in an increasingly secular world, less emphasis is placed on the amount of spiritual growth necessary to become more Christlike and establish the foundations that lead to enduring faith. We tend to emphasize moments of sublime spiritual understanding. These are precious instances when we know the Holy Ghost has witnessed special spiritual insights to our hearts and minds. We rejoice in these events; they should not be diminished in any way. But for enduring faith and to have the constant companionship of the Spirit, there is no substitute for the individual religious observance that is comparable to physical and mental development. We should build on these experiences, which sometimes resemble initial baby steps. We do this by consecrated commitment to sacred sacrament meetings, scripture study, prayer, and serving as called. In one recent obituary tribute for the father of 13 children, it was reported his “loyalty to daily prayer and scripture study profoundly influenced his children, giving them an immovable foundation of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p13" pid="Mi6d23QO0EuuVy4_vAS0_Q" hash="B2MFsw">An experience I had when I was 15 years old was foundational for me. My faithful mother had valiantly tried to help me establish the foundations of faith in my life. I attended sacrament meeting, Primary, then Young Men and seminary. I had read the Book of Mormon and had always prayed individually. At that time a dramatic event occurred in our family when my beloved older brother was considering a potential mission call. My wonderful father, a less-active Church member, wanted him to continue his education and not serve a mission. This became a point of contention.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p14" pid="2dOsWtTAOUKl6P2XyaApyw" hash="X0uNWg">In a remarkable discussion with my brother, who was five years older and led the discussion, we concluded that his decision on whether to serve a mission depended on three issues: (1) Was Jesus Christ divine? (2) Was the Book of Mormon true? (3) Was Joseph Smith the prophet of the Restoration?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p15" pid="ACwtecP5cEC9onMRjRJ1cA" hash="wBdhvQ">As I prayed sincerely that night, the Spirit confirmed to me the truth of all three questions. I also came to understand that almost every decision I would make for the rest of my life would be based on the answers to those three questions. I particularly realized that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ was essential. In looking back, I recognize that, primarily because of my mother, the foundations were in place for me to receive the spiritual confirmation that evening. My brother, who already had a testimony, made the decision to serve a mission and ultimately won our father’s support.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p16" pid="BznfsKEsTE6tY61cwh8sNg" hash="ewMS0Q">Spiritual guidance is received when needed, in the Lord’s time and according to His will.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is an excellent example. I recently viewed a first edition of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith completed the translation when he was 23 years old. We know something of the process and instruments he used in that translation. In that first 1830 printing, Joseph included a short preface and simply and clearly declared it was translated “by the gift and power of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> What about the aids to translation—the Urim and Thummin, the seer stones? Were they essential, or were they like the training wheels on a bicycle until Joseph could exercise the faith necessary to receive more direct revelation?<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p17" pid="oBvRjTGDjEW2Og0mySSCwQ" hash="AG9UEg">Just as repetition and consistent effort are required to gain physical or mental capacity, the same is true in spiritual matters. Remember that the Prophet Joseph received the same visitor, Moroni, with exactly the same message four times in preparation for receiving the plates. I believe that weekly participation in sacred sacrament meetings has spiritual implications we do not fully understand. Pondering the scriptures regularly—rather than reading them occasionally—can substitute a superficial understanding for a sublime, life-changing enhancement of our faith.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p18" pid="Ney498YEkk6C5Hy01S1pcg" hash="jXyjQA">Faith is a principle of power. Let me illustrate: When I was a young missionary, a great mission president<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> introduced me in a profound way to the scriptural account found in <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/8" class="scriptureRef">Luke 8</a> of the woman who had an issue of blood for 12 years and had spent everything she had on physicians who could not heal her. It has remained to this day one of my favorite scriptures.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p19" pid="8NIbBu97LEiiFmPO2E0aWA" hash="IAHIeQ">You will remember that she had faith that if she could but touch the border of the Savior’s garment, she would be healed. When she did so, she was healed immediately. The Savior, who was walking along with His disciples, said, “Who touched me?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p20" pid="018_dHhdiUWNiokvXdxg5Q" hash="XbCNPQ">Peter’s answer was that all of them, walking together, were pressing against Him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p21" pid="QShXROxB6EqRScH2loxRSQ" hash="gsCj5w">“And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p22" pid="mw-u_qyzTk6HMIt2eaAt0Q" hash="e0ALMw">The root word for <span class="emphasis">virtue</span> could easily be interpreted as “power.” In Spanish and Portuguese, it is translated as “power.” But regardless, the Savior did not see her; He had not focused on her need. But her faith was such that touching the border of the garment drew upon the healing power of the Son of God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p23" pid="zzS-CtAfeUiyIE7k3Q18XQ" hash="N3Iscw">As the Savior said to her, “Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p24" pid="-ksCJi093kKPe4qffsYVEA" hash="vGislA">I have contemplated this account all my adult life. I realize that our personal prayers and supplications to a loving Father in Heaven in the name of Jesus Christ can bring blessings into our lives beyond our ability to comprehend. The foundations of faith, the kind of faith that this woman demonstrated, should be the great desire of our hearts.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p25" pid="Tjy7EYrTl0WflCB4h6tPPQ" hash="waekdw">However, initial foundations of faith, even with spiritual confirmation, do not mean that we will not face challenges. Conversion to the gospel does not mean all our problems will be solved.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p26" pid="L042W093jkykwSR16mckCA" hash="IDgKIA">Early Church history and recorded revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants contain excellent examples of establishing foundations of faith and dealing with the vicissitudes and challenges that everyone faces.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p27" pid="sZYqzmYYZ0Gl8SK410B0_Q" hash="rUqYhg">The completion of the Kirtland Temple was foundational for the entire Church. It was accompanied by spiritual outpourings, doctrinal revelations, and restoration of essential keys for the continuing establishment of the Church. Like the ancient Apostles on the day of Pentecost, many members experienced marvelous spiritual experiences in connection with the dedication of the Kirtland Temple.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> But, as in our own lives, this did not mean they wouldn’t face challenges or hardships going forward. Little did these early members know they would be faced with a United States financial crisis—the panic of 1837—that would test their very souls.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p28" pid="1ldWIic5f0KgN-8NFqKBRQ" hash="LiDozg">One example of the challenges related to this financial crisis was experienced by Elder Parley P. Pratt, one of the great leaders of the Restoration. He was an original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In the early part of 1837, his dear wife, Thankful, died after delivering their first child. Parley and Thankful had been married almost 10 years, and her death devastated him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p29" pid="REX5jgBxPUqdBnTZONT33w" hash="IDT2ww">A few months later, Elder Pratt found himself in one of the most difficult times the Church has experienced. In the midst of the national crisis, local economic issues—including land speculation and the struggles of a financial institution founded by Joseph Smith and other Church members—created discord and contention in Kirtland. Church leaders did not always make wise temporal decisions in their own lives. Parley suffered significant financial losses and for a time became disaffected with the Prophet Joseph.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> He wrote a stinging criticism to Joseph and spoke in opposition of him from the pulpit. At the same time, Parley said he continued to believe in the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p30" pid="9RV_X-P4fkWif_z9AdFO6g" hash="qoOsXQ">Elder Pratt had lost his wife, his land, and his home. Parley, without telling Joseph, left for Missouri. On the road there, he unexpectedly met fellow Apostles Thomas B. Marsh and David Patten returning to Kirtland. They felt a great need to have harmony restored to the Quorum and persuaded Parley to return with them. He realized that no one had lost more than Joseph Smith and his family.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith.p31" pid="ROSniaTaikWGEoeYbnwVFg" hash="iLBPqg">Parley sought out the Prophet, wept, and confessed that what he had done was wrong. In the months after his wife, Thankful’s, death, Parley had been “under a dark cloud” and had been overcome by fears and frustrations.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Joseph, knowing what it was like to struggle against opposition and temptation, “frankly forgave” Parley, praying for him and blessing him.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Parley and others who remained faithful benefited from the Kirtland challenges. They increased in wisdom and became more noble and virtuous. The experience became part of their foundations of faith.</p>

Opposition in all things is part of the refiner’s fire to prepare us for an eternal celestial destiny.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> When the Prophet Joseph was in Liberty Jail, the words of the Lord to him described all manner of challenges—including tribulations and false accusations—and conclude:</p>
