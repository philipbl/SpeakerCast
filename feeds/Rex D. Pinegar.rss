      <description>I am reminded as I approach you today of a scripture that was written to me in a letter by one of the missionaries in the North Carolina-Virginia Mission. It expresses the feelings in my heart and is taken from Alma, the 29th chapter, verses 9 and 10</description>

I bring you greetings from the greatest group of missionaries in the world. It is a marvelous thing to labor among them and to feel the strength of the Lord as he works through them and the Saints to bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to his children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p2" guid="ad45a381-f0a9-440d-9bc3-6c440029abbf" pid="3UKnk53WHUuMhrpcUOfbCw" hash="NTS9gA">The blessing of sharing the gospel message is overwhelming. I am often filled with the feelings I think Paul may have had when he wrote to the saints at Ephesus, regarding his call to serve the Lord:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p3" guid="1e2deb3f-7538-41e9-bb65-cfd36a35098e" pid="pLxgZUJ4AkmmNwsBzO0qZQ" hash="iDc9fg">“Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me …</p>

As we see the peace and assurance that come to those who receive the gospel, we become more conscious of the great obligation and opportunity we have to share the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with our friends and neighbors, our brothers and sisters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p9" guid="797a5008-af8f-445b-9f4b-c72242bedeea" pid="DTzIpmNIGkmjh7cFY79CWg" hash="Q4ldSw">The Lord has spoken clearly regarding this sacred responsibility and the condemnation which rests upon members of his church should we fail to keep this commandment. On September 23, 1832, having given commandment unto the Twelve concerning the preaching of the gospel, the Lord then stated:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p10" guid="271f5e99-7140-4145-abcb-2abd8891f580" pid="GyEOObjfm0WpMIPlJnljWA" hash="aPmyxw">“And this revelation unto you, and commandment, is in force from this very hour upon all the world, and the gospel is unto all who have not received it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p11" guid="0f4b4d9b-5d1b-43a4-b5c0-5cd09d421cef" pid="Hc39XSXV_EKhxHP22uYXqA" hash="w-RVQw">“But, verily I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been given —from you it must be preached unto them. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.75-76" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:75–76</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p12" guid="860e9195-47ef-4b55-ac07-b937bc75a775" pid="otfVwzPmQ0S9OW6GynlTvw" hash="8oD3QQ">Joseph Smith has said that the greatest and most important duty we have is to teach others the gospel. He declared the same thing about doing the work for the dead. Each of these activities makes available to others the blessings of membership in the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p13" guid="1da5ff94-d95b-41d7-b05a-0fcefff87f47" pid="yx0wzaHMZEaqNt7WHr_Wug" hash="qbd1_Q">Fulfilling this sacred assignment to “warn our neighbors” brings unspeakable joys to both the receiver and the giver of the gift. Many families throughout the Church are experiencing the joys of doing this most important work. Not only are they “laying up in store that they perish not,” but they are helping our nonmember brothers and sisters to become eligible for these same blessings. They are finding that missionary work is not a task, but a glorious opportunity to assist the Lord in his greatest work—saving the souls of men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p14" guid="411bdc0f-6fb6-499c-9ce2-8cd731f09642" pid="zxjgfknbO06hBaWPRfDfDA" hash="sD25bA">There are many ways one may help others find the Lord. The Jones family, in Raleigh, North Carolina, assisted the Lord by preparing a copy of the Book of Mormon with their family picture and testimony inside the front cover. They then invited the missionaries to their home to meet some close friends, the Browns. The next day the missionaries went to the Browns and presented to them this copy of the Book of Mormon as a gift from the Jones family. The Browns were so appreciative of the gift that they agreed to read, ponder, and pray about this marvelous book of scripture. They did. The elders continued to teach them. The Jones family continued to fellowship them. Today the entire Brown family enjoys church membership.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p15" guid="f09ad18e-4658-405c-bdcb-c577ccfac45f" pid="9UfUD8pKtEW5JmnXHsVRRQ" hash="M7VTFw">Members in a small Virginia branch recently asked for missionaries to labor with them in spreading the gospel in that area. They felt they could arrange at least five meetings per week for the missionaries with interested friends and neighbors. The members have found many more than they had supposed waiting to hear their message. For the past three months the elders have held from four to eight meetings per day. There have been so many meetings that one of the missionaries wrote on the bottom of his weekly report: “Dear President: I am sorry. We have been so busy teaching, we haven’t had time to tract; but don’t worry, we’ll do better next week!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p16" guid="9d6fe0e7-1ff0-44c1-a819-38a12631dde5" pid="OtNuc3kvo0G4TC765g3bOg" hash="MR803w">These missionaries had spent 65 hours that week teaching the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ to friends the members had found. This small branch has made tremendous growth in attendance and home teaching. Several persons who had been absent from church meetings for some time are now active. Through member participation, missionary work has become the solution to several of their problems.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p17" guid="511cee3a-2c7a-4525-bf87-6caf899ed991" pid="NBwKoyR9AEi7qffzt0TtIw" hash="cOV6zw">There is a dentist who shares the gospel at every opportunity—to the “captive audience” in his chair, at the service station where he takes his car, at the post office, even at his neighbor’s home as he seeks advice in running his farm—just everywhere. He says he has read the Book of Mormon until he feels he understands the love and peace the sons of Mosiah felt when they went to preach to the Lamanites. And, I believe, he has the same zeal they had.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p18" guid="07dbad58-ef56-4bcf-bada-87ae2025cc43" pid="wzmOwBj6gU6gg5yYrl20Rw" hash="IEKXoQ">Through his efforts during the past year, missionaries have been introduced to hundreds of people and have brought four families into the Church. This fine member and his home teaching companion diligently go before the elders and set up meetings. He feels the people respond more readily to him because he is a permanent resident in the area. Again, member-missionary oneness has brought the light and peace of the gospel of Christ into the lives of those seeking the truth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p19" guid="eac711ce-1a99-41f5-a951-bf705eb1439d" pid="aqOICjY18kKzKBKcBY-heQ" hash="TtIOaQ">Another member, many miles away, shared the gospel in correspondence to a friend in Richmond, Virginia. A wonderful experience followed. Two missionaries were tracting one day in Richmond. One had been ill; the other felt uneasy as they walked the streets, knowing that his companion was not at his best. Both desired to persevere, however.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p20" guid="02809197-d5e6-4a11-bba8-9792a60dd6e9" pid="AHVlAvDVSEKhnMnKx_k8HA" hash="B9A08Q">After two hours of having little success, they knocked on a door and introduced themselves as missionaries with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “Oh, yes,” the woman replied, “Ann Smith sent you.” The elders looked at each other, shook their heads, then told her they were just knocking at the doors in the neighborhood and that no person in particular had sent them to her. She invited them in; the husband and other family members were present in the room.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p21" guid="2cc06b99-76f8-4045-851c-2d45631ac4d6" pid="36FMZApLtEmxdGObgCma5A" hash="5Om3Xg">She then told the missionaries something that caused them to marvel. She said, “Just an hour or two ago I finished reading a letter that I had received today from my dearest friend who lives in California. A year ago her husband and she were converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and were recently married in the temple. When we last heard, their marriage was falling apart, and she confided in me the sad situation. But today I received this ten-page letter telling me all about your church and the marvelous change it has made in their lives.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p22" guid="fbecabb3-15eb-492b-bcf6-0c20c2465e3a" pid="kxJL4Bh1O0aHPtjBwjIKbQ" hash="Sq37gQ">She allowed the missionaries to read the contents of that letter, which covered Relief Society, Primary, Sunday School, MIA, and much, much more. Then they read a short note at the bottom, which said, “I will be sending two missionaries to your house to teach you more about the Church.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p23" guid="2969e059-cf9b-4ae4-96d7-13f181ac1994" pid="Prj_BnMy_02lyF0Jq2bzng" hash="TFfDgg">After hearing the elders’ message, she said, with tears streaming down her face, “I believe the Lord sent you to us.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p24" guid="9d6fe012-cbd8-4f0c-b68a-2b6031c40cbe" pid="n428lxklk0u-0qzS115KMw" hash="x4ZgWg">When members and missionaries work faithfully together, they become as one and the Lord can use them to achieve his purposes among his children. The Lord had united as one the efforts of this faithful member and these diligent missionaries, to bring this family instruction which, if followed, will bring them joy and peace beyond measure and lead them back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/share-the-unsearchable-riches-of-christ.p25" guid="b8cef901-800c-4010-a627-951cd45f85cc" pid="eMsg04qUUE21OJMNcwk4rQ" hash="Rjurbg">Today we live in a time of trouble and turmoil. Many people are disturbed, discouraged, confused, and looking for something better. The Lord has provided that “something better” in the gospel of Jesus Christ. He has shown his love and concern for us in our time by appearing to a prophet, by revealing the Book of Mormon, and by restoring his church with his authority and power. We have the truth, the authority and power. Now it is our individual and family responsibility and our joy to share these blessings with others.</p>

There is only one way for men to gain a celestial inheritance of eternal glory, and that is to forsake the world, have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, enter his kingdom through the door of baptism, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and then keep his commandments.</p>

We are blessed to have the promise of Ephraim to bring the blessings of the gospel to them. May we keep the commandment to “preach the gospel unto them” who have not yet received the kingdom, by working as one in the Lord’s great missionary effort.</p>

In fact, the boy scoffed at such ideas and afterward tried to convince the girl that her father was old-fashioned and a hypocrite.</p>

It is in the home that we experience many opportunities to do this.</p>

Here in the sacredness of home father and mother teach correct gospel principles to their children. The children also have opportunities to teach and to share their thoughts and talents. Often the most effective learning takes place as family members help each other prepare for family home evening.

The father will teach the children. Here they can learn integrity, honor, dependability, sacrifice, and faith in God. Life’s experiences and the scriptures are the basis of the teaching, and this, wrapped up in filial and parental love, makes an impact nothing else can make. Thus, reservoirs of righteousness are filled to carry children through the dark days of temptation and desire, of drought and skepticism. As they grow up, the children cooperate in building this storage for themselves and the family. And so we have as a basic part of the Lord’s programs the home evening and the family prayers and the teaching of gospel principles in our homes.” (Spencer W.

Observing the diligence and faith of the missionaries has brought to me a greater realization of the blessings that accompany those who continue to serve the Lord in righteousness. I’m grateful to the Lord for the calling I now have which permits me to continue to serve in missionary service.</p>

This fine young man had served well his entire mission. He had demonstrated faith and courage under difficult circumstances. Now he faces the challenge of maintaining his missionary zeal and spirit in the surroundings of home where more subtle opposition may exist.</p>

He said, “The only big thing that is really bothering me about being home and being around the family is that my family is one that likes to do a lot of hunting. Now that used to be a great thing for me, but now it is a lot different, mainly because it means the family will be expecting me to go hunting with them on Sundays. So I am faced with a big decision right off the bat. I really don’t want to go hunting on Sunday, but I don’t want to upset my family because of it. Any counsel would surely be appreciated.” He went on to assure me that he knew his family did not desire nor intend to ask him to do wrong. Hunting was just a longstanding activity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/we-need-to-continue-in-righteousness.p5" pid="gkkaQVsrPkWtjtmbWEA8JA" hash="PHACjw">The counsel I would give to my missionary, and to others who may be faced with the decision to continue or not to continue a righteous course, is to recall the experience of Oliver Cowdery. Oliver had begun his labors in the kingdom with a faithful and humble service. The Lord rewarded him by giving him the gift of translation. He told Oliver of marvelous contributions he could make toward enlightening the people if he would continue faithfully in his efforts. Later when Oliver attempted to translate, he failed. The Lord told Oliver it was “because that you did not continue as you commenced.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 9:5</a>.) Oliver had not continued in his righteous efforts, and the gift was taken from him.</p>

As he approached his home, the voice of the Lord came to him. The Lord reminded Nephi of the blessings that would result from the unwearyingness with which he had labored and taught the people and with which he had kept the commandments of God. With renewed vigor and determination, Nephi turned from his home and returned to his labors to continue as he had commenced. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/10.2-12" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 10:2–12</a>.)</p>

He helps us to understand the blessing of building upon and following the teachings of righteous parents. Enos described his father as a “just man—for he taught me in his language, and also in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, … and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.1,3" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:1, 3</a>.) The continual teachings of a just father caused Enos’ soul to hunger, and he went before the Lord in mighty prayer and supplication for his own soul.</p>

His continuous and fervent humble prayer resulted in a marvelous declaration from on high: “And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.5" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:5</a>.)</p>

We must recognize that there is an opposing force to that which is right. Sometimes hardships come our way or fatigue dims our vision in decision making. It may be a selfish motive or a carnal desire that needs to be overcome before we can continue. In every situation, however, the answer which leads to happiness is to press forward. President Kimball has assured us that when we have done all we can do in a situation, the Lord “will find a way to open doors.”</p>

They met rejection and ridicule at almost every door. After a particularly difficult day, they returned to their apartment dejected and tired. They were not sure they could continue in the face of such opposition. After much discussion and prayer, they retired for the night, determined that on the morrow they would return once more to their area to continue their labors. The next morning they pleaded again with the Lord for strength to face the challenges of the day. That day nearly every family they called on welcomed their message. The Lord blessed their continued efforts and faith and opened the doors of homes and hearts to the message of restoration.</p>

He obtained a copy of the Book of Mormon and began reading. At first he felt nothing, but he continued to read. He remembered that he should pray as he read—that was the counsel the missionaries had given. For the next six evenings he continued to read and to pray. He continued to plead with the Lord to let him know the truths contained in these scriptures.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p18" pid="_mUka9WC40yo2fo6F2Vsig" hash="wsmETQ">One of the commandments of the Lord (that is being heeded today with the fervor reminiscent of our forebears) is the call to go forth and proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ. In April 1974 President Spencer W. Kimball reaffirmed the “call to arms” in these words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p19" pid="PEH_fR9Z_ke35p1gLAMFnw" hash="KdH9sQ">“We have hardly scratched the surface … we can … approach the ideals set out by President McKay, ‘every member a missionary.’ That was inspired! I know this message is not new, and we have <span class="emphasis">talked</span> about it before, but I believe the time has come when we must shoulder arms. … We must change our sights and raise our goals.” (<span class="emphasis">Regional Representatives Seminar,</span> April 1974, p. 18.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p20" pid="llqojZxh_EmQkJjlNUe1oA" hash="5otzAg">The zeal with which the Church membership has responded to President Kimball’s clarion call is very exciting. During 1973 new missionaries were entering the fields of labor at the rate of about 761 each month. In 1974 the rate increased to 847 missionaries each month, and for the first nine months of 1975 the monthly rate has been approximately 1,200. The spirit with which the young and the old are responding is typified in the words of one of them who wrote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p21" pid="C_LxIUUgPUuO4pr0IoOadQ" hash="KF47jg">“The call brought me to tears, not because I was afraid or sad or bewildered, merely overwhelmed by the trust the Lord has given me.

It is not unusual to find outstanding athletes interrupting promising careers to enter missionary service. Other young men postpone schooling and professional career preparation to “take up arms” for the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p23" pid="MtbkJd-Uc0ySUHz765e1bg" hash="YqrKvQ">Representative of these many noble examples is this young man from Brazil:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p24" pid="KMDjEGjHskauM39cJxwIMg" hash="3tgYdw">Fernando Requino was attending a sacrament meeting in his small branch when he heard the mission president emphasize President Kimball’s declaration that every young man should prepare himself for missionary service. Until that time he hadn’t thought it possible or necessary to even consider serving a mission. He had begun an apprenticeship; he supported himself and earned only enough money to pay for his schooling. His parents were not members of the Church nor were they sympathetic to his affiliation with the Church. Still, the words of the prophet pulled at his heart and mind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p25" pid="JUKc5faTqEmu3OPxNhxCwQ" hash="Npq2sg">One morning he met privately with his father and told him of his love and respect for him. Drawing upon all the courage he could muster, Fernando looked straight into his father’s eyes and with a soft, humble voice he said, “Father, I want your permission to go on a mission for the Lord, to serve as a missionary in my church.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p26" pid="ZER7SV2MX0mXZ939vctAqA" hash="uf2iGw">His father objected strongly. He reminded Fernando that he had no financial resources with which to pay for such an undertaking. With tears coursing down his cheeks, this son faced his father and answered that he was ready to sell the plot of land that was his inheritance and use the money obtained to finance his mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p27" pid="WwQleFQsikSR1U5NFNjDCg" hash="1Xn10A">Fernando told his father how a prophet of God had asked every young man to prepare and to go on a mission for the Lord. He told how he himself had fasted and prayed for three days and how the Lord had shown him what to do to fulfill his priesthood responsibility. The father’s heart was softened, and he put his arms about Fernando and together they wept. “If you want to go so much that you are willing to sacrifice your entire inheritance,” said his father, “Then you will have my permission to go. You will not have to sell your property. I will provide the financial support for your mission.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p28" pid="vGeM1Bbf006g2AykFTINcw" hash="Q5_4BQ">The Lord opens the way to serve for anyone who is obedient, faithful, and willing to sacrifice to cause his work to move forward.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p29" pid="VjnAC44O6UKroBCnMac5yw" hash="zyVE7g">Recently I had the privilege of meeting with some missionaries in Stuttgart, Germany. We talked of the urgency of our work and examined ways to improve the effectiveness of their proselyting efforts. We discussed the challenge by President Kimball for missionaries to become eight times more effective in obtaining teaching opportunities. As one group of elders returned to their apartment following the meeting, one of them said, “If the prophet of the Lord says we can do it, we can. We’ll find a way.” And they did! They studied, prayed, and worked. By the close of their next week’s proselyting period the five companionships had given more than 200 discussions. Each pair of missionaries met their goal, to be eight times more effective.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p30" pid="XKEU7fTdC0abVWdPSX4Uig" hash="UpHEGQ">In every part of the world where I have been privileged to visit I have seen similar examples of zeal and devotion. Members in their home branches and wards are also heeding the call of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p31" pid="DzILnVU2r0qMMr0N2lWALQ" hash="B8Q9Xw">One such member is a valiant brother from Guaratengeta, Brazil. He spreads the gospel almost every waking hour and in a unique way. As he meets people he states his name, E. J. Sariva, and hands them his card. He then waits for them to read his name as it is printed on the card: Elder E. J. Sariva, Zion. Often their response is something like this: “What does this “Zion” mean? To which he replies, “Oh, don’t you know about Zion? Let me tell you.” Brother Sariva then introduces his listener to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. With this courageous technique and in his zeal and love for the Lord, Brother Sariva has brought more than 130 souls into the kingdom of our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p32" pid="Za_UdAWMq0KjesHZqeXK8g" hash="JTPMXQ">Another “home front” soldier for the Lord is a taxi driver. In his cab hangs a sign which reads, “I Care.” Most passengers ask “What do you care about?” This good brother then explains that he belongs to a church that cares about people. If his passengers inquire further he accommodates their interest by handing them a copy of the Book of Mormon from the supply of copies he conveniently keeps by his driver’s seat. This faithful member has participated in the conversion of more than 200 souls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/a-call-to-arms.p33" pid="vNrYuYNDoU2x8-qu6Rr7bQ" hash="mJabNw">Yes, “the same spirit animates the whole” today among the members of the Church as they go forth in the greater cause of the Lord. What a thrilling time to be here in the earth! As we see the work rolling forth, may each of us become a part of its progress. May we answer the call as valiantly as did those who are responsible for the rich heritage we enjoy. Through courageous, faithful service may we bring forth a fruitful harvest from the seeds planted in the vineyard of the Lord. I testify that this is the kingdom of God on earth and that his chief steward and our prophet is Spencer W. Kimball. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Tonight we shall listen to the word of the Lord from His living prophet, Spencer W. Kimball. Young men, you’ve heard about prophets. It has been my opportunity to live where I could associate with one for the last four years. Tonight I would like to share some personal experiences which have brought me to an unyielding testimony of the divine call and mission of President Spencer W. Kimball as prophet, seer, and revelator for the Lord Jesus Christ in our day and time.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p2" pid="22hIPTzJIU2HE7WFg47x6g" hash="K6TXAA">It was my privilege to be present when President Kimball became President of the Church. As the body of priesthood bearers raised their hands to sustain President Kimball, there came into my heart and into my mind a calm assurance that this was indeed the will of our Heavenly Father.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p3" pid="hcbjh5rf0EyRQ25CSFyRCQ" hash="HGBkhw">President Kimball, like the Prophet Joseph Smith, is a man of courageous action. He is sensitive to the Spirit, a doer of the work. I have seen him on planes, on buses, in waiting rooms, in hotels, and in chapels, and he is in constant motion—reading, preparing, listening, teaching by precept and by example. His is an inspired and inspiring, warm personal approach as he applies the gospel of Jesus Christ to the people he serves. He seems never too busy nor too tired to attend to the needs of the individual as he encourages each of us to a higher, more excellent personal performance in living.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p4" pid="i8mOZSOvn0Kht80CWjhg4A" hash="93cEyQ">Recently, a young man in a wheelchair was referred to my office for counsel. He had been informed that he had a terminal illness. He desired a blessing and wanted to see a General Authority before he died. Elder Rector and I were talking with him when in came President Kimball. He had learned of the young man’s condition and came to spend a few moments with him. The President makes time for people.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p5" pid="QJz-1q7tdEOb4qaKO1ApqQ" hash="2CY54Q">On another occasion we were returning from area conferences in Europe, and we had a rather extended layover in New York City. Although tired and weary from his rigorous schedule, President Kimball eagerly visited with six missionaries who were en route to the Germany Munich Mission. He inquired about their families, their personal feelings about serving on missions, and then he charged them to be the best missionaries in their mission. He encouraged them to he diligent and faithful and promised that success would accompany such efforts. The missionaries left feeling uplifted in spirit and determined to serve valiantly. President Kimball edifies and inspires others.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p6" pid="36iMm2YKX0-yhH-qaoBCLg" hash="YlPJkw">While in Argentina in 1975 at the area conference, President Kimball spoke to a large gathering of youth. Shortly after he began, he set aside his prepared text and shared a personal experience with them. He asked them, “Who gave you your voice?” He then told them about his experience with surgery to save his voice. He explained that the Lord had spared his voice. He said it wasn’t the same voice he had once had. He couldn’t sing as he had previously enjoyed doing but he did have a voice. He said his voice wasn’t a pretty one, but I tell you it was beautiful in what it taught that night. As he spoke the youth responded even before the translator could interpret his words. He told those present, “Serving a mission is like paying tithing; you’re not compelled—you do it because it’s right. We want to go on missions because it’s the Lord’s way. The Savior didn’t say, ‘<span class="emphasis">If</span> it’s convenient, go,’ he said, ‘<span class="emphasis">Go</span> ye into all the world.’” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/16.15" class="scriptureRef">Mark 16:15</a>.) President Kimball explained that it was the responsibility of young women to help young men remain worthy and to encourage them to go on missions.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p7" pid="onNzMJ0fg0ulXkMzFwYIug" hash="xyHGjQ">As the President concluded his remarks he asked, “Didn’t the Lord give you your voice so you could teach the gospel?” He then testified that he had come to know that his voice and our voices are for the declaring of the gospel of Jesus Christ and for testifying of the truths revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith. President Kimball teaches us the correct perspective of life.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p8" pid="Xp_HjeZQkU25l6JFI3AtHQ" hash="KAZ7YA">Our beloved prophet not only calls us to be better missionaries, to lengthen our stride, he shows us how. In 1975 my wife and I were with President and Sister Kimball in Bogota, Colombia. As we were in the airport for his departure, an airlines representative met with us. Upon being introduced to this fine young man, the prophet extended his hand with these words, “Young man, I hope the next time I shake your hand you’re a member of this church.” Without any hesitation, and with his eyes fixed firmly on those of the prophet, the man replied, “Sir, so do I!” The President turned to the mission president and obtained a commitment from him to teach the man the gospel. Words President Kimball had spoken to missionaries in Bogota had been exemplified in deed: “Give full energy and thought to the Lord’s work—your lives will be rich because of it.” That day I saw how the prophet’s full thought was centered on living the spirit of the calling, as well as carrying out the physical duties that are his.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p9" pid="S59vuLOmH0eduCYz6tT34w" hash="TPCdBw">I was so impressed by the effectiveness of this missionary approach by the prophet that I tried it myself in Puerto Rico. Just a few weeks later I was in San Juan, Puerto Rico, for a district conference. Following the morning session a Brother Martinez brought his nonmember mother and sisters up so I could meet them. As I leaned down over the railing of the stand I could hear the words of President Kimball ringing in my mind. Out they came: “Ma’am, the next time I shake your hand, I hope you are a member of this Church.” To my amazement and joy, her reply came quickly and sincerely, “And sir, so do I.” Five weeks following the conference the Martinez family was baptized. The father followed the rest of the family into the waters of baptism by three weeks. This experience has been repeated at least six times. My life has become rich by following the example set by President Kimball.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p10" pid="hFaSPI1ilEGGxbx7MW696Q" hash="R5d-5w">This past summer my wife and I were again blessed to be with President and Sister Kimball and other General Authorities and their wives at area conferences in Scandinavia and Europe. Following the closing session in Copenhagen, Denmark, we all visited a cathedral referred to as the Dome. Within this great edifice are the best-loved works of Denmark’s greatest sculptor, Bertel Thorvaldsen—his original <span class="emphasis">Christus</span> and the Twelve Apostles. The imposing statue of Christ stands in an alcove at the front of the cathedral beyond an altar. Standing in order along the two sides of the cathedral are the lifelike statues of the apostles, with Paul replacing the betrayer Judas Iscariot. As we looked at those beautiful works of art we noted that Peter was sculptured with large keys in his hands; John is holding scriptures. Others of the Twelve are shown with identifying symbols indicating, for example, the manner in which they earned a living or how they were martyred. President Kimball thoughtfully studied each statue.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p11" pid="EBfre9OnWkypzkhyBq3wKg" hash="gSOXYA">As we were ready to leave the cathedral, the Danish caretaker, a man about sixty years of age, was standing near the door awaiting our departure. President Kimball shook his hand, thanked him for his kindness in letting us visit the cathedral. Then the president began an explanation of the church established by Jesus Christ and of its importance to us. All those present gathered near to be taught by the prophet.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p12" pid="HUaNUKULN06QzthdcfvUeQ" hash="XwtbkQ">He began in simple words which went something like this: “My dear friend, the man who created these statues was surely inspired of the Lord. The beauty and majesty of the <span class="emphasis">Christus</span> are wonderful. While Thorvaldsen was doing his work here, in 1821 to 1844 Joseph Smith was doing his work in America. Thorvaldsen didn’t have the gospel as did Joseph Smith, but he had the Spirit. He must have been inspired to create these statues of Christ and the apostles. He was trying to bring them to life.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p13" pid="RpLRR_xoP0ejTMrx-lxgRQ" hash="vcsu-g">Gathering President Tanner, Elder Monson, and Elder Packer closer to him, the president continued, “We are <span class="emphasis">living</span> apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. There are Twelve Apostles and three others who are the presidency of the Church. We hold the real keys, as Peter did, and we use them every day. They are in use constantly.” Then the president introduced me. “This is a real, live seventy,” he said. “You will recall that the Savior called His Twelve Apostles and His seventy. He sent the seventy two by two before His face into every city into which He Himself should come to prepare the way before Him. We can give you the true gospel of Jesus Christ.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p14" pid="s1t--u0I1UCWVcRvYrKO3Q" hash="b9bhOA">What a thrilling spiritual feeling to hear the prophet bear witness of his own calling and to have so graphically illustrated the importance of living apostles. As beautifully and masterfully done as the statues were, they were only marble and could do no more than remind us of the real priesthood leaders which they represented. How blessed we all felt to be present with a living prophet and apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. Brethren, we must be more than “marble.” We must follow the prophet’s lead and become “living examples” of Christ—bearers—living carriers of His message of salvation to those about us.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p15" pid="ggppFZ7wCUi-5nN3-WsPlw" hash="4t_V6Q">My testimony of the divine call of Spencer W. Kimball as the Lord’s prophet has grown from that sweet assurance at the time of his sustaining. Observing his personal example with individuals, with groups of people, in his nonpublic doings, with members and nonmembers of the Church, I have seen and felt his concern for the individual, his dauntless missionary spirit, and his commitment of his full energy and thought to the work of the Lord. In each of these settings, there has come into my soul that witness that here indeed is the prophet of God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p16" pid="wZDVZCBDtEuj7qeO-j0QxQ" hash="hvUPjw">I testify to you that Jesus is the Christ; that He is the Head of this Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and that He does have living apostles of whom the chief apostle is President Spencer W. Kimball. These men do hold the keys of priesthood authority and power, the soul-saving power administered by the Savior Himself during His sojourn here in the earth.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-living-prophet.p17" pid="GNPvI85zJkaaBDIT9vkLPA" hash="Ub26iw">Think of it! The Lord loves us so much that He has placed these great men here on the earth to guide us safely back into His presence. Take a good look at them. Listen to their counsel thoughtfully and prayerfully.</p>

His mind was focused upon an important event that was soon to occur in his family. His only son would be leaving home in just a few days to serve as a missionary in a far-distant land. His great love for his son caused him to reflect, “If my son is going so far away to teach about our Church, this had better be the best church!” Then he took out a notepad and pen and began to list the characteristics or qualities one would look for in the best church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-gift-of-love.p2" pid="slRSIgSUtk2Kt6lBNecS1w" hash="Zofrpg">“There should be a program to build and strengthen youth,” he wrote, “an athletic program, a wholesome activity program, a program for teaching and training children, a program for developing the skills and talents of women, a program to provide for the needy, for the ill, for the lonely, for the victims of catastrophes and disasters, a program to provide opportunities for work and service, a program to assist families and individuals in spiritual development and progress.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-gift-of-love.p3" pid="ynT529iYakKrtFgSB-aU0Q" hash="bfZNnA">His list became long and impressive, and he satisfied himself that his church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, offered a program to meet the need of every individual. Truly, he determined, it is the best church his son could represent!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-gift-of-love.p4" pid="FD-2wSCex0G_wazNU3QRlA" hash="IAJEew">My friend felt so good about his list of attractive qualities of the best church that he decided to show it to the gentleman seated next to him on the plane. The man, an executive from a financial firm, responded with interest and respect. Together they reviewed the list, and as they concluded their conversation the businessman asked my friend, “Would you like to know what I would look for in a church? There is just one criterion: the members of that church would best exemplify the teaching of the Savior—‘Love thy neighbor as thyself.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-gift-of-love.p5" pid="hZ2Lfi4k00mRvp8FZcESdQ" hash="ZxJyfg">My friend said he learned an important lesson from that experience. He had taught this fine man about the programs of the Church without acknowledging that the purpose of these programs is to help members learn how to love God and their fellowmen. He has shared that experience with me and permitted me to share it with you today that we might all be reminded of this.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-gift-of-love.p6" pid="6CKGZrgdSUiFNiyQkDGLRQ" hash="tIr78w">“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-gift-of-love.p8" pid="cQj2wuWtMEaERjBFxU3OAw" hash="ynumnQ">It is that love for the Lord and for our neighbors—all men everywhere—that is the motivating force which prompts my friend’s son, and twenty-seven thousand like him, to leave home, friends, family, security, and comfort to go among unknown neighbors throughout the world with the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is because we love the Lord and our neighbor that we are willing to go to any length, sacrifice at any price, to share the message that has brought joy and happiness into our own lives. For Latter-day Saints declare that God lives. He loves all men. He will lead all who will repent and follow him to everlasting joy and happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-gift-of-love.p9" pid="JDs3fjcA2kSe9zEP8BxUQA" hash="SeKNGA">We believe the people of the world are yearning for a message such as this to believe in. A national survey conducted recently by a leading publishing company revealed that the people of the world are in desperate need of a religion that will “regenerate their underlying faith in Christian living, … that will help them find the strength within themselves which their forefathers had, … a religion that will bring back strong family relationships, … and a religion that reflects the pioneering strengths which built this great country.” (Unpublished report, Littlepage Limited Advertising, 15 Aug. 1978.) This survey discovered that the basic concepts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints parallel the religious needs that people are seeking. The New York-based publishing company stated: “In a time of confusion, they (Mormons) give very clear and definite answers. … Their growth prospects for the immediate future seem very good … in that great world that is awaiting conversion.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-gift-of-love.p10" pid="DE1BHx-9lkqZgtezzVnL7w" hash="-0ut_w">My eleven-year-old daughter, Kristen, expressed a concern to me a few days ago that I believe is felt by many who are seeking to find a better, more righteous way of life. She said, “Dad, I’ve been challenged to live just one day as Jesus would live, but I’ve tried for a week now and I just can’t do it. Every day I think this will be that day. Then I make a mistake, and I have to wait for another day before I can try again.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-gift-of-love.p11" pid="dUGaSgySdEiWfoPC17jKiQ" hash="__XIRQ">I am often asked to counsel with people who experience somewhat that same dilemma. They want to correct and change their lives. They feel, however, that they have made so many mistakes that there is no way to cast off the burdens they now bear because of those sins. They feel weighted down by sorrow and despair, with no hope of escape.</p>

All the world needs to be taught of the great redeeming power of the Savior’s love. He loves us so much he has promised to forgive us of those things we do that are wrong and remember them no more if we will only repent and come unto him (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:42</a>). He loves us so much that he was willing to pay the price for those sins. He suffered for us. He died for us. He said, Come follow me; cast your burdens on the Lord. His desire is to lift us, to help us, to guide us, to save us.</p>

He put his hand on the boy’s head to comfort him and said, “‘My boy, God loves you.’” The boy soon arose “from his bed, and called out to the people in the house, ‘God loves me! God loves me!’ One word! It changed that boy. The sense that God loved him overpowered him, melted him down, and began the creating of a new heart in him. And that is how the love of God melts down the unlovely heart in man, and begets in him the new creature, who is patient and humble and gentle and unselfish. And there is no other way to get it. There is no mystery about it. We love others, we love everybody, we love our enemies, <span class="emphasis">because He first loved us.</span>” (<span class="emphasis">The Greatest Thing in the World,</span> Old Tappon, N.J.: Fleming H.

As I unwrapped the handsome package and discovered its contents, I was overcome with emotion. It was a precious item. I had seen it before in the office of the one who was now giving it to me. I had openly admired it for its unique capabilities and usefulness. It was finely crafted and very expensive. I was deeply touched as I received this generous gift—not because of its monetary value, but because I recognized the great love that the giving of this gift demonstrated to me. Here was an object I knew my benefactor could not afford to purchase for himself or for me. I knew that someone who loved him had bestowed that gift upon him. He was built up and made happy because of that gesture of love toward him. Now in his desire to bring me happiness, to express his love to me, he was sharing one of the finest material possessions he had.</p>

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/decide-to-decide.p2" pid="TbboONE-5E2zZRbnyyHAvg" hash="ht7z8Q">I am grateful for my assignment with the young men of the Church. Those in the Aaronic Priesthood quorums of the Church are our future missionaries, Church leaders, and leaders in the world. With so great an opportunity, I desire today to speak to this vast army of youth about their power to be whatever they decide to be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/decide-to-decide.p3" pid="KC8V_Bys-0mzhdsfWpUIIw" hash="bbc2Tw">This summer I had the unforgettable experience of camping with twenty-six hundred of these wonderful Aaronic Priesthood Young Men and their leaders. Amid a colorful array of tents and Boy Scout uniforms, the encampment took the shape of a giant twelve-spoked wheel. Each spoke housed one of Israel’s twelve “tribes.” The six days of camping at the Florida Deseret Ranch provided camping skills, special demonstrations, tests of physical fitness, inspirational programs, and numerous other activities (not to mention consumption of fifty-eight hundred gallons of milk, sixty-three thousand pounds of ice, one thousand cases of soft drinks, and one and one-half tons of bread). The young men and their priesthood leaders participated together, focusing upon priesthood objectives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/decide-to-decide.p4" pid="xLkFy6CVy0i6RPfpl27KZQ" hash="S3fy6g">On the first evening at dusk, with each “tribe” in place, all of “Israel” marched to an arena for the opening campfire. The golden rays of sunset formed a magnificent backdrop for the mile-long line of young men as they marched two abreast toward the arena. With colorful banners held aloft, the modern-day sons of Israel passed beneath an archway emblazoned with the Scout Promise: “On My Honor.” Sentries stood holding torch-lighted signs inscribed with the Scout Oath and Law and Aaronic Priesthood objectives. As the priesthood leaders led their young men past these sentries, it was anticipated that each young man would make a personal commitment to strive daily toward eternal life, to be a worthy priesthood bearer, worthy to serve a mission; worthy to marry in the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/decide-to-decide.p5" pid="jvpzMG38s0OfgksWpa1Xvw" hash="jcehBQ">The decisions made that night were followed up during the next four days by special “mountaintop” experiences. The leaders of ancient Israel often went to a designated mountaintop to receive special instruction from the Lord. It was planned that these “Israelite” priesthood bearers would prepare themselves to come to especially designated locations at the encampment where they might receive spiritual guidance and counsel. Here they learned that, having committed themselves to live the basic principles of the gospel, they had also committed themselves to make other important decisions regarding such things as being morally clean, being honest in word and deed, keeping the Word of Wisdom, and so forth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/decide-to-decide.p6" pid="Bba6GmZl_kyUVSlPaomUTw" hash="jSGvkQ">These are some of the “certain things” to which President Kimball referred in a recent conference address:</p>

We can make a single decision about certain things that we will incorporate in our lives and then make them ours—without having to brood and redecide a hundred times what it is we will do and what we will not do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/decide-to-decide.p8" pid="EkmaAkRG6UG-_V7RP5qS1Q" hash="N3ttSA">“… My young brothers, if you have not done so yet, decide to decide!” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>May 1976, p. 46; italics added.)</p>

Paul Getty, considered to be at one time one of the world’s wealthiest men, gave this formula for success: “Rise early, work late, and strike oil!” Mr. Getty has also made the thought-provoking comment that “it is possible for a man to get on a train that goes 60 miles per hour and say to himself, ‘I am going 60 miles per hour.’ But it is not true. Unless he is moving ahead on his own power, he is standing still.” (J. Paul Getty, <span class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest,</span> Sept. 1980, p. 94.)</p>

Mr. Stern told of having given his first concert in San Francisco at a young age. Music critics were extremely impressed and predicted a fine future for the promising young talent. With this encouragement, Isaac Stern began preparations for another concert a year later in New York City. The critics were not so kind to him there. It would require a tremendous amount of work, they judged, if Isaac Stern were to achieve success as a soloist.</p>

Should he now seek a profession as just another member of an orchestra?</p>

At every age life presents trials to bear and difficulties to overcome. Growing up is hard. There are often the heartaches of feeling wronged or rejected. Pursuing an education can press us to our financial, emotional, and intellectual limits. Serving a mission is not easy. It requires total dedication, spiritually and physically. The problems accompanying marriage, rearing a family, earning a living, or coping with illness, old age, and death are realities of life which we are required to meet, but with which we may be unprepared or unwilling to deal.</p>

One young lady held up an illustration in her Book of Mormon, painted by Arnold Friberg. It depicted the two thousand sons of Helaman known as the “stripling soldiers.” (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.22" class="scriptureRef">Alma 53:22</a>.)

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.56-58" class="scriptureRef">Alma 53:56–58</a>.) When their fathers were converted to the gospel, the fathers covenanted with the Lord that they would never again take up arms. But eventually their homes were threatened by hostile armies to the extent that the fathers would have to choose to fight or die. It was then that the two thousand young men, not bound by the same covenant, volunteered to defend their parents and their homes.</p>

Some of us may feel that life would not be so hard if we only had more wealth, or if we had a higher social station or better acceptance among our peers. Some may feel that if only they were married they could be truly happy. Others are seeking to be free from the responsibilities of marriage, thinking <span class="emphasis">that</span> would ease their challenges of life.</p>

From the time of his birth, life has been a challenge. When he became old enough to go to school, he pedaled himself on a tricycle in order to move about and keep up with the other children. When his short legs kept him from playing games and participating in athletics, he busied himself in preparing for a vocation in the business world. To obtain employment, he found it necessary to persist and to prove himself. When a job opportunity finally came to him, he found joy in life through his love for his work.</p>

Laurie Polk, already extremely limited in his physical mobility, lost the sight in one eye. Nearly complete loss of the use of his crippled, dwarfed legs followed shortly thereafter. Then, as if that were not enough of a trial for any man, the retina of Laurie’s other eye became detached and complete blindness encompassed him.</p>

Through the power of faith in God, Laurie Polk has learned the meaning of life. In his thirty-four inch frame, he possesses a strength not unlike the sons of Helaman, through which he not only overcomes the personal challenges he encounters—he actually finds joy in living. He knows he can solve any problem by putting his life in harmony with God and serving his fellowman.

To my daughter and to all others who are meeting new or challenging times, I say: Do not fear the challenges of life, but approach them patiently, with faith in God. He will reward your faith with power not only to endure, but also to overcome hardships, disappointments, trials, and struggles of daily living. Through diligently striving to live the law of God and with faith in Him, we will not be diverted from our eternal course either by the ways or the praise of the world.</p>

Our aircraft carrier was operating off the coast of Korea in rather choppy seas. As one of the Corsair fighter planes was attempting a landing, the ship rolled sharply, and the plane bounced off the flight deck, flipped over, and landed upside down, dangling partly on the ship and partly in the water. The pilot was rescued by a team of men linked together by a lifeline that enabled them to make their way down the wing to the plane’s cockpit. It became necessary, however, to rig a large crane to retrieve the plane.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel-lifeline.p2" pid="u8St8sCEC0mBs6B2aCGnhA" hash="CwaLxg">The boom, or arm, of the crane was stored in a cradle, or saddle-like device, approximately six to eight feet out from the side of the flight deck over the water. The rather dangerous assignment to release the boom was given to me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel-lifeline.p3" pid="heVAHl8bNEaiGNuqChhUbg" hash="s-eQ6Q">I put on a life jacket, and a lifeline secured to a steel cleat on the deck was placed about my waist and between my legs. Three men stood on the flight deck holding on to the line to save me should I slip from my precarious position.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel-lifeline.p4" pid="5Oupx3oUTUOyi2FDi9GnmQ" hash="zf1z1g">With my arms and legs straddling the boom, I inched my way along over the churning waters. The men holding the lifeline kept assuring me that they would not let me fall—at least not very far.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel-lifeline.p5" pid="-X6X_dJ2wUqanAeDY5Fjug" hash="cFBq3Q">When I reached the cradle where the boom rested, the nut and key bolt securing it appeared to be somewhat rusted from months at sea. It appeared that a great deal of force would be needed to jar it free. This would be no small trick while I was sitting astride the slick, round boom. The lifeline team readied themselves, knowing that the push with my rigger’s spike might throw me off balance and cause me to fall.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-gospel-lifeline.p6" pid="w8OvybXxXEK1NJdPuA6dAQ" hash="8MdSYQ">With the spike in place, I leaned forward, making a quick, heavy thrust, expecting the nut to resist my effort. Unexpectedly, the nut spun free, and the force of the thrust sent me quickly off the boom. Surprisingly, however, rather than tumbling down into the water, I spun completely around and stopped atop the boom in an upright position. By grasping the steel cradle, I was able to steady myself. The men holding the lifeline had stood firmly in place, carefully managing the line, making my situation as guarded and safe as possible.</p>

My mother’s letter reminded me of the lifeline of the greatest security and trust, the gospel of Jesus Christ. That lifeline is secured in the hands of God. If I would hold to it and live by it, it would hold me secure to eternal life.</p>

Because there wasn’t a branch of the Church in their small city, their home became the first meeting place for the few Church members his wife could locate and invite to worship with her. Their home was always open to the missionaries, where a good meal and a place to sleep could be counted on. (His wife recalls as many as fourteen missionaries sleeping wall-to-wall in their small home on one particular night.)</p>

These are (1) religious activity in the home (such as family prayer, family home evening, family scripture study) and (2) agreement with parents on values and on goals for the future. These two influences were found to have a greater impact than all other factors combined in creating these essential desires.</p>

Just as Lehi in the Book of Mormon saw in a vision the significance of the fruit of the gospel of Jesus Christ and then invited his family to partake, so should fathers in the Church today partake of the fruit of the gospel and hold out this lifeline to their wives and children. And, just as Nephi was obedient to his father and came forward faithfully and partook of the gospel’s fruit and received its blessings, so should every son today grasp firmly the iron rod, the lifeline of the gospel spoken of by Nephi, and, like Nephi, follow his father’s and his priesthood leaders’ righteous examples.</p>

Because he represents God, he cannot take this office to himself but must be called of God. In a special sense, a bearer of this priesthood power and authority delegated by God belongs to God. He must be holy and clean before Him. He represents the Lord and acts as His agent when officiating in or performing his priestly duties. Such priesthood rights are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven and can, therefore, be handled or utilized effectively only on the basis of personal righteousness.

Our ship was in the south Sea of Japan when a typhoon struck. The sea became so turbulent that lifelines were rigged along the weather decks and in every passageway below. For three days the raging storm caused the ship to pitch and roll, making it dangerous to walk anywhere without holding to a lifeline. Even the common tasks of shipboard life became difficult to perform without a lifeline. Only a foolish or inexperienced seaman ventures topside in a storm without a lifeline. He knows that even in a calm sea a lifeline is kept within ready reach.</p>

It was a beautiful sight on that hazy winter day. Senses were stirred as one drove with anticipation along that friendly, colorful street. Around each bend in the road rose the yellow balloons, waving upward to the top of the hill where they warmly proclaimed: “WELCOME HOME, BRIGHAM!” I had heard of Brigham Fordham only a few months ago when I was told of this young eighteen-year-old’s tragic accident that left him paralyzed. I only now discovered that this was his home and his homecoming from the hospital.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p2" pid="GCxMgEJqkkSRgyN8qP6O0A" hash="_YWKpw">I noticed the ramp that had been built to the front of the house and thought of other changes that would have been made in his home to accommodate the changes in his life. There will be changes in Brigham’s family, too, I thought. Life will be different for all the Fordhams—and difficult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p3" pid="scGgsHzJ3EuaA26dwhP65A" hash="drQiYA">But, as the yellow balloons brightly signaled to Brigham and to all who had the opportunity to travel this street, his was a caring home where family love and strength would be found.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p4" pid="isups1wLhUiF2DPKGCepfg" hash="VL5soA">Our Heavenly Father has organized us into families for the purpose of helping us successfully meet the trials and challenges of life. The home also exists to bless us with the joys and privileges of family associations. Our family is our safety place, our support network, our sanctuary, and our salvation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p5" pid="CcJgtN1GyUWkbwruSfXfnw" hash="QTo3cQ">Our homes should be “the strong place to which children can come for the anchor they need in this day of trouble and turmoil,” said President Harold B. Lee. (<span class="emphasis">His Servants Speak,</span> comp. R. Clayton Brough, Bountiful, Utah: Horizon, 1975, p. 154.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p7" pid="gX5g0x9zxEGxDSBxJRJ_xw" hash="7PSJyw">He states, “No matter what the form of your family, from single-parent household to the largest multi-generation family in your town, your work at keeping families together is the job of saving our world.” (Ibid, p. 351.)</p>

There is no happiness without service, and there is no greater service than that which converts the home into a divine institution, and which promotes and preserves family life.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 300.)</p>

My good friend Alvie Evans lived in a low-lying area near the water, where the maximum strength of the storm was headed. He gathered his family together and moved to higher ground, to the home of his mother.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p12" pid="QZIIB9_G3Em_uo9IanIo2g" hash="pPd-pw">Late in the night, 150-mile-per-hour winds raged around them, uprooting trees and ripping away parts of the house. The storm became so severe they began to fear they would experience physical harm. Alvie, with his wife and children, his mother and his brothers and sister and their families, knelt together in the entrance hall of the home and prayed humbly to the Lord, asking for protection and for safety.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p13" pid="vGpCygUZHUmT8t4QmsIm4Q" hash="EOOA0g">The next morning they viewed the devastation. Of the fifty or more large, strong oak trees that had been growing in his mother’s yard, only eight remained standing. There was damage to the house, the cars, the entire city, but the family was safe. The Lord had heard their prayers and had protected them through the storm. Alvie said, “I didn’t know then if we would have a house to return to, but I knew we would always have a home, because our family was intact and secure.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p14" pid="4orEqVsOI02d7O_CuJhMuA" hash="FznLSQ">President David O. McKay once said, “There is nothing temporary in the home of the Latter-day Saint.” (In Conference Report, June 1919, p. 77.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p15" pid="uUaCvGxjoUWw3HidfwFvXA" hash="uf1Y3g">He also stated: “[One] can have a beautiful house with all the decorations that modern art can give or wealth bestow. [It] can have all the outward forms that will please the eye and yet not [be] a home. … It may be a hovel, a log hut, a tent, a wickiup, if you have the right spirit within, the true love of Christ, and love for one another—fathers and mothers for the children, children for parents, husband and wife for each other—you have the true life of the home that Latter-day Saints build and which they are striving to establish.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Ideals,</span> Salt Lake City: Improvement Era, 1953, pp. 480–81.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p17" pid="-RKgm2PUhEy9ruRBfZhtng" hash="81j1xQ">Dr. Pearsall expresses the opinion that families aren’t failing, but we are failing the family because we have not learned how to put family life first in our world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p18" pid="BhmXXrtY6UKZK7AxhTy8eQ" hash="Ylh3bA">“Our society is interfering with the family-first feature,” he writes. “We are in familial bankruptcy and have fallen into the hands of receivers such as schools, businesses, recreational pursuits, and numerous institutional demands. The issue is not one of setting priorities; the issue is one of making difficult choices for the family. There can only be one number one,” he stresses. “Is it your family?” He makes this emphatic statement: “I warn you that if your family does not come first, your family will not last.” (Pearsall, p. 18.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p19" pid="0nmg_V_3Y0qu-Pz45kUxlg" hash="LHL5mw">In homes where high ideals and gospel values are maintained, it is parents, not teachers, who lay the foundation of character and faith in the hearts of their children. If the training a child should receive in the home is neglected, neither the Church nor the school can compensate for the loss.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p20" pid="glf8EKBl5EWi_oNbPooJbA" hash="OE4DRQ">In recent instruction from the First Presidency and the Twelve, President Thomas S. Monson pointed out that “the primary responsibility for building testimonies and providing faith-building experiences in our members, including our youth, resides in the home. The Church should continue to support the determination of the family to do this.” President Monson encouraged priesthood leaders to “increase their efforts to build strong, gospel-centered homes.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1990, p. 93.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p21" pid="eOapaBqQlkC2iTi4ngPGjw" hash="Fp3ZDQ">To assist us in this vital endeavor, major changes in Church budgeting policies have been made, which Elder Boyd K. Packer said “will have the effect of returning much of the responsibility for teaching and counseling and activity to the family where it belongs. … There will be fewer intrusions into family schedules and in the family purses.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p22" pid="mRZkaEpWEU6De2h4jh7zhg" hash="TP7Ozw">“Church activities must be replaced by family activities.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p24" pid="cNyauRt9zUSm-2a1d6U5dg" hash="FvfCmg">Only when parents and children work together for the same high objective—to put home and family first—can the home be preserved as God intended.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p25" pid="0wDHPpxAN0ecLNs7aB9JYg" hash="yIonSA">Just a few weeks ago we had a special opportunity for a family get-together. A married daughter and her husband came with their three little boys for a short stay before their move from the East Coast of the United States to the West Coast. Another married daughter and her husband came with their four children from out of town to make it possible for the entire family to be together for a weekend.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p26" pid="ER7RxHMyIEOhi1BNpJBGWg" hash="lWapPA">On Sunday evening all of our family gathered in our home just to celebrate being together—“all under one roof again,” exclaimed my wife. She had planned a special program for the occasion, with the appropriate theme, “Making Memories.” She had a recording of one of our daughters singing a song about memories. She had obtained copies of a particular book about the subject as a special gift for each son and daughter. To make the memory of that weekend really complete, there would be a family picture taken. Every detail about the evening had been meticulously planned. It would be certain to create a happy memory for each family member. Or would it?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p27" pid="8c9cTAkAo0C2CdCN4SmS6g" hash="FTD0ZA">While the beautiful song played softly in the background, the living room filled with the noise and laughter of our growing family circle. The grandchildren couldn’t sit still. They giggled and teased and played happily with one another. The grownup children enjoyed each other, too, and all talked at once, it seemed, about days gone by and about the future. They laughed with each other and laughed at the antics of their children, who by now were having tickling matches on the floor or sticking little fingers into the chocolate mint cake. It had become frustrating—and funny!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p28" pid="Mhrry7elx0GX6X8B6zJCpg" hash="j_R1Pg">I don’t know which was more frustrating or funny—the family program which ended soon after it began, with Bonnie, the would-be “memory-maker,” sighing, “Oh, what’s the use? No one’s listening!” or the photo session, with twelve frenzied adults all trying unsuccessfully to pose eleven overactive, squirming children. Was this a family celebration? Or was it a family circus? One thing I knew, this was not the way Bonnie had intended it to be. She had wanted this time of family gathering to be meaningful and memorable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p29" pid="5AvcwEoiIUaPUbjfv2U5JQ" hash="Oq2V4Q">A few days after everyone had gone and our house was again very quiet, a little book came for us. It was a picture book about families, and it was inscribed: “To my warm and loving, full-of-fun family—every one of you,” with a special note added for Mom: “Here’s to the wonderful chaos, the wonderful photos, the wonderful gathering place, the wonderful memories you so lovingly help to create each time we’re together.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p30" pid="Xox-WWk270iHtnR1e7Uktg" hash="YtEMbg">Later, this note from another daughter: “Thank you for a wonderful stay. The boys haven’t been this happy in many months. It has been so nice for them to feel so loved and to have a little extra attention and spoiling. I’m so glad we could all watch together as Clark learned to walk, and that he could start forming his special bonds with loving grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Our children couldn’t be more blessed to have such a loving, supportive family network.”</p>

There are problems in our family, as in many families—challenges related to serious illness, aging parents, schooling, employment, and others. However, individual burdens and concerns may be lightened by the power of a family united in mutual love and support and in prayers of faith.</p>

Donald Pinnell said of that moment, “We could tell that our home was completely engulfed in flames; and I just stopped the car at the top of the hill for a few minutes. I said to my sons, ‘Now look, you can spend all your life storing up treasures of the earth, and you can sit on a hill and watch them go up in flames, or, you can store up the right kind of treasures and take them with you through eternity.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/home-first.p38" pid="HVN6LiHYrUywj1nbjDIk_g" hash="9EgXSQ">The right kind of treasures are our families and those divine attributes and qualities of character that are taught and learned in gospel-centered homes.</p>

Hinckley made this observation: “It is easy to be a Mormon and accept the theology. It is difficult to be a Christian and follow Christ in word and deed.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p3" pid="Qjf5vrvQW0imTlKYYjIXMg" hash="oJ1z2Q">President Hinckley’s challenging words came with renewed force to my mind later when I was reading a book by Michael H. Hart entitled <span class="emphasis">The 100: A Ranking of History’s Most Influential Persons.</span> To my surprise and disappointment, Mr. Hart ranks Jesus Christ third on his list of people who have had the greatest effect on the course of human history.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p4" pid="BzPITmmHh0qYcUvr-xSQzQ" hash="yRKe_g">The author’s reason for placing Jesus third in importance is as follows:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p5" pid="jLiNR-HgAUmjtLolXOjfmw" hash="DUfH9Q">“The impact of Jesus on human history is so obvious and so enormous that few people would question his placement near the top of the list. Indeed, the more likely question is why Jesus … has not been placed first.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p6" pid="hSxUrAVng0q-cZl-xQYcFw" hash="E_JxTw">The author acknowledges that the teachings of Jesus Christ are “surely among the most remarkable and original ethical ideas ever presented. If they were widely followed, I would have had no hesitation in placing Jesus first in this book.” (Secaucus, N. J.:Citadel Press, 1987, pp. 47, 50.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p8" pid="aRJDRS8efkqHbrJGK7kxqg" hash="CCDHag">With these thoughts in mind, I feel it is appropriate for us to ask, “Where do we rank Jesus Christ in our lives? Does He come first, as He should?” Perhaps a more significant question would be, “Where would we rank ourselves as <span class="emphasis">followers</span> of Jesus’ teachings?” Do we live as Christians in word and deed?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p9" pid="8OlpNOwalUKX9DdQekxatA" hash="SItRaA">This is especially important for us because as bearers of the priesthood we have had bestowed upon us authority and power to officially act in the name of Jesus Christ. We have the sacred obligation and privilege to bear His name with dignity. Of all men on the earth, we are to keep His influence foremost in our lives, to bring a consistency in what we preach and in our conduct. As we do so, we will become converted and strengthen each other, and His teachings and all that His life represents will have their rightful influence and honor among mankind.</p>

Our four young daughters were excited as we approached the turnoff to that famous park. The laughter and happy chatter stopped suddenly, however, as our rented station wagon sputtered and chugged to an unexpected stop on the exit ramp. Many cars sped by us in the rush-hour traffic as I tried unsuccessfully to get the car running again. Finally, realizing there was nothing more we could do, we got out of the stalled car and huddled together off the road for a word of prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p11" pid="vawrOkgI0kCXBGGDRiWOvQ" hash="6B0Hew">As we looked up from our prayer we saw a smiling, handsome man and his son maneuver their bright red sports car through the lanes of traffic and pull off the road beside us. For the remainder of the morning and into the afternoon these men assisted us and cared for our needs in many kind and helpful ways. They took us and our belongings to the receiving area at the park. In their small car, it took several trips. They helped me locate a tow truck for the stranded car; they drove me to the rental agency to get a replacement vehicle. Then, because there was some delay, they drove back to where my family waited to let them know where I was. They bought refreshments for them and then waited with my family until I returned several hours later.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p12" pid="gnWaSxI8hUyJtpIzpfLOjw" hash="aGTy3A">We felt that these men were truly an answer to our prayer, and we told them so as we said good-bye and tried to thank them. The father responded, “Every morning I tell the good Lord that if there is anyone in need of my help today, please guide me to them.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p13" pid="wuwIlOk0m0OTZ3kO8Fl0Bw" hash="5Vid9g">We ranked those men very high as followers of Christ that day. Their influence remains with us still. There have been many days since then and possibly equally as many other people uplifted and influenced by daily acts of Christian kindness of that father and his son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p14" pid="CXdTFY-wJ0eIHAEik-zwAg" hash="jp1D0w">Acts of Christian service should be part of our everyday agenda. In the book of Acts, chapter 10, verse 38, it is said of Jesus that He “went about doing good.” [<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.38" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:38</a>] Jesus taught us how to do good: love our neighbors, forgive others, care for the poor, the needy, the afflicted, the lonely. It is inspiring to see that the Lord has organized His church to also do these same things—to care for the needs of others through various assignments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p15" pid="lJj7w1qvXUSBYi56OGb66g" hash="9_f7yQ">These planned acts of service generated through church programs are important and commendable. They are the mark of a Christian people. The Church has a function in service and renders assistance that cannot be provided by individuals alone. These opportunities of the Church as an institution, however, cannot fulfill the responsibility you and I have for personal acts of Christlike kindness. These lift our soul and renew our relationship with our Heavenly Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p16" pid="Cj_uwgTvmEK5JrZb0TnxMg" hash="sw1Ewg">President Spencer W. Kimball said, “The major strides which must be made by the Church will follow upon the major strides to be made by … individuals.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1979, p. 82.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p17" pid="EAK12VsFEkm_qkel-c4yLQ" hash="2qmRHg">Perhaps the greatest of Christian acts are those we never hear about. They are deeds done quietly, spontaneously, anonymously, without expectation of recognition or compensation. Christian acts begin with Christlike thoughts in our hearts. Then, Christ’s teachings and His characteristics will be reflected naturally in our actions. Soon, there will be more friendly smiles, more kindly words, more courteous responses from us—all seemingly small, insignificant acts, yet they can have a great impact in all our lives. President Rex Lee of BYU has said, “Christlike niceness is … the cornerstone of [Christ’s] teachings.” (Brigham Young University Devotional, 10 Sept. 1991.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p18" pid="pj707AnzP06IZYaFKcE5xw" hash="To8S9g">A junior high-age youth hurried home from school one day with steps lighter and quicker than usual, rushed into the house and called, “Guess what? Someone said hi to me today!”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p20" pid="qYJ7MO7ph0yAU6K2siBW0w" hash="vtz5FA">I know a young priest, Jason, who faithfully and quietly attends to his aging grandmother’s needs. He stops by her home regularly to care for her yard, wash windows, or run errands. Sometimes he’ll prepare something for her to eat if he sees she hasn’t been eating enough that day. One Saturday when she wasn’t feeling well, he took his friend to play Monopoly at her home so she wouldn’t be alone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p21" pid="jCU3zKTXB0OyO_FbHaCqYQ" hash="BsYHJg">Young men and brethren, honoring womanhood is also part of following Christ. His show of understanding toward Mary and Martha, his respect and concern for his mother, and the honor bestowed on her demonstrate that Christian men are to be considerate, honest, courteous, caring toward women. The designation “a Christian gentleman” should be a desired title of every man—young or old—who bears the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p22" pid="HDvaIOXqpkCNGiJYl9sXkA" hash="wFF2QQ">Niceness and kindness represent one level of Christlike service, but there are other levels. Sometimes we are asked to give more than we feel we are capable of giving or more than we really want to give. We may feel burdened with expectations and responsibilities. It is then we learn that following Christ also requires sacrifice, commitment, and courage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p23" pid="XGBoDlgB2EmnQINmQbsp0g" hash="Rhe3oA">The father of a young family who was asked to serve as a mission president gathered his children around him. He explained to them that the prophet had emphasized that the call was a call to the entire family. He asked each of the children if they would be willing to leave their new home, their friends, their school and go three years to an unknown place in the mission field. In that tender moment, each child agreed to willingly support this call to serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p24" pid="1GP0Ijg_E0e_3-NN0q7xSQ" hash="TSX8Tg">Several days later, the father, sensing that his fourteen-year-old son was unusually solemn and quiet, sat down with him to ask what was on his mind. The boy confided that he was worried about having to quit school at such a young age to serve as a full-time missionary. He didn’t know if he was ready to wear a suit and tie every day. He said, “I kinda wanted to be a boy a little longer.” Of course, the son had misunderstood. These duties were not expected of a young man his age. Yet he had been willing to do them if that was what the Lord required.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p25" pid="DifUDcy4qkyePa3oGvwEiw" hash="KCJZLA">Knowing what the Lord requires of us and also having the desire to follow Him doesn’t always assure that it will be easy. I believe it would help to ask the questions my best friend always asks when faced with a difficult decision or challenge: “What would the Lord have me do? Would I do it for the Lord?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p26" pid="3ME9oNaJRUygW5ydbn4-9w" hash="8C05DA">A young woman I know felt saddened and frustrated because a friend had made unkind, untrue remarks about her. It distressed her that those who heard the false accusations would believe them. She wanted others to know the truth, and she wanted her friend to realize how much hurt her words had caused. The young woman thought of ways to confront her friend in an effort to have the truth known. The situation weighed heavily upon her until finally she thought, “What would Jesus do?” She decided that Jesus would show love toward her friend. And that is just what this young woman did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p27" pid="qKREGwAUw0iwFwyuOLIlsg" hash="KOqB0Q">Once she let the teachings of Jesus influence her decision and guide her actions, that which bothered her seemed not to matter. She didn’t have to worry about it anymore. She said that she felt a big burden was lifted from her. What had been hard to endure became easier to resolve when a Christian attitude of forgiveness was taken.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p28" pid="Ywm7sKdHPUKTykAmpWD5Kg" hash="Qoj_Bw">When we place Jesus first in our lives, He will guide our decisions and give us the strength to avoid temptations. One day I received a phone call from my grandson Joel, who will soon be a deacon. He was having a difficult time making a decision. He had been invited to go with a group of students from his school to Sea Camp in San Diego, California. It sounded very exciting to a young boy! There would be behind-the-scene experiences at Sea World—watching the trainers and helping to feed the sea animals. His dilemma was that the camp would be on a weekend, with scuba diving and beach exploring on Sunday.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p29" pid="rOZeMb6rPEeLgDMmpoiwKg" hash="olLBuA">His parents had discouraged him in going but had allowed him to make his own choice, believing he would choose what was right. He had assured them that although he couldn’t attend church on Sunday, he would not swim. He said, “I can sit on the beach and be surrounded by God’s creations. Heavenly Father couldn’t feel bad about that, could He?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p30" pid="gNIM6GFxzkqoxvxT9ovQ7A" hash="4EuGgQ">Joel wanted to know what Grandpa Rex thought he should do. I answered with the question, “Joel, what do you think Jesus would want you to do?” His voice was a little choked up as he answered, “Grandpa, I don’t think He would be very happy with me if I do that on Sunday. Do you?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/follow-christ-in-word-and-deed.p31" pid="CkWkbr6x-kuJjB5JMmeE3g" hash="6m8x8w">It hadn’t been an easy decision to make, but it was the right one. We all have many difficult choices to make each day. There are many enticements that, if followed, will lead us away from Christ. The movies and videos we choose to watch, the entertainment we seek, the music we listen to, the styles we wear, and the language we speak are all influenced by the strength of our desire to follow Christ. In making these decisions, we may feel it is too hard to be left out or to miss out on what the world thinks is okay. Yes, “it is difficult to be a Christian and follow Christ in word and deed.” When we do follow Him, however, we will feel the peace and assurance that come from making right choices. He will provide the courage necessary for those times when we have to stand alone.</p>

It is the account of one who stood alone and of the force for good he became. With his armor girded about him, his head plate, breastplate and his shields fastened upon him, his banner of liberty raised on a pole above him, he “bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of Christians remain to possess the land—</p>

That we will find “the Spirit of the Lord … has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>.) This will enable us to rank ourselves as true followers of Jesus—as true Christians. Such actions will provide us and those we serve with spiritual strength to endure. That we may do this, and find the happiness and peace that lightens burdens and makes following Him easier, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Today I add my testimony of the blessing of peace that comes through the miraculous power of prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/peace-through-prayer.p3" pid="HYZPvBg1qUqUKu8n-Kf80w" hash="V4zDZg">Alexandre Dumas, in his classic tale <span class="emphasis">The Count of Monte Cristo,</span> wrote, “For the happy man prayer is only a jumble of words, until the day when sorrow comes to explain to him the sublime language by means of which he speaks to God.” (Trans.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/peace-through-prayer.p4" pid="jJwQMNXeLE-44OyrwUsOCw" hash="gTKUmg">It was a happy, carefree time in my young life until on such a day, sorrow and tragedy brought me closer to God in humble, sincere prayer. In the summer of my thirteenth year, on a July night, I eagerly joined some neighborhood friends to light fireworks. Five of us took turns igniting the colorful assortment of Roman candles and rockets and firecrackers. Each was a new surprise with its burst of sights and sounds through the evening sky.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/peace-through-prayer.p5" pid="_OCOy7a0HEqojDX-e3iYQw" hash="7kNh-g">Not all of our fireworks worked as they should have. Most, in fact, were what we called duds. They sputtered momentarily, and then died. We set the duds aside until we had tried to light all of the fireworks. We had so many defective ones remaining, we wondered what to do. We couldn’t just throw them away. What if we emptied the powder from all of them into the cardboard box? We could toss in a match and have one gigantic blast!</p>

The match was tossed; we quickly ran away and waited. Nothing happened. Pressing our luck, we tried a second time, using a makeshift fuse of rolled-up newspaper. Again we anxiously waited at a distance. Again, to our good, nothing happened. That is when we should have quit. Foolishly, we gave it one more try; this time my friend Mark and I huddled around the box to keep the flame from being extinguished by the evening breeze.</p>

The “gigantic blast” we thought we wanted exploded with fury into our faces. The force of the explosion knocked us off our feet, and flames from the ignited powder burned us severely. It was a tragic scene.

Consistency in prayer, along with searching the scriptures and following the counsel of living prophets, keeps us in tune with the Lord and enables us to interpret the promptings of the Spirit more easily.

As the days and years of suffering went on, she arrived at a time when she felt she could not handle another day. She had done all she could for him. Now a strength beyond her own was needed. In the depth of her sorrow, she pleaded more fervently to God for His help. With the morning came a blessed peace that filled her whole soul—a peace that has continued with her to this day.</p>

Hunter in 1967 when I reported to his office to be set apart for a new calling. We discussed my new assignment for a moment; then he surprised me by saying something like, “Brother Pinegar, we don’t need anyone to serve in that calling. Do you know what we need?” I sat there not knowing how to respond. I was wondering if I was mistaken about my call. In his pleasant way, he said if we were to stop the next one hundred members of the Church who passed in front of the Church Administration Building, almost all of them would be able and willing to serve in that same calling. “What we need,” he said, “is home teachers. That is the great need in the Church today.”</p>

I thought he might set me apart as a home teacher. In a kind, reassuring manner he gave me a blessing that I would be able to fulfill my calling. I promised myself that I would be a better home teacher.</p>

It will enable us to successfully combat the erosion of the family, which President Hunter has said is the greatest challenge in the world today. <span class="emphasis">Our first line of defense in a world of spiritual and moral decay is and will continue to be the family.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-simple-things.p21" pid="OmKYigflsUGu2p2unoX_LA" hash="jRYCjw">Christlike qualities instilled early in one’s life establish values that lead us to make correct choices and actions. It has been said, “Children are like wet cement; whatever falls on them makes an impression” (Haim G. Ginott).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-simple-things.p22" pid="qYdbOsPQWUSU36dm_urANw" hash="hUH6fg">As a teenage boy, I began working for a contractor pouring concrete foundations for homes. I learned that concrete was made of a mixture of very simple elements which of themselves were not stable enough for a foundation. But mixed together in proper sequence and proportions, tiny grains of sand, small pebbles, water, and cement powder form a unique substance of unusual strength and durability. For a few hours after the concrete is mixed, it can be poured into any desired form. At first, before it is completely hardened, even a tiny bird hopping across its soft surface will leave an imprint. Later, however, it becomes so firm an elephant could walk over it without leaving any tracks.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-simple-things.p23" pid="xAk8G-m1uUW4JResIJCdrw" hash="vXVXxA">Just as a few simple elements combined in a proper way form a sturdy foundation for a house, so do the simple teachings of the gospel bond together to make a strong foundation for our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-simple-things.p24" pid="Bunrj2zCeEeGCH4HHWRzkA" hash="AwMdDA">In contrast, we must be aware that there are small things that can destroy rather than build or strengthen us. Tiny grains of salt sprinkled on concrete can actually cause it to break up and crumble if they are not removed. Similarly, small steps taken in the wrong direction, ignored or uncorrected, will weaken and destroy our lives. Big problems grow out of thinking that little things don’t matter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-simple-things.p25" pid="BfrPsTNuiU21tQsVl4buNw" hash="e9HyPA">Like Naaman, we have been counseled by our prophets to do simple things which do matter. We have received simple instructions which we can all follow to strengthen our families, to heal our spiritual afflictions, and to become followers of Jesus Christ in thought and action. Parents have been counseled to set aside one night each week to teach fundamental gospel principles to their children.</p>

This practice unifies family members in a common direction and purpose. How simple the Lord has made it for us! All we have to do is sincerely ask in faith in his name, and He will hear and answer our prayers. Yet, if the prophet bid us do some great thing for such blessings, would we do it? Holding regular family prayer is such a simple thing to do to receive these great blessings.</p>

Because of their iniquity, the Lord “sent fiery flying serpents among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be healed; and the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.41" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:41</a>).</p>
