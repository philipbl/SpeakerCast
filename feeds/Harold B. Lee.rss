I would have you remember a remark of Brother Marvin J. Ashton in his very excellent address today when he said no home is a failure until it gives up on that son, or that daughter, or that husband, or that wife. It must not give up, no matter how difficult the task to save one of ours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/todays-young-people.p2" guid="63fe04b9-2b59-4800-b489-4f2950b38c43" pid="eNlhjpKAvEi06uDEziLy9A" hash="MzYzoA">Horace Mann, that great educator somewhere back in the time of Abraham Lincoln, told how he was the speaker at the dedication of a great boys’ school, and in his talk he said, “This school has cost hundreds of thousands of dollars; but if this school is able to save one boy, it is worth all that it cost.” One of his friends came up to him at the close of the meeting and said, “You let your enthusiasm get away with you, didn’t you? You don’t mean what you said that if this school, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, were to save just one boy, it was worth all that it cost? You surely don’t mean that.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/todays-young-people.p3" guid="66567e9b-689e-4b7f-a22d-ddf28a8275e4" pid="eLhKA8dCEEWkvkoVCrfvFg" hash="77UQgA">Horace Mann looked at him and said, “Yes, my friend. It would be worth it if that one boy were my son; it would be worth it.”</p>

It would be worth it if it were one of yours.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/todays-young-people.p6" guid="ad460aba-85c4-4f2c-8266-5fb325283e28" pid="l-_SrkxjY0CgSAodhXQoFQ" hash="F9Yatg">I came across a statement from the late President [Dwight D.] Eisenhower in the <span class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest </span>some years ago. He said, “Unfortunately many people nowadays have become so bemused by the excesses of a small minority of American youth, that they forget to note the decency and intelligence of the overwhelming majority. This is a great injustice to you young folks and a disservice to America.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/todays-young-people.p7" guid="0ef4d29b-35ac-4816-85fe-569c1e9e012b" pid="4wEBKC9VNE2067EuIdNK2g" hash="KBJ-kQ">“Judge Lester H. Loble of Montana, who has done so much to check juvenile delinquency in his state, has said that 97 percent of our youngsters today are as good as those of any generation, but the three percent who are hoodlums are worse. I might go one step beyond and suggest that in a good many ways, today’s young people are <span class="emphasis">better </span>than my own generation. Certainly, you are better educated, better informed about the world, have a far broader outlook on life than we did at your age. Moreover, most of you I talk with—and I do talk with hundreds every year in student and political gatherings and elsewhere—have fine motives and a sound moral attitude.” (“Thoughts for Young Americans,” <span class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest, </span>April 1966, pp. 88–92.)</p>

He said, “If the youth of today were not twice as good as were the youth of two generations ago, they wouldn’t be half as good as they are.” If you analyze that, I think you can understand why he would make that remark.</p>

But wo unto such, for their reward lurketh beneath, and not from above.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.26-29,32-33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:26–29, 32–33</a>.)</p>

Our job and your job, my job, is to look after the man behind the one in front of you. That is a little difficult for some people to figure out. And when you find out that one, and put him in line, then you are prepared to go out and search for the other ones. I pray that the Lord may help you to find out that one and put him in line, then you are prepared to go others round about you, and we will be on our way to a glorious future.</p>

I quote from this article by Rabbi Arthur Herlzterg:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p3" guid="ae77294d-5e32-45c5-a9e7-1569a2670f88" pid="ugYI40wZ1k-dw2pRdF6DfQ" hash="i4LrSA">“What people come to religion for, is an ultimate metaphysical hunger, and when that hunger is not satisfied, religion declines … the moment that clerics become more worldly, the world goes to hades the faster.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p4" guid="cd1a2747-a9a8-4c19-a2a9-ef0ec86fcb35" pid="u8T0kcIcfEa-uBU1ArtgxQ" hash="5wMVUQ">“… Religion represents the accumulation of man’s insight over thousands of years into such questions as the nature of man, the meaning of life, the individual’s place in the universe. That is, precisely, the question at the root of man’s restlessness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p5" guid="ed58eca5-987e-4e66-984f-48876f445e50" pid="wuTpijNk5EezcReI6CIRBg" hash="KDcdaA">“Man seeks something to end his state of confusion and emptiness … in the latest parlance, an antidote for aimlessness. We do not know if the truths of religious tradition can be interpreted to satisfy this need, but we are sure that here, not in political activism, is religion’s path to relevance.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p6" guid="aea8addd-0edb-4570-91c9-7c41a62ec8e7" pid="r2-aYuHAmESZRdTam64-6Q" hash="FqVARw">As an answer to those who may be wandering aimlessly, searching for something to satisfy their need and to end their state of confusion and emptiness, I would like to introduce a few thoughts by relating a remarkable vision which came to an ancient prophet by the name of Lehi—600 years before Christ. To the faithful members of the Church this will be an oft-related incident recorded in the Book of Mormon. To those not of our faith this may, if they will ponder seriously, be very significant in the light of many trends in our modern society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p7" guid="69379bd9-ab0a-44a4-aeef-0a10226e34c8" pid="es3OMgW-wUusAwvAJQ5S0w" hash="X8rWQw">In this dream, or better called a vision, the prophet Lehi was led by a heavenly messenger through a dark and dreary waste to a tree laden with delicious fruit which proved to be very satisfying to his soul. He beheld a river of water nearby along which was a straight and narrow path leading to the tree laden with delicious fruit. Between the river bank and the path was a rod of iron, presumably to safeguard the travelers from falling off the narrow path into the river.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p8" guid="8c148e4a-6b5f-4733-9e15-d4dc11662675" pid="qNBcAkC4gU-nvjDhZDnAlA" hash="NqhABA">As he looked, he saw large groups of people crowding forward to gain access to the spacious field where the tree with fruit was located. As they pressed forward along the path, a great mist of darkness arose, so dense that many who started lost their way and wandered off and were drowned in the murky water or were lost from view as they wandered into strange paths. There were others, however, likewise in danger of being lost because of the blinding mist, who caught hold of the iron rod and, by so doing, held their course so that they too could partake of the delicacies which had beckoned them to come, despite the hazardous journey. Across, on the opposite side of the river, were multitudes of people pointing fingers of scorn at those who made the journey safely.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p9" guid="01c0be22-6004-4f47-8d50-8c39e9b25647" pid="Gi1RzFPW9EO5EVOdhNUmwQ" hash="sh5rsg">As with many other ancient prophets in biblical history, dreams or visions of this nature were effective means by which the Lord communicated with his people through prophet-leaders. Just so, this dream had great significance, as the Lord revealed to the prophet Lehi. The tree laden with fruit was a representation of the love of God which he sheds forth among all the children of men. The Master himself, later in his earthly ministry, explained to Nicodemus how that great love was manifested. Said he: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life”; and then the Master added: “For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16-17" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p10" guid="4c56301f-ba25-47f2-8105-91daa1947c89" pid="DPOi5U83J0eOyWHoWjT7bA" hash="DGGCvA">The rod of iron as seen in the vision interpreted was the word of God, or the gospel of Jesus Christ, which led to the tree of life that the Master explained to the woman at the well in Samaria was as “a well of [living] water springing up into everlasting life.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/4.14" class="scriptureRef">John 4:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p11" guid="a0f2a15e-7e4b-4552-85e5-707a85d0c7ed" pid="RyGpVGsKNEihRvJstV0GNw" hash="xmNtaA">Those, as seen in the vision, who were across the river pointing fingers of scorn represented the multitudes of the earth which are gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb of God. The scorners, so the Lord revealed, represented the so-called wisdom of the world, and the building itself in which they were gathered was the “pride of the world.” (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.title" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11–12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p12" guid="89f19d77-5a29-43b1-a855-565192fcbe37" pid="Auu6-CaW4kGAhLuaQbUhTw" hash="gCzVkw">If there is any one thing most needed in this time of tumult and frustration, when men and women and youth and young adults are desperately seeking for answers to the problems which afflict mankind, it is an “iron rod” as a safe guide along the straight path on the way to eternal life, amidst the strange and devious roadways that would eventually lead to destruction and to the ruin of all that is “virtuous, lovely, or of good report.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p13" guid="0b6ec26d-6f28-4041-ae3d-bce0a52fa2fe" pid="VIPBb3xlMUCUstvMwDPxYA" hash="nqIA7A">These conditions as they would be found in the earth when these scriptures, now called the Book of Mormon, were to be brought forth were foreseen by the prophets. As I read some of these predictions, I would have you think of conditions with which we are surrounded today:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-iron-rod.p14" guid="de1ceb1d-a35e-4390-8eb9-145458c70970" pid="cJNsH8QmqkqRfxb4NMoI-g" hash="M68eSA">“And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts; unto … envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities … because of the pride of your hearts.</p>

After we had explained our worldwide activities in missions now being expanded into such newer areas as the Fiji Islands, Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand, Spain, Italy, and heretofore remote areas of Latin America, and among the Indian tribes, she asked, as she contemplated the magnitude of the worldwide missionary activities: “Are you people out to convert the whole world?”</p>

It would seem that the early revelations of the Lord to the Church pointed us to a preparation for this day, when he promised:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/watch-that-ye-may-be-ready.p15" guid="df607e36-eb35-41ea-802c-8b6e74d1f5b6" pid="fqMqcxRsmE-ncw3ptocG4A" hash="TY31XA">Never, it seems, has there ever been more unmistakable evidence of a need for spiritual guidance, as we met throughout our visits in these countries those who are seeking for answers to problems that confront them on every side. We have sensed that everywhere there is much dissatisfaction with the churches to which they have belonged. The real reason for this decline seems to stem from the fact, as one columnist has summarized it, “organized religion isn’t being attacked. It’s busily committing suicide trying to keep up with [the] Jane Fonda and Timothy Leary” type of relevance which would “tune out that corny old Bible, split out of that moldy church and turn on with relevance!” (Dr. Max Rafferty, “Church Should Examine Own Action in Decline of Religion,” <span class="emphasis">Salt Lake Tribune, </span>September 19, 1971, p. A-13.)</p>

There is a need for their churches to have concern about the personal welfare of the individual, so that each one could be aided to help himself through a unified church effort and a brotherhood in the Church that concerns itself with temporal and social, as well as spiritual, needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/watch-that-ye-may-be-ready.p18" guid="7648182d-4bd3-49bb-b875-d8d1d75afac8" pid="s_J0qbFnX0Sct5BDtYq4SA" hash="8Kqm3w">They are looking for a church where there is not only unity to be found within their local congregations, but which reaches out to a unification of effort in meeting the challenging problems confronting mankind; where a church congregation in one nation links hands with those of a common faith that spans the continents and the oceans and proclaims a universal brotherhood to which they may look with confidence in matters of health and education, strengthening of home ties, and in evolving and promoting constructive church activities where youth are taught correct principles so that they can learn to become effective leaders themselves; where wholesome activities are in such abundance that there is less time to engage in the evils that beckon on every side.</p>

They were seemingly rich in things that money could buy, but they were devoid of most of the precious things money could not buy.</p>

This question, of course, has prompted an explanation of the family home evening programs in the homes from which most of our youth have come.

Here we had assembled an all-British congregation of over twelve thousand members. The intensity of the interest there manifest bore eloquent witness to the growing awareness that the kingdom of God, meaning The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is worldwide, and that the people of Great Britain have a firm resolution to establish the Church more firmly in their native land. This was dramatically demonstrated when they concluded the three-day conference with an original song composed by one of their local leaders, entitled “This Is Our Place.” This song of theirs concluded with this impressive declaration:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/watch-that-ye-may-be-ready.p36" guid="936c6955-6651-43cb-a10a-3b6ff001be83" pid="Se_8siM7wk-sBtWuel4xnQ" hash="KmGTdw">As we visit the various countries, whether in the Far East, in the European areas, in the Latin American nations, or in other parts of the world, we have noted, as in the British Isles, the unmistakable signs of a strong desire on the part of our Church members to see the Church grow in their own countries. They are looking for a day when their membership and a developed leadership will be able to assume positions of responsibility to preside over districts and missions and temples, if and when their strength will be so manifest that they can govern themselves after they have been taught correct principles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/watch-that-ye-may-be-ready.p37" guid="5497a726-44b0-4c89-a1c3-69dca66849c3" pid="apTAa1vt3US97ztm-atJ7A" hash="OTu4kg">It is a standing marvel to see how susceptible these leaders are to training in the Church, when they have been taught by someone to show the way. As Church members catch the spirit of the work, they have an intense desire to go to a holy temple where they can receive the promised blessings of the priesthood, which, through their faithfulness, will gain them heaven’s highest privileges in the world to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/watch-that-ye-may-be-ready.p38" guid="e16638f5-e17f-40cf-a56e-2e5840389fe4" pid="BzPBcXzOi0ygt_vdHcWhhg" hash="guygFw">Everywhere we have gone, and here at home, men are asking as to our efforts in behalf of the so-called underprivileged peoples. This has given us the opportunity to explain how, from the finding of new converts, there proceeds, step by step, the introduction of the family home evening program, where parents are helped with family problems, small units of organization, of Sunday Schools, branches and districts, culminating into stakes for a purpose, as the Lord revealed, to provide “for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it is poured out without mixture upon the whole earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 115:6</a>.)</p>

He gave them certain signs that would foretell that this second coming was near, even at their very doors. He spoke of great tribulations, of wars, famines, and earthquakes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/watch-that-ye-may-be-ready.p40" guid="eebd3a59-0047-42cf-adea-068643a2de33" pid="ag977VbFi0O1q5Gwmi7o7A" hash="b8kAKA">One of the most significant among the other signs of which the Master spoke, and about which I had often wondered, was that prior to his coming there would be false Christs and false prophets who would show great signs and wonders in order to deceive the faithful who are looking forward to that glorious day when the Master will return again to the earth. We are actually seeing this present among us today, where individuals are coming forward with claims of Deity for their leaders. These arch-deceivers are among us, and some have come in person claiming to be God; and we may well expect others to rise up to do likewise in fulfillment of the Master’s declaration that false Christs and false prophets would come forth.</p>

We had four missionaries laboring there, two in each city. When the earthquake came, they were at the Lord’s business; two of our elders were teaching a gospel lesson on the outskirts of the town and the other two were in a preparation meeting in another city.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/responsibilities-of-the-priesthood.p2" guid="07a44ad5-7090-4e66-b551-ba89d932619a" pid="6ztSFWxKGUS-312IavizaA" hash="dG-dKw">I may take figures from one chart to impress the importance of what we are talking about. On one chart we have 353,000 holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood in the Church, most of whom are fathers, and only 187,000 are active, using attendance at one sacrament meeting and one priesthood meeting each month as helpful criteria. Or, in other words, they were considered active if they did that much. Of the 184,000 men over 21 who hold the Aaronic Priesthood, most of whom are fathers too, only 17,000 are active, mind you. There are also 48,000 adult male members who are unordained, and 117,480 nonmember husbands, most of whom are fathers also. Thus, of approximately 700,000 adult males, many of whom are fathers, almost 500,000 of the total are by these criteria inactive, if we include unordained males and nonmember husbands in describing this scope of our challenge.</p>

One of the mission presidents, with a group of his missionaries back in the Eastern States some years ago, was meeting in a hall with pillars that ran down the center of the hall, and he said to one of the missionaries, “Get up and push that pillar over.”</p>

As long as we have a weight of responsibility in this church, all hell can’t push us over; but as soon as that weight is lifted off, most of us are easy marks by the powers that drag us down.”</p>

You must remember that if we are to multiply the number of those who are so-called inactives, who haven’t been to the temple, by the average-size family, you are counting up to hundreds of thousands of members of this church who, unless we do something about it, will not be sealed together in the temple and will not, therefore, belong together in family relationships in the hereafter.</p>

We want the bishops, in turn, to submit these names to their stake presidents in the same manner, so that there is a continuing effort and evaluation over a period of time in which we focus on individuals rather than numbers, in which we test our love and creativity in terms of how we can best reach and assist fellow members in giving them the opportunity of serving others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/responsibilities-of-the-priesthood.p13" guid="a6a68e40-80f5-461d-9bdc-e0ddd1dcb70e" pid="pGH35RdzzkefbZhMLrfB5Q" hash="g7oi0g">We have had these brethren speak as they have tonight, directing your attention to this vital subject. All of them have touched upon various areas of concern. We have in the Church many men in various professions who have been asking, “Why can’t we, instead of being called to go out on a proselyting mission, go on a mission where we can use our talents, our professional skills, in helping the work of the Lord?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/responsibilities-of-the-priesthood.p14" guid="89745b77-bf5a-4bc1-9f89-7d8cb3bb4cec" pid="uZl01W2BU0mvEQ2szK4l3Q" hash="SgMycg">This is a program that we will hear more of, and this is a call to doctors, nurses, agricultural people, and all those whom Dr. Mason has talked about that we are going to try to marshal and call as regular missionaries to go out at their own expense, as all proselyting missionaries do, to give help for a period of time in helping to lift the standards of our people wherever that help is needed. Now we can see in this a great uplift and a great surge of strength that will come from many of these persons who are asking for somebody to give them a chance to serve in the fields where they are able to serve; to reach out to all of these who are in some measure less active than they should be and give them something to do. Use your imagination, you leaders, and see that everyone is given some responsibility, with the feeling that the Church needs them for a specific service.</p>

Bennion when he went out to the Utah State Penitentiary. He was bolder than some of us have been when we have gone out there. He engaged them in conversation. “Boys, I would like to ask you, what happened in your lives that caused you to make the mistakes that brought you here as inmates in the Utah State Penitentiary?” After he broke the ice, as it were, they gave him one answer: “We are here in the state penitentiary because there came a time in our lives when we were made to feel that nobody cared what happened to us.”</p>

A father or a mother or a child, or one who is not active, who feels that nobody cares—that man or woman is in a dangerous state, and we want you to reach out to all of these and bring them now into a measure of some activity, as soon as you can marshal your forces so to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/responsibilities-of-the-priesthood.p17" guid="381111f4-f011-476d-93c3-a92599df1d6b" pid="_OzXjVapdESR1eK0-mlP_g" hash="7PKOQQ">I was down in a husbands-and-wives meeting in Provo years ago when a lovely sister bore her testimony as to the joy that had come into her home since her husband had become active in the Church. She told about going through the temple with her husband. She told how he had been inactive, how he had smoked and hadn’t been advanced in the priesthood, and how someone took hold of him and finally helped him to become worthy and ready to receive the priesthood; and the bishop had finally given him a recommend to go to the temple. After she had described that wonderful evening, she said, “Here, five little girls came in to be sealed to their father and mother. This man of God pronounced us a family for the eternities.” And as she finished this story and bore her testimony, she looked over the pulpit and down in front of her where her husband was seated. She seemed to forget for that moment that there was anybody there but just the two of them, and she said to him, “Daddy, I can’t tell you how happy the girls now are and how grateful we are for what you have done for us, because, you see, Daddy, except for you who holds the priesthood, neither the children nor I could be together as a family in the hereafter. Thank God for our daddy who holds the key and unlocks the door to an eternal family home.”</p>

May the Lord help us so to do now and to catch the vision and the message that President Tanner and these men who have spoken to you tonight have given you—a glimpse of what we can do if we will only exercise the priesthood, which is the power of God by which he works through men to the salvation of his children. That the Lord might help us so to do, to catch that vision, and to carry out the purposes of what we are trying to do in these years ahead, I pray humbly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

There are a number who are listening in tonight, and one particularly who will remember this very vividly—an incident that took place a number of years ago in Japan. I want you to pay particular attention to a part of this, to show how a mistake in your early life can blight the possibilities of your future opportunities for service in the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p2" guid="a6a08d13-fd48-464f-8bfa-4c2cefe3d129" pid="8h6XyBTVrkajT6ke34DUqw" hash="jWZ_vg">It was just after the war; things were tense. We were at one of the upper camps where the planes could take off, and within half an hour they could be over on the Russian side. We were holding a noon meeting with our servicemen. They called on a young man to speak first. He announced his text from the prayer of the Master when he prayed for his disciples: “I pray not that thou shouldest take them [my disciples] out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.15" class="scriptureRef">John 17:15</a>.) Then this lad delivered one of the finest talks on chastity that I have ever heard. He closed by saying, “Rather than lose my virtue, I would die and have my body sent home in a pine box and my dog tags follow after.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p3" guid="ac57e945-79a4-4844-ad94-140d4ff5dbcd" pid="M43fJYavwkmOLPpdm0tmqA" hash="-bWOyQ">There was a hush over that audience of servicemen, and then he bore his testimony; and as he started to leave the pulpit, he stumbled and fell, draped over the pulpit. We lifted him off the pulpit and worked with him until he was revived, and then took him down in the audience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p4" guid="c2e239a7-44df-4b96-970d-6156cefd1ff1" pid="DYDCutp6BUqNT_2lqmcr9A" hash="tyvbTA">As they carried him down, the mission president said to me, “I wonder if he has a bad heart.” And I said, “You know, I have had a feeling that there is something quarreling inside of him against what he has been saying to us.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p5" guid="b1a45d67-8e48-410e-a8ff-b16b215be4e5" pid="cvA__uwDQ0KC8cmfCzQDXw" hash="hARWIw">When it came my time to speak, I said to him, “Now, my boy, you have made a profound impression upon all of us. You have said you would rather die than lose your virtue. But remember, the devil heard you, as we heard you, and if I don’t miss my guess, he is going to make you prove that you would give your life before you would lose your virtue. You had better be on guard.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p6" guid="9542a513-67c2-401a-a829-282c340b53eb" pid="SzxTRAk8SkG0ix49WopUKw" hash="qKJzwQ">The group leader took me aside when the meeting was over, and he said, “You were hitting close to the mark, because up at the Chitose Airbase there has grown up one of the most filthy, rotten cities filled with prostitutes to try to entrap our men, and we have tried to keep them out of their clutches. But this boy had made a date with one of these hussies, as they called them, patriotic hussies; and we found out before he kept the date and said, ‘Now look, we are not going to let you keep that date. Think of your mother; think of your sweetheart; think of your sisters. Now we will go down with you and help you break that date honorably.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p7" guid="521cbd5d-1284-46e3-a35a-2c252599ddb8" pid="kwtDeIq5t0K9hh70vzA3iw" hash="R42sWg">This they did, and kept him under their surveillance for two weeks. They assigned him to do ward teaching, or home teaching, as they call it now; that meant, visit all the inactive boys in the camp. And two weeks later they assigned him to talk on the subject of chastity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p8" guid="cf2b4764-3e8d-4ce1-add7-1e6b3d4ea3e4" pid="DMMO-yO_xky6v-gMN9TsBw" hash="D1oQiw">So the years passed. We were with President McKay at the dedication of the Los Angeles Temple. Between sessions I walked out to get some fresh air. As I walked up the west side of the building, I saw on the upper elevation a young man who seemed familiar to me, and I got closer to this young man that I had seen in Hokkaido, Japan. As he recognized me, he came running down the steps and threw his arms around my neck, and said, “Guess what! They have called me to be a worker in the Los Angeles Temple.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p9" guid="c96c8b44-3c80-4104-86f5-5e1ca14e3ddf" pid="PRB_2Kw59kiW9ziF2XL6Ow" hash="tPI2yw">There was a lump in my throat because I was there at the crossroads when he almost made a fatal step that probably would have forfeited him the right to be a worker in the Los Angeles Temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p10" guid="1930f2d3-6cb4-472f-b351-8209008158de" pid="F6k57V-jpU6_5qx-F14ymA" hash="-XGiLw">More years passed, and then I was out at a conference where he lived; and I saw a young couple walking down the aisle, the man holding in his arms a beautiful child, and a beautiful girl holding on to his arm, whom he introduced as his wife. As they uncovered the face of their new baby, I thought there was pride in the face of that young man because he knew as a young father that in the blood of his own child there was clean, pure blood. That is the reward that comes to one who passes the test.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p11" guid="25b22bfa-3c27-4bb8-b020-6dcd755a7020" pid="Ev9luf8ljkiusza1HTPn8g" hash="5cSadQ">One of the things we must do in teaching our young people is to condition them on how to meet a temptation that comes in an unguarded moment. When we teach our young boys going out into military service, we bring in those who have had experience to talk about some actual experiences they have gone through and say, “Now if you were faced with this or that temptation, what would you do? How would you react?” And there is a discussion as to just how he would react. How important that is in this day of wickedness!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p12" guid="fc499a45-fb18-479a-afa5-3b16f08af7a8" pid="UW7_-wtzKUa3rAMNc1vG2Q" hash="tbLb6A">The one who has the chief responsibility is the father of the boy. This doesn’t mean that the father should wake up some morning and call his boy to his bedside and in fifteen minutes tell him all the facts of life. That isn’t what the boy needs. He needs a father to answer when he wants to ask questions of a delicate nature. He is hungering to know; he is curious about things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p13" guid="e0637d52-6505-4137-8eb4-20ff571804d5" pid="xUCdoqhtcE-mdBmGqABzJw" hash="oOZMYw">If his father will be frank and honest, and tell him up to the limit of his intelligence as he grows up, that father will be the one to whom the son will return for counsel in the years that follow. That father will be an anchor to that boy’s soul, as the father takes from his book of experience lessons that he can give to his son to help condition him against the possibility of falling into that fatal trap in an unguarded moment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p14" guid="3cca2ba9-b9ff-4cba-acc3-5c984c32e7e5" pid="IAzdHst5502XK9qedIDgog" hash="2I22Tw">I want to talk about another thing. As we study the various activities like family home evening and the activities pertaining to temple marriage, home teaching, and what not, we have discovered that we never make any headway by mere exhortation and trying to pressure people into holding home evenings or home teaching. We are discovering that the only way to get home teaching over, or to get family home evening going, or attendance at sacrament meeting, or to have more temple marriages or temple attendance, is to make sure that the holder of the priesthood in the home magnifies his priesthood; and until he can realize the importance of the priesthood of God, which gives him the power of Almighty God to act through him, that home is not going to be secure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p15" guid="7d337e86-cf5b-45bd-bfb7-c244ebb36043" pid="T7G1KahO_kmLtSky5OpaKA" hash="SaG79A">We must impress upon every father that he will be held responsible for the eternal welfare of his family: that means coming into the Church with his family; that means going to sacrament meeting with his family; that means holding family home evenings to keep his family intact; it means preparing himself to take them to the temple, so that there can be prepared thereby the steps that will make for an eternal family home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p16" guid="f096e82e-7b14-4bb3-a942-27ec001c8345" pid="-J8QyVd1fEWg52cLpQYPVg" hash="ZYuMXg">It is a high responsibility to impress upon priesthood holders how they magnify their priesthood by living and doing as the Lord has commanded.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p17" guid="87825c62-78d4-4d2d-bc20-fed9eb4d7679" pid="K1Qkaab_iEq0M4rFUsYJYg" hash="Sr13cw">We talk about Suicides Anonymous. I am convinced that there are many in the Church who are committing spiritual suicide, and they are calling for help, just like those who are going to commit suicide physically. They tell us that there is a cry of distress that if recognized in time could save a life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p18" guid="1b865ffa-4536-4c10-b351-0f4dc35e2713" pid="W1L732GJVkeNWH7CTRfOVw" hash="G2eY3A">There are many among us today who are giving the signal, the cry of distress, because they are in danger of spiritual suicide. And if we can only recognize the cry of distress in time, we will be the means of saving souls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p19" guid="609cb6e1-0367-4370-9e04-5c6b524fe368" pid="RpfeRvupJ0iNaKD5FsafSg" hash="awh9Gg">One thing more I should like to state. We are having come into the Church now many people of various nationalities. We in the Church must remember that we have a history of persecution, discrimination against our civil rights, and our constitutional privileges being withheld from us. These who are members of the Church, regardless of their color, their national origin, are members of the church and kingdom of God. Some of them have told us that they are being shunned. There are snide remarks. We are withdrawing ourselves from them in some cases.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p20" guid="10f4ff0a-c52a-4949-89fc-8337850bdb63" pid="dxJmR1zaUkuXnYHR0L7hxw" hash="vYiZpQ">Now we must extend the hand of fellowship to men everywhere, and to all who are truly converted and who wish to join the Church and partake of the many rewarding opportunities to be found therein. To those who may not now have the priesthood, we pray that the blessings of Jesus Christ may be given to them to the full extent that it is possible for us to give them. Meanwhile, we ask the Church members to strive to emulate the example of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, who gave us the new commandment that we should love one another. I wish we could remember that.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p21" guid="2eaa2b18-6131-4df2-8785-910bb6ec4d12" pid="4I6B2O7MP0-62exmr8VToA" hash="2t57SA">Now finally, just one more thought. President Smith’s talk tonight has impressed something else. I heard someone say something that I have learned is an absolute fact. When I sat in as a younger member of the Council of the Twelve, the first Church reorganization I was permitted to participate in was when President Grant passed away. As we met in the temple for a long discussion, as is the usual custom before the votes are taken and the decisions reached as to the selecting of the president of the Church, I was thinking there had been some rumors as to who might be the counselors and who might not be the counselors, as is always the gossip that attends such reorganizations. But as the president named his counselors and they took their places at the head of the room, down inside me I had a witness that these were the men that the Lord wanted to be the presidency of the Church. It came to me with a conviction that was as though that truth was being trumpeted in my ears.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p22" guid="72ecd163-65c1-4bd1-8de0-f0e4c0143375" pid="QOdXApW9oUaI2nC15-qPcQ" hash="Wvz-SQ">Now I want to impress this upon you. Someone has said it this way, and I believe it to be absolutely true: “That person is not truly converted until he sees the power of God resting upon the leaders of this church, and until it goes down into his heart like fire.” Until the members of this church have that conviction that they are being led in the right way, and they have a conviction that these men of God are men who are inspired and have been properly appointed by the hand of God, they are not truly converted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/the-strength-of-the-priesthood.p23" guid="e7da88a2-90cd-4122-a574-476d32d759c0" pid="maWqZJZfaUqY0cozHXBi-Q" hash="37KFOA">So I bear you my witness that I know with all my soul, as I knew on that occasion, that those whom the Lord chooses are the ones he needs for a particular time. I heard Elder Orson F. Whitney, a member of the Twelve, say from this pulpit that he didn’t believe that these men are necessarily the best living men in the Church, but that there may be many others who live just as righteous lives, or maybe more so, but one thing he did know: that when there is a vacancy and the Lord has need for a person, he looks around and finds the person who is best qualified to fill the position at a given time.</p>

I bear that humble witness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Some have even said that this is the most critical period in the history of this nation and of the world.</p>

Write it upon the hearts of all of us that every dispensation has been just as decisive, and likewise that every year has been the most decisive year and time for ourselves, for this nation, and for the world. This is our day and time when honorable men must be brought forward to meet the tremendous challenges before us.</p>

There will be controversy, debate, conflict, and contention, which seem to be the order of a political campaign.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-time-of-decision.p4" guid="8639257b-6d38-42d6-a850-955305092494" pid="Qvz1JYMqZk-uADSi30KwpA" hash="3o5qww">In its loftiest sense, controversy may mean disputations because of honest differences of opinion. In its most degrading sense it may mean quarreling, strife, and name-calling. An example of that which degrades is the bitter personal abuse that so frequently is heaped upon an opposing candidate. Name-calling is continued throughout the whole season until listeners are left with doubt and mistrust that honor and integrity are to be found in any of those who may eventually be elected. The obvious hazard is that when these elected leaders have been maligned and down-graded, the seeds of disrespect to authority and law and order are sown in the minds of youth, particularly, instead of respectful obedience to counsel and to the laws enacted by those whose integrity and honesty have been thus impugned.</p>

Intense bitterness ensued between that son, who became Satan, and those who followed after him, and the beloved Son of God and those who followed after him, whose plan of salvation, by contrast, would give to every soul the right of choice, and the glory be to the Father. He even offered himself as “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/13.8" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 13:8</a>), that by the redemption of his atoning sacrifice, “all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.3" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:3</a>).</p>

A moment’s reflection will help you to see that when one sets himself up to make his own rules and presumes to know no law but his own, he is but echoing the plan of Satan, who sought to ascend to God’s throne, as it were, in being the judge of all that rules mankind and the world. There has ever been, and ever will be, a conflict between the forces of truth and error; between the forces of righteousness and the forces of evil; between the dominion of Satan and the dominion under the banner of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ.</p>

My friend made an attractive proposal to this young man. In a conversation that went something like this, he said, “Son, I’m going to take over full responsibility of your affairs from now on and relieve you of your worries. I’ll pay your tuition at college, buy your clothes, furnish you an automobile and a credit card for gasoline. When you get ready to marry, don’t worry about it; I’ll look for a wife for you, and I will supply you with a house that is furnished. I’ll support you and your family thereafter without any effort on your part. What do you think of my offer?”</p>

In his declaration to the Corinthians he has given us his counsel if we would be as powerful as he in our ministry. This was his secret in combating evil:</p>

Always we would do well to reflect upon the counsel of a wise king of ancient times: “Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore . . . do your business by the voice of the people.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29.26" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 29:26</a>.)</p>

Here we have given us the never-failing principles that will keep our feet firmly planted on the path of safety. By these eternal principles we can readily detect truth from error. In the earliest revelations of our dispensation we were told that the gospel teachings were given that “inasmuch as they have erred it might be made known; And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.25-26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:25–26</a>.)</p>

Who knows but that even our Lord and Master would be near us on such an occasion as this, for we, and the world, must never forget that this is his church, and under his almighty direction we are to serve! Indeed, I would remind you what he declared in a similar conference of Saints in Fayette, New York, and undoubtedly would remind us again today. The Lord said: “Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you that mine eyes are upon you. I am in your midst and ye cannot see me.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:7</a>.)</p>

There, in prayerful meditation, I looked upon the paintings of those men of God—true, pure men, God’s noblemen—who had preceded me in a similar calling.</p>

Smith. As I looked upon his noble stature. I thought of the nine-year-old boy helping his widowed mother across the plains and the 15-year-old missionary on the slopes of Haleakala on the isle of Maui being strengthened by a heavenly vision with his uncle, Joseph Smith. It was he who presided during the stormy days when an antagonistic press maligned the Church, but his was the steady arm by the Lord’s appointment to carry off the Church triumphantly.</p>

Grant placed his hands upon my shoulders and, with a deep feeling akin to mine, announced my calling to be an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. As his picture looked down upon me, there came again to my mind the prophetic words of his inspired blessing when I was ordained in the holy temple trader his hands.</p>

McKay, as he now looked at me with those piercing eyes, which always seemed to search my very soul. Never was I privileged to be in his presence but that I felt for a brief moment, as I had done on so many occasions, that I was a better man for having been in his company.</p>

As “the finger of God touched him and he slept,” he seemed in that brief moment to be passing to me, as it were, a sceptre of righteousness as though to say to me, “Go thou and do likewise.”</p>

This provoked some soul-searching in me also.</p>

It has never been so, but from the beginning some one that understands the Spirit and counsel of the Almighty, that knows the Church, and is known of her, is the character that will lead the Church.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> vol. 1, p. 123.)</p>

Then I recalled the words of the Prophet Joseph’s characterization of himself, which seemed somewhat analogous to myself. He said:</p>

At times it seemed as though I too was like a rough stone rolling down from a high mountainside, being buffeted and polished. I suppose, by experiences, that I too might overcome and become a polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.</p>

Eldon Tanner and President Marion G. Romney, I learned that I was not alone with a rich measure of the gift of prophecy. They too had passed the tests, and before the Lord they had not been found wanting. How grateful I am for these noble men of the First Presidency and the Twelve and the other General Authorities.</p>

I know full well the truth of what the Prophet Joseph told the early missionaries to Great Britain: “The nearer a person approaches the Lord, a greater power will be manifested by the adversary to prevent the accomplishment of His purposes.” (Orson F.

After the announcement of the establishment of the church of Christ in these latter days, the Lord gave to the President of the Church commandments and “gave him power from on high,” first, to bring forth “a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.8-9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:8–9</a>); then, to be a light to the world and a standard for Church members and for those who are not members to seek for it (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:9</a>); third, to prepare a people ready to receive the coming of the Lord; and finally, to teach the fullness of the gospel with power unto all nations (see <span class="emphasis">Documentary History of the Church, </span>vol. 4, p. 537).</p>

Reuben Clark, Jr., as but “a clumsy attempt of Satan to counterfeit the Lord’s plan of the United Order, as defined in the Holy Scriptures.” Our present welfare plan could well be the “setting-up” exercises to see how prepared this church is to live this plan, so that, as was the joyous realization of a people on this continent, as recorded in an ancient scripture we call the Book of Mormon, after they were all converted to the Lord, “there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all … partakers of the heavenly gift” and “surely there could not be a happier people” on the face of the earth (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.3,16" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:3, 16</a>), by living fully the law of sacrifice and consecration.</p>

In doing so they have set brothers against brothers in the Church and thus weakened the unity of the greatest weapon the Lord has already provided against these evils, through the priesthood organizations of the Church and kingdom of God. Some such groups, by adopting counterfeit measures and procedures, have been led away and have apostatized and been excommunicated from the Church.</p>

So, if the Lord is willing, I should like to talk to you now for a few minutes in this great conference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p2" guid="e5be8e8a-c626-4357-91e8-da169b2016be" pid="1C3u4CkmZE-p1gMfDsoPNQ" hash="5X1kQA">I had a lesson years ago as to the greatness of priesthood. It had to do with the call of the First Presidency for me to come to their office on a day that I shall never forget—April 20, 1935. I was city commissioner in Salt Lake City. I was a stake president.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p3" guid="67218e18-3e61-4dfa-bc66-74204663a8ad" pid="iHig5Y5YtUi2nv2CdQdy6Q" hash="jzO3VA">We had been wrestling with this question of welfare. There were few government work programs; the finances of the Church were low; we were told that there wasn’t much that could be done so far as the finances of the Church were concerned. And here we were with 4,800 of our 7,300 people who were wholly or partially dependent. We had only one place to go, and that was to apply the Lord’s program as set forth in the revelations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p4" guid="6e731fb7-9259-4e25-8296-aebbcbc6ff13" pid="n9Dxa6DPmUqSY-FVZZ513A" hash="3ZK38w">It was from our humble efforts that the First Presidency, knowing that we had had some experience, called me one morning asking if I would come to their office. It was Saturday morning; there were no calls on their calendar, and for hours in that forenoon they talked with me and told me that they wanted me to resign from the city commission, and they would release me from being stake president; that they wished me now to head up the welfare movement to turn the tide from government relief, direct relief, and help to put the Church in a position where it could take care of its own needy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p5" guid="6d7a4d39-0064-47d9-bc97-9a12a2c5e709" pid="qAV2uz7mFUmO4OYhVdr99w" hash="nO3uUw">After that morning I rode in my car (spring was just breaking) up to the head of City Creek Canyon into what was then called Rotary Park; and there, all by myself, I offered one of the most humble prayers of my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p6" guid="cdefbb34-dcf4-49e6-b52c-2dd07c998364" pid="dwngWmbyOEuttBqe56OV6g" hash="zNNhog">There I was, just a young man in my thirties. My experience had been limited. I was born in a little country town in Idaho. I had hardly been outside the boundaries of the states of Utah and Idaho. And now to put me in a position where I was to reach out to the entire membership of the Church, worldwide, was one of the most staggering contemplations that I could imagine. How could I do it with my limited understanding?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p7" guid="34630337-4935-4cfd-92b8-b3b88c72acba" pid="NBeNc0YskE2YpVIQTBoVBQ" hash="ZZ5Vcw">As I kneeled down, my petition was, “What kind of an organization should be set up in order to accomplish what the Presidency has assigned?” And there came to me on that glorious morning one of the most heavenly realizations of the power of the priesthood of God. It was as though something were saying to me, “There is no new organization necessary to take care of the needs of this people. All that is necessary is to put the priesthood of God to work. There is nothing else that you need as a substitute.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p8" guid="058f2d94-b6fd-48cd-b0f1-6088977c64b0" pid="rOXDcw_9ckia2EL6MHr4_g" hash="LYJ-HA">With that understanding, then, and with the simple application of the power of the priesthood, the welfare program has gone forward now by leaps and bounds, overcoming obstacles that seemed impossible, until now it stands as a monument to the power of the priesthood, the like of which I could only glimpse in those days to which I have made reference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/admonitions-for-the-priesthood-of-god.p9" guid="184a30f2-f5d5-4dd1-9c8a-eff80eaee95c" pid="4DO63DyEqUGrRfyEEbllcw" hash="OOEQ7Q">Now, with that understanding of priesthood power, let me speak of a few other matters that have come to my mind tonight.</p>

The first is the spread of rumor and gossip (we have mentioned this before) which, when once started, gains momentum as each telling becomes more fanciful, until unwittingly those who wish to dwell on the sensational repeat them in firesides, in classes, in Relief Society gatherings and priesthood quorum classes without first verifying the source before becoming a party to causing speculation and discussions that steal time away from the things that would be profitable and beneficial and enlightening to their souls.</p>

Sometimes these have come to men and women who because of transgression became easy prey to the Arch-Deceiver. At other times people who pride themselves on their strict observance of the rules and ordinances and ceremonies of the Church are led astray by false spirits, who exercise an influence so imitative of that which proceeds from at Divine source that even these persons, who think they are ‘the very elect,’ find it difficult to discern the essential difference. Satan himself has transformed himself to be apparently ‘an angel of light.’</p>

Also, they should understand that directions for the guidance of the Church will come, by revelation, through the head. All faithful members are entitled to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit for themselves, their families, and for those over whom they are appointed and ordained to preside. But anything at discord with that which comes from God through the head of the Church is not to be received as authoritative or reliable. In secular as well as spiritual affairs, Saints may receive Divine guidance and revelation affecting themselves, but this does not convey authority to direct others, and is not to be accepted when contrary to Church covenants, doctrine or discipline, or to known facts, demonstrated truths, or good common sense. No person has the right to induce his fellow members of the Church to engage in speculations or take stock in ventures of any kind on the specious claim of Divine revelation or vision or dream, especially when it is in opposition to the voice of recognized authority, local or general. The Lord’s Church ‘is a house of order.’ It is not governed by individual gifts or manifestations, but by the order and power of the Holy Priesthood as sustained by the voice and vote of the Church in its appointed conferences.</p>

If you have called a man to a position in this church and he dies the next day, that position would have a bearing on what he will be called to do when he leaves this earth.”</p>

I believe that every President of this church, every apostle of this church, every bishop, every stake president, every presiding position will have a bearing on what one is called to do when he leaves this earth.</p>

That President maintains his own place. We shouldn’t try to compare one as being greater than this one or greater than the other, because each one is, in the eyes of the Lord, in his own time the one most needed for that particular time. You may be sure of that.</p>

I sat in a class in Sunday School in my own ward one day, and the teacher was the son of a patriarch. He said he used to take down the blessings of his father, and he noticed that his father gave what he called “iffy” blessings. He would give a blessing, but it was predicated on “if you will not do this” or “if you will cease doing that.” And he said, “I watched these men to whom my father gave the ‘iffy’ blessings, and I saw that many of them did not heed the warning that my father as a patriarch had given, and the blessings were never received because they did not comply.”</p>

I went back into the Doctrine and Covenants and began to read the “iffy” revelations that have been given to the various brethren in the Church. If you want to have an exercise in something that will startle you, read some of the warnings that were given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to Thomas B. Marsh, Martin Harris, some of the Whitmer brothers, William E. McLellin—warnings which, had they heeded, some would not have fallen by the wayside. But because they did not heed, and they didn’t clear up their lives, they fell by the wayside, and some had to be dropped from membership in the Church.</p>

I was with a group of missionaries in the temple one day. A question was asked by one of the sisters about the Word of Wisdom, concerning the promise made that if one would keep the Word of Wisdom he should run and not be weary and should walk and not faint. And she said, “How could that promise be realized if a person were crippled? How could he receive the blessing that he could run and not be weary, and walk and not faint, if he were crippled?”</p>

I want you to think about that. We shouldn’t be concerned about why he said something, or whether or not it can be made so. Just trust the Lord. We don’t try to find the answers or explanations. We shouldn’t try to spend time explaining what the Lord didn’t see fit to explain. We spend useless time.</p>

Hinckley told a story after going into Vietnam that to me was a great lesson.

You ask when the Lord gave the last revelation to this church. The Lord is giving revelations day by day, and you will witness and look back on this period and see some of the mighty revelations the Lord has given in your day and time. To that I bear you my witness, and leave with you my testimony this night, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Perhaps never have we turned a page of the history of the Church with greater challenge, with greater problems, or with greater promise for the future.</p>

I believe you have felt the unity in your First Presidency, these noble men, President Tanner and President Romney, and the feeling of oneness that has been expressed by the Twelve and all of these brethren of the General Authorities. There is a bond that is to be found among those called to these positions that is stronger than the ties of blood relationship, so deep, so wonderful, so strengthening, except for which we probably couldn’t walk the path that we are asked to walk at these times.</p>

As we came out of the Saturday night leadership meeting, there was a heavy snowstorm. As we drove to the home of the stake president, he stopped his car and turned back to the temple hill. There the lighted temple was standing majestically. We sat there in silence for a few moments, inspired by the sight of that beautiful, sacred place. He said, “You know, Brother Lee, that temple is never more beautiful than in times of a dense fog or in times of a heavy, severe storm.”</p>

Somehow I have had the feeling that during the expressions here, whenever my name has been mentioned, they were talking of somebody other than myself. And I really think that is so, because one cannot go through the experience that I have gone through these last three days and be the same as before. I am different than I was before Friday morning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/a-blessing-for-the-saints.p12" guid="459aff50-15a0-44b4-b26f-afb65844a7d9" pid="ty3szzoCfU-U6WTJF4W1ag" hash="uQ64Ig">I cannot go back to where I was because of the love and faith and confidence that you, the people of the Lord, have reposed in me. So you have been talking of somebody else. You have been talking of somebody that you want me to become, which I hopefully pray God I may, with his help, become.</p>

Millions have been listening. You know we are being judged by what emanates from this tabernacle. I held a meeting with some new missionaries recently. Their attention was called to something that I may have the temerity to mention to you today. The Lord said here in a great revelation, “Therefore, cease from all your light speeches, from all laughter, from all your lustful desires, from all your pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.121" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:121</a>.)</p>

It doesn’t mean that we should be long-faced, should not show our joy, but we ought to couch our expressions of joy not with the audible expression that swells up to a great crescendo that might be mistaken by those who are listening on the outside. I think it would be well for us to remember that, with a sense of our responsibility to the most high God. We should be an example of what the Lord in this revelation has counseled us to be when we are in his service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/a-blessing-for-the-saints.p15" guid="d1d32c99-0a4d-4569-a750-f0db404b1cb1" pid="9zOWjy8Wo0arY-9hEOeoHA" hash="RVqlUw">Some great compensations have come to me in these last few days. Never has my family, the intimate family of mine, been drawn more closely together. One by one these precious children, grandchildren of mine, and my own dear companion have drawn closer, and I have reason to believe that those beyond sight have been very near to us, their families and mine. There has been a unity and a pledge to me that they feel that this is their call. I have said to them, “My sermons will be no better than the lives of the members of my family.” I am pleading with them to set an example before the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/a-blessing-for-the-saints.p16" guid="d2598a51-8087-44d8-bc94-a775cff32a20" pid="co0JnOijG0msvyisM_ECBA" hash="Udkbuw">And so I come to you in these closing moments; and as one who is as a patriarch to the Church holding this position, I have a right to extend a blessing to you. I am not concerned about how much you remember in words of what has been said here. I am concerned about how it has made you feel. What are you going to take back with you when you go? What are you going to give to your families? What are you going to give to your members and to your wards and stakes and missions?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/a-blessing-for-the-saints.p17" guid="157c0ae6-5354-47a6-ba74-6f8852df6961" pid="2hHoe4xtFUmfHd7b-vvdpA" hash="0P_png">If you can catch the spirit of what has gone on here during this conference and can feel that great unity now, then take to them my love and blessing. Assure them that the presidency of the Church and the General Authorities really love the members of the Church everywhere, the lowly, the mighty, the educated, the uneducated, wherever they are. Will you please assure them of our love and our concern about them and their welfare.</p>

I can’t leave this conference without saying to you that I have a conviction that the Master hasn’t been absent from us on these occasions. This is his church. Where else would he rather be than right here at the headquarters of his church? He isn’t an absentee master; he is concerned about us. He wants us to follow where he leads. I know that he is a living reality, as is our Heavenly Father. I know it. I only hope that I can qualify for the high place to which he has called me and in which you have sustained me.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/a-blessing-for-the-saints.p20" guid="87c41124-28b1-4888-9fb9-87f98a0db0e0" pid="qbphbgfOhkewrLWHSlcQDQ" hash="Zd92jw">My love goes out to my own family, to my associates, to all within the sound of my voice, even the sinners; I would wish that we would reach out to them, and those who are inactive, and bring them into the fold before it is too late.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/a-blessing-for-the-saints.p21" guid="3cf46c02-b974-4e8d-883d-b08df1b05060" pid="INzg8J1pXk-OOa8fYqIvWQ" hash="nv7_yA">God be with you. I have the same feeling as perhaps the Master had when he bid goodbye to the Nephites. He said he perceived that they were weak, but if they would go to their homes and ponder what he said, he would come again and instruct them on other occasions. So likewise, you cannot absorb all that you have heard and that we have talked about, but go to your homes now and remember what you can and get the spirit of what has been done and said, and when you come again, or we come to you, we will try to help you further with your problems.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p2" guid="037e08ff-3ea1-4311-8d6c-da0bb9cc8611" pid="ohN_2O1f9EedlhWmfqmMjA" hash="HRkFNQ">This is the annual conference of the Church. April 6, 1973, is a particularly significant date because it commemorates not only the anniversary of the organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in this dispensation, but also the anniversary of the birth of the Savior, our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith wrote this, preceding a revelation given at that same date:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p3" guid="9b4c4334-3f90-45f1-8ffd-417c5563d415" pid="p-77Ve3s-EKfsgASC11aCw" hash="ZoAM0Q">“The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:1</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p4" guid="9596f2d1-2e3f-44e5-ac91-cd37cf4c7281" pid="bmo8Z0rj40OfoM5nFnnDXw" hash="_1nzAw">Traditionally since that time, the spring conferences of the Church are held on the days of each year which include April 6.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p5" guid="f18a36af-0cee-4eaf-aa66-0e589f9ef8c0" pid="keVIObgsMEmAU2bvvHu2Dg" hash="1W833Q">Two years later another revelation followed, which had great significance then, and today has even greater meaning as viewed in the light of the demands of the increasing membership in the Church. This is a quotation which may be something of a text for my next few remarks today:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p6" guid="6a537887-d210-42ce-ba39-3058914111a7" pid="fX_mSca-lUqM_fPZzCtRoA" hash="5oFrzw">“For Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p7" guid="17dfd71d-56d4-46b0-8e9d-9ddef8700742" pid="A1B4JIBHzkmxHwr1ImL-4A" hash="2ab4yg">Zion, as used here, undoubtedly had reference to the Church. At that time there was but a small body of Church members just beginning to emerge as an organization, after having experienced harsh treatment from enemies outside the Church, who had then been directed to gather together in Jackson County, Missouri, which the Lord had designated as the “land of Zion.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p8" guid="05766ecb-b53e-46e5-b1ce-70fa33328a28" pid="z2f96VpB8EihmZBjKeHTlg" hash="QGhGYw">As though to impress upon these early struggling members their destiny in the world, the Lord in another revelation told them this:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p9" guid="58c6e88e-4288-4b46-a299-745f7ed8cff9" pid="hAr7FSQWlUy1e5QbdnEbkA" hash="bio8Og">“Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion—<small>THE PURE IN HEART</small>; therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked shall mourn.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 97:21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p10" guid="4289c054-9fa0-439f-b392-bd5cebf5d5d2" pid="mQSw_x5C9E6GNI8LWzTgQA" hash="H2infA">To be worthy of such a sacred designation as Zion, the Church must think of itself as a bride adorned for her husband, as John the Revelator recorded when he saw in vision the Holy City where the righteous dwelled, adorned as a bride for the Lamb of God as her husband. Here is portrayed the relationship the Lord desires in his people in order to be acceptable to our Lord and Master even as a wife would adorn herself in beautiful garments for her husband.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p11" guid="3cf6e5ec-6a85-4bb7-b3d4-f60715ac2bee" pid="IbgOl1cjB0K7lwXbnFy9Rw" hash="DvbXeA">The rule by which the people of God must live in order to be worthy of acceptance in the sight of God is indicated by the text to which I have made reference. This people must increase in beauty before the world; have an inward loveliness which may be observed by mankind as a reflection in holiness and in those inherent qualities of sanctity. The borders of Zion, where the righteous and pure in heart may dwell, must now begin to be enlarged. The stakes of Zion must be strengthened. All this so that Zion may arise and shine by becoming increasingly diligent in carrying out the plan of salvation throughout the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p12" guid="24fa73e4-6b78-482d-85c7-5b7e84282e38" pid="JJg6fKehhU6F6oqlaVz2Gg" hash="Xxy6wg">While the Church was in its infancy, the Lord pointed to a time when those earlier gathering places would not have room for all who would be gathered for reasons for which he declared that his church should be united. Here are his words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p13" guid="2a24e33f-9eca-488e-872e-5040810e02f4" pid="ODeP6ucznk-mQDCaT2Qj3g" hash="HEZWMA">“For thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” And then this command: “Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.4-5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 115:4–5</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p14" guid="36d5feee-3c34-48da-957d-5bbdd6cc23c0" pid="BdHsjR8O_UiDGxhbGaKwgw" hash="lL1ttw">Here is clearly inferred that the coming forth of his church in these days was the beginning of the fulfillment of the ancient prophecy when “the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. …” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/2.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 2:2–3</a>.)</p>

These units so organized are gathered together for these fundamental purposes: first, for a defense against the enemies of the Lord’s work, both the seen and the unseen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p16" guid="9578b5c0-a96e-48ea-b887-f80aa0aaa284" pid="myShBhXcrkOXMthGxyFeJA" hash="8al5zQ">The apostle Paul said with reference to these enemies about which we should be concerned:</p>

This prophetic warning of 1831 was given, as the Lord declared, so that “all men shall know that the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:35</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p20" guid="5a197736-fead-450b-81f8-d91acd475acf" pid="wVQlWp2lH0eOQmRniw2_8g" hash="Z1e4-A">Now 142 years later we are witnessing the fury of this time, when Satan has power over his own dominion, with such might that even the Master in his day referred to him as the “prince of this world,” the “enemy of all righteousness.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p21" guid="c7631d52-fff6-4a0c-a357-af3ba74b9422" pid="xCjymtnEGUmmXflYjflTgg" hash="g8hh1w">Despite these dire predictions and the evidences of their fulfillment truly before us today, there is promised in this same revelation even a greater power to thwart Satan’s plans to destroy the work of the Lord. Here the Lord makes this promise to the Saints of the Most High God, to the righteous in heart to whom he has referred as “the people of Zion.” This is what he said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p22" guid="fb07a7df-55dc-43f3-83ef-3f7e2f7c8e61" pid="DeXzPv2jcE2d1TgevUreRg" hash="I-guBQ">“And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:36</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p24" guid="7195fe2f-b0c7-41e5-a6fb-0cb2af4614fb" pid="1Ee4PNKGRESVZv6cd1bxyQ" hash="g67hnQ">I believe there has never been a time since the creation that the Lord has left the dominion of the devil to destroy his work without his power being manifest in the midst of the righteous to save the works of righteousness from being completely overthrown.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p25" guid="014ce918-ddb1-49fc-acae-5e38266bbb8d" pid="MIy69Nz8mUivWtLMQLw9gQ" hash="pCRb7A">Today we are witnessing the promise of the Lord that “if your eye be single to my glory,” which he declared to the prophet Moses was “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/2.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 2:39</a>), “your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.67" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:67</a>.)</p>

Behold, I will hasten my work in its time.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.72-73" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:72–73</a>.)</p>

Never in this dispensation, and perhaps never before in any single period, has there been such a feeling of urgency among the members of this church as today. Her boundaries are being enlarged, her stakes are being strengthened. In the early years of the Church specific places to which the Saints were to be gathered together were given, and the Lord directed that these gathering places should not be changed, but then he gave one qualification: “Until the day cometh when there is found no more room for them; and then I have other places which I will appoint unto them, and they shall be called stakes, for the curtains or the strength of Zion.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:21</a>.)</p>

McConkie of the Council of the Twelve, in a thought-provoking address, made some comments pertinent to this subject, and I quote a few sentences from his address:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p29" guid="b7442292-23e0-46eb-84fa-49fbb6b4b852" pid="-WhYLqDMlUih8ykl4Q5x8A" hash="zPKRtw">“Of this glorious day of restoration and gathering, another Nephite prophet said: ‘The Lord … has covenanted with all the house of Israel,’ that ‘the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God’; and that ‘they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.’ (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.1-2" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:1–2</a>.)</p>

Please note that these revealed words speak of the <span class="emphasis">folds </span>of the Lord; of Israel being gathered to the lands of their inheritance; of Israel being <span class="emphasis">established in all their lands of promise; </span>and of there being congregations of the covenant people of the Lord in <span class="emphasis">every nation, speaking every tongue, </span>and <span class="emphasis">among every people </span>when the Lord comes again.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p32" guid="cbbaf64b-ac45-4a8a-bcc4-202e3dbd47cd" pid="f8actbKVBUW9V2za5eQWKw" hash="I1Casw">“The place of gathering for the Mexican Saints is in Mexico; the place of gathering for the Guatemalan Saints is in Guatemala; the place of gathering for the Brazilian Saints is in Brazil; and so it goes throughout the length and breadth of the whole earth.

The first that might be called to the attention of those who would be interested is the basic principle of the plan of salvation from before the foundation of the world, for the redemption of mankind and which has been revealed to the prophets of this dispensation and has not been changed, for as the apostle Paul declared in his day, so do we declare today:</p>

In essence it probably would contemplate that they would give up their basic principles and be united in a nebulous organization which would not necessarily be founded on the principles as have traditionally been the doctrines of the church of Jesus Christ from the beginning.</p>

It could not be accomplished as set forth by a man-made formula; it could only be accomplished when the fullness of the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ are taught and practiced, as declared by the apostle Paul to the Ephesians, who said that the church is “built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.20" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:20</a>.)</p>

Today we have increasing numbers of missionaries, mostly younger men, who have been schooled from their childhood to prepare themselves for a call to serve as missionaries.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p56" guid="112ec573-959f-4fe3-85c7-017463bf6988" pid="wf9ZufGKeU6sO_vnOvuYJw" hash="El9yJw">From a handful of missionaries in the early days of the Church, this number has been increased to over 17,000 serving today, each at his own expense, or at the expense of his immediate family, for a period of two or more years, each with a conviction in his heart that one so called has the divinity of his calling in his mind as he may go forth into any part of the world to which he may be called.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p57" guid="9f3eadfe-11a9-4215-a77f-9c716c6bbbba" pid="Jp9UcuBWtUOGgVIvTfYEkw" hash="YMFiVQ">Another reason that might be given for the increase in the Lord’s work: perhaps as never before have there been so many people of the world searching for answers to the many perplexing problems.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p58" guid="79688d3d-0883-423d-bbb0-c3c28910b8a9" pid="Y1v0TvMSxUGfKiwrpjywEg" hash="zLmBbw">While the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ have not changed, the methods in meeting these challenges of the needs of today’s world must respond to the demands of our time. Fortunately the Lord has given, in the revelations to this church, the guidelines by which we should respond to the demands of the times. The plan of salvation has defined the way by which he would have us deal with the temporal needs of the people. The welfare plan of the Church seeks out those in distress. Where the newly found members are located, the plan of temporal salvation is, primarily, to teach the individuals how to take care of themselves. The Lord has provided a hedge against the terrifying impact upon the sanctity of the home and marriage, by strengthening the home and by providing guidelines to parents to teach their children the basic principles of honesty, virtue, integrity, thrift, and industry.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p59" guid="3d103e75-1bb1-41c7-926f-28fbb01ac8fa" pid="9P_62matDU6RlS66_w3Jug" hash="owVeuQ">There is a concern of the Church for the individual members, from childhood to youth, and from among the youth into adulthood, to respond to the needs of members of the Church of every age.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p60" guid="23cf25f8-5a6e-48c3-95de-e427311a0a1b" pid="me8MvrmGakKf5c5C6QiE3g" hash="gXQnYg">In answer to the questions as to whether or not there may have been any dropouts or members who have fallen away, our answer has always been to recall the Master’s parable of the sower, where the sower went out to sow. Some of the seeds fell on fertile ground, but among the seeds which fell on fertile ground, some produced thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some ninetyfold. So today, in about that same ratio, we have some who are partially active, some are more so, and some who are thoroughly active in the Church, but we are always reaching out to the ones who have strayed away, and we are constantly trying to bring them back into full activity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p61" guid="5c9b2eee-6712-4043-9b43-219dfff3ecfb" pid="cOtuwSpqLE-BfJEL-AV_NA" hash="qQhQcw">But perhaps the most important reason of all for the growth of the Church is the individual testimonies of the divinity of this work, as would be multiplied in the hearts of the individual members of the Church. For the strength of the Church is not in the numbers, nor in the amount of tithes and offerings paid by faithful members, nor in the magnitude of chapels and temple buildings, but because in the hearts of faithful members of the Church is the conviction that this is indeed the church and kingdom of God on the earth. Without that conviction, as one of my eminent business associates remarked, “The welfare plan of the Church would be but a shambles”; also missionary work would not flourish; and members would not be faithful in making generous contributions to the Church to finance its many operations. The secret of the strength of this church may be found in the statement of a president of a student body at one of our state-operated universities, whose identity, of course, is confidential. This is a quotation from his personal letter addressed to me:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p62" guid="e2af28a6-4d6c-4f2d-b8ed-c3812906a009" pid="LOO-FesBy0CIvjZSxAQFJA" hash="tvJZ2w">“With the rule of the radical ideas which are sweeping the country, there has come a breakdown of family ties which is despised in many intellectual circles. The country is seemingly plied with sex education, abortion, planned parenthood, pornography, women’s liberation, communal living, premarital sex, and postmarital permissiveness. …”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p63" guid="485f3d72-4d01-4c49-94a2-b1f72cda221a" pid="exoxgU-5ZEuTIGlAvvmDzQ" hash="HioWBQ">And then this young college student leader concludes with this heartwarming declaration, which I know came from the depths of his soul. This is what he wrote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p64" guid="352bdd69-987a-42b6-b4df-33221b45a899" pid="xWgWknl3EEmj888vlZehmQ" hash="jeQ16w">“President Lee, I want you to know that the Latter-day Saint students on campus who keep the commandments are 100 percent behind you. Thank God we have leaders who stand firm against the subtle battle of the adversary who is striking at the home, the most vital unit of the world. Thank you for being the kind of a person that we, as young people growing up in this mixed-up world, can understand and can follow.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p65" guid="1bd44c3e-b1af-4406-b8ca-3431c05cfbce" pid="QGQpwKN90Ee3HZo9Tpjdig" hash="lBdP_w">By that same token, and in the language of that brilliant college student, I am convinced that the greatest of all the underlying reasons for the strength of this church is that those who keep the commandments of God are 100 percent behind the leadership of this church. Without that united support it would be readily understood that this church could not go forward to meet the challenges of the day. Our call is for the total membership of the Church to keep the commandments of God, for therein lies the safety of the world. As one keeps the commandments of God, he is not only persuaded as to the righteousness of the course that is being followed under the leadership of the Church, but also will have the Spirit of the Lord to guide him in his individual activities, for each baptized member has been given a sacred endowment when he was baptized and which has been committed to every baptized member of the Church by the authority of the priesthood: the gift of the Holy Ghost, which, as the Master declared, would teach all things, would bring all things to their remembrance, and even show them things to come. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p66" guid="25391c6b-516e-4a9f-ae91-e844932900c1" pid="dO6PdrdjHU2H3oH0Tc3m9Q" hash="nMlqPg">It will be clearly understood, then, that the great responsibility that the leaders and teachers in the Church have is to persuade, to teach, to direct aright, that the commandments of Almighty God will be so lived as to prevent the individual from falling into the trap of the evil one who would persuade him not to believe in God and not to follow the leadership of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/strengthen-the-stakes-of-zion.p67" guid="8ef3daa9-34d7-448a-adbf-b72522df3b76" pid="qd4MW1ZPGkuD4-3heEyc3Q" hash="bzdkMw">I want to bear my sacred witness that because I know of the divinity of this work, I know that it will prevail; and that though there may be enemies within and without the Church who would seek to undermine and would seek to find fault and try to undermine the influence of the Church in the world, this church will be borne off triumphantly and will stand through the test of time when all the man-made efforts and weapons forged against the Lord’s word will fall by the wayside. I know that our Lord and Master Jesus Christ is the head of this church; that he has daily communion through agencies known to him, not only to the leaders of the Church in high positions, but also to individual members as they keep the commandments of God. To that I bear my sacred witness and leave my blessing upon all the faithful of the Church, and indeed in the world everywhere, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

I am sure that you listened to President Romney and heard him define that word <span class="emphasis">ponder, </span>and then made its application; that is what we are asking you to do now, and not go out as a Monday morning quarterback and try to do all the second-guessing. I want to say to you that there is no topic that has received longer and more searching, prayerful discussion by the General Authorities of the Church than the matters that pertain to the young people of the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood groups, and the women of similar ages.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/follow-the-leadership-of-the-church.p6" guid="7d05555c-7ded-47ae-9ab4-383012c1b4a6" pid="aAa5Sx7fx0-Wk_7aMYDZuQ" hash="nzJVnQ">May I just make this one statement, so that you will get this thing in proper focus. These announced Aaronic Priesthood and Melchizedek Priesthood MIAs do not do away with the Young Men’s and Young Women’s Mutual Improvement Associations. What is intended, as you see this unfold, is that the programs will go forward, but with priesthood identity the like of which they have not enjoyed before. And we sincerely believe that if you fully understand and this program is fully comprehended, as the priesthood identity is now explained, many of those who have not been active will now be brought into activity; and the priesthood and the youth and the young adults, and those over 25, and many others who have felt themselves forgotten souls will now, under the leadership of these great leaders, move forward. We hope that there will not one be missed, and everybody will be taken into focus by the great plan of salvation.</p>

Institutionalized, these same groups will still function as far as religious activities are concerned; but so far as the activity part of the program, the social part, is concerned, we trust that as you see this move into action, you will see that our youth of these various organizations, of these various groupings, will now be brought together so that there will be a wider relationship than there has ever been before. Hopefully there will be a greater chance for young people to find companionship within their groups, and eventually, we hope, in temple marriage.</p>

And interestingly enough, as I looked at this, my mind reflected back to an address I heard delivered from this pulpit by President Anthony W. Ivins on October 4, 1931. Just why I thought of that—I suppose it was intended that I should—is because he gave an address at that conference and used as his text the recently published book called <span class="emphasis">Our Bible in Stone. </span>Many of you remember this treated principally the erection, the symbolism, and the prophetic character of the pyramid of Gizeh, or in Greek, the Cheops. Students of the pyramid, after a study of the measurements, symbols, and the record of the pyramid, if it had a record, said that the year 1928 would witness the beginning of a period of great tribulation, which would culminate with intensity in 1936. That period, according to the reckoning of the students, would close with the advent of the Lord and the establishment of a period of peace, happiness, and goodwill among men.</p>

It will undoubtedly go into the mission field and our elders may make use of it. I simply want to warn you against sensationalism of any kind. … I do not say that his conclusions are wrong, but I do say that they do not come to us as the voice of the Church, nor are they to be accepted as such.”</p>

He said: “Brother J. Golden Kimball told us yesterday that he was a great believer in dreams that come true.” I wish you would think of that. That accords with my feelings. I am a great believer in dreams that have come true.</p>

Just be calm and turn to the Lord. … I pleaded with the people to put their houses in order and get out of debt, for I knew this was coming, because God himself through his Only Begotten Son had declared it.</p>

It will come to you in a manner that you will understand it. It will not be speculative. It will come to you philosophically, truthfully, and governed by common sense. God bless you,” he said, “is my humble prayer. …” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report, </span>October 1931, pp. 87–94.)</p>

There are sensational predictions and observations, and to make their writings appear to have Church sanction, they use quotations and addresses from Church leaders, past and present, taken out of context in such a way as to make it appear as though these quotations were the endorsement of the book they wish to sell to Church members, who may thereby be induced to accept their writings as from unquestioned sources.</p>

Now, brethren, we feel it is of the utmost importance to lift a warning voice so that our people will be safeguarded against such tactics as an all too obvious self-seeking opportunity to spread their own propaganda for their own interests.</p>

That isn’t the way to explain the duty of a deacon. What does it mean to pass the sacrament? When a deacon carries the emblems of the bread and water which have been blessed to the good of those to whom it shall be passed, it is then a renewal of a covenant that if they will keep the commandments of God and remember the Lord Jesus Christ, for whom those emblems stand, they will have the Spirit of the Lord to be with them.”</p>

They should have in mind when they are acting in those capacities it is as though they were acting for and responsible to the Lord.</p>

Priesthood is the power by which our Heavenly Father works through men, through deacons, through teachers, through priests, and I have a feeling that we are not impressing that upon our young men. They are not taking the understanding of their priesthood as seriously as they might. If they did, they would always want to appear as President Tanner has said of Bishop Featherstone. They would always want to appear at their best when they are exercising their priesthood. Their hair would be properly groomed; their clothing and appearance would reflect the sanctity they should feel in the performance of their priesthood duties. I have had that same feeling. I have never performed an ordinance, such as administering to the sick, without first excusing myself, if I were out in the garden or somewhere, until I was properly clothed, to make the best appearance I could, because I felt in so doing I was drawing close to the Lord himself, and I want to appear at my best in his presence.</p>

I have often thought one of the reasons why we are not magnifying our priesthood is because we don’t understand that as holders of the priesthood, He is working through us by the power of the holy priesthood, and I would wish that we could all have that feeling, and so teach our young people what it means to hold the priesthood and to magnify it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/follow-the-leadership-of-the-church.p34" guid="9229b802-24c9-491a-948b-43d602b15a99" pid="oRAuuOaemEa8tf3OBSZ9rw" hash="S7vP2A">Now tonight, brethren, we have touched a number of subjects. We come to you, one of the greatest bodies of priesthood that has ever been assembled, so we understand. What an influence! At the sessions of this conference you have had your attention called to some of the most dangerous trends in our public life—sex education, pornography, permissiveness—running rampant over the world. Brethren of the priesthood, this army, if they would reach out with all the influence that they could wield and really magnify their priesthood as the representatives of our Heavenly Father, could engender such a power and might that by the use of our priesthood in our various communities, these things would not be allowed to continue without a sturdy defense on the part of the priesthood of the living God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/follow-the-leadership-of-the-church.p35" guid="e42f0fdb-9656-4fc3-b830-84b42ac9afc6" pid="R-ZdO2Ymf0GkIoBo0lZxug" hash="JPwrMw">We must call ourselves to new service and new responsibilities, and not stand idly by and let these things go without challenge. Our youth are in danger. Keep your home ties strong, brethren. See to it, as we have all tried to say, and as I have repeated it many times and some have quoted it in this conference, that “the greatest of the Lord’s work you brethren will ever do as fathers will be within the walls of your own home.” Don’t neglect your wives, you brethren. Don’t neglect your children. Take time for family home evening. Draw your children around about you. Teach them, guide them, and guard them. There was never a time when we needed so much the strength and the solidarity of the home. If we will do that, this church will grow by leaps and bounds in strength and influence throughout the world. No longer need you be considered as a hiss and byword. We should stand four-square for the things that are honorable, righteous, pure, virtuous, and true.</p>

We stand ready. As you pray for us, we will try to meet that high expectation, God being our helper. We realize the magnitude of the responsibility we bear, and except we can be assured of your faith and your loyalty, and your unquestioned one hundred percent keeping of the commandments of God, we cannot meet it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/follow-the-leadership-of-the-church.p37" guid="c59c5990-c65a-4c17-bf0d-2410344585e0" pid="PvqbsCnkvEiTIyhxNjtZYQ" hash="GZEcGQ">I quoted in the opening session of this conference a wonderful letter that I received from a student body president who is greatly concerned about things going on on the campus and ‘round about in the society where he moves, and then his statement was, “I can assure you that every Latter-day Saint on this campus who is keeping the commandments of God one hundred percent is supporting and sustaining you.” Brethren, I know that that is true throughout this whole church. Every Latter-day Saint who is keeping the commandments is following the leadership of the Church. By that same token, if you find those who are not willing to follow the leadership of the Church, you may be sure it is a certainty that they are not keeping the commandments of God one hundred percent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/follow-the-leadership-of-the-church.p38" guid="c9fd9d02-8ad0-4f8d-9d41-c74631dfd457" pid="lhiK1Es1dEa5_1sKklLJoQ" hash="pGZlpw">So it is a call to arms—arms to do what? To keep the commandments of God in order that we might lay claim to the blessings we need so much in this day of uncertainty, in this crazy mixed-up world, as some have spoken of it, and our youth have seemed to feel. In these new movements with our young people, our only hope is that by intensifying the responsibility of the priesthood with the youth organizations we can strengthen their hands and reach out to these young men and women who need so much the shepherding influence of the priesthood, for in so doing we feel sure we can help to raise up a righteous generation that will carry on the work throughout the ages that lie ahead of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/follow-the-leadership-of-the-church.p39" guid="d9b27d73-72e5-4cd9-854f-829d56c9c36d" pid="5DinPIAEtEicgu4L09S1jw" hash="5IKqNQ">I bear you my solemn witness, my beloved brethren, that these things that have been spoken tonight have been spoken under the inspiration of the Lord, and we give it to you for your pondering, for your prayerful consideration, suspending judgment, and not raising your voices in criticism, but carrying on the youth organizations as they now exist until these brethren have given you the full details of just what lies ahead; then you can begin to see the merits of what it is all about.</p>

So I pray and leave you my blessing, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Sitting where we do as the First Presidency, we have been aware these last six months that there has been such a feeling of need to have questions answered, to have spoken from this pulpit at this conference things that are needed by so many in this mixed-up world, to help them to set guidelines for their own lives.</p>

If you want to know what the Lord has for this people at the present time, I would admonish you to get and read the discourses that have been delivered at this conference; for what these brethren have spoken by the power of the Holy Ghost is the mind of the Lord, the will of the Lord, the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation. I am sure all who have listened, if they have been in tune, have felt the sincerity and the deep conviction from those who have spoken so appropriately and so effectively.</p>

As we have seen them being brought into key positions, we have marveled as to how, when we have need of a man or person for a particular office, the man of the hour seems to have been brought to us, almost in a miraculous way.</p>

The heaviest burden that one has to bear in this life is the burden of sin. How do you help one to bear that great burden of sin, in order that it might be light?</p>

The door opened and a fine young man came in with a troubled look on his face, and he said, “Brethren, I am going to the temple for the first time tomorrow. I have made some mistakes in the past, and I have gone to my bishop and my stake president, and I have made a clean disclosure of it all; and after a period of repentance and assurance that I have not returned again to those mistakes, they have now adjudged me ready to go to the temple. But, brethren, that is not enough. I want to know, and how can I know, that the Lord has forgiven me, also.”</p>

As we pondered for a moment, we remembered King Benjamin’s address contained in the book of Mosiah. Here was a group of people who now were asking for baptism, and they said they viewed themselves in their carnal state:</p>

In your soul-searching, if you seek for and you find that peace of conscience, by that token you may know that the Lord has accepted of your repentance. Satan would have you think otherwise and sometimes persuade you that now having made one mistake, you might go on and on with no turning back. That is one of the great falsehoods. The miracle of forgiveness is available to all of those who turn from their evil doings and return no more, because the Lord has said in a revelation to us in our day: “… go your ways and sin no more; but unto that soul who sinneth [meaning again] shall the former sins return, saith the Lord your God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:7</a>.)

You help them to that day of repentance and restitution, in order that they too may have that peace of conscience, the confirming of the Spirit of the Lord that he has accepted of their repentance.</p>

The greatest miracles I see today are not necessarily the healing of sick bodies, but the greatest miracles I see are the healing of sick souls, those who are sick in soul and spirit and are downhearted and distraught, on the verge of nervous breakdowns. We are reaching out to all such, because they are precious in the sight of the Lord, and we want no one to feel that they are forgotten.</p>

Here was one who had never walked, impotent from his birth, begging alms of all who approached the gate. And as Peter and John approached, he held out his hand expectantly, asking for alms. Peter, speaking for this pair of missionaries—church authorities—said, “Look on us.” And, of course, that heightened his expectation. “Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.4,6" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:4, 6</a>.)</p>

He commands me to walk.” But the biblical record doesn’t end there. Peter just didn’t content himself by commanding the man to walk, but he “took him by the right hand, and lifted him up.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:7</a>.)</p>

Let’s walk together, and I assure you that you can walk, because you have received a blessing by the power and authority that God has given us as men, his servants.” Then the man leaped with joy.</p>

You must be sure, if you would rescue the man, that you yourself are setting the example of what you would have him be. You cannot light a fire in another soul unless it is burning in your own soul. You teachers, the testimony that you bear, the spirit with which you teach and with which you lead, is one of the most important assets that you can have, as you help to strengthen those who need so much, wherein you have so much to give. Who of us, in whatever station we may have been in, have not needed strengthening?</p>

I was suffering from an ulcer condition that was becoming worse and worse. We had been touring a mission; my wife, Joan, and I were impressed the next morning that we should get home as quickly as possible, although we had planned to stay for some other meetings.</p>

Some of our Church members were in the next section. As we approached a certain point en route, someone laid his hand upon my head. I looked up; I could see no one. That happened again before we arrived home, again with the same experience. Who it was, by what means or what medium, I may never know, except I knew that I was receiving a blessing that I came a few hours later to know I needed most desperately.</p>

It was now about 11 o’clock at night. He called me to come to the telephone, and he asked me how I was: and I said, “Well, I am very tired. I think I will be all right.” But shortly thereafter, there came massive hemorrhages which, had they occurred while we were in flight, I wouldn’t be here today talking about it.</p>

We see that manifest down in the countries we speak of as the underprivileged countries where there is little medical aid and perhaps no hospitals. If you want to hear of great miracles among these humble people with simple faith, you will see it among them when they are left to themselves. Yes, I know that there are such powers.</p>

But when I was guided by the Spirit to name two noble men, whose powerful words of teaching and testimony you have heard today, President N. Eldon Tanner and President Marion G. Romney, I realized that mine was not the responsibility to carry these responsibilities alone. And then as we meet week by week in the temple and look across the room and see 12 stalwart men, men chosen from out the world and given the power of the holy apostleship, I am aware that no greater men walk the earth than these men.</p>

Brown at this conference. We wish that Brother Alvin R. Dyer could have been here. Brother Alma Sonne has been able to be with us.

These are men who are fanning out over the whole earth now, to every corner of the earth. Newly baptized members who know little about the gospel and much less about the disciplines of the Church must be taught if the Church is to be safely led. These men who have been chosen from out of the strongest men we have in the Church now are going out now under the direction of the Council of the Twelve. And there are also the Mission Representatives of the Twelve and the First Council of the Seventy associated with them. They are going out to the humblest everywhere and teaching them these fundamental principles, teaching them, as the Prophet Joseph answered when asked, “How do you govern your people?” His answer was, “I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.”</p>

As we have said to them, they are standing as “coaches” rather than as “quarterbacks” on the football team, teaching the quarterbacks how to direct, teaching them correct principles. They are men of faith. And how grateful we are for all these auxiliary workers who have gone out, likewise at great expense, great travel, and sacrifice on the part of their businesses and their families.</p>

We were all preparing for that great occasion. It was something new in my life, when along about three or four o’clock in the morning, I enjoyed an experience that I think was not a dream, but it must have been a vision. It seemed that I was witnessing a great spiritual gathering, where men and women were standing up, two or three at a time, and speaking in tongues. The spirit was so unusual. I seemed to have heard the voice of President David O. McKay say, “If you want to love God, you have to learn to love and serve the people. That is the way you show your love for God.” And there were other things then that I saw and heard.</p>

I know that he is. I know that he is closer to us than many times we have any idea. They are not an absentee Father and Lord. They are concerned about us, helping to prepare us for the advent of the Savior, whose coming certainly isn’t too far away because of the signs that are becoming apparent.</p>

Teach your families in your family home evening, teach them to keep the commandments of God, for therein is our only safety in these days. If they will do that, the powers of the Almighty will descend upon them as the dews from heaven, and the Holy Ghost will be theirs, which has been spoken of so excellently by Elder Franklin D. Richards. That can be our guide, and that kind of Spirit shall guide us and direct us to his holy home.</p>

God bless you, take care of you, preserve you as you travel home, that there may be no accident or no untoward experience. Take to your people out in the far reaches the feeling of love that we have for all of them; and indeed, as the missionaries go out, that love extends not only to those of our Father’s children who are already members of the Church, but those who are our Father’s children to whom he would have us bring the gospel of truth; make them also to enjoy all the blessings that we now have.</p>

I speak of the shocking lack of self-respect by so many individuals, as is evidenced by their dress, their manner, and engulfing waves of permissiveness which seem to be moving over the world like an avalanche.</p>

Surely these matters must have been determined by the kind of lives we had lived in that premortal spirit world. Some may question these assumptions, but at the same time they will accept without any question the belief that each one of us will be judged when we leave this earth according to his or her deeds during our lives here in mortality. Isn’t it just as reasonable to believe that what we have received here in this earth life was given to each of us according to the merits of our conduct before we came here?</p>

We are all free agents, which means to some people who manifest a spirit of rebellion that they are free to do anything they please, but that is not the correct meaning of free agency as the prophets have declared in the scriptures where free agency has been defined. I quote:</p>

And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>.)</p>

If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3.16-17" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 3:16–17</a>.)</p>

This was his teaching: “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? … therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/6.19-20" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 6:19–20</a>.)</p>

This is the fate of “even as many as would not hearken unto my voice” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.4" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:4</a>), so declared the Lord to Moses.</p>

This was their firm conclusion after an exhaustive study: “The philosophy of the students who took their lives was so lacking that when a severe crisis came in their lives, they had nothing to hold fast to, and so they took the coward’s way out.”</p>

All of this was a free gift to every living soul as Paul declared: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:22</a>.)</p>

She said to me, “I have thought all this through. It doesn’t make any difference whether I go now or whether I live to 70, 80, or 90. The sooner I can get to a place where I can be active and doing things that will bring me eternal joy the better for all concerned.” She was comforted by the thought that she had lived such a life as to be worthy to enter into the presence of God, which is to enjoy eternal life.</p>

A young mother came with her beautiful flaxen-haired six-year-old daughter to her grandparents. The mother asked if we would like to hear a beautiful new children’s song which the daughter had just learned in her Primary class. While the little mother accompanied her, she sang:</p>

There we had 14,000 saints gathered from more than eight European countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland. Besides that, there was a large representation from the German Democratic Republic. They permitted a number of our people to come from behind what we call the “iron curtain.” In addition, of course, were a number of us from America. This required some very careful and extensive preparations for translating into five different languages, six including English.</p>

But how simple it would be if all of you would try to learn English besides your own mother tongue. Surely you could learn one language, English, rather than to expect the General Authorities to learn seventeen different languages.”</p>

These people came wanting to know clear signals of what they ought to do.</p>

We quoted to them what the Apostle Paul had said to the Galatians, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus … and heirs according to the promise.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/3.28-29" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 3:28–29</a>.)</p>

Despite the political differences that you have had with various countries, in you now, because you are all members of The Church of Jesus Christ, the war must end so far as you are concerned.”</p>

And that should apply not only in political matters, but it should apply in our dealings with each other. What we may do as politicians, or as those who are engaged in competitive temporal activities, we must say, “Because I am a holder of the priesthood of the living God, I am a representative of our Heavenly Father and hold the priesthood by which He can work through me; I can’t stoop to do some of the things that I might have done otherwise because of my fellowship with the priesthood of God.”</p>

The first such conference was held in Manchester, England, where we had about 14,000 there. We were in Mexico City next, where we had representatives from all the Central American countries and from Mexico. There we had 16,000, and to see what had happened from the time I first went down there in 1945 was an inspiration. To see congregations that at that time were meeting many times in houses with dirt floors! Many of the women came barefooted, showing the extremes of poverty; very few leaders—and now to go back after these few years and see under one roof well-dressed, fine-looking leaders taking their own responsibilities as bishoprics, stake presidencies, high councilors, stake mission presidents—it is one of the miracles. The world is asking the question, “How are you able to do it?” and there is only one answer: that when we become fellow citizens in the kingdom of God we must be men and women different. And that is what the holders of the priesthood must say to themselves: “We can’t be holders of the priesthood and be like other men. We must be different, because priesthood means a fellowship in the royal household of the kingdom of God.”</p>

Last June we announced some changes in the structuring of the MIA. The Aaronic Priesthood MIA is now for those 12 to 18 years of age; and the Melchizedek Priesthood MIA is for those from 18 to 25 for Young Adults; those 26 and over for Special Interest. And the announced purpose of this last grouping was to focus attention upon those who have not, up to this time, been involved. They have come to us many times in the last few years saying, “We have nowhere to go. We don’t relate to the Relief Society. We are not young adults. We go to sacrament meeting, we go to Sunday School. Why can’t we have a program that is suited to our needs?” And so this organization, as set up, is now moving forward and is designed to focus on every individual, and to make everyone feel that they are wanted; and the leaders of the Church must be in the forefront in carrying out these programs suited to the needs of those in these age groups.</p>

My bishop informed me of the Special Interest group in the Church. In this area, the program is still quite new and many people have never heard of it yet. I didn’t know it existed until about a month ago. I am sure there are many who need this program but they have been cheated because many of the bishops where we are are not converted to it. Therefore, they are not really trying to take the leadership in getting this thing started.”</p>

We sometimes make mistakes in choosing a companion, which sometimes results in a divorce. Or we may be widowed, and there are some who just haven’t found the right companion at twenty-five years of age.”</p>

Without the Special Interest group a single person after the age of 25 is like a fifth wheel. As a Church, most of the talks are centered around the complete family unit. This concept I fully agree with, and certainly should be encouraged.”</p>

Her husband passed away, and then she writes, “After the funeral services were over, I took my five children and went home, and was left to sink or swim. And I sank; I was all alone. How was I going to look after those five children? Oh, sure, the bishop would see that I didn’t go hungry and that we were taken care of, and we had enough food to eat, and so on, but we needed something more than that.”</p>

I need to meet other widows who have managed to raise their children alone successfully, without the hang-ups psychologists insist they will have. I need to know that some people’s problems are worse than mine, so I can recognize and count my blessings. I need people to talk to who fully understand my problems and needs. I need Special Interests because I have to learn how to handle my own problems. The first thing I learned as a widow was that no one else will help except in emergencies, and sometimes not then. As soon as the funeral was over, I repeat, I was left on my own either to sink or swim.</p>

There is no way you can fully understand our needs or problems, except you go through it yourself. Do you know what it is like to lose your wife or husband in death? It is nothing like losing your father or even your daughter. I know; I lost both before I lost my husband. Do you know what it is like to go through the hell of a divorce? Do you know what it is like to be a girl over 26, and still be single? You can’t know. We need each other. Some of us need small group activities. Some of us need large group activities where we can go and have to talk to people and visit. Sometimes we don’t feel like talking. Special Interests is not a dating bureau or a marriage bureau. As such it would be a complete failure. There are women in our stake who like to go places, but not alone. They come to our small activities hoping to meet other women with similar interests to go places with. One lady buys a season pass to the symphony every year, and she is still looking for someone to go with her.</p>

To me it is like a slap in the face to have the Young Marrieds or elders announce that Special Interests are invited to their party. I know you may not understand why I feel so strongly about it, but other Special Interests I have talked to understand, and most of the others feel the same way. I feel like this new Special Interest program is inspired of God. It is what we need, if it is done like it should be. I needed it eight-and-a-half years ago. Thank the Lord my president is working hard on it to do his part. Will you recognize us as a special group of people, long ignored and neglected with special problems and special needs and special interests? Some of us are raising special children, boys without fathers, girls without mothers. They have special problems and special needs. If our needs aren’t met, you are also neglecting some of their needs.”</p>

We know, and we announced when it was given that this came from the Lord. This was an evidence of a thing that the Lord was giving us to do to meet a special need. But it troubles me when I read some of these things where sisters are pleading with us to try to do something to stimulate the activities where the bishops or stake presidents have not caught on to what it is all about.</p>

Smith further said this, which strikes right at the heart of what I want to emphasize: “I desire to emphasize this. I want the young men of Zion to realize that this institution of marriage is not a man-made institution. It is of God. It is honorable, and no man who is of marriageable age is living his religion who remains single. It is not simply devised for the convenience alone of man, to suit his own notions, and his own ideas; to marry and then divorce, to adopt and then to discard, just as he pleases. … Marriage is the preserver of the human race. Without it, the purposes of God would be frustrated; virtue would be destroyed to give place to vice and corruption, and the earth would be void and empty.</p>

The Church authorities and the teachers of our associations should inculcate the sacredness, and teach the duty of marriage, as it has been revealed in the latter days to us. There should be a reform in the Church in this regard, and a sentiment created in favor of honorable marriage, and that would prevent any young man, or any young woman, who is a member of the Church, from marrying except by that authority which is sanctioned of God. And no man holding the priesthood who is worthy and of age should remain unmarried. …</p>

In answer to my questions, she said he was kind to her. He was a good provider, but somehow the luster of the romance of marriage, now that their children were pretty well grown, had now brought her to a point where she had begun to think that maybe if she were footloose she could do better than she was able to do with the husband who was the father of her children. We had quite a talk about it; but the other morning, after the first session of the conference, this lovely young woman met me and she said, with tears rolling down her cheeks, “I have had the answer to every problem. This session has changed my life. I am a woman different now, because I have understanding that I never had before. I am going back. I am going to take care of my family. I am going to love my husband, and I am going to correct the mistakes that are in me, where I think most of the problem lies.”</p>

At first thought we hesitated, because he was just a young man. He was younger than we are. But he was our bishop so we went to see him. We poured out our souls to our young bishop. He sat and listened silently, and when we ran out of conversation he said, simply, ‘Well, my wife and I, we had problems, too, and we learned how to solve our problems.’ That is all in the world he said. But you know there was something that happened as a result of that young bishop’s statement.

This may sound a little bit bold to urge marriage for those who are past the marriageable age; but in some of our countries, where we are bringing in new converts, we are shocked to know that some men are delaying marriage until their later thirties or into their forties, and they have never talked of marriage. Here I have quoted from a president of the Church, President Joseph F. Smith, who has told us in plainness that today a flood of iniquities is overwhelming the civilized world and that one great reason therefore is the neglect of marriage. It has lost its sanctity in the eyes of the great majority. It is at best a civil contract, but more than often an accident, or a whim, or a means of gratifying the passions; and when the sacredness of the covenant is ignored or lost sight of, then a disregard of the marriage vows under the present moral training of the masses is a mere triviality, a trifling indiscretion.</p>

I have tried to terminate the relationship, but it seems to drag on. There is no commitment; realistically, there is also very little hope.”</p>

His lifestyle seems to be an adaptation of that of worldly couples who live together without benefit of or commitment to marriage. There probably is no immorality involved in many cases, but it is a degenerative condition and does not by any means ‘avoid the appearance of evil.’ And the girls are probably as guilty as the fellows for allowing such conditions to exist; however, they are limited in their efforts to bring about satisfactory solutions.”</p>

All women have a desire for companionship. They want to be wives; they want to be mothers; and when men refuse to assume their responsibility of marriage, for no good reason, they are unable to consummate marriage. Brethren, we are not doing our duty as holders of the priesthood when we go beyond the marriageable age and withhold ourselves from an honorable marriage to these lovely women, who are seeking the fulfillment of a woman’s greatest desire to have a husband, a family, and a home.</p>

I am not trying to urge you younger men to marry too early. I think therein is one of the hazards of today’s living. We don’t want a young man to think of marriage until he is able to take care of a family, to have an institution of his own, to be independent. He must make sure that he has found the girl of his choice, they have gone together long enough that they know each other, and that they know each other’s faults and they still love each other. I have said to the mission presidents (some of whom have been reported to us as saying to missionaries, “Now, if you are not married in six months, you are a failure as a missionary”), “Don’t you ever say that to one of your missionaries. Maybe in six months they will not have found a wife; and if they take you seriously, they may rush into a marriage that will be wrong for them.”</p>

That is what the Lord tells us.</p>

Take time, yes, but don’t neglect your responsibility and your obligations as holders of the holy priesthood.</p>

What a force, 185,000 is the estimated number of you who are within the sounds of our voices tonight. Brethren, let us have our eyes fixed on the eternal value of things, with an eye single to the glory of God, and say each to himself, that “from now on, God being my helper, I am not going to engage in any activity unless it helps me to move myself further toward that goal of eternal life, eventually to return back to the presence of my Heavenly Father.”</p>

It is frightening, brethren, and much of it stems from one of the greatest of all the sins next to murder, the sin of adultery, that is running rampant throughout the Church. Brethren, we must ourselves resolve anew that we are going to keep the law of chastity; and if we have made mistakes, let’s begin now to rectify these mistakes. Let’s walk towards the light; and for goodness sake, brethren, don’t prostitute the wonderful opportunity you have as men, as those who may link hands with the Creator in the procreation of human souls, by engaging in a kind of unlawful relationship that will only go down to disgrace and break the hearts of your wives and your children. Brethren, we plead with you to keep yourselves morally clean, and walk the path of truth and righteousness, and thereby gain the plaudits of a Heavenly Father whose sons you are.</p>

But we want you to rise to your responsibilities, brethren, and keep yourselves in tune with the Spirit of the Lord. One of the greatest and saddest things that we can see is one who has had the Spirit of the Lord and then has lost it by sin, and they stand now in the dark and are turned over to the buffetings of Satan, and then experience the torture chambers of the hell in which they must live, which is terrible indeed as the Lord has warned. Brethren, let us try to catch people on the way down before they reach that kind of a goal, and where you see them going in that direction, brethren, rise to your responsibilities and try to save the manhood of this Church.</p>

We have members of the Church in all parts of the world. One of the anxious centers right today is over in Israel, where a war is raging. As yet we don’t know very much about the extent of it, but it seems that Egypt and Syria are moving into areas of Israel.</p>

We have had anxious parents who have been wondering, watching, waiting. The word has come to us that they are all safe and they are being watched over. You can be sure that we have shepherds of the flock, and we will continue to pray with you that no harm will come to any of them.</p>

The word comes to us, from one of the presiding authorities who has been here from Santiago, that there has been no loss of life as far as we know. Our people are holding fast, not taking part in the political turmoil, rising above it, as true members of the Church of Jesus Christ are expected to do, giving allegiance to those who are in command, and not wishing to take sides, but merely to bow their heads and yield obedience to the authority of the government where they are.</p>

But, some of the greatest of our enemies are those within our own ranks. It was the lament of the Master, as he witnessed one of those chosen men, who under inspiration he chose as one of the Twelve, betray him with a kiss and for a few paltry pieces of silver turn him over to his enemies. Judas then stood by and, realizing the enormity of what he had done, took the only escape out to sacrifice himself. And Jesus could only explain that of the Twelve, meaning Judas, he had a devil.</p>

But sometimes we have to say just like the Master said, “The devil must have entered into them.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/closing-remarks.p6" guid="4a99bda6-b3c8-4900-ad37-2ee6ed53969f" pid="r_ku2jFJ7U6bFy5BtvnMhQ" hash="eP3wNQ">A few years ago, we had a woman who had written some scurrilous things about the Prophet Joseph Smith. (Mention was made of it here in the conference at that time.) Shortly thereafter, I met someone on the street and they asked me if there had been a revelation or an utterance at the recently concluded general conference that might be considered as a prophecy. And I said, “Did you hear the closing remarks of President George Albert Smith as he closed the conference? If you did, you heard a prophet speaking, and let me tell you what he said.” I happened to have a clipping in my wallet. This is what President George Albert Smith said:</p>

They befoul the honored family names that they have. They have disgraced the honors that we had given to them in times past. They are trying to join the forces of the enemy against the work of the Lord. And we can say to them, as President George Albert Smith said then, “Those who have will be forgotten in the remains of mother earth, and the odor of the infamy will ever be with them, but honor, majesty, and fidelity to God, exemplified by the leaders of this church and attached to their names, will never die.”</p>

I am sure that many people came to this conference with many questions on their minds, seeking to know the answers to some of the troublesome things about them, wanting to know what to do in this case or in that case, how to act under these circumstances. As we have listened to their questions, we have remembered what the Lord said here in the preface to the revelations. He said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/closing-remarks.p20" guid="7b84dcc6-e05a-4d14-96ef-aa0c3aa97f91" pid="Qg4MTe9pu0KKQ2Q_3r9jow" hash="6x_FHw">“And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people.” And then he continued, “What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.14,38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:14, 38</a>.)</p>

Where are you going to go to hear and find out what the Lord wants you to do today? The Lord declared again:</p>

And then he added, “If we didn’t have the Book of Mormon and the revelations of God, we would have nothing.” (See <span class="emphasis">DHC, </span>vol. 2, p. 52.)</p>

If you want to know what the Lord would have the Saints know and to have his guidance and direction for the next six months, get a copy of the proceedings of this conference, and you will have the latest word of the Lord as far as the Saints are concerned.
