It was on that April morning that I heard my name read as one presented for your sustaining vote as a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles. It became my obligation to stand with those other living men who have been called as special witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the earth.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p2" guid="fe02d1e6-5e1c-4c0f-b1b5-d73ded453641" pid="sANGDmhOTEmP_6-RwbII5A" hash="P19gCA">You must have wondered, as I did, why this call should come to me. It seemed accidental at times, that I was preserved in worthiness, yet there was always the constant, quiet, lingering feeling about being guided and being prepared.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p3" guid="dcc09a27-2488-4724-b8e3-ad2d5f987a1e" pid="-ib-Khp-I0Cxi6SDxADEeg" hash="eg9qRQ">It has been our privilege this morning to raise our hands to sustain the President of the Church. I count that a great privilege and special obligation, for I have a witness about him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p4" guid="0e326053-893b-4edb-9997-737effa2fd06" pid="K_LrBkOJtkyn3BkuoJy_tw" hash="HGvBdg">Some weeks before the meeting of last April, I left the office one Friday afternoon thinking of the weekend conference assignment. I waited for the elevator to come down from the fifth floor.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p5" guid="aeca7c5c-bec9-4118-bbbc-80f6a82ec7e4" pid="8ZmV8ZRYeEinrPsYyPH3lQ" hash="LVou7g">As the elevator doors quietly opened, there stood President Joseph Fielding Smith. There was a moment of surprise in seeing him, since his office is on a lower floor.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p6" guid="37fdbdaa-ade3-414d-8986-92cff3f10124" pid="AOT-n1_ozkaCw3sKL8ZVOg" hash="c197qg">As I saw him framed in the doorway, there fell upon me a powerful witness—there stands the prophet of God. That sweet voice of Spirit that is akin to light, that has something to do with pure intelligence, affirmed to me that this was the prophet of God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p7" guid="ed15cc30-9408-4763-8d89-a59e8936fea9" pid="hrXRo2CVN0a0R1IpUTeqeA" hash="j76Vqw">I need not try to define that experience to Latter-day Saints. That kind of witness is characteristic of this church. It is not something reserved to those in high office. It is a witness, not only available but vital, to every member.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p8" guid="96a39528-d35f-46dc-bfb1-62342ef948dd" pid="P8aCf-9tM0-ldWVZezpHPA" hash="L_nM7Q">As it is with the President, so it is with his counselors.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p9" guid="55ec9f18-89cc-4f6f-ae29-3598999e11ce" pid="pkvxy2pNMk-VAUOwYaiHUw" hash="RYTVlA">North of us in the Wasatch Range stand three mountain peaks. The poet would describe them as mighty pyramids of stone. The center one, the highest of the three, the map would tell you is Willard Peak. But the pioneers called them “The Presidency.” If you should go to Willard, look to the east, and up, way up, there stands “The Presidency.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p10" guid="46d6d0bf-d822-45d3-abe3-bef569e2e2a3" pid="HIfFwcclAUmonoiOlK38vA" hash="U8L5aw">Thank God for the presidency. Like those peaks, they stand with nothing above them but the heavens. They need our sustaining vote. It is sometimes lonely in those lofty callings of leadership—for their calling is not to please man, but to please the Lord. God bless these three great and good men.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p11" guid="5bf64cce-8409-4fba-9767-9262dea2e553" pid="ss5KET6_Y0O4DwjeHPDLrw" hash="u3HHpQ">Occasionally during the past year I have been asked a question. Usually it comes as a curious, almost an idle, question about the qualifications to stand as a witness for Christ. The question they ask is, “Have you seen Him?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p12" guid="eb1e673c-6f3b-495d-a49f-f3e9767ec284" pid="sdpU9l8tHEeWx2geE1sflA" hash="HLyKTQ">That is a question that I have never asked of another. I have not asked that question of my brethren in the Quorum, thinking that it would be so sacred and so personal that one would have to have some special inspiration, indeed, some authorization, even to ask it.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p13" guid="f8b10990-0ef8-409d-8a7f-63649f589c88" pid="_qS-1xfMK06MWpkQgnbvkw" hash="wWzxlA">There are some things just too sacred to discuss. We know that as it relates to the temples. In our temples, sacred ordinances are performed; sacred experiences are enjoyed. And yet we do not, because of the nature of them, discuss them outside those sacred walls.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p14" guid="90095e4b-2ed5-4359-bb94-949b4c7edaa9" pid="r7_enQwWjEGZIm-72S6Z3Q" hash="CzRorw">It is not that they are secret, but they are sacred; not to be discussed, but to be harbored and to be protected and regarded with the deepest of reverence.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p15" guid="801d0408-e661-4ab9-9a1d-2a37627680c7" pid="OMY55scFukukF4fkvZ8CeQ" hash="QPyxag">I have come to know what the prophet Alma meant:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p16" guid="8282ca7e-ac84-47ed-b36a-95c4fee90b6e" pid="yhc8c2xasUmvHCiUjQRkfA" hash="s03g1A">“… It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p17" guid="fba04060-bb29-44c9-ba38-e5c9251b2faa" pid="wPnq5jC7NUqwyIq1hhzZYg" hash="d-3Zrg">“And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.9-10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:9–10</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p18" guid="5870864a-096e-4009-8f52-1c88d3d54843" pid="9jjKsdg2rUOZRk9So8ulbQ" hash="j7jCjA">There are those who hear testimonies borne in the Church, by those in high station and by members in the wards and branches, all using the same words—“I know that God lives; I know that Jesus is the Christ,” and come to question, “Why cannot it be said in plainer words? Why aren’t they more explicit and more descriptive? Cannot the apostles say more?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p19" guid="800ec543-c8d9-4f3a-a3fc-0960a6f27bb8" pid="Cc8Nd7-Ge0WOay3XgUBdnw" hash="zYKN3Q">How like the sacred experience in the temple becomes our personal testimony. It is sacred, and when we are wont to put it into words, we say it in the same way—all using the same words. The apostles declare it in the same phrases with the little Primary or Sunday School youngster. “I know that God lives and I know that Jesus is the Christ.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p20" guid="84575d71-0673-4d8d-8c80-64859b28e0b5" pid="M-S-APZ1wke4Aw_AZvLxOg" hash="m6Drfg">We would do well not to disregard the testimonies of the prophets or of the children, for “he imparteth his words by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many times which confound the wise and the learned.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:23</a>.)</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p22" guid="89cb51dc-4eeb-42b0-9134-410cbe95c750" pid="0pvPvukFiUmdu3DPaWBmgA" hash="2XZPBA">The bearing of a testimony is akin to a declaration of love. The romantics and poets and couples in love, from the beginning of time, have sought more impressive ways of saying it, or singing it, or writing it. They have used all of the adjectives, all of the superlatives, all manner of poetic expression. And when all is said and done, the declaration which is most powerful is the simple, three-word variety.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p23" guid="3b1df0ca-6a14-4d32-b6f6-db150d2ba7ce" pid="WdWIVuJ9Ike0uL-te1Fv0A" hash="xI8VpQ">To one who is honestly seeking, the testimony borne in these simple phrases is enough, for it is the spirit that beareth record, not the words.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p24" guid="818708ac-52d5-49d5-accb-53c476cad66b" pid="oBNWt5j0g0iQ4uXOTYaPIg" hash="-bCAHQ">There is a power of communication as real and tangible as electricity. Man has devised the means to send images and sound through the air to be caught on an antenna and reproduced and heard and seen. This other communication may be likened to that, save it be a million times more powerful, and the witness it brings is always the truth.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p25" guid="f2b9bf17-8d27-41a6-8bbf-080bafe78578" pid="OFuokeaWVkWmSaWsynfy7w" hash="Sm5TLw">There is a process by which pure intelligence can flow, by which we can come to know of a surety, nothing doubting.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p26" guid="da0d36b4-60ec-4622-bf77-7e15a46ae8cf" pid="TNaXPkLFRUKfbsRx_NTckQ" hash="kb0pjg">I said there was a question that could not be taken lightly nor answered at all without the prompting of the Spirit. I have not asked that question of others, but I have heard them answer it—but not when they were asked. They have answered it under the prompting of the Spirit, on sacred occasions, when “the Spirit beareth record.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.39" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:39</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p27" guid="42492660-7c4f-40fd-bf51-ddaefee46d97" pid="S-PlQU5KEkOfgG2q_JufZg" hash="RfFPNw">I have heard one of my brethren declare: “I know from experiences, too sacred to relate, that Jesus is the Christ.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p28" guid="07dd4285-b8f8-4590-9576-c0cb394f3490" pid="CcTV4RRuA0W60VSQ1L74rw" hash="TmEcBA">I have heard another testify: “I know that God lives; I know that the Lord lives. And more than that, I know the Lord.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p29" guid="7c0046c8-3561-415c-809f-ea6c04a47247" pid="a_imgcEoW0KTL9ddZBKAdg" hash="JZsaSg">It was not their words that held the meaning or the power. It was the Spirit. “… for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.1" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 33:1</a>.)</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p31" guid="2f2a35ff-fba8-406d-9558-0f0512e49a15" pid="-cT_K1JrZEeTr2SrtMujBA" hash="dlQUZQ">I have come to know that the witness does not come by seeking after signs. It comes through fasting and prayer, through activity and testing and obedience. It comes through sustaining the servants of the Lord and following them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-spirit-beareth-record.p32" guid="dba40ab9-682e-48aa-aea0-84202044c78d" pid="5ehr0n9OpECQiXvTG-_X3w" hash="LqYnPg">Karl G. Maeser was taking a group of missionaries across the Alps. As they reached a summit, he stopped. Gesturing back down the trail to some poles set in the snow to mark the way across the glacier, he said, “Brethren, there stands the Priesthood. They are just common sticks like the rest of us … but the position they hold makes them what they are to us. If we step aside from the path they mark, we are lost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

There are so many qualifications that I lack. There is so much in my effort to serve that is wanting. As I have pondered on it, I have come to only one single thing, one qualification in which there may be cause, and that is, I have <span class="emphasis">that </span>witness.</p>

I know that he lives. He was born in the meridian of time. He taught his gospel, was tried, was crucified. He rose on the third day. He was the first fruits of the resurrection. He has a body of flesh and bone. Of this I bear testimony. Of him I am a witness. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Always as we meet we find a common question that confronts us. Members of the Church, especially our missionaries, often hear this statement: “If there is anything I resent, it is those that say they are right and everybody else is wrong.” They object, of course, to the declaration concerning the exclusive delegation of authority in this church.</p>

Nevertheless, I would say to him: “Hold on, think for a moment. Surely you can’t believe that in the great confusing variety of religious beliefs, not one of them is true, is right.”</p>

If there is a typical response to our missionaries, it is, “I already have a church. One is just as good as another and it doesn’t matter really which one we belong to, or if we belong to any. We will all end up in the same place anyway.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p5" guid="f5f65fb4-c204-4361-8b8a-a5e2f5eac094" pid="kuIiC2UFQUG3mrRiDG0B9Q" hash="GdR15w">Surely no one who really thinks would hold to that position. Nevertheless, many people accept it when they would not for a moment apply it or relate it to any other phase of their life. They would not, for instance, take the same position with regard to education. Who would not smile at a statement that all schools are alike, that one is just as good as another, and that a person deserves the same diploma no matter which school he attends, or which course he takes, or for how long?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p6" guid="9fd227c6-d1c6-49f6-86da-de6a10800268" pid="IUnQNjLUakSbHBu0ld3EMA" hash="SkRWKw">Would you agree to send students to just any school, taking any variety of courses, and then award them specialized degrees, anything they wanted—in architecture, law, medicine? Such an attitude would suggest that a man would be just as good a surgeon by not studying for it as he would by following the prerequisite courses. No person who has given it real substantial thought would take such a position, and neither you nor I would want to be under the knife of a surgeon who had been trained, or maybe I should say “untrained,” in such a pattern.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p7" guid="fe9d404b-ee84-4455-bece-7d6d27722874" pid="vn7RXjlhpEqBiscgz9NphA" hash="L6CvUA">Isn’t it strange, then, that so many are able to apply such a view toward religion. They advocate: Go to any school, take any course, or go to no school at all, and we’ll all end up in the same place with the same heavenly diploma.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p8" guid="5c0651e9-052c-4776-bc43-db0024f1b36f" pid="U_hukd_m1UakjQSPDnS7OA" hash="x5QiSA">That just isn’t reasonable, nor is it true.</p>

Perhaps it would be more convenient and palatable and popular if we were to avoid it; nevertheless, we are under a sacred obligation and a sacred trust to hold to it. It is not merely an admission; it is a positive declaration. It is so fundamental that we cannot yield on this point.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p10" guid="b2cf64b6-929d-43bf-a415-733d514284b9" pid="iRLE4nPF5EWv2T-f2xx7gQ" hash="wbynVA">Now to those who think us uncharitable, we say that it was not devised by us; it was declared by Him, for he gave commandments to the early brethren, and I quote:</p>

They have some truth—some of them very much of it. They have a form of godliness. Often the clergy and adherents are not without dedication, and many of them practice remarkably well the virtues of Christianity. They are, nonetheless, incomplete. By his declaration, “… they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:19</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p14" guid="7b332495-99eb-4a5e-89bd-57f2f8e3ae9b" pid="aRfEIhsqok68SRIYdYHpvg" hash="dJBnQA">How shortsighted it is, then, to choose a single key and endlessly tap out the monotony of a single note, or even two or three notes, when the full keyboard of limitless harmony can be played.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p15" guid="d8dfae92-83e6-4b15-a873-625235c99ba0" pid="LSiwAu_Uh0eLnDByQrbBpQ" hash="Bc_9Yg">How disappointing when the fullness of the gospel, the whole keyboard, is here upon the earth, that many churches tap on a single key. The note they stress may be essential to a complete harmony of religious experience, but it is, nonetheless, not all there is. It isn’t the fullness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p16" guid="8bd8a9be-8bf8-4107-9606-01fc459d97cf" pid="DKD-GfdI4kaFI5oGWIm4JQ" hash="KmxR4A">For instance, one taps on the key of faith healing, to the neglect of many principles that would bring greater strength than faith healing itself. Another taps on an obscure key relating to the observance of the Sabbath—a key that would sound different indeed, played in harmony with the essential notes on the keyboard. A key used like that can get completely out of tune. Another repeats endlessly the key that relates to the mode of baptism and taps one or two other keys as though there were not a full keyboard. And again, the very key he uses, essential as it is, just doesn’t sound complete when played alone to the neglect of the others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p17" guid="17a37b6c-1964-4ed9-b595-fb2da38a8f2b" pid="25GAjIPfh0SDf0K7V5JEug" hash="YegGrw">There are other examples, many of them where parts of the gospel are endlessly stressed and the churches build upon them, until alone they sound nothing like they would if blended with the full measure of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We don’t say that the key of faith healing, for example, is not essential. We not only recognize it—we rely on it and experience it; but it is not the gospel itself, nor its fullness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p18" guid="f1ef0f41-4095-4a9e-af6f-728b7f307ecd" pid="WXEB25D2x02oZZ2Np5c2AQ" hash="T7Da4w">We would never hold that baptism is not essential, absolutely essential, for it constitutes the official enrollment in the church and kingdom of God. If that key, however, is played alone, without the counterpart key of authority, the fullness and the harmony are gone and it becomes dissonant. And without the key of faith and of repentance, it is meaningless, and perhaps worse, it is counterfeit. This happens when the authority we speak of is lacking.</p>

The fullness of the gospel has been restored. The power and the authority to act for Him is present with us. The power and the authority of the priesthood rests upon this church. The Lord revealed:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p20" guid="331f6c45-b33f-41b8-96e4-9a357d713c90" pid="3E7xxYYoJ0ecL_-P19J4-w" hash="SBy9WA">“… this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God.</p>

The Christian churches that should be the bulwark against it seem to provide little substance for their members or for their clergy. And we see the frightening specter of empty churches and a clergy promoting causes they, above all, should resist.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p24" guid="c6d53e97-eacc-4869-ae9d-c00fd85a2682" pid="YBDYsMzsokG3kcLAWwPoBA" hash="3JJ4mA">In these last travels I mentioned, it has been frightening to me to see the churches closed, boarded up, with weeds growing in the yard, or open but empty. We face the frightening thought of a generation raised without any contact with scripture.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p26" guid="a0445930-7585-4640-83f0-b4511793bb40" pid="HYUc07Zuc0O7uAZNtKXxfw" hash="yvm8qA">They become attracted by a single key, a doctrine, often one to which they take immediate exception and object to. They investigate it by itself alone. They want to know all there is about it without reference, in fact, with specific objection and rejection, to anything else.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p27" guid="c9614cb3-a148-4bc4-80c3-3a12e728927a" pid="PRJ05W1GJEGzq5kEloPePw" hash="q2G_GA">They want to hear that key played over and over again. It will give them little knowledge unless they see that there is a fullness—other complementary ideals and doctrines that present a warmth and a harmony, and a fullness, that draw at the right moment upon each key, which if played alone might seem discordant.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-only-true-and-living-church.p28" guid="8f05c3a1-38fa-4b95-b1b2-bc520ed12a17" pid="mq-lcakUAkeW8zplWsCP_w" hash="pgLkOg">Now that danger is not limited to investigators alone. Some members of the Church who should know better pick out a hobby key or two and tap them incessantly, to the irritation of those around them. They can dull their own spiritual sensitivities. They lose track that there is a fullness of the gospel and become as individuals, like many churches have become. They may reject the fullness in preference to a favorite note. This becomes exaggerated and distorted, leading them away into apostasy.</p>

More than that, I would urge you to pray about this matter. Thinking alone can be the basis for man’s wisdom. There is another more perfect manner of communication through the spirit: “… for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:10</a>.)</p>

That is how it all began, you know, with a fourteen-year-old boy who went into a grove. Two questions: Which of all the churches is true? and Which should he join? There he experienced a marvelous vision of the Father and the Son, and the dispensation of the fulness of times was ushered in. Subsequently the authority to act for Him was restored and rests yet with this church. We heard in this meeting a prophet of God, Joseph Fielding Smith.</p>

Because he loved you, he was anxious for your happiness and for your eternal growth. He wanted you to be able to choose freely and to grow through the power of correct choice, so that you may become much as he is. To achieve this, it was necessary for us to leave his presence. Something like going away to school. A plan was presented, and each agreed to leave the presence of our Heavenly Father to experience life in mortality.</p>

One, we would receive a mortal body, created in the image of God. Through it, by proper control, we might achieve eternal life and happiness. Two, we would be tried and tested in such a way that we could grow in strength and in spiritual power.</p>

This gift was to be used only within the sacred bonds of marriage. Through the exercise of this power of creation, a mortal body may be conceived, a spirit enter into it, and a new soul born into this life.</p>

We sang as the opening hymn in that meeting “How Gentle God’s Commands.” Later, in a prayer, President Lee included this phrase from the hymn: “Beneath his watchful eye, His saints securely dwell.” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 67.) He then reverently gave thanks to the Almighty for the security and protection of his saints, and in that prayer he invited a continuation of that watch-care over them.</p>

I think I was about six or seven years old. My brother and I (we were about the same age) walked to the stake conference together.

There was a man speaking at the pulpit, Elder George Albert Smith. He was a member of the Council of the Twelve at that time. I do not remember what he said, whether he was talking about the Word of Wisdom, or about repentance, or about baptism. But somehow while he was speaking it was fixed in my little-boy mind that there stood a servant of the Lord. I have never lost that testimony or that feeling. In my mind I came to know that he was an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

Music can be used to exalt and inspire or to carry messages of degradation and destruction. It is therefore important that as Latter-day Saints we at all times apply the principles of the gospel and seek the guidance of the Spirit in selecting the music with which we surround ourselves.” (<span class="emphasis">Priesthood Bulletin, </span>August, 1973.)</p>

Such music has little virtue and it is repellent to the Spirit of God.</p>

We could hardly set up a roulette table in the Church amusement hall for gambling purposes, with the excuse that if we do not provide it the youth would go to a gambling hall to gamble. We can never really hold our youth thus. Our task is to help the home to plant better standards in the minds of the youth.”</p>

Then overamplified sounds of hard music are introduced and an influence pours into the room that is repellent to the Spirit of God.</p>

Instinctively, the child will grip it more tightly and perhaps be injured. The wise parent will trade him for it—some equally appealing, but harmless object, given in exchange, so that he lets go willingly and without tears.</p>

We have, in this conference, sustained a new prophet, seer, and revelator. I am so grateful that we have a prophet authorized to receive revelation from God.</p>

It is shared by the General Authorities. And across the world, local leaders constantly report of the guidance that they receive when they have decisions to make or when needing further light and knowledge.</p>

And of course each of us, if we will live for it, may be the recipient of spiritual communications for our own personal guidance.</p>

And together with the sacred history that surrounds their being given they constitute the scripture. The Bible is, of course, the best known example. In the Church we do something that very few do any more: We read the Bible.</p>

We got them from somewhere. We say, “Handle them; read them; test them. See for yourself.” Unfortunately, most men are reluctant even to examine them.</p>

He put the stone on display to the public free of charge, and everyone took sides. A psychologist showed, by citing some famous case studies, that the young man was suffering from a well-known form of delusion. An historian showed that other men have also claimed to have found diamonds in fields and have been deceived. A geologist proved that there were no diamonds in the area but only quartz: The young man had been fooled by a quartz. When asked to inspect the stone itself, the geologist declined with a weary, tolerant smile, and a kindly shake of the head. An English professor showed that the young man in describing his stone used the very same language that others had used in describing uncut diamonds: He was, therefore, simply speaking the common language of his time. A sociologist showed that only three out of 177 florists’ assistants in four major cities believed the stone was genuine. A clergyman wrote a book to show that it was not the young man but someone else who had found the stone.</p>

Experts on diamonds were called in. Some of them declared it genuine. The others made nervous jokes about it and declared that they could not very well jeopardize their dignity and reputations by appearing to take the thing too seriously. To hide the bad impression thus made, someone came out with the theory that the stone was really a synthetic diamond, very skillfully made, but a fake just the same. The objection to this is that the production of a good synthetic diamond, for the farm boy, would have been an even more remarkable feat than the finding of a real one.” (<span class="emphasis">Lehi in the Desert and the World of the Jaredites,</span> Bookcraft, 1952, pp. 136–37.)</p>

These theories, which have been advanced, for the most part, by people who have never so much as read the books, generally group themselves under the idea that Joseph Smith produced them; that Joseph Smith authored them himself. He, then, deserves the blame.</p>

This I cannot accept, for this would make him a genius beyond all measurements. I do not believe he was that. To assume that he produced them without help and without inspiration is preposterous.</p>

He was a conduit through which the revelations were given. He was otherwise an ordinary man, as were the prophets in ancient times and as are the prophets in our day.</p>

They cite these changes, of which there are many examples, as though they themselves were announcing revelation. As though they were the only ones that knew of them.</p>

Simply because by comparison they are so insignificant, and unimportant as literally to be not worth talking about. After all, they have absolutely nothing to do with whether the books are true.</p>

Each becomes evidence, as Paul said, “the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.14" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:14</a>.)</p>

If you think it will yield to a casual inquiry, to idle curiosity, or even to well-intentioned but temporary searching, you are mistaken. It likewise will not yield to the overzealous or to the fanatic.</p>

Do not belittle the possibility that many humble folk, young and old, possess such a testimony. Many possess a testimony that transcends the knowledge to be gained in academic and scientific fields. When a humble man bears testimony based on spiritual inquiry and righteous living, be careful before you repudiate his witness because he is otherwise unlearned.</p>

To proceed on that way, these two things emerge as being very fixed. First, in His name rests the authority to secure the salvation of mankind. “For there is none other name under heaven given … whereby we must be saved.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/4.12" class="scriptureRef">Acts 4:12</a>.) And next, there is an essential ordinance—baptism—standing as a gate through which every soul must pass to obtain eternal life.</p>

This ideal was clear in the minds of His apostles also, and their preaching provided for one way, and one way only, for men to save themselves.</p>

This became very hard to explain. Perhaps they thought it to be generous to admit that there are other ways. So they tempered or tampered with the doctrine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-redemption-of-the-dead.p5" pid="UFLoVyrNAEWOLLfVROnf2g" hash="RKi9Pg">This rigid emphasis on “one Lord and one baptism,” was thought to be too restrictive, and too exclusive, even though the Lord Himself had described it as being narrow, for, “Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.14" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:14</a>.)</p>

The preaching of the gospel is evident to one degree or another in most Christian churches. Most, however, are content to enjoy whatever they can gain from membership in their church without any real effort to see that others hear about it.</p>

We will try to reach every living soul.”</p>

And that’s only part of the effort. Now I do not suggest that the number should be impressive, for we do not feel we are doing nearly as well as we should be. And more important than that, any one of them would be evidence enough if we knew the source of the individual conviction that each carries.</p>

There is a very provoking and a very disturbing question about those who died without baptism. What about them?

What power would establish one Lord and one baptism, and then allow it to be that most of the human family never comes within its influence? With that question unanswered, the vast majority of the human family must be admitted to be lost, and against any reasonable application of the law of justice or of mercy, either.

Revelation comes to individual members as they are led to discover their family records in ways that are miraculous indeed.

I quote a letter dated January the 17th, 1889, Safford, Graham County, in Arizona.

In order to teach a lesson not easily learned, I will relate an experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p2" pid="4HMgSSjSO0mfFJTiSxqvJw" hash="Quf3hw">I have always been interested in animals and birds and when I was a little boy and the other children wanted to play cowboy, I wanted to go on safari to Africa and would pretend I was hunting the wild animals.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p3" pid="GMM5_9K9C0ajzTzbV_T1OQ" hash="hQLoCg">When I learned to read, I found books about birds and animals and came to know much about them. By the time I was in my teens I could identify most of the African animals. I could tell a klipspringer from an impala, or a gemsbok from wildebeest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p4" pid="3uAmL7PqN0WhCW8YJEEcww" hash="8sw6uw">I always wanted to go to Africa and see the animals, and finally that opportunity came. Sister Packer and I were assigned to tour the South Africa Mission with President and Sister Howard Badger. We had a very strenuous schedule and had dedicated eight chapels in seven days, scattered across that broad continent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p5" pid="DyWRbUveZ0qvtGJnmdj00w" hash="BdoUVw">President Badger was vague about the schedule for September 10th. (That happens to be my birthday.) We were in Rhodesia, planning, I thought, to return to Johannesburg, South Africa. But he had other plans, and we landed at Victoria Falls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p6" pid="I7jKAko-j0eYrxkv6qinkg" hash="MYNq9w">“There is a game reserve some distance from here,” he explained, “and I have rented a car, and tomorrow, your birthday, we are going to spend seeing the African animals.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p7" pid="730dRQTPzE-JrRQji7dptw" hash="d_Jsqw">Now I might explain that the game reserves in Africa are unusual. The people are put in cages, and the animals are left to run free. That is, there are compounds where the park visitors check in at night and are locked behind high fences until after daylight they are allowed to drive about, but no one is allowed out of his car.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p8" pid="u4n8phHfF0uuJmuSve5BVw" hash="6MBb_w">We arrived in the park in the late afternoon. By some mistake, there were not enough cabins for all the visitors, and they were all taken when we arrived. The head ranger indicated that they had a cabin in an isolated area about eight miles from the compound and we could spend the night there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p9" pid="cDK87VKc7kWXrH4SgRAjrg" hash="Ny-DQg">Because of a delay in getting our evening meal, it was long after dark when we left the compound. We found the turnoff and had gone up the narrow road just a short distance when the engine stalled. We found a flashlight and I stepped out to check under the hood, thinking that there must be a loose connection or something. As the light flashed on the dusty road, the first thing I saw was lion tracks!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p10" pid="A4JgvzKQ1kmHZE7kbeARMw" hash="DWOY5g">Back in the car, we determined to content ourselves with spending the night there! Fortunately, however, an hour or two later we were rescued by the driver of a gas truck who had left the compound late because of a problem. We awakened the head ranger and in due time we were settled in our cabin. In the morning they brought us back to the compound.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p11" pid="6p4jrFXucEC77SBv3HXvlg" hash="FBG3XA">We had no automobile, and without telephones there was no way to get a replacement until late in the day. We faced the disappointment of sitting around the compound all day. Our one day in the park was ruined and, for me, the dream of a lifetime was gone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p12" pid="5zXZvWeKakOLXLoypAxpSw" hash="RMX3Fw">I talked with a young ranger, and he was surprised that I knew many of the African birds. Then he volunteered to rescue us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p13" pid="yg9LXGPbmEuYkQ7wiHs6-w" hash="Rgpvgw">“We are building a new lookout over a water hole about twenty miles from the compound,” he said. “It is not quite finished, but it is safe. I will take you out there with a lunch, and when your car comes late this afternoon we will bring it out to you. You may see as many animals, or even more, than if you were driving around.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p14" pid="CpxzVYOkRUyrtfh62s-3jg" hash="wA8TiQ">On the way to the lookout he volunteered to show us some lions. He turned off through the brush and before long located a group of seventeen lions all sprawled out asleep and drove right up among them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p15" pid="_fghEB4ook60zu3RYBb6_w" hash="jI1Lig">We stopped at a water hole to watch the animals come to drink. It was very dry that season and there was not much water, really just muddy spots. When the elephants stepped into the soft mud the water would seep into the depression and the animals would drink from the elephant tracks.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p16" pid="0zgee-Ev4EauV4W6fREo_g" hash="_2Dl-Q">The antelope, particularly, were very nervous. They would approach the mud hole, only to turn and run away in great fright. I could see there were no lions about and asked the guide why they didn’t drink. His answer, and this is the lesson, was “Crocodiles.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p17" pid="eX2EvZS3_0ivoos-WKl-0g" hash="g9kMFg">I knew he must be joking and asked him seriously, “What is the problem?” The answer again: “Crocodiles.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p18" pid="uKALowaFcEifPjW36wjdzg" hash="JSy5BA">“Nonsense,” I said. “There are no crocodiles out there. Anyone can see that.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p19" pid="sMM57HnD2Uee9o_CX0l_VA" hash="Z8cQTw">I thought he was having some fun at the expense of his foreign game expert, and finally I asked him to tell us the truth. Now I remind you that I was not uninformed. I had read many books. Besides, anyone would know that you can’t hide a crocodile in an elephant track.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p20" pid="4td5rE-Z1E-3jh83PqjGkg" hash="UsVfqg">He could tell I did not believe him and determined, I suppose, to teach me a lesson. We drove to another location where the car was on an embankment above the muddy hole where we could look down. “There,” he said. “See for yourself.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p21" pid="QCZ5EjZojEGHKYyGajRZ9A" hash="XoE6ZQ">I couldn’t see anything except the mud, a little water, and the nervous animals in the distance. Then all at once I saw it!—a large crocodile, settled in the mud, waiting for some unsuspecting animal to get thirsty enough to come for a drink.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p22" pid="NKbhvUqmGUylWUXJ1h0Zyg" hash="9Jjhjw">Suddenly I became a believer! When he could see I was willing to listen, he continued with the lesson. “There are crocodiles all over the park,” he said, “not just in the rivers. We don’t have any water without a crocodile somewhere near it, and you’d better count on it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p23" pid="HMGuQBEPoUOUtdStdUyw0w" hash="Io_8nA">The guide was kinder to me than I deserved. My “know-it-all” challenge to his first statement, “crocodiles,” might have brought an invitation, “Well, go out and see for yourself!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p24" pid="Hc1HdGUHske1LFGpTUVTUA" hash="EFIXsw">I could see for myself that there were no crocodiles. I was so sure of myself I think I might have walked out just to see what was there. Such an arrogant approach could have been fatal! But he was patient enough to teach me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p25" pid="WSpJVVrdO0yZX1jtVwQMDQ" hash="bdMCYQ">My young friends, I hope you’ll be wiser in talking to your guides than I was on that occasion. That smart-aleck idea that I knew everything really wasn’t worthy of me, nor is it worthy of you. I’m not very proud of it, and I think I’d be ashamed to tell you about it except that telling you may help you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p26" pid="Kp_By7QwTki_xsIyFOh0VA" hash="6zM01A">Those ahead of you in life have probed about the water holes a bit and raise a voice of warning about crocodiles. Not just the big, gray lizards that can bite you to pieces, but <span class="emphasis">spiritual crocodiles,</span> infinitely more dangerous, and more deceptive and less visible, even, than those well-camouflaged reptiles of Africa.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p27" pid="c2HksJJFmk2vMRH80EvGDw" hash="e0ZKhQ">These spiritual crocodiles can kill or mutilate your souls. They can destroy your peace of mind and the peace of mind of those who love you. Those are the ones to be warned against, and there is hardly a watering place in all of mortality now that is not infested with them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p28" pid="kO9X4qVJ_k-VV0mQvdLAMQ" hash="D4KulA">On another trip to Africa I discussed this experience with a game ranger in another park. He assured me that you can <span class="emphasis">indeed</span> hide a crocodile in an elephant track—one big enough to bite a man in two.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p29" pid="m_FQzqEfCEaR8-1qnziX0A" hash="YG91EQ">He then showed me a place where a tragedy had occurred. A young man from England was working in the hotel for the season. In spite of constant and repeated warnings, he went through the compound fence to check something across a shallow splash of water that didn’t cover his tennis shoes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p30" pid="OEuPkNKHYEe6nX93mwW4LQ" hash="7QwdaA">“He wasn’t two steps in,” the ranger said, “before a crocodile had him, and we could do nothing to save him.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p31" pid="iPhTvHYBgk-Bsc5HVGQ9ng" hash="Dv0vbA">It seems almost to be against our natures, particularly when we are young, to accept much guidance from others. But, young people, there are times when, regardless of how much we think we know or how much we think we want to do something, that our very existence depends on paying attention to the guides.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p32" pid="kTuy9dTZrEOoMBaPwwyGzg" hash="GY72jQ">Now, it is a gruesome thing to think about that young man who was eaten by the crocodile. But that is not, by any means, the worst thing that could happen. There are moral and spiritual things far worse even than the thought of being chewed to pieces by a monstrous lizard.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p33" pid="zJD8yk46YEun9uX-bM4Y8g" hash="U1V5cQ">Fortunately there are guides enough in life to prevent these things from happening if we are willing to take counsel now and again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p34" pid="pO-Cp9qmX0S2jiMHz72VHA" hash="XV1WBQ">Some of us are appointed now, as you will be soon, to be guides and rangers. Now we don’t use those titles very much. We go under the titles of parents—father and mother—bishop, leader, adviser. Our assignment is to see that you get through mortality without being injured by these spiritual crocodiles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p35" pid="B59CaZjec0iIMaJB4ysxzg" hash="Ow-tOw">All of the training and activity in the Church has as its central purpose a desire to see you, our young people, free and independent and secure, both spiritually and temporally.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p36" pid="LkK00rOLNU6OqisA6XlvuA" hash="MQMq4w">If you will listen to the counsel of your parents and your teachers and your leaders when you are young, you can learn how to follow the best guide of all—the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. That is individual revelation. There is a process through which we can be alerted to spiritual dangers. Just as surely as that guide warned me, you can receive signals alerting you to the spiritual crocodiles that lurk ahead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p37" pid="YF44ew8epUuSUVWilGKe_w" hash="aEL3sA">If we can train you to listen to these spiritual communications, you will be protected from these crocodiles of life. You can learn what it feels like to be guided from on high. This inspiration can come to you now, in all of your activities, in school, and dating—not just in your Church assignments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p38" pid="eLvBl7OHD0CPuDloelcynA" hash="Zm0R0g">Learn how to pray and how to receive answers to your prayers. When you pray over some things, you must patiently wait a long, long time before you will receive an answer. Some prayers, for your own safety, must be answered immediately, and some promptings will even come when you haven’t prayed at all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p39" pid="-u6_k5E_K0Ka5rDSxJ2t9w" hash="B2uLew">Once you really determine to follow that guide, your testimony will grow and you will find provisions set out along the way in unexpected places, as evidence that someone knew that you would be traveling that way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p40" pid="ilT3U9uI50K6SYBRUksaGA" hash="WPMmLQ">The basic exercise for you to perform in your youth to become spiritually strong and to become independent lies in obedience to your guides. If you will follow them and do it willingly, you can learn to trust those delicate, sensitive, spiritual promptings. You will learn that they always, invariably, lead you to do that which is righteous.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p41" pid="mfxNlHpF6EaDSCNeVvJivg" hash="qW95JQ">Now, my young friends, I would like to make reference to another experience, one I think of often but one I seldom talk about. I shall not mention it in detail; I only want to refer to it. It happened many years ago when I was perhaps not quite as young as you are now, and it had to do with my decision to follow that guide.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/spiritual-crocodiles.p42" pid="FQqgz82jikqQt-NvVQ1imA" hash="lj0Ang">I knew what agency was and knew how important it was to be individual and to be independent, to be free.

There were in attendance twelve sisters. We sang the hymns of Zion from song books—words without music—printed nearly fifty years ago. The spiritual living lesson was reverently given from the pages of a handmade manual.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p2" pid="_-ep7-kp7kuaN9Y1EokkXA" hash="E2I8FA">I told those sisters that they belonged to the largest, and by all measure, the greatest women’s organization on earth. I quoted the Prophet Joseph Smith when he and the Brethren organized the Relief Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p3" pid="ciRHqtAx80-b216hsZiUDA" hash="ONyZsQ">“I now turn the key in [behalf of all women].”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p7" pid="rNlCyKpW3kGye4XUlO_2uA" hash="JBzyAw">The Spirit was in that meeting! And when the meeting closed, the lovely sister who had conducted with gentility and reverence wept openly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p8" pid="FOdUYfxJpkSociBiRjqy6Q" hash="S93RYw">I then told them about you, and they were strengthened. I spoke of the assignment to speak to you here tonight and asked if they had a message for you. Several of them made notes; each expression, every one, was in the spirit of sending something to you—not of asking something from you. One of them said, “A small circle of sisters send their own hearts and thoughts to all the sisters and begs the Lord to help us go forward.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p9" pid="qZuOeGVGKUCYDVzgBASw_A" hash="F36Hcg">Those words, “circle of sisters,” inspired me. I could see them standing in <span class="emphasis">your</span> circle. I caught then the vision of a great circle of sisters—the same vision the Apostles and prophets before us have had.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p10" pid="kNm7OEfsc063lgPeRd8LBw" hash="QoriIQ">That evening I stood, for a moment, in that circle and felt the impulses of faith and courage and love coming and going on either side. I remembered the sealing rooms of the temples. In some of them mirrors are placed on opposing walls. If you stand near the altar and look to either side, you can see a corridor of diminishing images. It gives one the feeling of looking into the infinite, into the eternities. You can see as far as you can see and you have the feeling that if you could move to the limit of your vision you could yet see on forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p11" pid="4v8iMsrK4UOdftyplNe41A" hash="f-y6uQ">I feel that here tonight, as I stand for a brief moment in your circle. Each sister, no matter where in that circle she stands, can look to either side and feel the spirit of inspiration coming back as she extends the gentle hand of charity to those on either side.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p12" pid="g3nlPOPTVUWPDWSIbPAPZw" hash="uqoa9Q">I am humbled beyond expression to know that the message I here enter into your circle can surge around the earth and come back, and go out once again. Can you imagine how deeply I desire to have that impulse a worthy one?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p13" pid="WXJ58GvSXU6Lj6VbmS35-g" hash="c0FCcg">The Relief Society, the Prophet told us, is organized after the pattern of the priesthood. When a man holds the priesthood, he belongs to something bigger than himself. It is something outside himself to which he can make a complete commitment. It requires full dedication and loyalty. There is connected with it an oath and a covenant.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p14" pid="xwVRMdqhOEWrc4LsWuIsyw" hash="LUYZ_Q">Membership in the priesthood magnifies the man and the boy. Wherever he is, whatever he does, no matter with whom he associates, he is expected to honor his priesthood. It is the commitment of his manhood to the highest standards of integrity. Attendance at quorum meetings on Sunday is but a part, even a small part, of his membership responsibilities. Through full activity in the priesthood every worthy desire may be achieved, every need of the man can be fulfilled.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p15" pid="pldQXUx1gUCSQR6aANnB2w" hash="qNWXfA">The brethren do not talk much of the needs of men; certainly they are not preoccupied with them. You may be surprised to learn that they are seldom discussed. Those needs are important, very important. So are the restraints that protect each holder of the priesthood and guide him to a complete fulfillment in life. But the brethren are not preoccupied with their needs. They are preoccupied with the <span class="emphasis">priesthood!</span> It is a worthy preoccupation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p16" pid="17-i4ph1wkCP8dnXjn_UPQ" hash="b80fLg">When the priesthood is organized and functions as it should, the worthy aspirations of all who have part in it are satisfied. Through the priesthood men can be trained in the proper relationship with all sisters—their wives and daughters and mothers. Priesthood is <span class="emphasis">the</span> cause for men and boys in the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p17" pid="NlysK4CrdEq97j3iOAiExA" hash="7d1jaQ">Relief Society is a great strength to the priesthood. Through it you will share in the privileges and blessings that belong to the priesthood. Indeed, the holders of the priesthood cannot have a fulness without you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p18" pid="9U2wx5VikkimOeCoYrXEnA" hash="5UPaOQ">If you sisters follow after that pattern, you will not be preoccupied with the needs of women. You will serve your organization, your cause—the Relief Society—this great circle of sisters. Your every need shall be fulfilled, now, and in the eternities; every neglect will be erased; every abuse will be corrected. All of this can come to you, and come quickly, when you devote yourself to Relief Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p19" pid="YZNihh0lcUm6XsaFyzCLIw" hash="STYkzw">Service in the Relief Society magnifies and sanctifies each individual sister. Your membership in Relief Society should be ever with you. When you devote yourself to the Relief Society and organize it and operate it and participate in it, you sustain the cause that will bless every woman who comes within its influence. You are organized, I remind you again, after the pattern of and under the authority of the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p20" pid="HgpIBety60W7w9y2mKkDPw" hash="6W1__w">During the study that concluded with the consolidated schedule, my main anxiety, and I expressed it in every discussion, was for the Relief Society. We had the concern that Relief Society might be regarded thereafter as little more than a Sunday class. That fear was not without some foundation, and I want to remind you—particularly you who are officers and teachers—that the Relief Society has very broad responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p21" pid="6oLGX0Lv7ki8yoeVHk5YTA" hash="RQaNqg">Attendance at the Sunday meeting is but a small part of your duty. Some of you have not understood this and have set aside much of what Relief Society has meant over the years—the sisterhood, the charitable and practical parts of it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p22" pid="u3aJSZyG70m2ZG0yq6ytyQ" hash="p-y6lw">You must gather them in again. You who lead this work must now find ways to bring back and to increase the sisterhood, the fraternal spirit of the Society. You must find ways to strengthen the charitable and the practical dimensions as well. Nothing must distract you from this. You will receive some suggestions about how this can be done without adding a second meeting every week.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p23" pid="ciwuwI1l2E-FYUB6tJMMtg" hash="rpoGzg">Many of you are not able to attend the Relief Society Sunday meeting because you are called to serve in the Primary or the Young Women. This, again, is according to the pattern. Many brethren serve the Aaronic Priesthood. Just as their service strengthens the Higher Priesthood, so your service will bless Relief Society. Do not feel denied; never complain. To unselfishly render this service is to show devotion to Relief Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p24" pid="WtAzeY33JECUaAhBMSAp1Q" hash="liIH_A">Then this great circle of sisters will be a protection for each of you and for your families. The Relief Society might be likened to a refuge—the place of safety and protection—the sanctuary of ancient times. You will be safe within it. It encircles each sister like a protecting wall.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p25" pid="F9lD3y1uLUWUXduOk-8fjg" hash="-o2fJA">Because it is your course of study this coming year, we turn to the Old Testament for a lesson. When the Israelites returned from their long captivity in Babylon, they found their city in ruins. The protecting walls of Jerusalem lay in rubble. Their enemies moved among them with great influence and the Israelites were subject to them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p26" pid="hXlCdCXjR06dh1suuOT5Uw" hash="ufxhSg">Then came Nehemiah the prophet, known now as “the wall builder.” He rallied the Israelites to their own defense. Under his direction they began to rebuild the wall.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p27" pid="-RgSBSccSk-qmZ_hKuVmbg" hash="b0_HnA">At first their enemies ridiculed them. Tobiah, the Ammonite, mocked them, saying, “Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/neh/4.3" class="scriptureRef">Neh. 4:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p28" pid="XmZbvycgzUWH3nM2hXxWLw" hash="vqN_Fw">But Nehemiah consoled his people and set to work. The enemy was everywhere. “Nevertheless,” he recorded, “we made [a] prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/neh/4.9" class="scriptureRef">Neh. 4:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p29" pid="MCMnCV1AoU-a-vEPPtiLpg" hash="ELxagg">Sisters, think carefully upon that. They “made a prayer,” and “set a watch,” and proceeded with their work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p30" pid="K3bv59Fom0aTclOLs31BjQ" hash="YOjK_Q">The day came when their enemies saw that the wall went up. It encircled the city. Finally no breach was left, save it be the place for the gates. What their enemies had ridiculed was nearly done. The wall now stood. No longer could their enemies threaten nor destroy. When their enemies saw that they grew strong, they worried, and they turned to other tactics.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p31" pid="MnM7PQy-BUOnbM9mAb4XnQ" hash="AVCtKg">And here is the lesson. It is a type, it is symbolic, it is a warning! In it is a message for every sister in Relief Society; for the general presidency and their board; for the stake and ward officers and teachers; indeed, for every member. Consider it very, very carefully.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p32" pid="mmLgmkU-00GUbkGr31bdlA" hash="Zbr33A">Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem sent for Nehemiah. “Come,” they enticed, “let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono.” They endeavored to draw him away from his work on the wall. But the prophet knew their hearts and said, “They thought to do me mischief.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/neh/6.2" class="scriptureRef">Neh. 6:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p33" pid="57zyvy9BTU6k4sOBEssv7w" hash="1V3Zzg">Five times they sent for him to come out to them. Their importuning came then, just as it comes now to us: “Come parley with us, come join our cause, come do things our way. Come out into the world and be part with us.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p34" pid="Tkysth_er0yYtDlwcBE5HA" hash="4OgEKQ">His answer to them holds counsel for every sister in Relief Society. It is a message as well to the brethren of the priesthood. “I sent messengers unto them,” Nehemiah recorded, “saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/neh/6.3" class="scriptureRef">Neh. 6:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p35" pid="tWQLZVSyC0qOzJltV6A9Bg" hash="2gzAyg">Sisters, you have a great work to do. Build Relief Society! Strengthen its organization! Do not be enticed to leave it and go down to the worldly plains of Ono.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p36" pid="BtRcyCTY00mkOJLcVCMXGw" hash="zgMNqw">Do not allow yourselves to be organized under another banner. Do not run to and fro seeking some cause to fulfill your needs. Your cause stands under the authority of the priesthood of Almighty God; that is the consummate, the ultimate power extant upon this earth!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p37" pid="OzrEpyZldkq1OSLFbQSaPw" hash="70UAhw">As I followed the history of your great organization, I came across a message to the Relief Society from the First Presidency of the Church, sent to them on the occasion of their centennial. Here is their message:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p38" pid="Swrv1cmubkaLgYjou_AUXw" hash="tGSkIg">“We ask our Sisters of the Relief Society never to forget that they are a unique organization in the whole world, for they were organized under the inspiration of the Lord. … No other woman’s organization in all the earth has had such a birth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p39" pid="tMHf02UHf0e_P7Yfw95FEA" hash="S5KY0A">“This divinely inspired origin brings with it a corresponding responsibility, in consecration to service, and in the loftiest loyalty to the Priesthood of God and to one another. The members should permit neither hostile nor competitive interests of any kind to detract from the duties and obligations, the privileges and honors, the opportunities and achievements of membership in this great Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p40" pid="OfyeHatirEGls6TCj0kdJw" hash="JlmimQ">“The prime, almost the exclusive allegiance of every member of this great group, runs … to their fellow members and to the organization. Members should permit no other affiliation either to interrupt or to interfere with the work of this Society. They should give to Relief Society service precedence over all social and other clubs and societies of similar kinds. We urge this because in the work of the Relief Society are intellectual, cultural, and spiritual values found in no other organization and sufficient for all general needs of its members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p41" pid="TWeQPUEKMEevt_bX81yLXQ" hash="SZpI9Q">“We urge all the Sisters to take these things to heart, and to cooperate in continuing the Relief Society in its position of the greatest and most efficient woman’s organization in the World.” (“A Centenary of Relief Society,” p. 7, Deseret News Press, 1942.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p42" pid="51l3XS1MtEG5UqzBgeT-AA" hash="ONm8xQ">That counsel from the First Presidency holds today! Rally to the cause of Relief Society! Strengthen it! Attend it! Devote yourselves to it! Enlist the inactive in it and bring nonmember sisters under the influence of it. It is time now to unite in this worldwide circle of sisters. A strong, well-organized Relief Society is crucial to the future, to the safety of this Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p43" pid="YleL-1LnskGePl4T2OWG8Q" hash="bwn0YA">We now move cautiously into the darkening mists of the future. We hear the ominous rumbling of the gathering storm. The narrow places of the past have been a preliminary and a preparatory testing. The issue of this dispensation now is revealed before us. It touches the life of every sister. We do not tremble in fear—for you hold in your gentle hands the light of righteousness. It blesses the brethren and nourishes our children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p44" pid="Ryg3gB8uXEK5wpYGNThs_w" hash="v_PsSg">Those who tell you that in the kingdom of God a woman’s lot is less than that of the man know nothing of the love, akin to worship, that the worthy man has for his wife. He cannot have his priesthood, not the fulness of it, without her. “For no man,” the Prophet said, “can get the fulness of the priesthood outside the temple of the Lord” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.1-3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 131:1–3</a>). And she is there beside him in that sacred place. She is there and shares in all that he receives. Each, individually, receives the washings and anointings, each may be endowed. But he cannot ascend to the highest ordinances—the sealing ordinances—without her at his side.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p45" pid="rbIDaSyUREKZsdCijqgMdw" hash="gRwDdg">Oh, how powerful the tender, tempering teachings and the disarming wisdom of our sisters can be. I found the spirit of Relief Society—the whole of it—in the quiet reply of one of your number.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-circle-of-sisters.p46" pid="C2HtJ8tde0qIHryTI4nSkw" hash="eVm_fQ">Someone ridiculed her determination to gather her year’s supply. She had stored enough for herself and her husband, with some to spare for her young married children who were without the means or the space to provide much for themselves. She told him she did it because the prophets had counseled us to do it. He chided her, “In the crunch you won’t have it anyway. What if your leaders call everything in? You’d have to share it with those who didn’t prepare. What will you think then?”</p>

The program centered on the opening of a jubilee box prepared by the Relief Society of the Box Elder Stake in Brigham City fifty years ago to celebrate the centennial of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p2" pid="rBB_IGEKOkiacWkORVX53g" hash="-qrrkQ">The box included newspapers, mementos, and a few letters. One of those letters was written by my grandmother, Sarah Adeline Wight Packer. I quote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p3" pid="kE6ifVT7skyk8De-WQiCWg" hash="MoWtzw">“We moved to a farm in Corinne in the year 1902. There being no branch of the Church there at that time … , myself and Hannah Basley visited all the sisters in Corinne and surrounding territory, to see if there was enough interest among them to organize a Relief Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p4" pid="KLu8hFoqBEumIEMX-ucCqg" hash="m22A8A">“Through our visits we learned the sisters were willing to come to meeting, and so we proceeded to get a branch organized.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p5" pid="fIFRFdVfIkW4DBmnnRVs6w" hash="Iz0vtA">There was another jubilee box at our social. Each couple posed for a portrait, and we were given a page on which to write a message to go into it. The box will be closed at year’s end, to be opened in the year 2030.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p6" pid="FVVrJs0HnUGzZf6jCx3E9Q" hash="jk3c3Q">We have not handed in our message as yet. But we have very thoughtfully considered it and hope to include something of what I say here today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p7" pid="6mfdEyH_pEGYFQjnCvb5YQ" hash="JdHqJQ">I address my remarks to our children and grandchildren. You may wonder why I would speak to them from this pulpit, rather than in a family meeting. There are two reasons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p8" pid="CbtRl--CbkebJhf7IjBlaw" hash="iPdnAw">First, a careful account is kept of these proceedings, and through that record I hope to speak to those who are not yet born. And next, I have the feeling and a hope that what I say may help someone else.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p9" pid="rXQuyExBckC6pYaLxAonCw" hash="aMnMPQ">The counsel I give is very difficult to teach and to learn. I fear that when I have given this counsel, some will say, “Well, I knew that already,” and regard it as prosaic, unimaginative, even dull. For what I want to say is so ordinary, so commonplace, that it is very difficult to have it universally regarded as important.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p10" pid="hDuCMRTODEegPDtxaA0sQA" hash="tfhIrw">Nevertheless, we want our children and grandchildren to know that, beyond the fundamental truth that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, there has been a restoration of His gospel through the prophets, that the fulness of the gospel is upon the earth. After that (really as an essential part of it), this is the one truth we most want to teach our children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p11" pid="UL372uz9HEyhPoO51gF6zQ" hash="cT8Pqg">Three weeks ago I spent a day with Sister Packer in the record office in London. We were looking for Mary Haley. Like missionaries looking for living souls, we tracted through the pages of old record books. Some of them, I am sure, had not been opened for a hundred years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p12" pid="NcfVTFE0BkWDnFu_1zAABg" hash="2ELiAQ">I spent most of the day reading the minutes of the overseers of the workhouse—which was really the poorhouse.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p13" pid="3g2BQ6LelEqMAIG30H0P6w" hash="PIAkLg">One entry told of a woman who had been dismissed from the workhouse and sent to prison. She was refused permission to leave to check on a report that her child was being badly abused at the workhouse school. In great frustration she had “willfully broken a window.” And so they sent her to prison.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p14" pid="hrci9IPUKE6spqJbNZVDhQ" hash="W4qMRw">Another entry reported an inspection of the school. The doctor complained that piles of manure along the edge of the school yard blocked the drainage. Water and sewage had backed up into the yard until the mire was ankle deep. Because of the cold and the poor condition of the children’s shoes, many children were ill.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p15" pid="lG-MyBet_kyWrhfgZ9NI5w" hash="pkNbLg">The record of dismissals listed “dead” or “died” time after time, with an explanation: “complaint,” “fever,” “consumption,” “dropsy.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p16" pid="9B7hVmTCsUWzpYGJXJKIFg" hash="HIxtGQ">We found Mary Haley! She married Edward Sayers, and they had eleven children. Six of them died before they were seven years of age, one from burns. To our knowledge, only one of the eleven grew to maturity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p17" pid="3JAFYpGqvUW1O3zw3XbHcQ" hash="WTpelA">That was Eleanor Sayers, my wife’s great-grandmother. She was born at Pullham, Norfolk, in the Depwade Union Workhouse and was the first of her family to join the Church. She died of cancer in a dismal London hospital.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p18" pid="U3VFP1gulk2rQBAfyxe9WA" hash="8aP4ig">The lives of those souls, our forebears, were characterized from beginning to end by both poverty and obscurity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p19" pid="Em2jm1mBuUyzIffxde2BiA" hash="UK172g">Before Eleanor Sayers Harman died, she gave all of her funds to her daughter Edith and counseled her to go to America.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p20" pid="j0oTyc8LMU2WIsTiS-F1Rg" hash="uTZc4Q">Edith had been cast out by her husband when she joined the Church. She and eight-year-old Nellie left England with the flimsy assurance that a missionary <span class="emphasis">thought</span> his family in Idaho <span class="emphasis">might</span> take them in until they could be located.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p21" pid="PYChQzLlDU2Mb3ZV6v02dQ" hash="owE-5Q">Nellie was my wife’s mother; Edith, her grandmother. I knew them well. They were women of special nobility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p22" pid="tg7Wq4ZWgE6ydpDp8q5IgQ" hash="RfQ8TA">Our lineage runs also to the stately manor houses of England, well-connected with the courts of kings, where culture and plenty were much in evidence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p23" pid="RwKTP0zoO061uYMX1UPplA" hash="ecx6Yw">But the dignity and worth of those forebears is not more, and may well be less, than that of Eleanor Sayers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p24" pid="Op_jXX7iikikvCqs17ngZQ" hash="LPhB1A">Sarah and Eleanor, Edith and Nellie—all were women of a special nobility—the royalty of righteousness. We want our children to remember that their lineage runs to the poorhouse in Pullham, Norfolk, and to remember this: It is the misapprehension of most people that if you are good, really good, at what you do, you will eventually be both widely known and well compensated.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p25" pid="9OB8Jax_mkGp6dIz9JYzRQ" hash="6dloEA">It is the understanding of almost everyone that success, to be complete, must include a generous portion of both fame and fortune as essential ingredients.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p26" pid="5OAc60C-DEqiYiTbAjGXbA" hash="tP6b3Q">The world seems to work on that premise. The premise is false. It is not true. The Lord taught otherwise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p27" pid="U5dRy1ib2kGySHjH3N3Z_A" hash="l7s-bw">I want you, our children, to know this truth:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p28" pid="VpjbETmnJkOtYhBb51U4Pg" hash="hm_vWw">You need not be either rich or hold high position to be completely successful and truly happy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p29" pid="klPdvwiBrUiv3Yp4sC7fQw" hash="InvjBw">In fact, if these things come to you, and they may, true success must be achieved in spite of them, not because of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p30" pid="-0AhBgjpSkyTSMvDafSkig" hash="pqGseg">It is remarkably difficult to teach this truth. If one who is not well known, and not well compensated, claims that he has learned for himself that neither fame nor fortune are essential to success, we tend to reject his statement as self-serving. What else could he say and not count himself a failure?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p31" pid="B5vxKjI_Vk6-cQr4sWHtmA" hash="T_PO2w">If someone who has possession of fame or fortune asserts that neither matters to success or happiness, we suspect that his expression is also self-serving, even patronizing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p32" pid="n41YE9DukkaqAxi_fd_lZw" hash="_cqK9g">Therefore, we will not accept as reliable authorities either those who have fame and fortune, or those who have not. We question that either can be an objective witness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p33" pid="iv4vu1pUmEq7f4xyqbrRgQ" hash="rmD4XQ">That leaves only one course open to us: trial and error—to learn for oneself, by experience, about prominence and wealth or their opposites.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p34" pid="Fmx0t85aMUCSsBWPu3w6uw" hash="C7kL4Q">We thereafter struggle through life, perhaps missing both fame and fortune, to finally learn one day that one can, indeed, succeed without possessing either. Or we may, one day, have both and learn that neither has made us happy; neither is basic to the recipe for true success and for complete happiness. That is a very slow way to learn.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p35" pid="bdt_7zJArki18GYqI1bdJA" hash="QehLUg">Was it Poor Richard who said, “Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other” (<span class="emphasis">The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard’s Almanac, and Other Papers,</span> New York: A.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p36" pid="Y2_EGco2gk6stvG82ODcbg" hash="fNRg7g">We come into mortal life to receive a body and to be tested, to learn to choose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p37" pid="zX8u9cctXkOv_PiRI_1LWA" hash="nbmecA">We want our children and their children to know that the choice of life is not between fame and obscurity, nor is the choice between wealth and poverty. The choice is between good and evil, and that is a very different matter indeed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p38" pid="r_b3pKzTpUaqTjhL1Ouu2Q" hash="lD0EtQ">When we finally understand this lesson, thereafter our happiness will not be determined by material things. We may be happy without them or successful in spite of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p39" pid="-cWlA-fEA0aiAWNIcYZyqQ" hash="icpP-A">Wealth and prominence do not always come from having earned them. Our worth is not measured by renown or by what we own.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p40" pid="SzQHYZ50bU-2uD_7_N-4sg" hash="vepmoA">Someone may say that my testimony may not be valid because of the prominence of the General Authorities of the Church. That is something we do not earn. It comes, as the saying goes, “with the territory.” And I want you to know that it comes as a burden on our backs, not as wings on our heels.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p41" pid="h-lSxTRjrUamzrZz41X1_w" hash="h5ks2Q">Our lives are made up of thousands of everyday choices. Over the years these little choices will be bundled together and show clearly what we value.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p42" pid="hDQ5SXyLZk63hOaUTSCSgQ" hash="LstEyA">The crucial test of life, I repeat, does not center in the choice between fame and obscurity, nor between wealth and poverty. The greatest decision of life is between good and evil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p43" pid="MDczwfccjkOy6pityMTj9w" hash="OrfwZA">We may foolishly bring unhappiness and trouble, even suffering upon ourselves. These are not always to be regarded as penalties imposed by a displeased Creator. They are part of the lessons of life, part of the test.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-choice.p44" pid="8NMbc3JFnUiNGnOIMeGG_w" hash="UgCIyg">Some are tested by poor health, some by a body that is deformed or homely.

He thought he couldn’t do that; he was too old now. “If you do it,” I told him, “you probably will not exactly fit in.

I only spent ten minutes with him, sitting on a log by our front gate. I did not build a school nor ask the Church to build one. I did not pay his tuition or prepare his lessons.

It had its beginning in Old Testament times and is the fulfillment of a prophecy by Ezekiel, who wrote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p2" pid="T1caqI5UFU-Jhpt3zlNO3A" hash="pSQQyg">“The word of the Lord came … unto me, saying, Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, for Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ezek/37.15-17" class="scriptureRef">Ezek. 37:15–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p3" pid="eOEEqO-r-0Gq-Jk2vWW7-A" hash="VSa05Q">The sticks, of course, are records or books. In ancient Israel records were written upon tablets of wood or scrolls rolled upon sticks. The record of Judah and the record of Ephraim, according to the prophecy, were to become one in our hands. Two events connected with the fulfillment of the prophecy were centered in print shops.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p4" pid="t8gEBsf1WE6Sgd0t8KZotA" hash="Zy9-RA">The first began on the second floor of a building on Main Street in the village of Palmyra, New York. In June of 1829 Joseph Smith and Martin Harris called upon Mr. Egbert B. Grandin, the proprietor, to discuss the publication of a new book of scripture. Mr. Grandin, then twenty-three, was three months younger than Joseph Smith. Only three months earlier he had advertised his intention to print books, a very ambitious undertaking for so small a shop with only a hand-operated, cast-iron press.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p5" pid="wfaYFMues02_rtLrYRwCVA" hash="DOXrbQ">Others had refused to print the book, and young Mr. Grandin, a religious man, was very skeptical himself. But as the contract was secured by a mortgage on the farm of Martin Harris, it was signed and printing commenced in August of 1829.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p6" pid="IHpdqyMGSkyxrij8UDhA5g" hash="CgkQNg">No sooner had the project begun than one Obadiah Dogberry, Jr., began to steal pages of the work and print them with accompanying ridicule in his weekly paper, <span class="emphasis">The Reflector.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p7" pid="3tV_c4c9O0G2Hj6lJvbh8A" hash="wD5Pmw">In March of 1830, the Book of Mormon came from the press and was advertised for sale. It met such a bitter and destructive response that it did not sell, and Martin Harris lost his farm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p8" pid="QoIDZulY0Ue974Pas7E2yA" hash="a9g1kA">An epoch of scriptural history had begun. The Prophet Joseph Smith and his successors to this day would proclaim the Book of Mormon to be another testament of Jesus Christ. Obadiah Dogberry and his successors, moved by another spirit, would, with the same methods, to this day revile it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p9" pid="MmPkhIp2cUCzDmaBXIlwpQ" hash="_JwumQ">One hundred forty-eight years later, in June 1977, again in a print shop, another step in the coming together of these two sticks occurred.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p10" pid="Dj_fLCWUUEWmdHzukcjzhA" hash="5LjipQ">James Mortimer, long experienced in publishing scriptures, and Dr. Ellis T. Rasmussen, recently dean of Religious Instruction at Brigham Young University, called at the Cambridge University Press in Cambridge, England. Bibles had been printed at this prestigious press for 293 years before Egbert Grandin opened his print shop in Palmyra.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p11" pid="SwUL5Ww8pke78hec29pDww" hash="uDtLog">They met with Mr. Roger Coleman, director of religious publishing, to discuss the publication of a most unusual edition of the King James Bible. The printers were quite as skeptical about this proposal as Egbert Grandin had been nearly 150 years before.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p12" pid="00CzRlf5ZUa4kKbjou6xFg" hash="wsXYTA">The Cambridge Press had been publishing the King James Bible since the first edition in 1611, but they had never been asked to do anything like this. The text was to remain exactly as it was, no changes, not one. But all footnoting, cross-references, chapter introductions, indexes, and so on, were to be replaced. Only the chapter and verse numbering for the sixty-six books would be retained.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p13" pid="yFkQfpGeIEOFoTG3Cixohg" hash="srORGQ">And that was just the beginning. This edition of the Bible would be cross-referenced with three other books of scripture: the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. The printers had barely heard of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p14" pid="jKxjGXiKI0WJkYoFI_pebQ" hash="YM6Q2g">But there was more. A new, innovative system of footnoting was to be used. Instead of progressing from <span class="emphasis">A</span> to <span class="emphasis">Z</span> in each chapter, the letters would start over in every verse, for innumerable verses would have many footnotes in them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p15" pid="GBI8ukfI7ESqa-kAVKJxZA" hash="4qVMKg">The technical problems seemed insurmountable. Computers could help, but there was always the human factor. How could you cross-reference the Bible with any other book? To cross-reference it with the three volumes was to require tens of thousands of footnotes. Thereafter there would be hundreds of thousands of possible combinations of information. It was too big even to think about. The technical challenge alone was staggering, to say nothing of maintaining accuracy, harmony, and consistency with the biblical text itself. It could not be done!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p16" pid="84HXXhorP0q8NBrqFmgFqg" hash="s2vonQ">But in that meeting also was Mr. Derek Bowen, editor, a most remarkable man. A World War II injury had left him unable to hear. Thereafter he devoted his remarkable compensating abilities to the editing, typesetting, and printing of Bibles. He was, perhaps, the one man in the world who could direct such a printing project.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p17" pid="Tkba_7EXz0-RxwKV6yhUfA" hash="avLnpw">All of the problems mentioned so far related only to the printing part of the project. The actual compiling and organizing of the tens of thousands of footnotes would require many hundreds of workers. This work had already been underway for several years. Without the computer it would be manifestly impossible!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/scriptures.p18" pid="nkwVskRvTkGSeXQh0Ykkew" hash="nA9Y9w">That also was but a beginning. There would be a combined concordance and topical guide, listing hundreds of subjects; a Bible dictionary; maps; and a new format. New chapter headings would be written. All in harmony with the sacred message of the Old and the New Testaments.</p>

Several weeks ago I had in my office a four-star general and his wife; they were very impressive people. They admire the Church because of the conduct of our youth. The general’s wife mentioned her children, of whom she is justly proud. But she expressed a deep concern. “Tell me,” she said, “how you are able to control your youth and build such character as we have seen in your young men?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/agency-and-control.p2" pid="nenge4iY_0OSJrLSwxH4zw" hash="YQWq1g">I was interested in her use of the word ‘control’. The answer, I told them, centered in the doctrines of the gospel. They were interested; so I spoke briefly of the doctrine of agency. I said we develop <span class="emphasis">control</span> by teaching <span class="emphasis">freedom.</span> Perhaps at first they thought we start at the wrong end of the subject. A four-star general is nothing if not a disciplinarian. But when one understands the gospel, it becomes very clear that the best control is self-control.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/agency-and-control.p3" pid="_fb2aV3Ao0qjSxwc49Gq8Q" hash="6xbAfg">It may seem unusual at first to foster <span class="emphasis">self-control</span> by centering on <span class="emphasis">freedom of choice,</span> but it is a very sound doctrinal approach.</p>

And they miss one vital connection and see obedience only as restraint. They then resist the very thing that will give them true freedom. There is no true freedom without responsibility, and there is no enduring freedom without a knowledge of the truth. The Lord said, “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.31-32" class="scriptureRef">John 8:31–32</a>.)</p>

Latter-day Saints are not obedient because they are compelled to be obedient. They are obedient because they know certain spiritual truths and have decided, as an expression of their own individual agency, to obey the commandments of God.</p>

There is an obedience that comes from a knowledge of the truth that transcends any external form of control. We are not obedient because we are blind, we are obedient because we can see. The best control, I repeat, is self-control.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/agency-and-control.p9" pid="xLvkmK5M1kKjYbzaD_BAhg" hash="NuSaNg">The general knew then why we teach our children the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ and where they get the resolute determination to protect individual freedom.</p>

There, carved into the facade of a building, are the three monkeys. One with its hands over its ears, another over its eyes, and the third over its mouth. Hear no evil; see no evil; speak no evil!

A handsome young Hawaiian athlete was being honored. He had been blessed with a well-formed body, and he had excelled in several sports.

I found it easier to control my eyes on the playing field than on the street. It is not easy to control what I will hear. Most of all, it is not easy to control my thoughts.” He then expressed gratitude for the seminary program and paid tribute to his seminary teachers. They were the coaches who taught him control over the most permanent part of his nature.</p>

She may get a feel for the language, even pick up many words. But this is not enough. She must memorize grammar and vocabulary. She must practice pronunciation.

But some time one must <span class="emphasis">learn</span> the doctrine. Here, too, rote learning, practice, memorization, reading, listening, discussion, all become essential.

So we have seminaries, institutes, religion classes; there are priesthood, Sunday School, and auxiliary classes. The curriculum for all of them centers in the scriptures and the history of the Church. Spiritual development is tied very closely to a knowledge of the scriptures, where the doctrines are found.</p>

But unless a student knows the system of cataloging, a search for that knowledge will be discouraging; it will be an ordeal. Those systems are really not too difficult to learn. Then all of the knowledge in all of the books is opened to him. Searching becomes very simple indeed. But one must find it and read it. One must <span class="emphasis">earn</span> it.</p>

They contain the fulness of the everlasting gospel, an eternity of knowledge. But one must learn to use them or the search will be discouraging. Again, there is a system. Learn about the concordance, the footnotes, the Topical Guide; memorize the books of the Bible and the Book of Mormon. And the scriptures will then yield their treasure. All of this is taught in the seminary and institute classes. The teachers are both worthy and well trained. But they cannot help if your students are not enrolled.</p>

We move from the Industrial Age to the Age of Information. And schools are tooling up to meet the challenge.

That would surely be a mistake. It would be like adding one more brick to the house of knowledge when there is little mortar to hold it all together. Parents, encourage, even insist, that your students register for seminary or institute. Presidents, bishops, youth leaders, you are responsible to encourage every youngster, without exception, to enroll. Few things you do will benefit them quite as much.</p>

As a rule of thumb, we have told our youngsters that disrespect for teachers, in public schools or in Church schools, brings trouble at home as well. This year two hundred thousand students are enrolled in seminary, and over one hundred and twenty thousand in institutes of religion in eighteen languages in sixty-eight countries. Whether it be released-time, the early-morning, or the home-study programs, the courses are the same. They center in the scriptures; they teach the doctrine and history of the Church.</p>

President Kimball and I once attended a seminary class in North Dakota. We did not meet in a fine room with a blackboard and projector and special school chairs. We met in the very small bedroom in a very small house.</p>

The students crowded together on the floor. It was no less a class than one held in a beautiful building. The most important ingredient, the Spirit of the Lord, was there. I attended a seminary graduation in Omaha, Nebraska. The speaker, again a young man, described this experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/agency-and-control.p32" pid="77vCN82A8EOLQ0MKrsv-Fg" hash="6GfYuQ">“Each morning I awoke to the sweet voice of my mother calling out, ‘John, John, time to get ready for seminary!’ The year rolled on and the mornings grew cold and wet and dark; still the happy voice of Mother would sing out, ‘John, John, time to get up for seminary!’” Then he added, “I learned to hate that sound!”</p>

It will come later, when they are away from both teacher and parent. One day you must set them free. When that day comes, how <span class="emphasis">free</span> will they be, and how <span class="emphasis">safe?</span> It will depend on how much truth they have received. I know of a young missionary who, half a world away from his parents and teachers, faced the testing that comes to young manhood. There, beyond the control of either of them, he made a decision. Later he wrote: “I’m so glad I stayed, because during this last month I found something—I found myself.”</p>

That still, small voice of inspiration whispering, “Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.78" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:78</a>.)</p>

Two of our sons, then little boys, were wrestling on the rug, and they had reached that line which separates laughter from tears.

They now watch their children grow as we watched them. They are coming to know something as fathers that they could not be taught as sons. Perhaps now they know how much their father loves them.

Then just before his ordination he dropped out because there were so many unanswered questions. He still regarded himself as a devout, if somewhat disillusioned, Christian. He found another profession, married, and was raising a family when our missionaries found him.</p>

To his surprise he found, underlying the programs of the Church, a solid foundation of doctrine. He had no idea of the depth and breadth and height of our theology.

All is beautifully ready. The tables are in one long row. We even have tablecloths and china. You have never seen such a feast. The Relief Society and Young Women have outdone themselves. The tables are laden with every kind of delicious food: cantaloupes, watermelon, corn on the cob, fried chicken, hamburgers, cakes, pies—you get the picture?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p5" pid="666NwF5QwEe9HvQMPJHN2A" hash="OGEywg">We are seated, and the bishop calls upon the patriarch to bless the food. Every hungry youngster secretly hopes it will be a short prayer.</p>

And then an anxious mother takes a box to that extra table nearby. It is mealtime. Their children are hungry. She puts a few leftovers on the table. Then she nervously moves them about, trying to make it look like a meal for her hungry brood. But there is not enough.</p>

She pulls her runny-nosed little brother over to us and pushes her head between you and me. We cringe aside, because they are very dirty. Then the little girl says, “Ummm, look at that. Ummm, ummm, I wonder what that tastes like.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p11" pid="IBRyKPB-pkui4VPaog7pVg" hash="frykXA">Everyone is waiting. Why did they arrive just at that moment? Such an inconvenient time. Why must we interrupt what we are doing to bother with outsiders? Why couldn’t they have stopped somewhere else? They are not clean! They are not like us. They just don’t fit in.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p12" pid="0Xz1WzPbiUm2TJvHTps-ig" hash="87G_RQ">Since the bishop has put us in charge, he expects us to handle these intruders. What should we do? Of course, this is only a parable. But now for the test. If it really happened, my young friends, what <span class="emphasis">would</span> you do?</p>

And we do have too much of some things. We could take a little of this and a little of that and lure the little children back to their own table. Then we could enjoy our feast without interruption. After all, we earned what we have. Did we not “obtain it by [our own] industry,” as the Book of Mormon says? (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 4:6</a>.)</p>

You could slide that way, and I could slide this way, and the little girl could sit between us. They could all fit in somewhere to share our feast. Afterward, we will fix their car and provide something for their journey.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p20" pid="8fAMHPuMsUGyWElwwVANbA" hash="71pmcw">Is that what you would do? Surely it is what you <span class="emphasis">should</span> do. But forgive me if I have a little doubt; let me explain.</p>

Every conceivable manner of spiritual nourishment is ours. Every part of the spiritual menu is included. It provides an unending supply of spiritual strength. Like the widow’s cruse of oil, it is replenished as we use it and shall never fail. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/17.8-16" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 17:8–16</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p26" pid="hqnY5tHePU-BW9OQkg6jnQ" hash="rELilA">Even mistakes and transgressions must not stand in the way. You should make yourself <span class="emphasis">worthy</span> to receive a call.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p27" pid="6womlxyOWUuJc7Bn8Q-Yig" hash="3waUSg">The early Apostles at first did not know that the gospel was for everyone, for the Gentiles. Then Peter had a vision. He saw a vessel full of all kinds of creatures and was commanded to kill and to eat. But he refused, saying they were common and unclean. Then the voice said, “What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.9-16" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:9–16</a>.) That vision, and the experience they had immediately following, convinced them of their duty; thus began the great missionary work of all Christianity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p28" pid="hahGVB_No06vzVkFBxLOqA" hash="cplJjA">Almost any returned missionary will have a question: “If they are starving spiritually, why do they not accept what we have? Why do they slam the door on us and turn us away?“</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p29" pid="S91IcMnMSE6BC4H9yeQbbg" hash="Is40Pw">One of my sons was serving in Australia and was thrown off a porch by a man who rejected his message.</p>

Remember, all who are spiritually hungry will not accept the gospel. Do you remember how reluctant you are to try any new food? Only after your mother urges you will you take a little, tiny portion on the tip of a spoon to taste it to see if you like it first.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p32" pid="fWaEe85wGEm9r5eKWuIDHg" hash="yvOkmg">Undernourished children must be carefully fed; so it is with the spiritually underfed. Some are so weakened by mischief and sin that to begin with they reject the rich food we offer. They must be fed carefully and gently.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p33" pid="AHoIO22LD0qtln6KjOly5w" hash="idd9dA">Some are so near spiritual death that they must be spoonfed on the broth of fellowship, or nourished carefully on activities and programs. As the scriptures say, they must have milk before meat. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3.2" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 3:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:22</a>.) But we must take care lest the only nourishment they receive thereafter is that broth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p34" pid="xEyHIr_iX0-affoNR8dO9w" hash="vnzWAA">But feed them we must. We are commanded to preach the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. That message, my young friends, appears more than eighty times in the scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p35" pid="txZG2Or4nkSJyCKtwvLciQ" hash="1wPGOw">I did not serve a regular mission until we were called to preside in New England. When I was of missionary age, when I was your age, young men could not be called to the mission field. It was World War II, and I spent four years in the military. But I did do missionary work; we did share the gospel. It was my privilege to baptize one of the first two Japanese to join the Church after the mission had been closed twenty-two years earlier. Brother Elliot Richards baptized Tatsui Sato. I baptized his wife, Chio. And the work in Japan was reopened. We baptized them in a swimming pool amid the rubble of a university that had been destroyed by bombs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p36" pid="l384I5EQMUS8wfnGeEa21A" hash="ZKSj-w">Shortly thereafter I boarded a train in Osaka for Yokohama and a ship that would take me home. Brother and Sister Sato came to the station to say good-bye. Many tears were shed as we bade one another farewell.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p37" pid="3GZGU7FhqECgCIVI35mzBA" hash="IONFDQ">It was a very chilly night. The railroad station, what there was left of it, was very cold. Starving children were sleeping in the corners. That was a common sight in Japan in those days. The fortunate ones had a newspaper or a few old rags to fend off the cold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p38" pid="PVP4Ubw_TkOUeAyU_9OLlA" hash="4p62ww">On that train, I slept restlessly. The berths were too short anyway. In the bleak, chilly hours of the dawn, the train stopped at a station along the way. I heard a tapping on the window and raised the blind. There on the platform stood a little boy tapping on the window with a tin can. I knew he was an orphan and a beggar; the tin can was the symbol of their suffering. Sometimes they carried a spoon as well, as if to say, “I am hungry; feed me.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p39" pid="DAKjWFveXk2-WyeYl967SQ" hash="znLrlQ">He might have been six or seven years old. His little body was thin with starvation. He had on a thin, ragged shirt-like kimono, nothing else. His head was shingled with scabs. His one jaw was swollen—perhaps from an abscessed tooth. Around his head he had tied a filthy rag with a knot on top of his head—a pathetic gesture of treatment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p40" pid="NteCgo7ur0-ewSi9S4eRvw" hash="0oeoLg">When I saw him and he saw that I was awake, he waved his can. He was begging. In pity, I thought, “How can I help him?” Then I remembered. I had money, Japanese money. I quickly groped for my clothing and found some yen notes in my pocket. I tried to open the window. But it was stuck. I slipped on my trousers and hurried to the end of the car. He stood outside expectantly. As I pushed at the resistant door, the train pulled away from the station. Through the dirty windows I could see him, holding that rusty tin can, with the dirty rag around his swollen jaw.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p41" pid="_QtzBQwMUESn1jEA1I4WuQ" hash="WLi3Mg">There I stood, an officer from a conquering army, heading home to a family and a future. There I stood, half-dressed, clutching some money which he had seen but which I could not get to him. I wanted to help him, but couldn’t. The only comfort I draw is that I did want to help him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/feed-my-sheep.p42" pid="F8Nu6jI0fEqm5a90E4hsXg" hash="MQLQjQ">That was thirty-eight years ago, but I can see him as clearly as if it were yesterday.</p>

On occasion a family member has suggested, sometimes even insisted, that some innovation be added to the funeral service as a special accommodation to the family. Within reason, of course, a bishop may honor such a request. However, there are limits to what may be done without disturbing the spirituality and causing it to be less than it might be. We should remember, too, that others attending the funeral may suppose that innovation is an accepted procedure and introduce it at other funerals. Then, unless we are careful, an innovation which was allowed as an accommodation to one family in one funeral may come to be regarded as expected in every funeral.</p>

We should regard the bishop rather than the family or the mortician as the presiding authority in these matters.</p>

Sometimes the casket is kept open during the funeral, and members are expected to file by at the close of the funeral. And, instead of the simple family prayer, talks, and even musical numbers, have been added at the closing of the casket or at the cemetery before the grave is dedicated. I do not refer to graveside services which may on occasion take the place of a formal funeral. I refer to those alterations of the approved simple agenda for funerals.</p>

All the Lord approves is not detailed in the scriptures, neither is all that is forbidden. The Word of Wisdom, for instance, makes no specific warning against taking arsenic.

Tolerance may be a virtue, but it is not <span class="emphasis">the</span> commanding one. There is a difference between what one <span class="emphasis">is</span> and what one <span class="emphasis">does.</span> What one is may deserve unlimited tolerance; what one does, only a measured amount.

We have compounded the mistake by neglecting to teach moral and spiritual values. Moral laws do not apply to animals for they have no agency. Where there is agency, where there is choice, moral laws must apply. We cannot, absolutely cannot, have it both ways.</p>

They wrest the scriptures attempting to prove that these impulses are inborn, cannot be overcome, and should not be resisted; and therefore, such conduct has a morality of its own.

Though some of the sheep may wander, the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold. Either in this life or the life to come, they will return. They will have to pay their debt to justice; they will suffer for their sins; and may tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last, like the penitent Prodigal, to a loving and forgiving father’s heart and home, the painful experience will not have been in vain. Pray for your careless and disobedient children; hold on to them with your faith. Hope on, trust on, till you see the salvation of God.” (Orson F. Whitney, in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, p. 110.)</p>

There were along the way Scouts in uniform with flags. There were the elderly in camp chairs, even wheelchairs. Farmers left their equipment to stand in the field, and families dressed in their Sunday best paid their respects. Thousands of people expressed love for him, a spontaneous outpouring of love—all of which is now transferred to President Howard W. Hunter. His physical limitations actually enhance his capacity as prophet and seer. God bless him for the course that he has already set and the direction that he will yet give us.</p>

Some important scene is near to take place. It may be that my enemies will kill me. And in case they should, and the keys and power which rest on me <span class="emphasis">not</span> be imparted to you, they will be lost from the earth. But if I can only succeed in placing them upon your heads, then let me fall a victim to murderous hands if God will suffer it, and I can go with all pleasure and satisfaction, knowing that my work is done, and the foundation laid on which the kingdom of God is to be reared in this dispensation of the fulness of times.

The sustaining of the prophet is still an essential ongoing part of the safety of this people. Should age and infirmity cause his hands to grow heavy, they are held up by his counselors at his side. Both are prophets, seers, and revelators, as is each member of the Quorum of the Twelve.</p>

Several years ago in Africa I learned how dangerously invisible crocodiles can be. I then warned our youth about unseen spiritual crocodiles lying in wait to destroy them.</p>

To this day those regulations apply to every member and to everyone who seeks to join the Church. They are so compelling that no one is to be baptized into the Church without first agreeing to live by them. No one will be called to teach or to lead unless they accept them. When you want to go to the temple, you will be asked if you keep the Word of Wisdom. If you do not, you cannot go to the house of the Lord until you are fully worthy.</p>

Generally principles are not spelled out in detail. That leaves you free to find your way with an enduring truth, a principle, as your anchor.</p>

It’s well known that tea, coffee, liquor, and tobacco are against it. It has not been spelled out in more detail. Rather, we teach the principle together with the promised blessings.

They teach that the good things of the earth “are made for the benefit and the use of man, … Yea,” the Lord said, “for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul, … to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.18-20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:18–20</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-twelve-apostles.p9" pid="Tj0k4gBpiEyHFtmSKZFt8A" hash="4w-p4Q">Some suppose that the organization was handed to the Prophet Joseph Smith like a set of plans and specifications for a building, with all of the details known at the beginning. But it did not come that way. Rather, it came a piece at a time as the Brethren were ready and as they inquired of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-twelve-apostles.p10" pid="tKrh-fx2KESq-se5leHGCA" hash="TIQplQ">The Melchizedek Priesthood, the consummate authority given to man from God, was restored under the hands of Peter, James, and John. By them, the Lord said, “I have ordained you and confirmed you to be apostles, and especial witnesses of my name, and bear the keys of your ministry and of the same things which I revealed unto them;</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-twelve-apostles.p12" pid="RcMxKFiSxk244VsXvsvjeg" hash="6rr6yw">The First Presidency was in place by 1833; then two years later, in February of 1835, came the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. And that is as it should be. The First Presidency came first in sequence and stands first in authority. And, true to the pattern, it was made of men called from the ordinary pursuits of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-twelve-apostles.p13" pid="_DEfrS4mRE2vQ5jp-zqCGw" hash="Pg-dVA">With the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve in place, with the offices of the Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric revealed, the proper order of things prevails. But there is a difference. Perhaps President J. Reuben Clark said it best: “Some of the General Authorities [the Apostles] have had assigned to them a special calling; they possess a special gift; they are sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators, which gives them a special spiritual endowment in connection with their teaching of this people. They have the right, the power, and the authority to declare the mind and will of God to his people, subject to the over-all power and authority of the President of the Church. Others of the General Authorities are not given this special spiritual endowment.” The resulting limitation “applies to every other officer and member of the Church, for none of them is spiritually endowed as a prophet, seer, and revelator.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-twelve-apostles.p14" pid="xBFAOUfTzk6pwUXqGs0tfg" hash="BzBPpQ">Furthermore, President Clark said that among those of the Twelve and the Presidency, “only the President of the Church, the Presiding High Priest, is sustained as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator for the Church, and he alone has the right to receive revelations for the Church, either new or amendatory, or to give authoritative interpretations of scriptures that shall be binding on the Church, or change in any way the existing doctrines of the Church.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Each move to perfect that order has come about in response to a need and in answer to prayer. And that process continues in our day.</p>

Lee told me once of a conversation he had with Elder Charles A. Callis of the Quorum of the Twelve. Brother Callis had remarked that the gift of discernment was an awesome burden to carry. To see clearly what is ahead and yet find members slow to respond or resistant to counsel or even rejecting the witness of the apostles and prophets brings deep sorrow.</p>

No calling is more important, no service more enduring, than parenthood. Generally callings in the Church help parents to be better parents. Nevertheless, leaders should use both judgment and inspiration to make certain that a call does not make it measurably difficult for parents to serve as parents.</p>

It is quite as much in the interest of the men and boys that Relief Society prosper as in the interest of women and girls.</p>

Even at night, those attending came at different times, one from one direction and one from another, so as to not call attention to themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p8" pid="JupPOUq5LUm8Jjg1I6lWCg" hash="iuNfUw">There were in attendance 12 sisters. We sang the hymns of Zion from songbooks—words without music—printed more than 50 years before. The Spiritual Living lesson was reverently given from the pages of a handmade manual. The few pages of Church literature we could get to them were typed at night, 12 carbon copies at a time, so as to share a few precious pages as widely as possible among the members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p9" pid="-yB2w8M5kUuotq-YmC0KvA" hash="AZuiBA">I told those sisters that they belonged to the largest and by all measure the greatest women’s organization on earth.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p14" pid="yTWx2B0YEk-EpBIk6akWWw" hash="HuP4cQ">I told them that upon our return I was assigned to speak at a Relief Society conference; could I deliver a message from them? Several of them made notes; each expression, every one, was in the spirit of giving—not of asking for anything. I shall never forget what one sister wrote: “A small circle of sisters send their own hearts and thoughts to all the sisters and begs the Lord to help us go forward.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p15" pid="OjXXDV-QuUC3yEx0zLTTYQ" hash="Ey962Q">Those words, <span class="emphasis">circle of sisters,</span> inspired me. I could see them standing in a circle that reached beyond that room and circled the world. I caught the same vision the apostles and prophets before us have had. The Relief Society is more than a circle now; it is more like a fabric of lace spread across the continents.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p17" pid="l4X-xXu_40qjBPOXjEbahw" hash="YE9JtQ">You sisters may be surprised to learn that the needs of men are seldom, if ever, discussed in priesthood quorums. Certainly they are not preoccupied with them. They discuss the gospel and the <span class="emphasis">priesthood</span> and the family!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p18" pid="LdP8mth6tES76v02Hw3Mrg" hash="JiKDig">If you follow that pattern, you will not be preoccupied with the so-called needs of women. As you give first priority to your family and serve your organization, every need shall be fulfilled, every neglect will be erased, every abuse will be corrected, now or in the eternities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p19" pid="mG7BR3imnk-A70af3jtxkw" hash="rc7iDg">There are many community causes worthy of your support. There are others which are flawed, for they erode those values essential to a happy family. Do not allow yourselves to be organized under another banner which cannot, in truth, fulfill your needs. Do not drift from the course established by the general presidency of the Relief Society. Their stated purpose is to help bring women and families to Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p20" pid="_Uguc_TwUkmCx_8VVQtGCQ" hash="7AZmxQ">As mission president, I attended a mission Relief Society conference. Our mission Relief Society president, a relatively recent convert, announced something of a course correction. Some local societies had strayed, and she invited them to conform more closely to the direction set by the general presidency of the Relief Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p21" pid="Mr_2Xkj27UukbHaqt2rA8A" hash="IX-IBw">One sister in the congregation stood and defiantly told her that they were not willing to follow her counsel, saying they were an exception. A bit flustered, she turned to me for help. I didn’t know what to do. I was not interested in facing a fierce woman. So I motioned for her to proceed. Then came the revelation!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p22" pid="dveyNHQSG06CRh1Fk_-tNA" hash="qoDe_Q">This lovely Relief Society president, small and somewhat handicapped physically, said with gentle firmness: “Dear sister, we’d like not to take care of the exception first. We will take care of the rule first, and then we will see to the exceptions.” The course correction was accepted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p23" pid="LMppJiCTkkuHjjje6QqT0w" hash="DzVgfA">Her advice is good for Relief Society and priesthood and for families. When you state a rule and include the exception in the same sentence, the exception is accepted first.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p24" pid="ycdTjRFkRUqbAdpacWlz1A" hash="wawkpA">The Brethren know they <span class="emphasis">belong</span> to a quorum of the priesthood. Too many sisters, however, think that Relief Society is merely a class to attend. The same sense of <span class="emphasis">belonging</span> to the Relief Society rather than just attending a class must be fostered in the heart of every woman. Sisters, you must graduate from <span class="emphasis">thinking</span> that you only <span class="emphasis">attend</span> Relief Society to <span class="emphasis">feeling</span> that you <span class="emphasis">belong</span> to it!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p25" pid="O0p_vEEwHUW_xJ7eCVB-xQ" hash="S2FwSg">However much priesthood power and authority the men may possess—however much wisdom and experience they may accumulate—the safety of the family, the integrity of the doctrine, the ordinances, the covenants, indeed the future of the Church, rests equally upon the women. The defenses of the home and family are greatly reinforced when the wife and mother and daughters belong to Relief Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p26" pid="ySiRoRONBEqHyOvFHTp3Tw" hash="_Lgr2w">No man receives the fulness of the priesthood without a woman at his side. For no man, the Prophet said, can obtain the fulness of the priesthood outside the temple of the Lord.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> And she is there beside him in that sacred place. She shares in all that he receives. The man and the woman individually receive the ordinances encompassed in the endowment. But the man cannot ascend to the highest ordinances—the sealing ordinances—without her at his side. No man achieves the supernal exalting status of worthy fatherhood except as a gift from his wife.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p27" pid="U4BrrKPLf0S6w7ArtMG7Cg" hash="gpTTDg">In the home and in the Church sisters should be esteemed for their very nature. Be careful lest you unknowingly foster influences and activities which tend to erase the masculine and feminine differences nature has established. A man, a father, can do much of what is usually assumed to be a woman’s work. In turn, a wife and a mother can do much—and in time of need, most things—usually considered the responsibility of the man, without jeopardizing their distinct roles. Even so, leaders, and especially parents, should recognize that there is a distinct masculine nature and a distinct feminine nature essential to the foundation of the home and the family. Whatever disturbs or weakens or tends to erase that difference erodes the family and reduces the probability of happiness for all concerned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p28" pid="LHhSyreqe0q5aPU944E-1A" hash="CxHYPQ">There is a difference in the way the priesthood functions in the home as compared to the way it functions in the Church. In the Church our service is by call. In the home our service is by choice. A calling in the Church generally is temporary for there comes a release. Our place in the home and family, which is based on choice, is forever and beyond.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p29" pid="iryXlGimQ0OzYEIA2Z0XRA" hash="ZfKrRA">In the Church there is a distinct line of authority. We serve where called by those who preside over us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p30" pid="1vW9NOBtJkymdtjaPsuTnA" hash="nbc3Rg">In the home it is a partnership with husband and wife equally yoked together, sharing in decisions, always working together. While the husband, the father, has responsibility to provide worthy and inspired leadership, his wife is neither behind him nor ahead of him but at his side.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p31" pid="qdwaQv2FjkeqvvGl65o6ww" hash="QSWtlw">The leaders of Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary are all members of the ward and stake councils, and they have a unity which comes from their membership in Relief Society. To the degree that leaders ignore the contribution and influence of these sisters, in councils and in the home, the work of the priesthood itself is limited and weakened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p32" pid="6R87ZyiNxEeJu1KPqxy5MA" hash="feiZCA">Neither the brethren, acting as a quorum of the priesthood, nor these sisters who sit in councils must ever lose—not for a minute can they lose—a perspective of the place of the home.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p34" pid="aATV4LOlPU6WHyu7rA5cJQ" hash="AoQzDg">Priesthood and auxiliary leaders, and especially parents, must use wisdom born of inspiration to make very certain that those activities, for both leaders and members, are not overdemanding of time and money. If they are, it leaves too little of both and makes it difficult for attentive parents to influence their own children. Be very careful to sustain and support rather than supplant the home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p35" pid="21pL5eIjBEmRKaPd2TCJJg" hash="uOpJuQ">At those times when parents feel smothered and just cannot do it all, they must make wise and inspired judgments as to how much out-of-home activity of all kinds is best for their own family. It is on this subject that the priesthood leaders, in council assembled, must pay careful attention to the expressions of the sisters, the mothers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-relief-society.p36" pid="MAFL8e_mkE2bvqHJ7qe_gQ" hash="_Aofxw">Strong Relief Societies carry a powerful immunizing and healing influence for the mothers and the daughters, for the single parent, for the single sisters, for the aging, for the infirm.</p>

From the day they arrive, he will belong to a quorum of the priesthood and she will belong to Relief Society. There she will find a grandmother—someone to call in the place of her own mother when her cooking isn’t turning out right or to ask how to know if a restless child is really ill. She will find the steady, wise hand of surrogate grandmothers. They will give a word of comfort when the painful disease of homesickness hangs on too long. The young family will find security—the husband in the quorums, the sister in Relief Society. Both have as their consummate purpose to secure the family eternally.</p>

They do not see that they are moving from the one best source of light and truth, of help with their family, into the shadows where danger and heartbreak await.</p>

Some youngsters receive very little teaching and support at home. There is no question but that we must provide for them. But if we provide a constant schedule of out-of-home activities sufficient to compensate for the loss in those homes, it may make it difficult for attentive parents to have time to be with and teach their own children. Only prayer and inspiration can lead us to find this difficult balance.</p>

Sister Lee put a handful of pennies on a table before our young son. She had him slide the shiny ones to one side and said, “These are your tithing; these belong to the Lord. The others are yours to keep.” He thoughtfully looked from one pile to the other and then said, “Don’t you have any more dirty ones?” That was when the real teaching moment began!</p>

The neighbor thought nothing of it until much later when he passed the field again, and the team had not moved. He climbed the fence and crossed the field to the horses. Emery was nowhere to be found. He hurried to the house to check with Lucille.</p>

His father had been killed in the war. His mother, with his grandparents, and his mother’s sister, also a widow, and her two little girls, were forced to evacuate their village with only 30 minutes’ notice. They grabbed what they could and headed west. Manfred and his mother pulled and pushed a small cart. At times, the ailing grandfather rode in the cart. One Polish officer looked at the pathetic little Manfred and began to weep.</p>

Hinckley, the 14 men, Apostles, who had had conferred upon them the keys of the kingdom, gathered together in the upper room of the temple in order to reorganize the First Presidency of the Church. There was no question about what would be done, no hesitancy. We knew that the senior Apostle was the President of the Church. And in that sacred meeting, Thomas Spencer Monson was sustained by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as the President of the Church. He nominated and named his counselors. They likewise were sustained, and they were each ordained and given authority. President Monson was specifically given the authority to exercise all of the priesthood keys of authority. Now, as the scriptures provide, he is the only man on the earth who has the right to exercise all of the keys. But we all hold them as Apostles. There is one man among us called and ordained, and he becomes the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Already he was and had been sustained for years as a prophet, seer, and revelator.</p>

Smith made this statement about the priesthood in the home: “In the home the presiding authority is always vested in the father, and in all home affairs and family matters there is no other authority paramount. To illustrate this principle, a single incident will perhaps suffice. It sometimes happens that the elders are called in to administer to the members of a family. Among these elders there may be presidents of stakes, apostles, or even members of the first presidency of the Church. It is not proper under these circumstances for the father to stand back and expect the elders to direct the administration of this important ordinance. The father is there. It is his right and it is his duty to preside. He should select the one who is to administer the oil, and the one who is to be mouth in prayer, and he should not feel that because there are present presiding authorities in the Church that he is therefore divested of his rights to direct the administration of that blessing of the gospel in his home. (If the father be absent, the mother should request the presiding authority present to take charge.) The father presides at the table, at prayer, and gives general directions relating to his family life whoever may be present.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span></p>

It can protect you from the plague of pornography—and it is a plague—if you are succumbing to its influence. If one is obedient, the priesthood can show how to break a habit and even erase an addiction. Holders of the priesthood have that authority and should employ it to combat evil influences.</p>

The key is labeled “repentance.” If you know how to use this key, the adversary cannot hold you. The twin principles of repentance and forgiveness exceed in strength the awesome power of the tempter. If you are bound by a habit or an addiction that is unworthy, you must stop conduct that is harmful.

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="6"></span>Years ago on a cold night in a train station in Japan, I heard a tap on the window of my sleeper car. There stood a freezing boy wearing a ragged shirt with a dirty rag tied about a swollen jaw. His head was covered with scabies. He held a rusty tin can and a spoon, the symbol of an orphan beggar. As I struggled to open the door to give him money, the train pulled out.</p>

It was night, and while Elder Tuttle spoke, a little boy, perhaps six years old, appeared in the doorway. He wore only a ragged shirt that went about to his knees.</p>

This starving street orphan saw the bread and inched slowly along the wall toward it. He was almost to the table when a woman on the aisle saw him. With a stern toss of her head, she banished him out into the night. I groaned within myself.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-atonement.p7" pid="RZCnIn3wiUiF-etb0jM4HA" hash="p11YsA">The day we were to return from Savai‘i, it was raining. Knowing the plane could not land on the wet field, we drove to the west end of the island, where there was a runway of sorts atop a coral break. We waited until dark, but no plane arrived. Finally, we learned by radio that there was a storm, and the plane could not take off. We radioed back that we would come by boat. Someone was to meet us at Mulifanua.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-atonement.p8" pid="9EqD55_gDkacB6BKIhoT8w" hash="1DPKgg">As we pulled out of port on Savai‘i, the captain of the 40-foot (12 m) boat asked the mission president if he had a flashlight. Fortunately, he did and made a present of it to the captain. We made the 13-mile (21 km) crossing to Upolu island on very rough seas. None of us realized that a ferocious tropical storm had hit the island, and we were heading straight into it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-atonement.p9" pid="eHJE1B9fN06JBw2I6wpHBg" hash="X75WSw">We arrived in the harbor at Mulifanua. There was one narrow passage we were to go through along the reef. A light on the hill above the beach and a second lower light marked the narrow passage. When a boat was maneuvered so that the two lights were one above the other, the boat would be lined up properly to pass through the dangerous rocks that lined the passage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-atonement.p10" pid="q0pRkQ09U0OCaWnZvXUetw" hash="VZBh8g">But that night there was only one light. Two elders were waiting on the landing to meet us, but the crossing took much longer than usual. After watching for hours for signs of our boat, the elders tired and fell asleep, neglecting to turn on the second light, the lower light. As a result, the passage through the reef was not clear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-atonement.p11" pid="xpBku9h4KEOvvrPhSeUMiA" hash="iax3qQ">The captain maneuvered the boat as best he could toward the one upper light on shore while a crewman held the borrowed flashlight over the bow, searching for rocks ahead. We could hear the breakers crashing over the reef. When we were close enough to see them with the flashlight, the captain frantically shouted reverse and backed away to try again to locate the passage.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="76"></span>After many attempts, he knew it would be impossible to find the passage. All we could do was try to reach the harbor at Apia 40 miles (64 km) away. We were helpless against the ferocious power of the elements. I do not remember ever being where it was so dark.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-atonement.p13" pid="ioEY3nQr5EWGb661HnrPuQ" hash="03OuqA">We made no progress for the first hour, even though the engine was at full throttle. The boat would struggle up a mountainous wave and then pause in exhaustion at the top of the crest with the propellers out of the water. The vibration of the propellers would shake the boat almost to pieces before it slid down the other side.</p>

Boats were lashed to one another for safety. They were several deep at the pier. We crawled across them, trying not to disturb those sleeping on deck. We made our way to Pesega, dried our clothing, and headed for Vailuutai to organize the new stake.</p>

The nests in the vines are safe from foxes and raccoons and cats that are about.</p>

Desperate cries of distress came as 8 or 10 finches from the surrounding woods came to join in this cry of alarm. I soon saw the source of the commotion. A snake had slid partway down out of the ivy and hung in front of the window just long enough for me to pull it out. The middle part of the snake’s body had two bulges—clear evidence convicting it of taking two fledglings from the nest. Not in the 50 years we had lived in our home had we seen anything like that. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience—or so we thought.</p>

He rose to greatness, but he started as a 14-year-old boy who had a question: “Which of all the churches should I join?” (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Joseph Smith—History 1:10</a>). Joseph’s faith and testimony of the Savior grew as ours must grow, “line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 28:30</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 128:21</a>).

He presides over this Church. He is no stranger to His servants. As we move into the future with quiet confidence, His Spirit will be with us. There is no end to His power to bless and direct the lives of those who seek truth and righteousness. I bear witness of Him in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

There I met Donna Smith. About that time I read that two essential ingredients to a successful marriage are a cookie and a kiss. I thought that was a pretty good balance.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p6" pid="4GBGgq7YbEyHpbTfaLZgHg" hash="ACsXuw">I attended college in the morning and then went back to Brigham City to work in my father’s auto-repair garage in the afternoon. Donna’s last morning class was home economics. I stopped by her classroom before leaving. The door had a frosted glass window, but if I stood close to the glass, she could see my shadow outside. She would slip out with a cookie and a kiss. The rest is history. We were married in the Logan Temple, and that began the great adventure of our lives.</p>

And the Gods said: We will cause them to be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.27-28" class="scriptureRef">Abraham 4:27–28</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p11" pid="xePPwowME0CnBWnb6A4nRQ" hash="E1Oeuw">And so the cycle of human life began on this earth as “Adam knew his wife, and she bare unto him sons and daughters, and they began to multiply and to replenish the earth.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p12" pid="txwvGAN2c0276ltuThXesA" hash="ED6BVQ">“And … the sons and daughters of Adam began to divide two and two in the land, … and they also begat sons and daughters” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:2–3</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p13" pid="YTkFyrG8qUeO6mbYCdJWhA" hash="FrUAuQ">The commandment to multiply and replenish the earth has never been rescinded. It is essential to the plan of redemption and is the source of human happiness. Through the righteous exercise of this power, we may come close to our Father in Heaven and experience a fulness of joy, even godhood. The power of procreation is not an incidental part of the plan; it is the plan of happiness; it is the key to happiness.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p14" pid="liGqd--dR0anTfBObf1R9A" hash="8iuT0A">The desire to mate in humankind is constant and very strong. Our happiness in mortal life, our joy and exaltation are dependent upon how we respond to these persistent, compelling physical desires. As the procreative power matures in early manhood and womanhood, very personal feelings occur, in a natural way, unlike any other physical experience.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p15" pid="p_6ogLF5VE2LJq5Iq0x8DA" hash="tLDYCQ">Ideally, mating begins with romance. Though customs may vary, it flourishes with all the storybook feelings of excitement and anticipation, even sometimes rejection. There are moonlight and roses, love letters, love songs, poetry, the holding of hands, and other expressions of affection between a young man and a young woman. The world disappears around the couple, and they experience feelings of joy.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p16" pid="oNKyRbI1kEyMK3HHvdMVGw" hash="4RLQ0g">And if you suppose that the full-blown rapture of young romantic love is the sum total of the possibilities which spring from the fountains of life, you have not yet lived to see the devotion and the comfort of longtime married love. Married couples are tried by temptation, misunderstandings, financial problems, family crises, and illness, and all the while love grows stronger. Mature love has a bliss not even imagined by newlyweds.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p17" pid="sli9atoT5kqKkozvZtt6lQ" hash="Mr-iNQ">True love requires reserving until after marriage the sharing of that affection which unlocks those sacred powers in that fountain of life. It means avoiding situations where physical desire might take control. Pure love presupposes that only after a pledge of eternal fidelity, a legal and lawful ceremony, and ideally after the sealing ordinance in the temple are those procreative powers released in God’s eye for the full expression of love. It is to be shared solely and only with that one who is your companion forever.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p18" pid="GHbm8y6d7kSzRmNU7vuLGw" hash="uBjc9g">When entered into worthily, this process combines the most exquisite and exalted physical, emotional, and spiritual feelings associated with the word <span class="emphasis">love.</span> That part of life has no equal, no counterpart, in all human experience. It will, when covenants are made and kept, last eternally, “for therein are the keys of the holy priesthood ordained, that you may receive honor and glory” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:34</a>), “which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 132:19</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p19" pid="ML1LAMxvw0m2bGWaJ9P5oQ" hash="BcUiWw">But romantic love is incomplete; it is a prelude. Love is nourished by the coming of children, who spring from that fountain of life entrusted to couples in marriage. Conception takes place in a wedded embrace between husband and wife. A tiny body begins to form after a pattern of magnificent complexity. A child comes forth in the miracle of birth, created in the image of its earthly father and mother. Within its mortal body is a spirit able to feel and perceive spiritual things. Dormant in that mortal body of this child is the power to beget offspring in its own image.</p>

There are eternal laws, including laws relating to this power to give life, “irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:20</a>). These are spiritual laws which define the moral standard for mankind (see Joseph Smith Translation, Romans 7:14–15 [in the Bible appendix]; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.5" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 2:5</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 29:34</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/134.6" class="scriptureRef">134:6</a>). There are covenants which bind, seal, and safeguard and give promise of eternal blessings.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p21" pid="TPfwlaq7rk6DmOlHhVMLuA" hash="XAbzVA">Alma admonished his son Shiblon, “See that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 38:12</a>). A bridle is used to guide, to direct, to restrain. Our passion is to be controlled. When lawfully used, the power of procreation will bless and will sanctify (see <span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph F. Smith</span> [1998], 158).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p22" pid="0RV0r0LB4EqeoxDuMRaEAw" hash="Mpg7ug">Temptations are ever present. Because the adversary cannot beget life, he is jealous toward all who have that supernal power. He and those who followed him were cast out and forfeited the right to a mortal body. “He seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 2:27</a>). He will tempt, if he can, to degrade, to corrupt, and, if possible, to destroy this gift by which we may, if we are worthy, have eternal increase (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.28-31" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 132:28–31</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p23" pid="2AyR2lOKO02Rk20ul8pBhw" hash="RO2E_A">If we pollute our fountains of life or lead others to transgress, there will be penalties more “exquisite” and “hard to bear” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:15</a>) than all the physical pleasure could ever be worth.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p24" pid="Qdh2T7kIuE2YXEaz8RN4xA" hash="B6jhVQ">Alma told his son Corianton, “Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.5" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:5</a>). We cannot escape the consequences when we transgress.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p25" pid="hIei0T8wyUGqXFMrh5dWRQ" hash="hJyFhw">The only legitimate, authorized expression of the powers of procreation is between husband and wife, a man and a woman, who have been legally and lawfully married. Anything other than this violates the commandments of God. Do not yield to the awful temptations of the adversary, for every debt of transgression must be paid “till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.26" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 5:26</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p26" pid="etqdcxHrc0CmRZFZt8tDFw" hash="Qc6mwA">Nowhere is the generosity and mercy of God more manifest than in repentance.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p27" pid="nYBiATtVtUqamA3xboSrsQ" hash="hCR7cg">Our physical bodies, when harmed, are able to repair themselves, sometimes with the help of a physician. If the damage is extensive, however, often a scar will remain as a reminder of the injury.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p28" pid="OqnhRIYjiUaE8Nl8dSVfHA" hash="-95HeQ">With our spiritual bodies it is another matter. Our spirits are damaged when we make mistakes and commit sins. But unlike the case of our mortal bodies, when the repentance process is complete, no scars remain because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The promise is: “Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:42</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p29" pid="Ctgu6iotOU-YpjmGlZAW1Q" hash="3xJZiA">When we speak of marriage and family life, there inevitably comes to mind, “What about the exceptions?” Some are born with limitations and cannot beget children. Some innocents have their marriage wrecked because of the infidelity of their spouse. Others do not marry and live in single worthiness.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p30" pid="wJ3D4s9viEW-49-a4Y7wbg" hash="k9v6WQ">For now I offer this comfort: God is our Father! All the love and generosity manifest in the ideal earthly father is magnified in Him who is our Father and our God beyond the capacity of the mortal mind to comprehend. His judgments are just; His mercy without limit; His power to compensate beyond any earthly comparison. “If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Corinthians 15:19</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p31" pid="DuV1YwQeu0yWf2V6dNfprA" hash="d0qe8w">Reverently now I use the word <span class="emphasis">temple.</span> I envision a sealing room and an altar with a young couple kneeling there. This sacred temple ordinance is much more than a wedding, for this marriage can be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise, and the scriptures declare that we “shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 132:19</a>). I see the joy that awaits those who accept this supernal gift and use it worthily.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p32" pid="JV1FOyK4WkuhkmwsA--nvw" hash="AWNBGA">Sister Donna Smith Packer and I have been side by side in marriage for nearly 70 years. When it comes to my wife, the mother of our children, I am without words. The feeling is so deep and the gratitude so powerful that I am left almost without expression. The greatest reward we have received in this life, and the life to come, is our children and our grandchildren. Toward the end of our mortal days together, I am grateful for each moment I am with her side by side and for the promise the Lord has given that there will be no end.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p33" pid="PAP0qrHgkUCkdyRKy3HBcw" hash="XMc8Ag">I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God. He stands at the head of the Church. Through His Atonement and the power of the priesthood, families which are begun in mortality can be together through the eternities. The Atonement, which can reclaim each one of us, bears no scars. That means that no matter what we have done or where we have been or how something happened, if we truly repent, He has promised that He would atone. And when He atoned, that settled that. There are so many of us who are thrashing around, as it were, with feelings of guilt, not knowing quite how to escape. You escape by accepting the Atonement of Christ, and all that was heartache can turn to beauty and love and eternity.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p34" pid="4PlseIA7F0-p4ygXnO9lpA" hash="Wo9KeQ">I am so grateful for the blessings of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the power of procreation, for the power of redemption, for the Atonement—the Atonement which can wash clean every stain no matter how difficult or how long or how many times repeated. The Atonement can put you free again to move forward, cleanly and worthily, to pursue that path that you have chosen in life.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-plan-of-happiness.p35" pid="rQm2B6dGnEGoH3n7pmFBjQ" hash="RGELLw">I bear witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that the Atonement is not a general thing that is for the whole Church. The Atonement is individual, and if you have something that is bothering you—sometimes so long ago you can hardly remember it—put the Atonement to work. It will clean it up, and you, as does He, will remember your sins no more. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
