Wellington and hold our missionary meeting on the top. We shall there seek to commune with the Lord and partake of his Spirit.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p2" guid="2d533aee-7eeb-4d2e-8e8f-090249d70659" pid="ZwQ2QYoTr0GLFEvD0akwrQ" hash="sORAJg">We made the climb, and while on top of the peak we visited a television broadcasting station. A bright young man explained to us in words I had never heard, and using principles I could not and do not understand, how the sounds and scenes of television were broadcast into the valley below.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p3" guid="c675ba8b-9eeb-4ad0-9428-d4fbf8bd00ea" pid="MQcF_54PeEqoJl0n2UTMag" hash="WMNbxg">That night, back in the city of Hobart, my two young sons and I sat before a television set that was tuned to the proper wave band, and we saw and heard and experienced what had been described to us in words.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p4" guid="7a4efae5-ca79-43d5-963f-d1b499906ca0" pid="gGXx9fBCg0-RinXzkNb7bA" hash="gcaZGQ">Now I think this illustrates perfectly what is involved in the receipt of revelation and the seeing of visions. We can read about visions and revelations in the records of the past, we can study the inspired writings of people who had the fullness of the gospel in their day, but we cannot comprehend what is involved until we see and hear and experience for ourselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p5" guid="1ff38a66-dcd4-41dd-81f9-753f92ac32b6" pid="54jSzpBdH0-yOQMVyf3EUw" hash="ZW8hXQ">This Tabernacle is now full of words and music. Handel’s <span class="emphasis">Messiah </span>is being sung, and the world’s statesmen are propagandizing their people. But we do not hear any of it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p6" guid="83e4ab16-860f-4733-ae7f-716a7530a05e" pid="m9XLhAG7CUmfosR0lYvWLw" hash="4p2mDg">This Tabernacle is full of scenes from Vietnam and Washington. There is even a picture of men walking on the surface of the moon. But we are not seeing these things. The minute, however, in which we tune a radio to the proper wave band and tune a television receiving set on the proper channel, we begin to hear and see and experience what otherwise remains completely unknown to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p7" guid="edd990e3-5322-4bf9-8dc6-86ccd9056759" pid="SqFeYrAMqkSbGv9GDL9A0A" hash="S3KUQA">And so it is with the revelations and visions of eternity. They are around us all the time. This Tabernacle is full of the same things which are recorded in the scriptures and much more. The vision of the degrees of glory is being broadcast before us, but we do not hear or see or experience because we have not tuned our souls to the wave band on which the Holy Ghost is broadcasting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p8" guid="a6706678-4a40-4396-bbab-b51851e3aa0f" pid="peYld9eXTkGw5BkOVjEKrw" hash="EqnW1Q">Joseph Smith said: “The Holy Ghost is a revelator.” And, “No man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelations.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith </span>[Deseret Book Co., 1968], p. 328.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p9" guid="edcacb74-d2e0-4f81-b77e-ffc8e9feef5d" pid="DlsTfxQQ90GJJksVpC89_A" hash="h5bOjQ">Moroni said: “… by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.5" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:5</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p11" guid="10d99057-6a57-49ed-a692-ad181885b25a" pid="5mC3B5ZXg0mEqr7GSuh1zQ" hash="mFPUxQ">How this is done we do not know. We cannot comprehend God or the laws by which he governs the universe. But that it does happen we know because here in the valley below, when we attune our souls to the Infinite, we hear and see and experience the things of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p12" guid="a6c0027e-f5db-4879-9d14-ba162d0a5217" pid="a0sAdYdlmUmQHNXux-26xg" hash="-UeT9Q">The laws governing radio and television have existed from the time of Adam to the present moment, but only in modern times have men heard and seen and experienced these miraculous things. And the laws have always existed whereby men can see visions, hear the voice of God, and partake of the things of the Spirit. But millions of people everywhere live and die without tasting the good word of God, because they do not obey the laws which implant the revelations of the Lord in their souls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p13" guid="78fa4e9b-381b-4784-b944-a12ff6cdb0ba" pid="yVawmm7vbk-vtKSRlRZihQ" hash="ehcUnw">And may I say that the only way to gain true religion is to receive it from the Lord. True religion is revealed religion; it is not a creation of man’s devising; it comes from God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p14" guid="5e15ac48-0d26-4943-b6cd-259fd964e51d" pid="Oiu_JSdGTUauUlEX5m3tTw" hash="hT1MQQ">Man did not create God, nor can he redeem himself. No man can resurrect himself or assign himself to an inheritance in a heavenly kingdom. Salvation comes from God, on his terms, and the things men must do to gain it can be known only by revelation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p15" guid="0d5908db-ae92-44ea-86f4-ec55155b416a" pid="HUEnj1u9gUWep_KOYtSneA" hash="QW4dcQ">God stands revealed or he remains forever unknown, and the things of God are and can be known only by and through the Spirit of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p16" guid="277d2e10-f6bd-4e12-89e3-34dc212eb7dd" pid="B4u6yKubZU2yLoqv9QjsDw" hash="Adbpbg">True religion deals with spiritual things. We do not come to a knowledge of God and his laws through intellectuality, or by research, or by reason. I have an average mind—one that is neither better nor worse than the general run of mankind. In the realm of intellectual attainment I have a doctor’s degree, and I hope my sons after me will reach a similar goal. In their sphere, education and intellectuality are devoutly to be desired.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p17" guid="b0dddc80-a98b-4e5e-bf68-64a397a2e47b" pid="_V93-iLYFEC7t9n70-O1Gw" hash="Q9Y9vQ">But when contrasted with spiritual endowments, they are of but slight and passing worth. From an eternal perspective what each of us needs is a Ph.D. in faith and righteousness. The things that will profit us everlastingly are not the power to reason, but the ability to receive revelation; not the truths learned by study, but the knowledge gained by faith; not what we know about the things of the world, but our knowledge of God and his laws.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p18" guid="ea4d0a85-b5a9-4124-909d-0ae11afa4460" pid="cHwmeLMFOUmkXLk4Gn33wg" hash="ucfj9A">Joseph Smith said that a man could learn more about the things of God by looking into heaven for five minutes than by reading all the books ever written upon the subject of religion. Religion is something which must be experienced.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p19" guid="1e8b8d44-f1e9-47b9-8cee-5db96176b35c" pid="kcacLjXrzky58v63h1XxvQ" hash="f3fN0A">I know people who can talk endlessly about religion but who have never had a religious experience. I know people who have written books about religion but who have about as much spirituality as a cedar post. Their interest in gospel doctrine is to defend their own speculative views rather than to find out what the Lord thinks about whatever is involved. Their conversations and their writings are in the realm of reason and the intellect; the Spirit of God has not touched their souls; they have not been born again and become new creatures of the Holy Ghost; they have not received revelation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-lords-people-receive-revelation.p20" guid="088ef396-1270-427f-8386-f3a94abf6e74" pid="rg9MytX7m0OCNaTxmKLvWg" hash="Mit5Vg">It is the privilege and the right of every member of the Church to receive revelation and to enjoy the gifts of the Spirit. When we are confirmed members of the Church, we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is the right to the constant companionship of that member of the Godhead, based on faithfulness. The actual enjoyment of this gift depends upon personal worthiness. “God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit,” the revelation says to the Saints, “yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:26</a>.)</p>

I now seek, most sincerely and devoutly, to be guided by the power of the Holy Ghost in bearing testimony of the truth and divinity of this glorious work in which we are all engaged. I pray also that the spirit of light and truth and edification so far present in this meeting may continue to rest in your hearts, so that you, being edified, will know of yourselves that those things about which I shall testify are true.</p>

The first of these gifts listed in our modern revelation on spiritual gifts is the gift of testimony, the gift of revelation, the gift of knowing of the truth and divinity of the work. This gift is elsewhere described as the testimony of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy. This is my gift. I know this work is true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/i-know-that-my-redeemer-lives.p3" guid="ec4a8a94-8fb3-4689-ae78-0e6776c6def4" pid="6okuTwsYtEenYuSb0dBxpQ" hash="L0ZSXw">I have a perfect knowledge that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that he was crucified for the sins of the world. I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God through whose instrumentality the fullness of the everlasting gospel has been restored again in our day. And I know that this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the kingdom of God on earth, and that as now constituted, with President Harold B. Lee at its head, it has the approval and approbation of the Lord, is in the line of its duty, and is preparing a people for the second coming of the Son of Man.</p>

To us in this day he gives the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, even as he did to them of old. “I will tell you” the glories and wonders of the everlasting gospel, he says; “I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2-3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 8:2–3</a>.)</p>

I know God speaks in this day because he has spoken to me. I rejoice in the privilege and opportunity to serve as a witness of his name, to teach the truths of salvation which he has revealed, and then to testify that these doctrines are true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/i-know-that-my-redeemer-lives.p6" guid="b9de8b27-54c4-4b98-981b-9aeff977eb17" pid="ubugF9OG1k-EUdvdos_jlg" hash="ANB3aA">This course of teaching sound doctrine and of testifying of the truth is the Lord’s system. Religion comes from God. There is no other source. That which is true, that which brings joy and peace into the hearts of men in this world and prepares them for eternal glory in the world to come—all this originates with the Lord. Man can no more create saving religion than he can resurrect himself.</p>

His system is now and always has been to reveal to apostles and prophets and righteous men the doctrines and truths of salvation and to command them to teach those truths and to bear witness of their verity to the world. They are to bear testimony that they know their teachings come from the Lord. His representatives and servants are always witnesses of the truth. I rejoice in the privilege of standing as a witness of the truth in this day.</p>

Lee, a seer, a man filled with the spirit of revelation and of wisdom who is on intimate terms with that Lord whose we are; President N.

Romney, a spiritual giant, a preacher of righteousness, who knows the Lord and teaches his doctrine. President Romney and I are members of the same family. After I had been told of my call, he said to me, “I think Granddad Redd [Lemuel Hardison Redd] will be glad to receive us.” I said, “I am going to live so I will be worthy to go where he is.” He said, “So am I.”</p>

He is our Savior and Redeemer. He came into the world to redeem men from the temporal and spiritual death brought into the world by the fall of Adam, and he gave to us a plan and system of salvation that is called the gospel of Jesus Christ. This plan of salvation is that all men everywhere should have faith in Christ; should repent of their sins; should covenant in the waters of baptism to keep the commandments and serve God with all their heart, might, mind, and strength; that they should then receive the gift and companionship of the Holy Spirit and thereafter live in righteousness and devotion all their days, with the assurance and promise that by so doing they shall gain peace in this life and eternal glory in the life to come.</p>

Keys and power, authority and priesthood have been given again to mortal men, and once again we have all of the laws and the prerogatives and possess all of the powers that are needed to save and exalt a human soul. We have in this kingdom, in this church, the keys of the kingdom of God, the keys of salvation for all men everywhere.</p>

Now this places upon us the obligation of learning how we are going to do this thing, this thing of such incomparable and transcendent magnitude. How are we going to proclaim the truths of salvation among our own people and take the message of the restoration to the world?</p>

Then he said on another occasion that we were sent out “to testify and warn the people. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.81" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:81</a>.)</p>

The record says that “they were men of a sound understanding,” who “had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God. But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 17:2–3</a>.)</p>

On the one hand we are obligated and required to know the doctrines of the Church. We are to treasure up the words of eternal life. We are to reason as intelligently as we are able. We are to use every faculty and capacity with which we are endowed to proclaim the message of salvation and to make it intelligent to ourselves and to our Father’s other children. But after we have done that, and also in the process of doing it, we are obligated to bear testimony—to let the world know and our associate members of the Church know—that in our hearts, by the revelation of the Holy Spirit to our souls, we know of the truth and divinity of the work and of the doctrines that we teach.</p>

Peter and his associates had the same obligation for their day that we have for ours: to carry the message of salvation to the ends of the earth. I suppose Peter read and taught the revelations that Isaiah and the prophets gave about Christ and his gospel. He reasoned with the people about them. He followed the divine counsel, “Come now, and let us reason together. …” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/1.18" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 1:18</a>.) He obeyed the divine decree, “… bring forth your strong reasons.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/41.title" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 41: 21</a>.)</p>

After he had taught the doctrines and after he had reasoned, he bore a personal witness of the truth and divinity of what he was presenting to his fellowmen; and the Lord prepared him to do just that by giving him spiritual experiences, by letting the power of the Holy Spirit rest upon him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/upon-judeas-plains.p14" guid="cb5f3189-1c62-47cd-8cde-d8bcad2eb03e" pid="EwuPfE0o2UeZ8Wc3hs57qw" hash="8fJrHQ">You will recall, for instance, that Peter and some others of the Twelve and a small group of saints were assembled in an upper room; that the Lord Jesus appeared; that the people there assembled were terrified and affrighted; and that the Lord said to them: “Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.38-39" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:38–39</a>.) Then they stretched forth their hands and felt the wound marks that scarred his body. He called for meat and ate it before them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/upon-judeas-plains.p15" guid="2adc4fb2-9e9b-4837-998e-09464a604536" pid="qHpagJzsi02WXa9xx9eXgg" hash="_1Kfyw">Thomas was absent on this occasion and believed not the testimony of his fellow disciples; eight days later the Lord made a similar appearance to the whole group and said to him: “Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.” Thomas said: “My Lord and my God.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.24-28" class="scriptureRef">John 20:24–28</a>.)</p>

It was the Lord’s way of giving to Peter and his associates a witness of the truth and divinity of his divine Sonship. If he rose from the dead, he was the Son of God; if he was the Son of God, then the gospel of salvation they were proclaiming was true; and so their obligation was to establish in the minds of men that Jesus rose from the dead. Now as I say, they might have attempted to do this by quoting Isaiah, or reasoning out of the revelations, which of course they did; but having so done, they then had to bear a personal witness; and I now read a sample of such a witness that Peter bore. He said to a group of assembled gentiles:</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/upon-judeas-plains.p30" guid="873b18fc-5ff4-4443-a87b-a52b96ad43b8" pid="zd23l2ER-kK02jMlQ_ohdw" hash="bSPGCg">Now Peter could have reasoned at great length, and after having so done people could have argued with him and said, “You don’t understand the scriptures. Your interpretations are in error. This or that is wrong.” But you can’t argue with a testimony, and so after Peter had reasoned, if he then said to them, as he must have done in substance and in thought content on many occasions, if he said to them, “I was in an upper room. The Lord Jesus came through the wall. He appeared to us. I recognized him. He was the same person with whom I had labored and traveled for three and a half years. He is the person who lived in my home in Capernaum. I then felt the nail marks in his hands and in his feet. I thrust my hand into his side. I was there when he ate food and drank before us. I know he is the Son of God. The Holy Spirit of God has borne this witness to my soul”—if he said this to them, there was nothing left to debate. You can’t argue with that kind of a presentation. You can say, as Festus said to Paul: “Thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/26.24" class="scriptureRef">Acts 26:24</a>), but in the final analysis all you can do is accept or reject the witness that is borne. It is either true or it is false. There is no middle ground.</p>

Well, you reason out of the revelations. You can make a good case; and that isn’t any problem. The truth is with us. The Lord is the author of the system we have received. But after you have reasoned and after you have analyzed, you have got to stand as a personal witness who knows what he is saying. You have to do what the sons of Mosiah did—speak and teach by the spirit of prophecy and the spirit of revelation; and the result is that you speak as one having authority. This is the great thing that separates us from the world, and thanks be to God we have this knowledge. We have received this revelation, and we are in a position to speak as those having authority.</p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith said that if we would come together and strip ourselves of jealousies and have perfect faith, that the veil might as well be rent today as at any time. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/67.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 67:10</a>; <span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, </span>p. 9.) I think that when the Lord dwelt in the city of Enoch, without question he spoke in their congregations; and when in due course he will reign in millennial splendor on the earth, he will do exactly the same thing again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/think-on-these-things.p3" guid="dff1f65f-6f45-48b3-9303-06d3721e8115" pid="wSVgpDsGPEKpjTfp4_yOoQ" hash="FHo4iQ">But we also operate under the principle that the word of eternal truth which is given to the children of men, whether it comes by his own voice or the voice of his servants, it is the same. And I had it impressed upon me, when President Lee opened the conference yesterday, and again when President Romney bore the persuasive and powerful and true witness that has just come from his lips, that if the Lord himself were here, those statements which came from them are the very things that he would say at this time.</p>

They hold the keys of the kingdom of God on earth at this hour and from them come the words of life and truth and revelation that will give us, if we conform to them, peace in this life and eternal glory in the life to come.</p>

I desire, if I may be so guided, to counsel the Latter-day Saints to take an affirmative, wholesome attitude toward world and national conditions; to turn their backs on everything that is evil and destructive; to look for that which is good and edifying in all things; to praise the Lord for his goodness and grace in giving us the glories and wonders of his everlasting gospel.</p>

The issue, I think, is not <span class="emphasis">what </span>we should do but <span class="emphasis">how </span>we should do it; and I maintain that the most beneficial and productive thing which Latter-day Saints can do to strengthen every good and proper cause is to live and teach the principles of the everlasting gospel.</p>

We must speak the truth and work the works of righteousness. We shall be judged by our thoughts, our words and our deeds.</p>

It is the Lord himself who said that he, at the day of his coming, will be a swift witness against those that oppress the hireling in his wages.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/think-on-these-things.p18" guid="5407cb8d-b379-4796-bf9d-7227f76d4cc7" pid="waHcXOWyDUKG0zw-UMYBdg" hash="y1x0oQ">Third, “… he that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes.” That is, we must reject every effort to buy influence, and instead deal fairly and impartially with our fellowmen. God is no respecter of persons. He esteemeth all flesh alike; and those only who keep his commandments find special favor with him. Salvation is free; it cannot be purchased with money; and those only are saved who abide the law upon which its receipt is predicated. Bribery is of the world.</p>

We must cease to find fault and look for good in government and in the world. We must take an affirmative, wholesome approach to all things.</p>

If we think evil thoughts, our tongues will utter unclean sayings. If we speak words of wickedness, we shall end up doing the works of wickedness. If our minds are centered on the carnality and evil of the world, then worldliness and unrighteousness will seem to us to be the normal way of life. If we ponder things related to sex immorality in our minds, we will soon think everybody is immoral and unclean and it will break down the barrier between us and the world. And so with every other unwholesome, unclean, impure, and ungodly course. And so it is that the Lord says he hates and esteems as an abomination, “an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations. …” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/6.18" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 6:18</a>.)</p>

If virtue garnishes our thoughts unceasingly, our confidence shall wax strong in the presence of God and he in turn will rain down righteousness upon us. Truly as Jacob said, “… to be carnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.39" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:39</a>.) And as Paul said, “Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/6.7-8" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 6:7–8</a>.)</p>

Brother Packer yesterday pleaded with eloquence that we sing the songs of Zion in order to center our thoughts on wholesome things. I would like to add that we can also—after we have had the opening song—call on ourselves to preach a sermon. I have preached many sermons walking along congested city streets, or tramping desert trails, or in lonely places, thus centering my mind on the Lord’s affairs and the things of righteousness; and I might say they have been better sermons than I have ever preached to congregations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/think-on-these-things.p25" guid="55952b74-cd5d-409e-9adc-3c3b30878085" pid="8wBD2EOQckCEltnS7h4Xng" hash="kQkjEA">If we are going to work out our salvation, we must rejoice in the Lord. We must ponder his truths in our hearts. We must rivet our attention and interests upon him and his goodness to us. We must forsake the world and use all our strength, energies and abilities in furthering his work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/think-on-these-things.p26" guid="894bf0b6-4381-4705-83d8-f5a680e83249" pid="ixC61kkLDkOOgJCmCU5yDg" hash="V7snAQ">I think the Lord’s people should rejoice in him and shout praises to his holy name. Cries of hosannah should ascend from our lips continually. When I think of the revealed knowledge we have about him whom it is life eternal to know, and of the great plan of salvation which he ordained for us; when I think about his Beloved Son, who bought us with his blood, and who brought life and immortality to light through his atoning sacrifice; when I think of the life and ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who has done more save Jesus only for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man who ever lived in it, and who crowned his mortal ministry with a martyr’s death—my soul wells up with eternal gratitude and I desire to raise my voice with the choirs above in ceaseless praise to him who dwells on high.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/think-on-these-things.p27" guid="1ccd1b45-0936-403e-854f-1f2a265e5c48" pid="ubUOLXlYUESSom6_4vxvwA" hash="2ylanw">When I think that the Lord has a living oracle guiding his earthly kingdom, and that there are apostles and prophets who walk the earth again; when I think that the Lord has given us—the gift and power of the Holy Ghost so that we have the revelations of heaven and the power to sanctify our souls; when I think of the unnumbered blessings—the gifts, the miracles, the promise that the family unit shall go on everlastingly, all the blessings that are poured out upon us, and offered freely to all men everywhere—my desire to praise the Lord and proclaim his goodness and grace knows no bounds. And so in this spirit of praise and thanksgiving, which is the same spirit that attended the expressions made by President Romney this morning, I shall conclude with these words of my own psalm:</p>

Those of us who sit almost daily at the feet of Presidents Spencer W. Kimball, N. Eldon Tanner, and Marion G. Romney marvel at the wisdom and judgment that attend their decisions and recognize them as preachers of righteousness of the same stature as Peter, James, and John, who were the First Presidency of the church in their day.</p>

His hand is in it. He knows the end from the beginning. He ordained and established the plan of salvation and decreed that his everlasting gospel should be revealed to man in a series of dispensations commencing with Adam and continuing to Joseph Smith. And he—the Almighty—chooses the prophets and apostles who minister in his name and present his message to the world in every age and dispensation. He selects and foreordains his ministers; he sends them to earth at the times before appointed; he guides and directs their continuing mortal preparations; and he then calls them to those positions they were foreordained to receive from before the foundations of the earth.</p>

Kimball as an illustration and pattern of one who was prepared, foreordained, and called to leadership among the Lord’s people. He was, it is true, born in the household of faith. Like Jacob, who inherited spiritual talents from Isaac and Abraham, so is he endowed by natural inheritance with those talents and abilities that prepare him for his present position of apostolic presidency.</p>

He was born in the household of faith for a reason, and it was not this life alone that prepared him to stand as a minister of light and truth and salvation to his fellow mortals. The fact is, he is a spirit son of God who was called and chosen and foreordained before the foundations of the earth were laid, and he is now fulfilling the destiny designed for him from the preexistence, and promised him, in our presence, as we sat with him in the grand council when God himself was there.</p>

We know he gave us our agency and ordained the laws by obedience to which we can obtain eternal life. We know we had friends and associates there. We know we were schooled and trained and taught in the most perfect educational system ever devised, and that by obedience to his eternal laws we developed infinite varieties and degrees of talents.</p>

When we come into mortality, we bring the talents, capacities, and abilities acquired by obedience to law in our prior existence. Mozart composed and published sonatas when but eight years of age because he was born with musical talent. Melchizedek came into this world with such faith and spiritual capacity that “when a child he feared God, and stopped the mouths of lions, and quenched the violence of fire.” (JST, Gen. 14:26.) Cain, on the other hand, like Lucifer, was a liar from the beginning and was told in this life: “… thou shalt be called Perdition; for thou wast also before the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.24" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:24</a>.)</p>

It is his voice that calls for service and sacrifice. This is his work. He is at the helm guiding and directing the destiny of his kingdom.</p>

Another such event altered the course of history when an aged prophet believed God and built an ark wherein he and seven others, out of all the inhabitants of the earth, were saved from a watery grave.</p>

Yet another of these events, destined to affect the life and being of every living soul, happened in the Arimathean’s tomb when the sinless spirit of the one perfect man returned from the paradise of God to inhabit again—this time in glorious immortality—the pierced and slain body that once was his.</p>

Was it on the sixth of April? Perhaps—such at least is the tradition. But be that as it may, what transpired at that time was destined to affect the salvation of the billions of our Father’s children who should live on earth from that day to the great winding up scene when the Son shall deliver up the kingdom, spotless, to his Father.</p>

It was a day of spiritual darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains. Angels no longer ministered to their fellow beings; the voice of God was stilled, and man no longer saw the face of his Maker; gifts, signs, miracles, and all the special endowments enjoyed by the saints of old were no longer the common inheritance of those in whose hearts religious zeal was planted. There were no visions, no revelations, no rending of the heavens; the Lord was not raining down righteousness upon a chosen people as he had done in days of old.</p>

The religion of the lowly Nazarene was nowhere to be found. All sects, parties, and denominations had gone astray. Satan rejoiced and his angels laughed. Such were the social and religious conditions of the day.</p>

Eighteen twenty was to be the year when the Great Jehovah would commence the restitution of all things spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began. The covenants made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob concerning their seed were about to be fulfilled.</p>

And thanks be to God, when the hour arrived to usher in the dispensation of the fulness of times, there was Joseph Smith, the mighty prophet of latter-days.</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.10" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:10</a>.) In the midst of these contentious times, God’s future prophet often said to himself: “What is to be done?

If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.10" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:10</a>.)</p>

Enjoy the words of eternal life in this life, and hope for immortal glory in the life to come. Read, ponder, and pray about all that the prophets have written. Such is the course which the Lord invites men to pursue where his holy word is concerned. And it was into this path of progress and enlightenment that young Joseph was led by that providential hand which knows the end from the beginning and rules in love and mercy over all his children.</p>

It is a superlative spiritual endowment which in its very nature sets the Latter-day Saints apart from the world and makes them a peculiar people.

It is truly a wondrous thing for earthbound eyes to pierce the fogs and darkness of our planet and see within the gates of heaven. It is marvelous, almost beyond belief, that mere mortals can begin to comprehend him who is eternal, can know of a surety of things past, present, and future, and can have the assurance of an eternal inheritance with immortal beings who dwell in everlasting glory.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.13" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:13</a>.)

Ye Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, ye Saints of the Most High, ye devout souls who seek salvation: What think ye? Is salvation in Christ or look we for another?

How carefully and aptly Jesus preserves the distinction between him and all men. He is the Son of God; Peter is the son of Jonah. The Father of Jesus is the Immortal Man of Holiness; Peter’s sire is a mortal man.</p>

Smith, Heber J. Grant, George Albert Smith, David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, and Spencer W. Kimball; and that this holy Apostleship and these keys will continue to descend from one Apostle to another until the Lord Jesus Christ comes in the clouds of heaven to reign personally upon the earth. And this I say not of myself, but in the name of the Lord, standing as his representative and saying what he would say if he personally were here. His is the only name given under heaven whereby salvation comes, and we are his ministers. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

On a wondrous day in April of 1836, Moses and Elijah and Elias each come, bringing from their dispensations the keys and powers they had exercised as mortals.

It contains a record of God’s dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas. It is another testament of Jesus Christ.</p>

This ancient record was then translated by the gift and power of God and is now published to the world as the Book of Mormon.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/what-think-ye-of-the-book-of-mormon.p10" pid="66yXSmCgQ06mA2WMvUqH5A" hash="LC0ePQ">All of this I explained to my two Protestant friends. One of them, a congenial and decent sort of fellow, said somewhat casually that he would read the Book of Mormon. The other minister, manifesting a bitter spirit, said: “I won’t read it. We have experts who have read the Book of Mormon, and I have read what our experts have to say about it.”</p>

There are sincere and devout people everywhere who have heard what other people say about this volume of holy writ, and so they do not read it themselves.</p>

If the Book of Mormon is true—if it is a volume of holy scripture, if it contains the mind and will and voice of the Lord to all men, if it is a divine witness of the prophetic call of Joseph Smith—then to accept it and believe its doctrines is to be saved, and to reject it and walk contrary to its teachings is to be damned.</p>

Those who believe the Book of Mormon and accept Joseph Smith as a prophet thereby open the door to salvation; those who reject the book outright or who simply fail to learn its message and believe its teachings never so much as begin to travel that course along the strait and narrow path that leads to eternal life.</p>

And, once again, after the meeting I had a private discussion with them.</p>

Taking the Book of Mormon as their guide, they must read, ponder, and pray in order to gain a witness from the Spirit as to the truth and divinity of this great latter-day work.</p>

In his reading he had done no more than scan a few of the headings and read an isolated verse or two.</p>

At this point she spoke up and said, “But Reverend, you have to pray about it.”</p>

He desired not alone to act as a scribe to Joseph Smith but also to translate directly from the plates. After much importuning, the Lord permitted Brother Cowdery to try.</p>

Then came the divine word: “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.” That is, he had not done all that in his power lay; he had expected the Lord to do it all merely because he asked.</p>

On the other hand, if we say it is true when in fact it is not, we are thereby leading men astray and surely deserve to drop down to the deepest hell.</p>

It declares plainly that all men must accept it as pure scripture or they will lose their souls. It is not and cannot be simply another treatise on religion; it either came from heaven or from hell. And it is time for all those who seek salvation to find out for themselves whether it is of the Lord or of Lucifer.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.44" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:44</a>.) This, then, is the test:</p>

It calls for us simply to read, ponder, and pray—all in the spirit of faith and with an open mind.
