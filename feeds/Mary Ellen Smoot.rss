Mordecai took in Esther as his own daughter after her parents passed away. He brought her to the palace. Esther pleased the king, and he made her his queen (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/esth/2.17" class="scriptureRef">Esth. 2:17</a>).</p>

Such an act was punishable by death. If she were to remain quiet, she would likely enjoy a life of luxury and ease. She could live the life of a queen or risk her life to save her family and her people. She counted the cost and chose to heed the longings of her people and of her heart.</p>

Then she said, “I [will] go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/esth/4.16" class="scriptureRef">Esth. 4:16</a>).</p>

The Spirit has borne witness to me that we each have been born “for such a time as this” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/esth/4.14" class="scriptureRef">Esth. 4:14</a>).</p>

The Church estimates that by the end of 1997, the membership of the Relief Society will exceed 4.1 million in 160 countries.

Despite the great challenges we individually and collectively face today, I’m sure you will agree, this is a wonderful time to be alive.

That perhaps the Savior would help me, through [service to] others? I am sure there are many disheartened sisters out there. Sisters, did you know this promise? Will you take that leap of faith with me? I’m not sure when the answers will come, but I do believe they will come. Already my prayers are being answered in ways that I never would have guessed; I know He is mindful of me and I pray He will continue to guide me, safely (and happily) to live with Him again. I pray that perhaps these words can give hope to anyone in need of hope.”</p>

This sister was faithful. She joined the Church 18 years ago and believed with all of her heart that she could have a family united in the gospel of Jesus Christ. However, her husband was not prepared to make the necessary lifestyle changes. He supported her decision but would not join. She had two sons who were being influenced by the decisions of her husband. In the course of her struggle, a dear sister gave her a tape of a talk by Elder M. Russell Ballard. From that tape she learned that faith and doubt cannot be in the mind at the same time. She firmly grasped onto this hope that the Lord would support her in her righteous desires if she would be faithful. She told no one but set a goal for her husband’s baptism and the reactivation of her two sons. New ideas kept coming into her mind as to what she could do to bring about this great promise. Slowly but surely she began to see progress. Her husband accepted the challenge <span class="emphasis">to take the discussions again, and her sons felt a new spirit in their home and started reacting positively.</span></p>

And finally, her husband was baptized and received the priesthood. Not coincidentally, her husband’s baptism was within three weeks of the date which this faithful sister set as her goal to unite her family in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

About 13 miles out of Baker, Oregon, the car spun out of control, left the road, and rolled two and a half times. The second time it rolled over, the mother, who was driving, and her youngest daughter, who was 10 years old, were thrown from the car. Because the car did not have enough momentum to complete the third roll, it rocked back and pinned the mother and her daughter beneath its weight. The father quickly surveyed the situation and, knowing that if the car was not moved quickly his wife would die, he bowed his head in humble prayer and then proceeded to lift the huge Buick, with its wheels still spinning. The youngest daughter crawled from beneath as his 12-year-old daughter pulled her mother from beneath the car. The mother was critically injured and in terrible pain. As the father tended to the others, the 12-year-old daughter knelt beside her mother to comfort her. The mother reached for the girl’s hand and said, “Always remember who you are, and always be a good girl.”</p>

Amid the critical moments of that evening as the mother teetered between life and death, she pled with her Father in Heaven to spare her life long enough to see her six daughters married to worthy men in the house of the Lord. She promised that if He would grant her this righteous desire, she would then be ready to go, and she would dedicate her life to Him.</p>

That day was the fulfillment of a sacred covenant between a beloved daughter of God and her loving Heavenly Father. The woman, her husband, their six daughters, and their eternal companions stood together in the house of the Lord. Her earnest plea from a hospital bed years before had been heard and fulfilled.</p>

They were made by a modern-day pioneer, Brother Robert King, while he was serving as a missionary in Nauvoo. He was the first member of his family to join the Church, or so he thought. Brother King and his wife are currently serving as family history missionaries, and in the course of his research, he discovered that his great-grandfather Reed and his great-uncle Abraham joined the Church in 1835. But Reed was lost. He wandered down unknown paths, and the tender seedling of faith within him died.</p>

As I have traveled and met new converts, their eyes ablaze with the joy and peace their newfound faith has brought them, I have seen them make great sacrifices to join the fold. We must honor their sacrifice by loving them and strengthening them. My desire is to plead with our sisters to stop worrying about a phone call or a quarterly or monthly visit, and whether that will do, and concentrate instead on nurturing tender souls. Our responsibility is to see that the gospel flame continues to burn brightly. Our charge is to find the lost sheep and help them feel our Savior’s love. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell says, “It is easier to find and to help ‘the one’ when the ‘ninety and nine’ are securely together.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Remember that the seed of faith was planted in the lives of both his great-grandfather Reed and his great-uncle Abraham. What became of Abraham? He kept the faith. Feeling fulfilled in the cause, Abraham endured the persecutions and trials of the pioneer migration west. Due to Abraham’s commitment to the cause of Zion, his posterity includes more than 2,000 members of the Church today.</p>

Do you ever like to imagine someday you will be invited to something grand, some event that will acknowledge your significance, your immeasurable worth? The anticipation is at least as much fun as the event itself. Even the mundane tasks add excitement and meaning when you prepare and plan for an event to which you’ve been invited. To this day, any envelope arriving in our mail that even resembles an invitation is the first to be opened.</p>

Some come as enticements or solicitations. Whether arriving in the mail, through the computer, or on television, they can lure and tempt—and actually mislead. But, thankfully, the invitations we receive from the scriptures, the prophets, and the Holy Ghost are invitations we can count on. They give us direction, peace, comfort, and joy. A still, small voice speaks to us and encourages righteous living. We must listen carefully to His beckoning and search our souls. As we do, clouds of darkness will dispel and the glorious light of God will fill our beings.</p>

It seemed to me that going to Relief Society each week helped me become a stronger and better sister. Not that I missed my other meetings; I didn’t. I went because I knew that’s where I was supposed to be. I went and then feasted on the word and especially Relief Society. It was my ‘relief’ and my ‘society.’ I belonged; I felt a part. I lost myself in lessons, service to others … and to my little child. I found if I kept my mind and hands busy there was less time to think of the pain of the past. … But through all those years what I remember most was the belonging I felt—to the organization my Lord and Savior gave to all the sisters, not just to me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Elder Bruce R. McConkie explained: “Faith is a gift of God bestowed as a reward for personal righteousness. It is always given when righteousness is present, and the greater the measure of obedience to God’s laws the greater will be the endowment of faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Many times we think just being a member of the Church will entitle us to all the Lord has promised. But each blessing requires obedience. The Lord declared, “When we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:21</a>). We gain strength by living the commandments.</p>

We follow the path of spiritual preparedness as it is set forth in scripture and by our living prophets. We take full fellowship in the Relief Society organization. This society, established and directed by our prophets through divine inspiration, is not just a Sunday meeting. It is an organization to bring sisters and their families unto Christ.</p>

You all know the story and its message. Allow me to review it with you. The Lord likened the kingdom of heaven to “a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</p>

He was also pleased with the servant who had two talents and gained two more. But he was not at all pleased with the servant who was given one talent and buried it in the earth. He took the talent from this servant and gave it to another (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.16-30" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:16–30</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p2" pid="DstYr4K5L0CwKADg7dWafA" hash="WYQlWw">I recently met a sister in Oregon who was brought back into activity because of a nurturing visiting teacher. Surely this visiting teacher must feel as Ammon and his brothers did when they rejoiced at having “been made instruments in the hands of God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:3</a>) in bringing the knowledge of Christ to Lamanites who had “been strangers to God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.9" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:9</a>). For “the worth of souls is great in the sight of God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:10</a>).</p>

I think of a ward in Brazil that has an influx of new members every week. The sisters in that Relief Society decided to set a goal to not let even one week pass without each newly baptized sister receiving a visit in her home and a copy of “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” and the Relief Society Declaration. So far they haven’t lost any sisters to inactivity.</p>

To date she has visited 25 sisters, and all but 3 of them have come back to church.</p>

All of us in the pursuit of our duty touch the lives of others. …</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p7" pid="9XI8wGvujkaWQwwIC-2_JQ" hash="gOQk3g">Truly, we may <span class="emphasis">each</span> be an instrument in the hands of God. Happily, we need not all be the same kind of instrument. Just as the instruments in an orchestra differ in size, shape, and sound, we too are different from one another. We have different talents and inclinations, but just as the French horn cannot duplicate the sound of the piccolo, neither is it necessary for us to all serve the Lord in the same way. Sister Eliza R. Snow said that “there is <span class="emphasis">no sister</span> so isolated and her sphere so narrow but what she can do a great deal towards establishing the Kingdom of God upon the earth” (<span class="emphasis">Woman’s Exponent,</span> 15 Sept. 1873, 62; emphasis added). Our privilege and our responsibility as daughters of God and as sisters of Relief Society, then, is to become the most effective instruments <span class="emphasis">we</span> can be.</p>

The Prophet Joseph, who organized the Relief Society in 1842, made it clear that the purpose of this divinely inspired organization was to not only “relieve the poor, but to save souls” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:25). Since its earliest days Relief Society has done incalculable good. The Relief Society provided the first carload of flour that reached survivors of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and later provided wheat to the United States government during World Wars I and II. Last year our sisters donated more than 140,000 quilts to help those in distress. We have championed motherhood and the family, waged war against illiteracy, and rendered untold hours of service throughout the world. But my declaration to you tonight is that our most crucial work lies ahead as we join with our priesthood leaders to help move the kingdom of God forward.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p9" pid="p1vpW7SDDUGHNdbB9lu8DQ" hash="vZrWBQ">Sisters, we are needed here—by the Lord, by our priesthood leaders, by our families, and by each other. The Lord needs us to embrace our eternal callings and fill the measure of our creation. He needs us to come home to Relief Society and look for ways to serve others in the name of His organization for women and to work together as sisters in helping the gospel kingdom move forward. Truly, Relief Society will help each of us serve our families and each other in ways that no other club or organization can.</p>

Kimball said: “In the world before we came here, faithful women were given certain assignments. … While we do not now remember the particulars, this does not alter the glorious reality of what we once agreed to. [We] are accountable for those things which long ago were expected of [us]” (“The Role of Righteous Women,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Nov. 1979, 102).</p>

Amid the pressures of life, how do we become the most effective instruments we can be in the hands of the Lord? There is a great deal about this that we can learn from the sons of Mosiah and from the Relief Society Declaration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p12" pid="BF4MQRT6MUO3NQDb2ICzXQ" hash="WGl6qQ">
        <span class="emphasis">Number 1.</span> Our own conversion must come first. The most important conversion for any of us is our own. If we are to bring the light of the gospel into others’ lives, it must shine brightly in our own. Once converted, the sons of Mosiah labored without ceasing to share the gospel with others, “for they could not bear that any human soul should perish” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28.3" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 28:3</a>). Only when <span class="emphasis">we</span> are converted to the Lord Jesus Christ are we in a position to strengthen others. And only then do we begin to understand that our lives truly do have meaning, purpose, and direction, and that as sisters united in our devotion to Jesus Christ our calling is to be a light to the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p13" pid="Na6ASLALakSBXsTFHKGbMw" hash="8Jyw1Q">
        <span class="emphasis">Number 2.</span> Like the sons of Mosiah, we must wax “strong in the knowledge of the truth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2" class="scriptureRef">Alma 17:2</a>). These brothers continually studied the gospel. Through fasting and prayer and immersing themselves in the scriptures, they came to know that Jesus is the Christ, and they learned to hear His voice.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p15" pid="_hjCbXgRwkiiU-Koddo9og" hash="n_8W1A">It is almost impossible to be an effective instrument within our own families, with our neighbors, or even from the pulpit unless we can discern the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. Ammon was able to perceive the thoughts of the Lamanite king because he was living close to the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/18.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 18:16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p16" pid="Kh2Rr9xNI0usum-CZckQBg" hash="c-qJrQ">Our ability to hear the voice of the Spirit is dependent upon our willingness to keep the commandments, for “when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:21</a>). If we want to experience the inexpressible joy of gospel living and feel of Christ’s atoning mercies, obedience to all, and not just a select few, of God’s commandments is the only way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p17" pid="RQO8x00w20-MFWKLK-3fmg" hash="GQirZQ">Have we received the immeasurable blessings of holding weekly family home evening and daily scripture study and prayer? Do we understand the far-reaching blessings of keeping our covenants and filling our minds with only that which is “virtuous, lovely, or of good report”? (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:13</a>). When obedience becomes a quest, it is no longer an irritation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p18" pid="JqwA6HlEAE6DUz-EROJ5DA" hash="9eMsUA">Relief Society can help us abide by divine laws and become closer to God. Imagine what goodness will fill the earth when, under the direction of the priesthood, this circle of righteous women unite to bring to pass righteous purposes! When we unitedly serve each other and all of our Father’s children, we can be instruments in the hands of God, not only to relieve physical suffering but, more importantly, to succor those who are in need spiritually.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p19" pid="M9rauLEra06R_NqSkuDpaw" hash="chpZVQ">
        <span class="emphasis">Number 3.</span> Service is a key to being an effective instrument. The sons of Mosiah chose to serve the Lamanites rather than assume leadership of their father’s kingdom. And in many instances, their service softened the hearts of the Lamanites and made them receptive to the gospel. When Lamoni’s servants were busy recounting Ammon’s exploits in fending off marauders, Ammon himself was in the stable feeding the horses and serving the king (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/18.9-10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 18:9–10</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p20" pid="MQcilMXTeECVkZsdZDpARg" hash="iTxCQw">We, too, delight in service and good works. Service softens and opens hearts, for it is truly the gospel in action. I know of a ward in Arizona where three families are currently investigating the Church, all as a direct result of compassionate service rendered by the Relief Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p21" pid="5jTjiJaG2U25dwYv_heD9A" hash="K_I3Lw">Relief Society affords us countless opportunities to develop and exercise the pure love of Christ in all aspects of our lives. For example, home, family, and personal enrichment meeting provides an ideal setting to learn and serve together. Service <span class="emphasis">is</span> the gospel of Jesus Christ in action, for service blesses both the giver and the receiver. Will you look for ways to channel your service through the organization of the Relief Society, realizing that service is one of the most effective ways we can bless others temporally and spiritually?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p22" pid="uPugms5Xb0inX_GO5dd0Mg" hash="SNt3FQ">
        <span class="emphasis">Number 4.</span> Love must undergird everything we do. As sisters of the Relief Society, we love the Lord, we love our families, we love life and learning, and we love one another. Lamoni’s father, who was king of the Lamanites, softened his heart when he saw how sincerely Ammon loved his son. Eventually Ammon’s love led to the conversion of Lamoni’s family (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/20.26-27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 20:26–27</a>). Our greatest and first concern with regard to conversion, retention, and activation must be to our own family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p23" pid="ERIMyte-2E-_y0Lbx-IHtA" hash="mhUaRA">Once again, Relief Society can help. Sister Elsa Bluhm, who is 102, knew the gospel was true. She loved the Lord. She met a good man and married him. He was from Germany, and he was not a member of the Church. Her husband had never been taught to pray. When Elsa knelt beside the bed each night, she would take his hand in hers and pray. After many years he joined the Church, and they were sealed in the temple. Before his passing, Brother Bluhm became an instrument in the hands of God by researching his German ancestors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p24" pid="UTXWjGC50kWYvRdnYukdgQ" hash="MLxnHQ">This happy ending began with one woman’s insistent, loving, righteous example. Elsa invited the Spirit into their home and marriage by loving her husband and loving the Lord. She was both faithful and filled with faith, even when at times she felt alone. She was an instrument in the hands of God in her own home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p25" pid="BNm0m1UCG0yTXxxqFQyzOA" hash="-zkeiQ">For each of us, our righteous examples may seem small, but by influence they are great. To all within your sphere of influence, “be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 4:12</a>). Let others feel the peace and joy that gospel living brings you. Invite your friends not of our faith or less-active members over for family home evening. Bring them to church and set an example of reverence for them. Let them see that you avoid movies or television shows or Internet sites that would drive the Spirit away and thus make us less-effective instruments.</p>

Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has indicated that if the missionary program of the Church is to accomplish all it must, we as sisters must join in the effort.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p27" pid="L_zS8qCXLU6v2ICNINLk9Q" hash="qNzqjQ">We don’t need a new program to spur us on—we need only incorporate the desire to share the gospel and reach out to new members and those who are less active in our existing programs. Whether we are serving as a visiting teacher or planning home, family, and personal enrichment meetings or teaching children in Primary or leading the youth, we can find ways to reach those who are new in the faith or whose faith has faltered or those who haven’t yet found the truth. We can be instruments in helping gather the Lord’s sheep back to the fold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p28" pid="TsM_T_RhW0arKAEAmyy2PA" hash="QWfs5Q">I know that we can. I know we can do it. We have brought warmth to tens of thousands of people around the world with our homemade quilts. We have demonstrated our willingness to serve and give and love. Now, let us find ways to give the gift of the gospel to those who need spiritual warmth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/we-are-instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p29" pid="ySt0gQAU20eUBB0RNznCwg" hash="iJYKfQ">When you return home this night, will you take a moment to write down impressions that come to your heart this evening? Will you think of specific ways you can be an instrument in the hands of God? Will you contemplate the blessings that await your obedience in this life and throughout eternity? And will you insert your name in the verse of this scripture and know with all of your soul that God loves you? “Continue in preaching for Zion, in the spirit of meekness, confessing me before the world; and I will bear [you] up as on eagles’ wings; and [you] shall beget glory and honor to [yourself] and unto my name” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:18</a>). I know that the gospel is true. I know that this work is of the Lord. I know that Jesus is the Christ and we have a true prophet on the earth today. Sweet is the work. Of this I humbly bear witness, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
