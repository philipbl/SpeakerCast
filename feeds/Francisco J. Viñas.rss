      <title>Listening to the Voice of the Lord</title>
      <link>http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord?lang=eng</link>
      <description>I have been reflecting lately on the importance that listening to the voice of the Lord has had in my life and in the lives of other people, especially when this voice comes through His servants and under the influence of the Holy Ghost.</description>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p2" pid="0pCZ_NKrI02MfNBxtOL9DQ" hash="sNZk1w">The fact that I am able to be here this afternoon is a blessing for which I must express appreciation to my parents, who, many years ago when the missionaries came to them, heard for the first time the voice of the Lord through His servants and hearkened to it. That changed the course of their lives and was a great influence in the lives of their children and grandchildren.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p3" pid="9y4zIVsMwke23B1y9o9D8w" hash="Q7onxQ">Growing up in the Church in Uruguay and being a witness of this wonderful work in other countries of South America, I have carefully observed the effect that diligently and humbly listening to the voice of the Lord has had in the lives of people. I observed the same effect when I went back to live in Spain and saw the change produced in the lives of people when they diligently listened to the servants of the Lord and developed sufficient faith to obey the commandments. As Paul wrote to the Romans: “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/10.17" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 10:17</a>).</p>

In His earthly ministry, the Savior frequently declared these words: “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.15" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:15</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.9,43" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 13:9, 43</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/4.23" class="scriptureRef">Mark 4:23</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/8.8" class="scriptureRef">Luke 8:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/14.35" class="scriptureRef">Luke 14:35</a>). He also taught that “he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.24" class="scriptureRef">John 5:24</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p8" pid="9aAx-HUIEUyPYkNJ80wGvA" hash="Vci73w">The preface the Lord gave to the Doctrine and Covenants, which we know as section 1, begins by saying, “Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:1</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p10" pid="0i3R4jNQfUiIRfpfJd7mAg" hash="qHxFnA">This admonition to open our ears to listen does not always receive the same response. While some people indicate a willingness to listen attentively and to be obedient to the words of the Lord, others seem to close their ears, not wanting to hear nor to obey. There are others who are slow to hear but who eventually do listen and become obedient. For all of these people, the result of their attitudes concerning the voice of the Lord will bring into their lives consequences which, in many instances, may be of an eternal nature.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p11" pid="BYoiX9-SMEKXczrI6vZTlw" hash="M7CdZw">An example of those who close their ears can be found in chapter 15 of 1 Samuel when Saul, who had been anointed king over Israel, set aside the counsel and warnings of the prophet of the Lord and tried to justify the error of his ways. Samuel the prophet reproved Saul and taught him that “to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.” He then indicated to Saul the consequences of his attitude: “Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/15.22-23" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 15:22–23</a>). From the example of Saul we learn that pride is a great obstacle in listening to the voice of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p12" pid="gM6cP46PFUq7RvnmHST4aA" hash="3PUf_g">In chapter 5 of 2 Kings we read the story of Naaman, a general in the Syrian army who sought help from the prophet Elisha to be healed of his leprosy. The prophet sent one of his servants to say to Naaman: “Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.10" class="scriptureRef">2 Kgs. 5:10</a>). This response was not pleasing to Naaman, who went away in anger. Thanks to the intervention of his servants who persuaded Naaman to follow the instructions of the prophet, finally “went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.14" class="scriptureRef">2 Kgs. 5:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p13" pid="TXWOmRZ_-kqS0K2Ht4AOQw" hash="yCtb6g">From his experience we learn that frequently the words of the prophets do not agree with our expectations or with our way of seeing things. Sometimes it seems that we need someone else, in addition to the prophets, to persuade us to listen to the voice of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p14" pid="oEPI-G3Q5UmgLjiFKfkITg" hash="ZnOvmA">In chapter 17 of 1 Kings we read about a humble widow who lived in Zarephath during a time of great scarcity of food because of the drought. This humble woman possessed no more than a handful of meal and a little oil for herself and for her son. With these she planned to prepare a final meal and then die. The prophet Elijah asked her to first give him something to eat with the promise that if she did so the meal and the oil would not decrease until it rained again:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p15" pid="MmwuGXY26EewxFOAtvYNHw" hash="mXhc-Q">“And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p16" pid="jHOnaW_Exkm3AXM092xlyA" hash="4CNliw">“And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/17.15-16" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 17:15–16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p17" pid="G03MfFI3zkyGtjWQXUxXLw" hash="q3jhRw">Thus we see how, when people listen to and accept with humility and simple faith the words of the prophets, they receive the Lord’s blessings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p18" pid="6PLf8U2NC0y15OxfRIuDow" hash="xnTM7w">In summary, the voice of the Lord may be received by listening to the Lord’s servants, studying the scriptures, and being prompted through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. And for those who not only hear but those who hearken to the Lord’s voice, the Lord calls them “mine elect,” “for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 29:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p19" pid="UQ2Ep5sRZkeLm7sgvYVZPg" hash="u61FeA">I believe that our ability and our willingness to hear can be increased and that our ears can be opened to hear clearly the voice of the Lord. In section 136, verse 32, we find a guideline which will help to do this: “Let him that is ignorant learn wisdom by humbling himself and calling upon the Lord his God, that his eyes may be opened that he may see, and his ears opened that he may hear” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/136.32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 136:32</a>). Through humility and prayer we can develop and improve our capacity to be attentive to the words of life which will bless our lives and the lives of our families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/listening-to-the-voice-of-the-lord.p20" pid="SEE1-kiKW0Kt3bdaMMNLzg" hash="eM0uaA">This conference is a great opportunity to listen to the voice of the Lord, to follow the counsel given, and to give heed to the teachings we are receiving. I know that God the Eternal Father lives, that Jesus Christ also lives and is our Savior, our Redeemer. I know that President Gordon B. Hinckley is a prophet of the Lord and that this is the true Church. I testify of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon and of the divinely ordained role of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I testify of this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Hinckley declared: “I believe our problems, almost every one, arise out of the homes of the people. If there is to be reformation, if there is to be a change, if there is to be a return to old and sacred values, it must begin in the home. It is here that truth is learned, that integrity is cultivated, that self-discipline is instilled, and that love is nurtured” (“Walking in the Light of the Lord,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Jan. 1999, 117; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1998, 99).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/applying-the-simple-and-plain-gospel-principles-in-the-family.p2" pid="hfvFbKkLsUWG1jPxjyMtmA" hash="HuZL1w">Among the old and sacred values to which we should return are the plain and simple principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. These should be firmly established in our homes to ensure happiness in family life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/applying-the-simple-and-plain-gospel-principles-in-the-family.p3" pid="pn4D8kOma02TeC3ABM09sw" hash="jd_E0w">President Wilford Woodruff declared: “The Lord has a great many principles in store for us, and the greatest principles which he has for us are the most simple and plain. The first principles of the gospel which lead us unto eternal life are the simplest and yet none are more glorious or important unto us” (“Remarks,” <span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> 1 Apr. 1857, 27).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/applying-the-simple-and-plain-gospel-principles-in-the-family.p4" pid="prz0x4t7Z0qduTOo7WDNbQ" hash="uHWraQ">It is precisely because these principles are plain and simple that many times they are not considered when there are challenges to face that affect family life. At times we have the tendency to think that the more serious the problem, the bigger and more complex the solution should be. That idea can lead us, for example, to seek help from people or institutions outside the home when in reality the most effective solution will come by applying the glorious principles of the gospel in our homes in the small actions and duties of everyday life. The scriptures remind us “that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/applying-the-simple-and-plain-gospel-principles-in-the-family.p5" pid="wj5oLN06bEGxSMsGttrzKw" hash="iUB5fg">In “The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles declare that “successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (<span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Oct. 1998, 24; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/applying-the-simple-and-plain-gospel-principles-in-the-family.p7" pid="W70mDyT0zEiiBDWxe2Uj0A" hash="nEyYbg">These principles, once applied, will act as a light that will illuminate each member of the family and, in a progressive way, will lead us to integrate other related values and principles which will strengthen family relationships. We know that “he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:24</a>).</p>

Any hurts caused by the friction of living together will heal. Offenses will be forgiven. Pride and selfishness will be replaced by humility, compassion, and love.</p>

When we adopt a principle, its influence radiates from us and can be felt by others.</p>

This process begins with the first principle of the gospel, faith.</p>

There is no better place to build faith than in the home, where the lessons and practical applications are realized and lived day to day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/applying-the-simple-and-plain-gospel-principles-in-the-family.p14" pid="-3kCXWkbbkWK2rIZpLL3Gw" hash="WOs0EQ">It is in the home that one learns that faith is intimately related to the Atonement, “this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:15</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/applying-the-simple-and-plain-gospel-principles-in-the-family.p16" pid="paRGioBHUkiqcpoOxC0mOQ" hash="zibmsw">Repentance, that change that takes place in the heart, that is born of love for the Lord, that leads us to move away from sin and to submit to His will, can “become effective and accepted by God” “only through the atonement of Jesus Christ” (Guide to the Scriptures, “Repent, Repentance,” 206).</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p6" pid="jH9d8GEK7UyGsculc0xWZQ" hash="bbu2rw">Through our experience in life, we learn that joy in this world is not full, but in Jesus Christ our joy is full (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:36</a>). He will give us strength so we will not have to suffer any manner of afflictions save they are swallowed up in His joy (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.38" class="scriptureRef">Alma 31:38</a>).</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p14" pid="CfCcr3plwUi8c7jJoWgdeA" hash="0IrI6w">In those difficult moments in our lives, the pleasing word of God that heals the wounded soul brings the following message of comfort to our heart and mind:</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p17" pid="yWebgnpWUkSJali_RGHZ8A" hash="MMvzBQ">The pleasing word of God fills us with hope, because we know that those who are faithful in tribulation will have the greater reward in the kingdom of heaven and that “after much tribulation come the blessings” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.3-4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:3–4</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p18" pid="NaH5q-_likuBf4X-ujUEBQ" hash="32eMsg">The pleasing word of God, as spoken through the prophets, gives us the security that our eternal sealing, sustained by our faithfulness to the divine promises that we were given for our valiant service in the cause of truth, will bless us and our posterity (see Orson F. Whitney, in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, 110).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p19" pid="Um9IO47R5USVFNo6dPRCdA" hash="VHPTXg">It also gives us the security that, after we have lived a faithful life, we will not lose any blessing for not having done certain things if we were never given the opportunity to do them. If we have lived faithfully until the time of our death, we “will have all the blessings, exaltation, and glory that any man or woman [who has had that opportunity] will have.” (See <span class="emphasis">The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow,</span> ed. Clyde J. Williams [1984], 138.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p20" pid="SJuqB5Qs-Ea9_BvSVlzaBg" hash="n_okzg">Now, it is important to understand that some suffering and affliction can also enter our lives if we fail to truly repent of our sins. President Marion G. Romney taught: “The suffering and distress endured by people of this earth is the result of unrepented and unremitted sin. … Just as suffering and sorrow attend sin, so happiness and joy attend forgiveness of sins” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1959, 11).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p21" pid="FDMXYOXmJUeaOrGmcAr2Ug" hash="39yljg">Why does lack of repentance cause suffering and pain?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p22" pid="CZqolzayeUCEK5SgK_7H5w" hash="Peyx8A">One of the possible answers is that “a punishment [was] affixed, and a just law given, which brought [about] remorse of conscience” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:18</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.16" class="scriptureRef">verse 16</a>). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that we are the ones who condemn ourselves and that it is the torment of disappointment in our mind that makes it as intense as a burning lake of fire and brimstone (see <span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</span> [2007], 224).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p23" pid="wVbtn2UmL0yo-F0qDn7_7g" hash="UPx6ZQ">If we attempt to appease our conscience by trying to “excuse [ourselves] in the least point because of [our] sins” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.30" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:30</a>) or by trying to hide them, the only thing we will accomplish is to offend the Spirit (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:37</a>) and delay our repentance. This type of relief, besides being temporary, will ultimately bring more pain and grief into our lives and will diminish our possibility of receiving a remission of our sins.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p24" pid="k4PtWcXM3UC0ULVNHvO5PQ" hash="Lt_ajQ">For this type of suffering, the pleasing word of God also brings comfort and hope; it tells us that there is relief from the pain caused by the effects of sin. This relief comes from the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and takes effect if we exercise faith in Him, repent, and are obedient to His commandments.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p25" pid="m_owZh_Jwkm-20Y5FdBmXw" hash="Wgj2iA">It is important that we realize that just like the remission of sins, repentance is a process and not something that happens at one particular moment. It requires consistency in each of its steps.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p26" pid="1Kwny0eBaUOp2XmRIpV9Nw" hash="4sEpxg">For example, when we partake of the sacrament, we show the Lord that we are going to remember Him always and keep His commandments. That is an expression of our sincere intent.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p27" pid="iT_nATvYj0arazvRmci_nA" hash="qx4CSA">The moment we begin to remember Him and keep His commandments every day—and not just on the Sabbath day—is when the remission of our sins begins to gradually take effect and His promise of having His Spirit with us begins to be fulfilled.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p28" pid="Zq2HwsmGr0SkyQ9plQo9ew" hash="6GqUzQ">Without the proper obedience that must accompany our intent, the effect of remission may disappear before long and the companionship of the Spirit begins to withdraw. We will run the risk of honoring Him with our lips while removing our hearts from Him (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.25" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 27:25</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p29" pid="_j0batYD2EW-XDGUFpgbiA" hash="ENq0zA">In addition to comforting us, the pleasing word of God warns us that this process of receiving a remission of our sins can be interrupted when we become entangled “in the vanities of the world,” and it can be resumed through faith if we sincerely repent and humble ourselves (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.5-6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:5–6</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p30" pid="GfDhMU6-UUmerivwPVamZg" hash="2LnXdA">What might be some of those vanities that can interfere in the process of receiving a remission of our sins and that are associated with keeping the Sabbath day holy?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p31" pid="nQkr5PYBxUmwFN8-KBtt9w" hash="AbWRkQ">Some examples include arriving late for sacrament meeting without a valid reason; arriving, without previously having examined ourselves, to eat the bread and drink from the cup unworthily (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.28" class="scriptureRef">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>); and arriving without first having confessed our sins and having asked God for forgiveness for them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p32" pid="w8SksURc30al9K5ZmRoC8A" hash="f3PEqw">Other examples: being irreverent by exchanging messages on our electronic devices, leaving the meeting after partaking of the sacrament, and engaging in activities in our homes that are inappropriate for that sacred day.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p33" pid="Xi6UMDiE1U2mJTrojpGjrg" hash="_RTYEQ">What might be one of the reasons why we, knowing all these things, often fail to keep the Sabbath day holy?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p34" pid="vVTYYxVcQkKSFZbVfrgf9g" hash="QICzhg">In the book of Isaiah, we can find an answer that, though related to the Sabbath, also applies to other commandments that we must keep: “Turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/58.13" class="scriptureRef">Isaiah 58:13</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p35" pid="Psr_BZIz1ESkYM6ZD_-QQA" hash="wb2FGA">The key words are “turn away … from doing thy pleasure,” or in other words, doing God’s will. Oftentimes, our will—shaped by the desires, appetites, and passions of the natural man—conflicts with the will of God. The prophet Brigham Young taught that “when the will, passions, and feelings of a person are perfectly submissive to God and his requirements, that person is sanctified.—It is, for my will to be swallowed up in the will of God, that will lead me into all good, and crown me ultimately with immortality and eternal lives” (<span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> Sept. 7, 1854, 1).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p36" pid="tkdhYWuAkkeSohX-Qeimuw" hash="d8mOfQ">The pleasing word of God invites us to use the power of the Atonement of Christ to apply it to ourselves and become reconciled with His will—and not with the will of the devil and the flesh—so we, through His grace, can be saved (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.24-25" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 10:24–25</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p37" pid="8oGi6yseLkG6bNUlkMp3WA" hash="rv7Icg">The pleasing word of God that we share today shows us the need for continuous repentance in our lives so we can keep the influence of the Holy Ghost for as long as possible.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p38" pid="XNPdOsLVmkWmjOo1RqtLBw" hash="Pjg-wQ">Having the companionship of the Spirit will make us better people. “It will whisper peace and joy to [our] souls, … it will take malice, hatred, envying, strife, and all evil from [our] hearts; and [our] whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness, and build up the kingdom of God” (see <span class="emphasis">Teachings: Joseph Smith,</span> 98).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p39" pid="sRilpe056kWz-Hah47AWEA" hash="Oxkc0w">With the influence of the Holy Ghost, we will not be offended, nor will we offend others; we will feel happier, and our minds will be cleaner. Our love for others will increase. We will be more willing to forgive and spread happiness to those around us.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-pleasing-word-of-god.p40" pid="-dHF938G5UuWgBlykrNkKw" hash="dT_7eg">We will feel grateful to see how others progress, and we will seek the good in others.</p>

We will become better people, and our families will be blessed. Of these principles I testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
