Jesus Christ prophesied that in the last days even the very elect would be deceived.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Consider three examples of how Lucifer is “laying traps and snares to catch the holy ones of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

        <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">The snare of false inadequacy. </span>
</span>A faithful young person feels unable to meet the expectations of others. At home and school, she is rarely praised and often criticized. The popular media tells her she is not beautiful enough or smart enough. Every day this righteous sister questions whether she is an individual worthy of Heavenly Father’s love, the Savior’s atoning sacrifice, or the Spirit’s constant guidance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p4" pid="-KZF4zryoEOJg12wv0sWZg" hash="WfFD0A">
        <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">The snare of exaggerated imperfection. </span>
</span>An outstanding missionary feels incapable of meeting the expectations of God. In his mind, this worthy elder imagines a stern Heavenly Father bound to irrevocable justice, a Savior capable of cleansing others’ transgressions but not this elder’s own, and a Holy Ghost unwilling to accompany an imperfect person.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p5" pid="Wc_I0yc8Ik2Zp-lN5wV35Q" hash="R8Au9Q">
        <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">The snare of needless guilt. </span>
</span>A middle-aged woman is a devoted mother, a loving friend, a faithful Church servant, and a frequent temple patron. But in her heart, this sister cannot forgive herself of sins committed years ago that she has repented of and fully resolved with priesthood leaders. She doubts that her life will ever be acceptable to the Lord and has lost hope of eternal life in Heavenly Father’s presence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p6" pid="ANrK-cPx6kutwKrZMvswWg" hash="7qYTDA">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="77"></span>If you have any thoughts and feelings similar to these good Saints, I invite you to become as a little child and feel again “the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son in the coming of the Redeemer into the world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Childlike faith in the perfect love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will “divide asunder”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Satan’s snares of inadequacy, imperfection, and guilt.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p8" pid="XF0xRfe580Ct_ohyrZIXPQ" hash="-bcgGQ">
        <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">First, see yourself as a precious child of a loving Father in Heaven. </span>
</span>Our children with confidence sing, “I am a child of God, and he has sent me here.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Little children feel and know what perhaps you have forgotten. You are the beloved son or daughter of Heavenly Father, created “in his own image,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> and of immense value—so much so that Jesus Christ gave His life for you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p9" pid="GvCCHs2qPk-dh8leP56MOg" hash="G9fv2Q">God the Father is merciful and has infinite love for you despite your faults. Only the voice of Satan will cause you to feel of no value. In contrast, the Holy Ghost will cause you to feel “godly sorrow”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> unto repentance in a manner that fills you with hope of positive change.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p10" pid="NNQuE6OWskix4PqqU0222A" hash="WSZiyA">When you feel worthless, “remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Refrain from repeatedly thinking or saying negative words about yourself—there is a clear difference between humility and humiliation. Identify and use your unique talents rather than dwelling on your weaknesses.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p11" pid="KLkDg0uOm0S1b84daowsOg" hash="stzrZw">
        <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">Second, place your burdens on Jesus Christ. </span>
</span>When you feel overwhelmed by expectations and challenges, do not fight the battle alone. Follow the example of small children, and drop to your knees in prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p12" pid="WLzRwhTHQkiIUqxpua5xOQ" hash="HSfZ8Q">Jesus Christ has commanded us, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Doubt, fear, and worry indicate we have taken all of life’s burdens and anxieties on ourselves. When plagued by thoughts that you are inadequate, confidently say, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Then as you “cheerfully do all things that lie in [your] power,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> you can rest assured that the Lord will do the remainder and things will work out all right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p13" pid="zZ3FJR1PGUqFWuXu4ef7FA" hash="HoU-FA">The Savior promised, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> As you “cast [your] burden upon the Lord,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> you will feel the peace of the Spirit.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p14" pid="Hr83p-b5fUeP4_7BOBNbYA" hash="nk_3Yw">
        <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">Third, forgive yourself of sins and imperfections. </span>
</span>Heavenly Father is not expecting you to become completely perfect in this life. He knew His children would make mistakes as they learned from experience in mortality. But “God so loved the world”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> that His plan of happiness provided a merciful Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p15" pid="EzNi3H4HAkWPikNzCQehcg" hash="ZLjtqg">Jesus said, “I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> Start with yourself, and forgive others as well. If God will not remember our repented-of sins,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> then why should we? Avoid wasting time and energy reliving the past.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p16" pid="7HvaRwo3DEu7o26dV2GfCg" hash="STpcgQ">To forgive yourself and others, you must trust the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The prophet Zenock prayed, “Thou art angry, O Lord, with this people, because they will not understand thy mercies which thou hast bestowed upon them because of thy Son.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> Our Father in Heaven is saddened when we limit the power of His Son’s atoning sacrifice. As you exercise faith in Jesus Christ, you can have your guilt “swept away.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span> If guilt remains after sincere repentance, believe your priesthood leaders when they declare you to be worthy.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p17" pid="9fwy-x_iD0aQXEoK_TNYTg" hash="umSEEQ">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="78"></span>
        <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">Fourth, sustain hope of eternal life. </span>
</span>If you imagine that your prior sins, character flaws, and poor decisions prevent you from receiving all of God’s blessings, consider the experience of Alma the Elder. Referring to his younger years as an immoral priest for the wicked King Noah, Alma admitted, “I myself was caught in a snare, and did many things which were abominable in the sight of the Lord, which caused me sore repentance.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span> Yet Alma’s repentance was so complete and Christ’s Atonement so infinite that Alma became a prophet and was promised eternal life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span> As you do your best to be obedient and repentant, you too can receive a place in the celestial kingdom through the Atonement and grace of Jesus Christ.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p18" pid="urRL85VJtUGGpmAN3yzhOA" hash="y6GBaw">
        <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">Fifth, find joy each day. </span>
</span>One source of joy is service, for when you are busy helping others, you will have less capacity to agonize over your own shortcomings. The Savior wisely taught, “For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_27">27</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p19" pid="x1-B3oVWG0iwcLOiJuVN7Q" hash="gzG12Q">You will experience greater joy in life as you eradicate adult-onset pessimism and substitute childlike optimism. Optimism is a virtue that allows us to see God’s loving hand in the details of our life. A favorite hymn counsels, “Count your many blessings; see what God hath done.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-great-and-wonderful-love.p20" pid="GQgqvwPGaEmGaA3uQbmPSg" hash="DNmPTw">I testify of Heavenly Father, who in great and wonderful love reaches out to each of His children. I bear witness of Jesus Christ, who is “mighty to save”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_29">29</span> us from our inadequacies, imperfections, and sins. I bear testimony of the Holy Ghost, who will accompany the imperfect yet penitent soul. To you faithful and worthy Saints who struggle with latter-day snares of the devil,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_30">30</span> “may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_31">31</span> In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="54"></span>When I was a young man, our family would drive over America’s Rocky Mountains to visit grandparents. The road began in sagebrush flatlands, ascended through steep, pine-covered slopes, and ultimately emerged into aspen groves and mountaintop meadows, where we could see almost forever.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/beware-concerning-yourselves.p6" pid="E6JqBMS4gUqqOq9dcSXKrw" hash="Y6mlFg">But this beautiful road was not perfectly safe. Much of the highway was carved into the steep mountainside. To protect travelers, road builders constructed guardrails and placed signs that read, “Beware: Falling Rocks.” We observed ample reason for these warnings. Rocks and boulders were strewn along the riverbed far below the road. Occasionally we could see crumpled cars on the canyon bottom, a tragic record of drivers who failed to beware.</p>

King Benjamin directed, “Beware lest there shall arise contentions among you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span> Never forget that Satan is the “father of contention”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_27">27</span> and seeks that family members “fight and quarrel.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span> Brethren, if we are emotionally, verbally, or physically abusive to any member of our family, or bully any person, then we lose priesthood power.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_29">29</span> Choose to control anger. Family members should hear blessings from our mouths, not cursings. We are to influence others only by persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, love unfeigned, kindness, and charity.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_30">30</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/beware-concerning-yourselves.p24" pid="h2io7jdp90O6K9de8Q4AgQ" hash="lYiOyA">Fifth, obeying the law of tithing is an essential element of faith and family unity. Because Satan uses greed and the pursuit of possessions to sweep families off the celestial highway, Jesus advised, “Beware of covetousness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_31">31</span> Covetousness is restrained as we project our income, pay an honest tithe and generous fast offering, budget needed expenses, avoid unnecessary debt, save for future needs, and become temporally self-reliant. God’s promise to us is, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_32">32</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/beware-concerning-yourselves.p25" pid="NUk4sg4cMkabAUSDTLsHhA" hash="sg7yNw">Sixth, fully living the law of chastity yields confidence to stand “in the presence of God” with the Holy Ghost as our “constant companion.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_33">33</span> Satan is assaulting virtue and marriage with an avalanche of obscenity. When the Lord warned adulterers to “beware and repent speedily,” His definition extended beyond the physical act of adultery to the lustful thoughts that precede it.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_34">34</span> Modern prophets and apostles have spoken often and clearly about the plague of pornography. President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: “[Pornography] is like a raging storm, destroying individuals and families, utterly ruining what was once wholesome and beautiful. … The time has come for any one of us who is so involved to pull himself out of the mire.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_35">35</span> If you are tempted to violate the law of chastity in any form, follow Joseph of Egypt’s example, who “fled, and got him out.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_36">36</span></p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="56"></span>These six fundamental principles help priesthood holders continue up the heavenly highway safely between the spiritual guardrails of personal conversion and family relationships. Young men, obeying these principles will prepare you for temple covenants, full-time missionary service, and eternal marriage. Husbands and fathers, living these principles will qualify you to preside over the home in righteousness, serving as your family’s spiritual leader, with your wife as an equal partner.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_37">37</span> The priesthood path is a journey filled with joy.</p>

After passing a “Beware: Falling Rocks” sign, my father noticed pebbles and small stones landing on the pavement in front of us. He quickly slowed the car to a near stop just as a basketball-sized boulder whizzed by us. Dad waited for the rock slide to cease before continuing. My father’s constant attention and immediate action ensured that our family safely reached our final destination.</p>

Take courage that although the Savior affirms, “Beware … , and refrain from sin,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_42">42</span> He also promises: “I, the Lord, forgive you. … Go your ways and sin no more.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_43">43</span></p>

Prayers, scriptures, and ordinances deepen conversion. Love, tithing, and chastity strengthen family. Avoid tragedy by heeding spiritual “Beware” signs placed along our way by God and prophets.
