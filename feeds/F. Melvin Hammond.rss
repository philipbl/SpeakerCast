      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p1" pid="0l3gMVDaIkO7p-8_03q2pw" hash="mnDwIw">My beloved brothers and sisters, today I am happy to express to you the genuine love of the members of the Church in the South America North Area and of your wonderful missionary sons and daughters, young and old, who constantly say to me, “Elder Hammond, when you see our dear prophet, please tell him that we love him. And when you speak in a general conference of the Church, please tell the Saints that our love of the Savior is united firmly with theirs.” They are all so wonderful, and I am pleased to comply with their loving request.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p2" pid="k91ebpJicki4Ro0toEJbAA" hash="821-uQ">On this occasion I would like to speak especially to the young people the world over. Somehow, I believe that they have a special ability to understand important things. May I illustrate with this little story?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p3" pid="ctpR2ihhXUmkvaWC7hA4lQ" hash="jGqgbw">Many years ago we sat as a family in our weekly home evening discussing the principle of the resurrection. Attempting to explain in simple terms what is involved, I noticed our small children looking at me with puzzled expressions on their tiny faces. Apologetically, I mumbled something about it being very difficult to understand such things. Whereupon, Lezlee, our then five-year-old, with a look of loving concern for my discomfort, said, “Don’t feel badly, Daddy; I understand you.” And then she proceeded to demonstrate her new gospel knowledge. Lying down on the floor, straight and stiff, with her arms outstretched, she slowly raised herself and said, “It’s simple, you just sink up.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p4" pid="izL0zd0dTUC40cooJf7Xhw" hash="3oERCA">So I want to talk to you about the resurrection of our Savior, Jesus Christ, because on Easter Sunday we will celebrate His rising from the dead and all of us <span class="emphasis">should</span> know the wonderful story of that remarkable event.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p5" pid="y5RSIXo2QEiJncOOkNkSMA" hash="6GdlqQ">It was early on Sunday morning. Deep darkness still hung over the holy city, Jerusalem. Mary of Magdala entered the garden and approached the tomb where the body of Jesus of Nazareth recently had been laid.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p6" pid="_Wrg-DndhUGVR9L0OZUj7w" hash="vR1jcw">Just two days before, the humble Christ, hanging from a wooden cross, had given up the ghost, and mortality had ended for the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p7" pid="L4LSt-4tyES5WYZMF8BxBw" hash="mWDgUw">Joseph of Arimathaea, a member of the Sanhedrin but a loving disciple of Jesus, had gone to the Roman procurator, Pontius Pilate, and had asked that he be allowed to remove the body from the cross. Permission was granted. The body was taken from the cross, and Joseph, with the assistance of Nicodemus, who earlier had come to question Jesus by night, gently prepared the body for burial after the manner of the Jews. The kind, loving men placed the body of the deceased in a newly hewn tomb belonging to Joseph. Then a great stone was rolled across the entrance, and a Roman seal was placed upon it, “lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/27.64" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 27:64</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p8" pid="gDh15l4IFUmkG1tycV4z2Q" hash="lO4pag">Now Mary Magdalene approached the tomb, but to her utter amazement the huge stone had been rolled away. The body of her beloved Jesus was gone. Quickly she ran to advise the Apostles of this new tragedy, saying, “They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.2" class="scriptureRef">John 20:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p9" pid="DRVi3ahoKUKnTvwitjyFjA" hash="UdXKAA">Peter, the chief Apostle, and John, the beloved Apostle, hurried to the place of burial. The account of Mary was confirmed. The tomb was indeed empty, except for the linens which had been used to wrap the body. Saddened, the two Apostles went away to their own homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p10" pid="SrTsY20k8U-yvDMXonvAtg" hash="eeN5tQ">“But Mary,” who had followed Peter and John back to the garden, “stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.11" class="scriptureRef">John 20:11</a>.) Two angels dressed in white sat within the tomb. Seeing her great grief they asked, “Woman, why weepest thou?” Sorrowfully, she answered them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.13" class="scriptureRef">John 20:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p11" pid="OTInOb_kG0OLiRp0gOIctQ" hash="4ACKMQ">Still weeping, Mary turned from the tomb, and through her misty eyes she noticed someone standing close by. The person spoke to her, “Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?” Thinking that perhaps it was the gardener who addressed her, she replied, “Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.15" class="scriptureRef">John 20:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p12" pid="TYQc8XsTREi_OMD8THXbrQ" hash="0RVXYQ">In a voice tinctured with pure love and the sweetest tenderness, he simply uttered one word, “Mary.” There was no mistaking the voice; it was Jesus Christ. And thrilled beyond any comprehension, the dear woman could only say, “Rabboni,” which means Master. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.16" class="scriptureRef">John 20:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p13" pid="WTQWJD1qhE6sSWjBiBcakg" hash="j5iykw">There He stood—alive! Raised from the dead! Never to die again! His perfect body forever united with the spirit. The eternal Christ!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p14" pid="nY7uB_Wz3UaSnZX6r2DHrA" hash="5-RpdA">To the credit of gentle, loving women everywhere, our Redeemer chose as the first mortal witness of His resurrection from the dead a woman, Mary Magdalene.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p15" pid="Lv_JghbAXEKeX4S2kKHrrA" hash="punbFw">As we contemplate the events leading to the death of Jesus Christ, we tend to grieve for the awful sufferings which He experienced at the hands of wicked men—the terrible rending by the lash, the dreadful nails placed in His hands and feet, the prolonged agony of the cross, and finally His tender heart breaking for the sins of all men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p16" pid="VWwXp0NMF0G49b_RIUAaQg" hash="cFNlgQ">But stop! He is not dead! He is risen! He is the first fruit of the resurrection. Without Him, life for all men would end at death. All would be consigned to the grave, their bodies to molder in the dust forever. But because of Him, our Savior, even Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, we, every one of us, will live again—freed from the everlasting chains of death.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p17" pid="OGTwuSUczUqNnE5CDLRJSA" hash="eq7L-g">To you sweet parents who have placed the mortal body of a dear son or a beautiful daughter in the grave, or to all who have lost a mother or father, husband or wife, to the relentless hand of death, I say, have hope. For if we ourselves are faithful to the end, they will not be lost to us save for a moment. And then, oh the sweetness of that joyous reunion, for the tender mercy of the Lord will bring them forth triumphant from the grave.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p18" pid="4hA5WK3rvEO_xieAm_oOfw" hash="PFUc0w">And so, my wonderful young people everywhere, as we come to celebrate Easter, will you remember the story of Jesus coming out of the grave a perfect, glorified being? Will you remember that He made it possible for all of us to someday be resurrected and to come back and live with Him in the celestial kingdom of God throughout all eternity? Then if you will remember, you will understand His love for all of us, and your love for Him will grow deeper and deeper forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-resurrection.p19" pid="oUYH9qYD80aL0PacEVIM1g" hash="mI5wAQ">Such is my humble testimony of the glorious resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, which I proclaim to you along with my profound love for Him and each one of you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/trying-to-be-like-jesus.p3" pid="KdNeMgovaEmmBBBTnRqbRA" hash="nq1lng">It was Christ who in the premortal state presented Himself to become the Savior of men, saying, “Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.27" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:27</a>). From that time forth it was proclaimed that the Son of Man would come to earth to sacrifice Himself as an atonement for the sins of all men (see Mosiah 3).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/trying-to-be-like-jesus.p4" pid="AjlttmybUUi2XpC9u5oPiQ" hash="6bMXJA">As the day of His mortal birth approached, Nephi heard the voice saying, “Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, … on the morrow come I into the world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.13" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 1:13</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/trying-to-be-like-jesus.p7" pid="iLWJqAroBECcnU6UMUYiBQ" hash="z0oO4Q">In succeeding years “Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.52" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:52</a>). At the age of thirty, He began His ministry, teaching the great plan of happiness—faith, repentance, baptism by immersion, the laying on of hands to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.title" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27</a>).</p>

Some of them were humble fishermen. He invited them to come “follow me, and I will make you fishers of men” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:19</a>). Immediately they left their nets and followed Him, as all who are called should willingly do.</p>

To a father who mourned the death of his dear, young daughter, He said, “She is not dead, but sleepeth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/8.52" class="scriptureRef">Luke 8:52</a>), and He took her by the hand and she rose from the dead.</p>

He reminded the Twelve of the awful fate that awaited Him: “Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.2" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:2</a>).</p>

There He knelt down and prayed, saying, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:39</a>). The law demanded a perfect Lamb for the atoning sacrifice. He alone could qualify. His love for us was so great, so intense, that voluntarily He suffered both body and spirit until blood came from every pore to pay the price of sin (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:7</a>). Somehow we must try to understand and internalize the ransom that He actually paid for each one of us.</p>

Yea, the greatest of all of God’s children was left to die on a horrible cross. When finally all things were accomplished, He said, “It is finished” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/19.30" class="scriptureRef">John 19:30</a>) and “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.46" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:46</a>). Jesus Christ was dead. The spirit had fled. The body was placed in a borrowed tomb.</p>

Finally, from Bethany He rose from their midst and ascended into heaven (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.50-51" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:50–51</a>).</p>

But with their passing came a rapid decline of spirituality. The sacred ordinances were changed, priesthood authority was lost, and spiritual darkness enveloped the earth. Mankind had ceased to know God.</p>

Hear Him!” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>). Pure light emerged, and darkness fled. God had spoken to man again.</p>

The holy priesthood has been restored to man. The sacred ordinances are being administered to every worthy soul who will receive them.

As we entered the room, President Hinckley looked carefully at us and then with a smile on his face said, “How can three white-headed, old men be the Young Men presidency of this Church?” Our only response was, “Because you called us to be, President.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p2" pid="4nBELHsi3U2pmhss8Re8jg" hash="9gEN6A">Young men, we hope that you are excited about the Aaronic Priesthood: Fulfilling Our Duty to God program. It has been introduced to all of the Aaronic Priesthood throughout the world. It is designed to bless you spiritually, physically, socially, and mentally. The requirements are meaningful and will stretch you almost to the limits of your capability. You will be able to establish personal goals and achieve them with the help of your parents and your great leaders. There is a wonderful excitement associated with this program all over the Church. We want <span class="emphasis">every one of you</span> to qualify and receive the coveted Duty to God Award.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p3" pid="7WRRXwBHKkuHcGxeWfdEtg" hash="VKp1DA">Many years ago I took our only son on his first camping, fishing trip. He was just a boy. The canyon was steep, and the descent was difficult. But the fishing was good. Every time I hooked a fish I would give the pole to the eager boy, and with shouts of joy he would reel in a beautiful trout. In the shadows and coolness of the late afternoon, we began our climb back up to the rim high above us. He scrambled rapidly up the mountain ahead of me with a challenging, “Come on, Dad. I’ll bet I can beat you to the top.” The challenge was heard but wisely ignored. His small frame seemed literally to fly over, under, and around every obstacle, and when every step that I took seemed ridiculously like my last, he had reached the top and stood cheering me on. After supper we knelt in prayer. His small voice rose sweetly heavenward in benediction to our day. Then we climbed into our large double sleeping bag, and after a bit of pushing and pulling I felt his little body snuggle and settle tightly against mine for warmth and security against the night. As I looked at my son beside me, suddenly I felt a surge of love pass through my body with such force that it pushed tears to my eyes. And, at that precise moment, he put his little arms around me and said, “Dad.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p4" pid="rR9fyDBxREWP820PuOJnGg" hash="G11jjA">“Yes, son.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p7" pid="U0qVi2TQjEyO-oykdNOU4Q" hash="znW0ng">“Dad, I love you a million, trillion times!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p8" pid="EOtFzyY2KEGQqsvJ98L92A" hash="GKpAgg">And immediately he was asleep. But I was awake far into the night, expressing my great thanks for such wonderful blessings clothed with a little boy’s body.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p9" pid="4VbMN5hx0EWPyPn0tV7Nww" hash="R9sWPQ">Now my son is a man with a son of his own. Once in a while the three of us go fishing. I look at my little red-headed grandson beside his father, and I see in my mind’s eye the image of that wonderful moment long ago. The question so innocently asked, “Dad, are you awake?” still rings in my heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p10" pid="QM3r8WaSQEmsZgTdinsdQg" hash="N8FvXw">To every father, I pose the same penetrating question, “Dad, are you awake?” Do your sons ever wonder if you are asleep when it comes to the things that are most important to them? I would suggest that there are several areas that would indicate whether we are “awake” or “asleep” in the eyes of our sons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p11" pid="8QKeACDSJUyxhFcYCICBWg" hash="xIPONA">
        <span class="strong">First, our love for God and accepting our role as the family leader in keeping His commandments.</span> Some years ago, following a stake conference, I felt impressed to pay a visit to a priesthood brother who had fallen away from the Church. We found him working in his garden. I approached him and said, “Dear brother, the Lord Jesus Christ has sent me to see you. I am Elder Hammond, one of His servants.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p12" pid="wFmJjT1aaUKf3ZyoWWfMQQ" hash="fmDkDg">We exchanged a Latin <span class="emphasis">abrazo</span> and entered into his lovely little home. He called for his wife and three children to join us. Two handsome young men and a beautiful girl sat beside their father and mother. I asked the children what they would like, more than anything else in the world, right now. The oldest son spoke: “If only all of us could go back to church as a family, we would be so happy—so grateful.” We told them how much they were needed by the Savior and how He loved them. We bore our testimonies to them and then knelt in prayer. The father prayed. The mother wept. They are now back in full fellowship. The children are proud of their father, and they are happy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p13" pid="F6UyYnlV8kuGnDBTx4lpaw" hash="NhaBZA">Every father in the Church should function as the patriarch of his home. He should take the lead in spiritually guiding the family. He ought not to delegate nor abrogate his responsibilities to the mother. He should call for family prayer, family home evening, scripture reading, and occasional father interviews. He is the protector, the defender, and the kindly source of discipline. It is the father who should lead, unify, and solidify the family unit by accepting the priesthood of God and responding to the calls and privileges associated with priesthood authority. His relationship with God and His Son, Jesus Christ, is one of the beacons which will lead his sons and daughters through the stormy shoals of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p14" pid="Wq6PqXC2y0aCcTgyzwxRaw" hash="AeL68w">If Dad is a true disciple of Jesus Christ, then the sons will follow him as the night the day. “Dad, are you awake?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p15" pid="24Jpr4S1XEOIIo1B-Uw8Fg" hash="ACHw7A">
        <span class="strong">Second, the relationship we have with our wives—their mothers.</span> Considering everything else that we do, the way we treat our wives could well have the greatest impact on the character of our sons. If a father is guilty of inflicting verbal or physical abuse in any degree on his companion, his sons will resent him for it, perhaps even despise him for it. But interestingly enough, when they are grown and marry, they are likely to follow the same pattern of abuse with their wives. There is an urgent need in our society for fathers who respect their wives and treat them with sweet, tender love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p16" pid="ITp8Z6bpVk24OL-uQ3dvuA" hash="QbtwWw">Recently I heard of a father who foolishly called his beautiful, intelligent wife “stupid” and “dumb” in a most degrading manner for some small mistake that she had innocently made. The children listened, embarrassed and frightened for their mother. She was belittled in front of those that she loved most. Although an apology and forgiveness were expressed, there still remained the hurt and shame of a senseless moment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p17" pid="LOUud8kAPUeZe4y3jLy0wA" hash="1ozRIg">The Spirit of the Lord cannot be expected to bless our lives if we persist in being angry, callous, and cruel to our mates. We cannot expect our sons to develop respect and gentleness toward their mothers if we do not provide the proper example. President David O. McKay said, “The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother” (quoted from Theodore Hesburgh, <span class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest,</span> Jan. 1963, 25; in <span class="emphasis">Richard Evans’ Quote Book</span> [1971], 11). “Dad, are you awake?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p18" pid="TH1GRA7DT0qkcFkPI9ZOVw" hash="cW1o0Q">
        <span class="strong">Third, to provide discipline that is just and administered with love.</span> Too often out of our own frustration and weakness we raise our hands to strike our children, usually in an attempt to protect our own selfish pride. Every child needs to be disciplined. Not only do they need it; they expect it; they want it. Discipline gives direction and teaches self-control, but in all discipline there should be a sense of righteous judgment and pure love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p19" pid="VejVUsmv7kyeTGy6ffnsIA" hash="2OqOkA">When I was a little boy, my widowed mother gave me the most severe discipline possible. She said, with tears in her eyes, “My son, I am so disappointed in you.” The pain in my heart was more than I could bear. A thousand lashes could not have cut me so deeply. I knew that such a rebuke could only have been made to me out of her pure love, for if there was one thing that I was certain of, it was that my mother loved me. I resolved never again to be subject to the disappointment and the broken heart of an angel mother. I believe that I have succeeded in that resolve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p20" pid="Gzo1p1FssUa-dZrfrzwUDw" hash="CV3j7g">When it comes to discipline, “Dad, are you awake?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p21" pid="c7GrJA0q-UK2GfpRIXzw5Q" hash="7JCGdw">Dads, it is imperative that the challenges I have mentioned be mastered in our lives if our sons are to be spiritually and emotionally mature. If we do, then they will not be ashamed of us, nor will they ever be ashamed of themselves. They will become men of honor, respect, full of love, willing to serve the Savior and submit their will to Him. Then we will rejoice in the fact that they are ours forever. They will say, “Dad, are you awake?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/dad-are-you-awake.p22" pid="WeRUFNUkJUK8zOgNmtsDbg" hash="DcN3tQ">And we will respond, “Yes, my son, I am awake.”</p>
