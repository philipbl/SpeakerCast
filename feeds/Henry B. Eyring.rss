      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p1" pid="h9KC0GS3XEW_N1O473LGlg" hash="dpMXig">On Friday morning, President Hinckley called me to serve as a counselor to Bishop Hales in the Presiding Bishopric. I am grateful for the call and for the knowledge that it is the Savior who makes such calls through his servants in his Church. And I am grateful for your sustaining vote, which surely must stem from your conviction that God issued that call.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p2" pid="-2lteTlYfUaLrn6loweu6A" hash="SMXtMw">During the meetings yesterday, I was overwhelmed in two ways by the reaction of the General Authorities. First, they expressed love and confidence, which I deeply appreciate. But second, I felt, in addition to that same love from Bishops Brown, Peterson, and Clarke, an added expression of almost solicitude. I realized they knew what was ahead of me, and I sensed they might know the growing feeling in my heart that I was overwhelmed by the task ahead. As that feeling increased, I began to think more and more of me. But then I remembered that, in the past few weeks, a deacon has come home with the rolls to announce he was the new quorum secretary; a teacher has been called to preside in his quorum; a mother has been called to be a counselor in a Relief Society presidency; and a nineteen-year-old boy has been called to go to a new city with a new missionary companion. To each of them, and to each of you, fear of failure might try to poke its head in, as it has with me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p3" pid="rwmJNWwlUki-JEiVzg43BQ" hash="PGJFkg">Something happened to me yesterday afternoon that I found of great help to me, and it may be of help to you. Since that moment, the fear has gone. It was when Bishop Hales was speaking in conference. He mentioned that we had known each other since boyhood, and as he did a memory was replayed in my mind. It was of a hotel ballroom in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Bishop Hales was likely not there, since he lived in what seemed to us the well-established stake in New York. We were in the New Jersey District, a single district that covered the whole state. The Princeton Branch met in my parents’ dining room. Dad was the branch president. Mother was both the pianist and chorister (which is hard to do if you think about it). There was not another family in the branch with children, so my brother Ted was the Aaronic Priesthood, and my brother, Harden, and I were all there were of Primary and junior Sunday School. The congregations were young students who happened to be there, like Jim Fletcher and Neil Zundle, and a few older converts—none with spouses that were members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p4" pid="LKbMSYeMn0GULGyWj5g6ww" hash="eljkhw">There was no building, no gym, no stake center, and so we traveled to a hotel ballroom for what must have been a district conference. I was sitting on a folding chair somewhere near the back, next to my mother. I must have been very young because I can remember putting my legs through the back of the chair and sitting aft instead of forward. But then I remember hearing something—a man’s voice from the pulpit. I turned around and looked. I still remember that the speaker was at a rostrum set on wooden risers. There was a tall window behind him. He was the priesthood visitor. I don’t know who he was, but he was tall and bald, and he seemed very old to me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p5" pid="iO9fy4cJJ0ibYJXdhGT2FA" hash="pJQx-g">He must have been talking about the Savior or the Prophet Joseph, or both, because that was all that I remember much of hearing in those days. But as he spoke, I knew that what he said came from God and that it was true, and it burned in my heart. That was before scholars told me how hard it was to know. I just knew of certainty—I knew it was true. And when I listened to Bishop Hales yesterday, I knew that what he was saying was from God and that it was true, and then the fear left.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p6" pid="pb2GD0aQTEWiAGMrzawBPw" hash="WyoNbA">You can have that same confidence, not of yourself, but from God. He lives, and he communicates with his children. This is the Church of Jesus Christ, and he leads it. No assignment in it need ever overwhelm you if you know that and listen for the Master’s voice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p7" pid="zIKjjx0bX0mT5qd_Sg9ygQ" hash="mUzAMQ">Now I can hear the young deacons saying, “Well, now, that may be fine for you, but surely you don’t think that’s going to help me in my assignment down here in this deacons quorum.” Oh yes, I do. Between being a high councilor and a member of the General Board of the Sunday School, I was a deacons quorum adviser. A boy, the president, presided in the meetings, and I taught the lessons out of the scriptures and out of the manual. I stayed very close to the lessons as they were outlined.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p8" pid="qQr2oDjAmk-VLv7aUfkCWA" hash="ZSJkHQ">I remember one boy in the quorum had to miss a few meetings, and so he sent his brother to the class with a tape recorder. His brother recorded our meeting and took it home. It happened more than once. When the deacon came back, I asked him why. I don’t remember his words, but I remember that it was clear he knew what I knew. God was trying to speak to that deacons quorum. The boy wasn’t anxious to have a tape recording to hear me; he was trying to hear God. He knew where to listen and how to hear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p9" pid="yWddbpND-0qdPmKXh3yc0g" hash="xmzn1w">He’d read the scriptures for us in class, and I knew he knew them and loved them. And so, even when I wasn’t teaching very well, by the power of the Holy Ghost and from knowing the Master’s voice in the scriptures, he could hear what he needed to hear. The memory of that black recorder with its tape turning will always remind me of the scripture which says, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.15" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p10" pid="EgryYVD7a0q8vdTkCSXr5g" hash="b9krCA">I spoke at his funeral just a few years later. He lived about as many years as the Prophet Joseph had lived when he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ in the grove. My deacon hadn’t seen a vision, but he had heard the voice of God through his servants in a deacons quorum. He wanted to hear, he knew how, and he had the faith he could. Like the boy prophet Joseph, he knew the heavens were open.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p11" pid="n2p8NSe17kimdWC1bV5Rvg" hash="Ivspog">You and I can take confidence in that assurance. If you and I will study the scriptures and pray and tune our hearts and ears, we will hear the voice of God in the voice of the people that he has sent to teach and guide us and direct us. I heard it yesterday as I listened to Bishop Hales, and I heard it last evening in the priesthood session as I listened to the recorded voice of President Kimball, a prophet of God. You and I can take confidence in that assurance for the Church itself. However large the kingdom will grow (and it will fill the earth), you will not ever feel lost or forgotten, and you need never feel overwhelmed. God will call people to care about you and to teach you. And if you will listen and hear the voice of God, the kingdom will roll forth to its appointed place, ready for the coming of the Master.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p12" pid="kx415asKfUedRBlzy9p77Q" hash="9Iet4A">None of us can see now all the wonders of technology and organization and buildings that God may give us; but you, just you, hearing the voice of God through your teacher and leader, will always be at its heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p13" pid="IsMEM3M85ESZqvAK1NPWyQ" hash="pLTI9A">I’m grateful for the gift given to me of ears to hear. One of my great-grandfathers, John Bennion, walked or rode his horse from over Jordan to this place to hear his name called out to go on a mission to Dixie. His journal doesn’t say much, except just that the next day he prepared to go, and he went. His assignment was to be a sheepherder. In his journal there is a record of an evening in which he met with Erastus Snow. He said another man was in the room; his name was Henry Eyring. And somewhere in St. George that night was Bishop Miles Romney. They talked about sheep. And you might have thought they were talking about something temporal. But not to those men, because they knew they were God’s sheep, and they knew they were for God’s people. And they knew how to listen, and they knew how to do what they heard.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p14" pid="_lGQq391MkmnSPgehfxL-w" hash="6-Agng">John Bennion went on another mission to Wales and back again to this valley. Henry Eyring went on to Colonia Juarez, as Miles Romney did. And they left for me a tradition which I deeply appreciate. They were the yeomen of the Church, the soldiers of the Church, and my great-grandfathers. You can’t find in their journals records of the positions they held, just of the instructions they heard, and knew were from God, and followed. I’m grateful to my parents who handed me that heritage undiminished. I’m grateful to my wife, who more than once has heard when I did not and gently said, “Would you pray about it?” If my sons and daughters will listen to her, and hear through her what God has in mind for them, we will pass the heritage on again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/ears-to-hear.p15" pid="j08Pbm8p3kaapBMW28iNpw" hash="bNb8tA">God lives, Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith in fact saw God and His Son and received all the keys of the priesthood. And President Kimball holds them today. I testify that God loves his children and can tell us what is true. I pray that we all may have ears to hear, that he may guide us. I pray that I may serve you and him, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p1" pid="3ob3xz_G_EaWKyBF0oZ7eg" hash="sLdJuQ">At the close of the last general conference, President Benson said this: “I bless you with increased <span class="emphasis">understanding</span> of the Book of Mormon. I promise you that from this moment forward, if we will daily sup from its pages and abide by its precepts, God will pour out upon each child of Zion and the Church a blessing hitherto unknown” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1986, p. 78).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p2" pid="zP25gQGSUUuY6RDeTD-XKg" hash="lWLL6g">I bear my testimony that I have been blessed as He promised, and I have seen new blessings come to people I love. I am grateful that God honors the promises he makes through his prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p3" pid="hdrNQlPDG06HQcioOdMBWA" hash="7PhYOQ">Even as I feel that gratitude, I think of those whose hearts ache over promises yet unfulfilled. Tonight, or tomorrow, many of us will pray with real intent, and perhaps with tears, over someone whose happiness would bring us happiness, who has been promised all the blessings of peace that come with baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and yet who counts the promises worthless. None of us is immune, because all of us have circles of love large enough to include such people. My heart is drawn especially to those asking the question we all have asked: “How can I be sure I have done all I can to help?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p4" pid="v95yjiDo7EiAtqhBECO6Vg" hash="6CMzNw">Fifty years ago, in October conference, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., of the First Presidency, gave this answer, which I carry copied on a card:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p5" pid="AMj4mmnTUUWTc_ss4-nnNw" hash="SjZTHg">“It is my hope and my belief that the Lord never permits the light of faith wholly to be extinguished in any human heart, however faint the light may glow. The Lord has provided that there shall still be there a spark which, with teaching, with the spirit of righteousness, with love, with tenderness, with example, with living the Gospel, shall brighten and glow again, however darkened the mind may have been. And if we shall fail so to reach those among us of our own whose faith has dwindled low, we shall fail in one of the main things which the Lord expects at our hands” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 114).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p6" pid="ZSdozL-oZEySMYBkdHrlFQ" hash="DreunQ">That lovely metaphor—of a spark, a spark of faith—gives me confidence. President Clark pictured the spark nearly hidden, almost smothered by the ashes of transgression. It may be so small that the person can’t feel its warmth. The heart may be hardened. Even the Holy Spirit may have been forced to withdraw. But the spark still lives, and glows, and may be fanned to flame.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p7" pid="TJip-LrxzEiaVItDU5X4RQ" hash="qtCiVg">President Clark also suggested what we can do. He did not suggest a single approach to reach all people. But he described what every effort that succeeds in fanning the spark will include.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p8" pid="T7vk240K5kS5GKsbesjckg" hash="17C0Lw">Teaching is first. But what should we teach? Suppose time and opportunity are scarce, as they generally are with people who don’t think they need your teaching. If you had the gift, and the chance, to teach only one thing, what would it be?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p9" pid="wnjdQCcFbEGGNrU1KvO2rQ" hash="wulIkA">For me the answer is illustrated in the success of a great man whose heart ached over someone he loved. His name was Alma, and his son, Alma, went about trying to destroy the true Church. You remember that in response to the prayers of his father, and of faithful members of the Church, God sent an angel to rebuke the son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p10" pid="0uCzDH19f0OIEz1wHnmFKw" hash="V2pbhA">The rebuke brought young Alma such remorse that he would have been destroyed had he not remembered his father’s teaching. He described it this way:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p11" pid="Sokvfy5BD0Oz0zmvwijLQw" hash="G092zw">“And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p12" pid="BGag4OjuaU6xhliNljCoXg" hash="gtkN3w">“And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p13" pid="H94OqEFdFkqhNk6fINJbnQ" hash="u4qgtQ">“Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.16-18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:16–18</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p14" pid="oVkV82RvPUeZ5OvtzVmirQ" hash="KVrUmg">Because his father had taught him that the Savior was his only source of hope, Alma began the process which took him to full repentance. If I had the chance to teach one thing, it would be what it means and how it feels to exercise faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p15" pid="jP51SlsJ20CNIRQTAw4C0A" hash="-FCMIw">To do it I would try to take the person I loved on a journey from when we were with a loving Father in Heaven to when we can go home to him again. We would see the fall of Adam and Eve and feel its effects on us. We would go to Bethlehem and rejoice at the birth of the Son of God, and to the Garden and to Golgotha as our hearts break at the transcendent gift of the Atonement. And we would go to the open tomb, and to Galilee, and to this hemisphere to feel hope in keeping the commandments of the Risen Lord. Then, we would go to a grove in New York to watch the boy Joseph Smith talk with God the Father and his resurrected Son, to begin the errand that restored the ordinances of the gospel, which can lead us home again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p16" pid="LFLMC-VV8kuRkwfrz82Opg" hash="Giac_g">President Clark understood that a person in whom faith is an ember won’t receive even great teaching unless his heart is softened. And so he said that we must touch the person with the spirit of righteousness, with love, and with tenderness. Now, you and I might rightly feel that what he asks is nearly superhuman. In our efforts to invite others back, we have felt rejection and even ridicule. We may feel fatigue, frustration, and sometimes guilt. How then can we keep reaching out in a spirit of righteousness, with love and tenderness?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p17" pid="6ViyCL01_0-h5a5mT0xQTw" hash="lRY6aQ">The best answer I know comes from another wonderful father. His name was Mormon. He wrote a letter to his son Moroni in a time when they met not only rejection but unbridled hatred, and faced not only frustration but almost certain failure. Mormon wanted Moroni to meet even such a test with love and tenderness and the spirit of righteousness. He gave a formula, the same one given by true prophets in all ages. It has always worked. The promise is sure. Here it is, from Mormon’s letter:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p18" pid="NkRtQ5Hvv0-p9wCr4d5k3Q" hash="AZnXTQ">“And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p19" pid="36BwqPnyYEeGE4xnqgNP6Q" hash="hkI3HQ">“And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.25-26" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 8:25–26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p20" pid="vjQngCGk50qO3R6q_4BF-g" hash="Td8KuA">If you try to imagine the Savior restoring a lost sheep to the fold, won’t you picture him cradling it in his arms? That tenderness and love, Mormon testified to his son, is the natural result of the atonement of Jesus Christ operating in our lives. Our faith leads us to repentance, to the gifts of the Spirit, and from that to the perfect love which the Master Shepherd has, and knows we must have to serve him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p21" pid="KCko2UK7pE2RND2R33U0gw" hash="HiSSXw">The effects of the Atonement in our lives can also produce in us the example those we love will need. I learned again the other night the example we need to be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p22" pid="UpUhDBIo9EGKow1awHFHxQ" hash="_mNajQ">I was chatting with my wife at the end of a long day. Three of our children were in the room, listening. I turned and noticed that one of them was watching me—and watching my face intently. And then he asked me, softly, “Why are you unhappy?” I tried to give a reason for my furrowed brow, but I realized later that he could well have been asking this deeper question: “Can I see in you the hope for peace in this life that Jesus promised?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p23" pid="g1KmgtOzm0OlQ-7BE_glAw" hash="DiJZgg">To turn my thoughts from what darkened my look to what would brighten it, I went to another letter from Mormon to his son. Both Mormon and Moroni were facing days of difficulty that make my challenges pale. Mormon knew his son might be overcome with gloom and foreboding, so he told him the perfect antidote. He told him that he could choose, by what he put in his mind, to become an example of hope. Here is what he wrote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p24" pid="S3Zr5i0MJkK1YbybMAXbAQ" hash="_Ml4mA">“My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.25" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 9:25</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p25" pid="N919UmtDsUmK63V54t6rzg" hash="j4lL4w">What we can do to help—teaching, and doing it with the spirit of righteousness, with love, with tenderness, with example—centers on the Savior and his atonement. That is what we would teach. The Atonement working in our lives will produce in us the love and tenderness we need. And by remembering Him and His gift, which we promise to do as we take the sacrament each week, we can put a light of hope in our faces which those we love need so much to see.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p26" pid="SVYPPbJkOE-bPxgoQa5P-w" hash="9N6WBQ">President Clark reminded us, at the end of his suggestions, that there is, and always will be, free agency. The spark won’t glow brighter until the person tries living the gospel. That is why we hope so much that those we love will be called and will fulfill some assignment, however small. After their choice to serve others, to sacrifice, to try the commandments with promise, the spark of faith ignites. Even after we have done all we can do, that choice—whether to act on what faith they have—must be theirs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/the-spark-of-faith.p27" pid="JgURF-g4LUCxCPBhTL2F7w" hash="O6Pqpg">I bear my testimony that God lives, Jesus is the Christ, and in this dispensation, through prophets from Joseph Smith to Ezra Taft Benson, He has given the power to offer again the full blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I pray that we may never cease to offer the opportunity to choose those blessings to those in whom the spark of faith may yet be fanned to flame. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In fact, I’ve seen it so often that it merges into one image, one picture. It’s of a small boy, maybe nine or ten, in shorts, barefoot, and with a torn shirt. He’s on a patch of dirt, alone, and he’s looking down at a white-and-black-checkered ball. He takes a step toward it, his leg swings through, and the ball shoots off, about seven feet above the ground, where it might zip past a goalie into the net—except there’s no goalie and no net; there’s just the boy and the ball. And then he runs to the ball, puts it in place with his foot, and kicks it. And he does it over and over again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p2" pid="nDp0mSuAh0uByy8Bf4JcOQ" hash="Cc1Jjw">You don’t know where he lives, but you know that he’ll take the ball home with him and that more than likely he keeps it near the place he sleeps. He sees it when he gets up and when he goes to bed. He may even dream about that ball shooting toward the goal.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p3" pid="7AbU6JNDgkSnzjLvlLlTWw" hash="msXG0Q">You know that because you’ve done something like it yourself. It may have been a basketball. I can remember looking down at the ball in my hands on one freezing winter day and seeing my bloody fingerprints on the ball. I’d been outside so long that the cold had cracked the skin on my fingertips, but my mind and my eye were on the orange rim. I can still remember it, including the chipped paint on the front edge of the rim where you’d lock your eye and know the ball would fall just past that spot into the dirt-stained net. I can still remember the mark on the driveway I’d dribble to and know I was at the top of the key. I’d spin and jump for that last second shot, with the score tied. And I’d do it again and again, sometimes for hours, feeling neither time nor the cold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p4" pid="9LSlxMo1q0KzsIF9rYNMIw" hash="yk76xw">You may have learned endurance playing a trumpet, or throwing a football, or riding a bucking horse, or drawing a picture. But you learned what we all did. Effort only “now and then” didn’t take you far. The dreams that turned into reality stuck with you nearly all the time. You worked at them, either in fact or in your thoughts, every day and almost every hour.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p5" pid="yWwUlPkGWE2IooaFq6iRNQ" hash="jzshWA">It shouldn’t surprise us, then, that the Lord has said to you and to me, “Watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.53" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:53</a>). God loves us, and he intends for us to become like him. He doesn’t ask us now to worry about all his children in all the world, as he does. Instead, he begins with a call to watch over just a few families, just a few people. But he knows that to visit thirty minutes every month with the same lesson for every family would never produce the progress he wants for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p6" pid="TXedIlaoakKSVwS2sXFJgQ" hash="uLQEJQ">And so he commands, “Watch over [them] always, and be with and strengthen them.” You can’t be with them twenty-four hours a day. That would be “always,” wouldn’t it? But they can be in your heart always. If you’ll think about the families you visit, those of you who are blessed to be called home teachers, you know the help they need is beyond your casual effort.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p7" pid="KMqwPimPjkCzIGl1LLBANA" hash="bMLEeg">In my experience, I’ve been assigned to watch over people who struggled with divorce, with financial ruin, with children who would not respond to all that parents had done, or with disease that would not respond to all that faith and medicine could do. I’ve gone to a home where little twin girls were sent to the screen door to tell us that Mommy and Daddy were sleeping and couldn’t we come another time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p8" pid="byN0zx4xZUqc4s7FrL2l1w" hash="0fhfeQ">I knew in my heart that effort “now and then” wasn’t enough, that “going out home teaching” or even “giving a good lesson” wouldn’t do it. God called us to watch over and help people in all their struggles for physical and spiritual well-being. He called us to help by the Spirit. He called us to teach by the Spirit. He called us to live what we teach. He called us to bear testimony. He called us to love them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p9" pid="GaCTD9zlKE6LLwXnt8X0HA" hash="TcyB1A">Now, he didn’t make it that hard just to test you. He gave you so high a calling because he loves you. He wants you home again, and to get there you have to become like him. So he gives you a calling that can only be done with persistence and endurance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p10" pid="JBMxU0ANzEqKvoCeCLbOwg" hash="a5mZ7w">Let’s talk tonight as if you and I were companions. I know we may not have gotten together often to prepare, but let’s do it tonight. Let’s imagine that you and I are at my house. You’ve come over for a few minutes, and we’re sitting at my kitchen table.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p11" pid="SCZ255eGHUCV1pulO4VxPw" hash="-DddnQ">We won’t talk about home teaching visits or lessons first. We’ll talk about our families for a while. We’ll find that some of them are struggling. And that will humble us, knowing that the Lord is counting on us. We might talk about what we know the bishop and the Relief Society and some neighbors are doing to help. And we might talk about some things we have done and could do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p12" pid="DhKHr0Uz2kCfjOI_1rEbew" hash="mHk2PQ">Then, we’ll get around to talking about one family and what we might teach them. I’ll push the April <span class="emphasis">Ensign</span> across the table to you, opened to the First Presidency message from President Benson. You look down and see the title, “Seek the Spirit of the Lord.” That looks like the perfect lesson, doesn’t it? There’s only the mom and dad at home. They worry about her health problems, wondering if they’re doing all they can and should. On top of that, they probably aren’t sleeping much because of their son. He’s still in the same town, but he’s living with his friends. He won’t be there when we call, but he’ll be in their minds, and what he’s doing and not doing will be tearing at their hearts. They’ll be wondering what they can do for him. If people ever wanted and needed the Spirit of the Lord, these folks do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p13" pid="aZdOZ2BVzUawKRDCLKvAoQ" hash="fTjq3A">Let’s agree that we’ll both prepare the lesson. But I think they have such respect for you that you ought to take the lead. We can’t do them any good unless the Holy Ghost is with us, so I guess we’d better do more than prepare the lesson. We’d better prepare ourselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p14" pid="wwl-bAyYDECX6zz3lDipjw" hash="P7nR6Q">First, the Holy Ghost can’t be with us unless we’re clean. I admire the way you try to watch what you say and do, even what you think. I guess when the Lord tells us to watch over the Church, that means watching over ourselves too. Let’s read this quotation from President George Q. Cannon I keep handy. And let’s agree that we’ll try to follow it:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p15" pid="UiGBLqULFU2vllAcMaeUPA" hash="zRTTng">“Some people have an idea that because they have entered the waters of baptism and repented of their sins then that is an end of it. What a mistake! We need to have this spirit of repentance continually; we need to pray to God to show us our conduct every day. Every night before we retire to rest we should review the thoughts, words, and acts of the day and then repent of everything we have done that is wrong or that has grieved the Holy Spirit. Live this way every day and endeavor to progress every day” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Truth,</span> Jerreld L. Newquist, ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1987, p. 129).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p16" pid="6cKURTVHAkad5owXFsc4pA" hash="MCiVuQ">Second, let’s pray both for forgiveness and to get answers about what to do for the family. It would help if, when we go, we tell them that the Holy Ghost can guide them; it has already guided us to do something for them. If we pray and then feel that prompting and act on it, what we do may be more important than anything we say. Maybe our finding out how to help them will lead them to find out what more they can do for their son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p17" pid="42iB4cSSnUy29r4DrM-Wvw" hash="1mT9Pw">Let’s agree that we’ll include both the parents and their children in our personal prayers, and we’ll plead for the Holy Ghost to help us teach. You remember the promise, “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:14</a>). That really fits us, doesn’t it?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p18" pid="2cuASe1yfEi35hhVF3dqCw" hash="AAvE0A">Third, we’re going to be teaching a gospel principle, so we’d better study and ponder the scriptures. You remember that the Lord said, “Teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:12</a>). I know you’ve been reading the Book of Mormon regularly. So have I. Why don’t we think about our family and the gifts of the Spirit while we read? If we do, I’m sure that we’ll understand and feel some things that are new to us. And we’ll teach and bear testimony in their home with more power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p19" pid="T7U1TngRxUiyB5Vrhr1Z2A" hash="LihScg">It won’t hurt to bear testimony from our own experience that we felt the Spirit while we read the scriptures. Then they may try reading and pondering. If they do, they’ll get the prompting of the Holy Ghost for themselves. And that will help them more than just feeling it when we’re there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p20" pid="mn-Mtjmy-E28TNJGo6rpuA" hash="kDERBQ">Then we’ll have a prayer together before you leave. In the next day or two we may stop by the house to do something for the family before we get there for a lesson.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p21" pid="Qqz8oKYNS0evoMBRGewAxQ" hash="-_4Odg">The night we teach them, things will seem about as they have before, with a few exceptions. An idea and a scripture will come into your mind as you teach. You’ll bear testimony of the Savior with more feeling. Perhaps we will both find our hearts drawn out to the people more. And they may linger at the door a little longer than usual as we go.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p22" pid="hSCTEoQTKEiA49sYvAsgCA" hash="H8VfbQ">Maybe only some of that will happen. But that won’t discourage us. We thought it would take repeated, steady effort. The desire of our hearts is to help others taste the fruit of the gospel. We know it won’t come quickly or easily after a single effort, for them or for us. But in that visit, or in one that will come later, you will feel a warmth in your heart and truth will come into your mind. And that will bring you joy. It may go away, but you will remember it. Then you will be able to imagine what it would be like to have the Holy Ghost for your constant companion in this life and to feel the love and approval of the Savior and your Father in Heaven for eternity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p23" pid="aQvpSXtJy0eTKxrBuO865A" hash="i6FHDA">Alma knew what having that desire in our hearts and visualizing it with faith would mean to us. It would keep us going when the going was hard. Here’s what he said: “And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p24" pid="CGlfTJJaRECmXR1apWY34Q" hash="qhIfsA">“But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.40-41" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:40–41</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p25" pid="3-tDsCEoZUSRGBvsthx2ww" hash="9Vtg7A">By the power of the Holy Ghost and with the eye of faith, we have glimpsed and we can look forward to the fruit of the gospel. That is the desire of our hearts. And wanting it will give us the power to keep going, with great diligence and patience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p26" pid="MB7M0z4kpEGluFJhefFAuQ" hash="_QK7Qw">The little boy in my memory keeps kicking that ball, over and over again. I can’t see a goalpost or a goalie. I can’t hear the roar of the crowd. But in his mind, he can. And so he kicks the ball, over and over again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/because-of-your-steadiness.p27" pid="W89UR107cUSnMCAFDVkQ6w" hash="kxQUCg">I pray that we will take the great opportunity God has given us to prepare ourselves. He has trusted us as watchmen of the souls of his children. He has given us a way to look forward to the fruit of the gospel by giving us a calling that requires our whole hearts. As the boy’s dreams of kicking the winning goal draw him back to persistent practice with that ball, so our vision of the fruits of the gospel will draw us back to persistent repentance and prayer and study and service.</p>

We are going to need that change. Someday, in our families and as a people, we will live as one, seeking each other’s good.</p>

A story from one of those tries, in Orderville, Utah, gives us a clue as to why it is so hard.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/remembrance-and-gratitude.p6" pid="GtsQM8RaxUOnZ9dat4CgaA" hash="UwsyNw">Orderville was founded in 1870 and 1871 by people who wanted to live the united order; in 1875, they began the order. They built housing units in a square, with a common dining hall. They built a storehouse, shoe shop, bakery, blacksmith shop, tannery, schoolhouse, sheep shed, and woolen factory. They grew and made nearly everything they needed, from soap to trousers. They had carpenters, midwives, teachers, artists, and musicians. They produced enough surplus that they could sell it in neighboring towns for cash: with that they built up a capital fund to buy more land and equipment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/remembrance-and-gratitude.p7" pid="1NmGvYd6T0Cx2i3oeOM1Vg" hash="4YmHtA">The population rose to seven hundred people. One hundred and fifty of them gave Orderville a special advantage: they had come to Orderville from the mission on the Muddy River, where they had nearly starved. When those who had been called to the Muddy were released, they were in near destitution. Twenty-four of those families went to Long Valley, founded Orderville, and pledged all they had to the Lord. They didn’t have much, but their poverty may have been their greatest contribution. Their having almost nothing provided a basis for future comparison that might have guaranteed gratitude: any food or clothing or housing that came to them in Orderville would be treasure compared to their privation on the Muddy mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/remembrance-and-gratitude.p8" pid="L50-RXECaEyVpzNPSlsVcw" hash="Mat45g">But time passed, the railroad came, and a mining boom put cash in the hands of people in the neighboring towns. They could buy imported clothes, and they did. The people in Orderville were living better than they had in years, but the memory of poverty on the Muddy had faded. They now focused on what was in the next town. And so they felt old-fashioned and deprived.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/remembrance-and-gratitude.p9" pid="rR4g6AmKvkaen66BPXuWrA" hash="tkXGIA">One ingenious boy acted on the discontent he felt when he was denied a new pair of pants from the Orderville factory because his were not worn out yet. He secretly gathered the docked lambs’ tails from the spring crop. He sheared the wool from them and stored it in sacks. Then, when he was sent with a load of wool to sell in Nephi, he took his sacks along and exchanged them for a pair of store pants. He created a sensation when he wore the new-style pants to the next dance.</p>

The boy gave an honest answer. So they called him into a meeting and told him to bring the pants. They commended him for his initiative, pointed out that the pants really belonged to the order, and took them. But they told him this: the pants would be taken apart, used as a pattern, and henceforth Orderville pants would have the new store-bought style. And he would get the first pair.</p>

Orders for new pants soon swamped the tailoring department. When the orders were denied because pants weren’t yet worn out, boys began slipping into the shed where the grinding wheel was housed. Soon, pants began to wear out quickly. The elders gave in, sent a load of wool out to trade for cloth, and the new-style pants were produced for everyone.</p>

There were many challenges Orderville faced in the ten years they lived the order there. One of them they never really conquered. It was the problem of not remembering. That is a problem we must solve, too.</p>

Whatever we get soon seems our natural right, not a gift. And we forget the giver. Then our gaze shifts from what we have been given to what we don’t have yet.</p>

A group of people in the Book of Mormon record lost their flocks, their herds, and their fields of grain. Some lost their lives. And then the survivors remembered. In Alma it says: “And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 4:3</a>.)</p>

Gratitude for what they had led to faith unto repentance. That led to forgiveness. That produced new gratitude.

If you begin to express gratitude for each of them, your prayer may take a little longer than usual. Remembrance will come. And so will gratitude.</p>

A woman sat next to me on a plane. I spoke to her. She strained to understand me. When she spoke, her accent almost overpowered her English. In answer to my question, she told me that she was returning to the place of her birth. She said that the occasion which drew her was a religious observance of the death of her father, who died many years ago. She had made the flight on the third, the seventh, the thirteenth, and the seventeenth anniversaries of his death. And now she was going again.</p>

She said, quietly, that she believed in the veneration of her ancestors. I asked her if her family had attended church. She smiled and said, “No, only go to church when someone dies.” I asked her if she believed in a god. She said, “Yes.” I asked her if she thought he was close by. She said, “No. If we should need him we would say, ‘come here,’” and she made a beckoning sign with her hand. I asked her who she believed God was. Her soft, tentative answer was: “Well, he is like one of our distant ancestors.”</p>

But I realized those words would not touch her. I remembered and understood the power of what Elder Spencer W. Kimball wrote in the beginning of his book <span class="emphasis">The Miracle of Forgiveness.</span> You may recall this warning:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/to-draw-closer-to-god.p4" pid="sxXuABPCl0-qqsk_bnv5Lw" hash="5FNpXQ">“This book presupposes a belief in God and in life’s high purpose. Without God, repentance would have little meaning, and forgiveness would be both unnecessary and unreal. If there were no God, life would indeed be meaningless; … we might find justification in an urge to live only for today, to ‘eat, drink and be merry,’ to dissipate, to satisfy every worldly desire. If there were no God there would be no redemption, no resurrection, no eternities to anticipate, and consequently no hope.” (Spencer W. Kimball, <span class="emphasis">The Miracle of Forgiveness,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969, pp. 3–4.)</p>

God is our ancestor, not distant but close. He is the Father of our spirits; we are his children. But like that woman, we all at times feel far removed from him. Like her, if we are to have the words of the gospel of Jesus Christ touch us, then we must believe in God. We must want to be with him. And we must sense our need to be purified to be with him again.</p>

When the Savior appeared among the people on this continent, after his resurrection, he taught them how to pray. He used the words, “Pray always.” That doesn’t mean now and then. It doesn’t mean to pray only when you feel like it. Listen to what he said to them:</p>

And so you must be very quiet inside. That is why you may wisely fast when you want to listen. And that is why you will listen best when you feel, “Father, thy will, not mine, be done.” You will have a feeling of “I want what you want.” Then, the still small voice will seem as if it pierces you. It may make your bones to quake. More often it will make your heart burn within you, again softly, but with a burning which will lift and reassure.</p>

Do you notice how much of it is an urging to do something for someone else? That is no surprise. God loves his children. They have great needs. Everything belongs to God, so there is not much you can give him, after you have given him a repentant heart. But you can give kindness to his children. If you were my earthly friend, you would win my heart by being kind to my children. God loves his children more than any earthly parent, so think what your kindness to his children means to him.</p>

As part of the trip, I was to travel by car from São Paulo to a conference in a city about two hours distant. A member of the Quorum of the Twelve was going to preside at that conference. I hoped to ride in the car with him so that I might learn. But he suggested that I make the trip in another car with missionaries. He said, “Teach them while you travel.” So, when I climbed into the front seat of the car, I learned that two young lady missionaries, companions, were going to that city for a transfer. After we had become acquainted, I leaned back over the seat and asked, “What would you like to know about?” Both of them, eagerly and almost in chorus, said, “Tell us how we can become more humble.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p2" pid="eXNEX6J3jUuxc6sTu7WY2Q" hash="QwXsmw">You might have struggled with that as I did. I only remember the green hills of Brazil going by as I tried. And the feeling at the end that I failed. If only I could have that chance again on this beautiful day. I have learned some things about their question since President Hinckley invited me to meet with him yesterday afternoon and issued the call to this sacred office. I think I could help them a little more now.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p3" pid="qFrn7HQzvEaNbrac728S7g" hash="YQ6IVw">First, I would have realized that they already had the first lesson in their hearts. The fact that they even asked meant that they had gone beyond being overwhelmed by their doubts about themselves to hope that if they would just submit, if they could just learn what to do, they could be better. If I had the chance again, I would have told them that. And then I would have given them just this one bit of counsel, counsel about what to do. I would have said just this: “Always remember him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/4.3" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 4:3</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 5:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77,79" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77, 79</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p4" pid="lmKq-rB5kkWgl4gKii59Sw" hash="WBuqfA">I would have tried to help them do that by taking them in their minds to a garden where they would hear the Savior of the world’s words: “Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.42" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:42</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p5" pid="-kr7FU9cXEqc3WLDVWl2Ng" hash="MQwk2A">And then I would have taken them forward in time to that glorious day reported in the Book of Mormon when the resurrected Lord appeared to the people in the Americas and said: “And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.11" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:11</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p6" pid="5T9zHauBK02wvXN-cQM5DA" hash="X2w0SA">I know from the softness I heard in their voices and saw in their eyes that those missionaries would have then, and perhaps always, remembered him. And from his perfect example they would have felt their hearts breaking and received the answer to their pleading, “Tell us how we can become more humble.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p7" pid="pSU27PNczk-0t0gTCqo7Mg" hash="2MzaTQ">When we drove away from them in the city of our destination, they were standing waiting for a bus. I looked back. There they stood alone. I wish I had known what I learned last night so that I could have read to them while they were in the car these words from the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the twenty-third verse [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:23</a>]: “That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.” And then starting at the twenty-sixth verse:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p8" pid="0weu1DC3jUStBYtawpN1uw" hash="crdcjg">“And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed;</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p11" pid="9FbJuGjO2UW1VqNTleZt7w" hash="OKMhfA">They would have known the Savior spoke of them. And then in their humility they would have found that they were given power to proclaim his name.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p12" pid="DXGJhSa-kkqmSWhwRKNbMw" hash="YBaT3g">Over the last hours I have come to understand other blessings from “always remembering him.” I thought of a family in Albuquerque, New Mexico, I met years ago: a father, mother, and two teenage daughters who belonged to no church but read the Bible together every day. They pondered the Savior’s life and his words. When we found them they had decided that Christ would have a church and that they should find it. They knew that it would have prophets and Apostles at its foundation because that is what Christ had left in his church in the meridian of time. They knew that the resurrected Lord had appeared to his Apostles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p13" pid="koR6kjdfMUuZESR6UKFwkg" hash="ZZggfA">And so when we testified that God, the Father, and his Son, the Savior of the world, came to a boy prophet, Joseph Smith, that seemed right to them. When they heard us testify that Peter, James, and John appeared and restored priesthood, they knew that would have to have happened. And the Holy Spirit, which they also recognized, told them it was true. I realized sometime last night or early this morning that they recognized the truth, that this is the Church of Jesus Christ, in large part because they had always remembered him. Every day they had gathered to read about him and his words, and so they remembered him. And after they were baptized they were ready to follow the living prophet because they knew the Savior always speaks to his prophets to bless his people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p14" pid="mTnNqMtnT0W6Hub7phWSPA" hash="bLUQUA">I will keep my covenant to take his name upon me and always remember him. And I will go wherever I am sent to teach of him and offer the ordinances by which we take his name upon us and promise that we will always remember him and keep his commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p15" pid="hNgWY8-5pkuFDsBLBPdr5A" hash="WWxSrw">And if they accept that invitation, they will know what I know: God, our Father, lives. His Son, Jesus the Christ, did the will of the Father and atoned for all of our sins. Because of him we will be resurrected. Because of his atonement we may be exalted. The Lord sent heavenly messengers to confer keys on his prophet, Joseph Smith. The Lord has called his prophet today, Gordon B. Hinckley. The Savior will speak to us and all the world through him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/always-remember-him.p16" pid="PTE_rsPBIEK83HCzNF76Xw" hash="ynmuyg">And if those who hear will take the Savior’s name upon them and always remember him, and keep his commandments, they will finally come to him and he will take them home to his Father and our Father, where we may live forever in families. I testify that is true, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The life you touch in your service will be as valuable to God as any other life. And so how you touch a life is as serious a matter for you as it would be for any other servant of God.</p>

Your responsibility is to touch people so that they will make the choices that will take them toward eternal life. And eternal life is the greatest of all the gifts of God. Some of you young men may feel uncomfortable with the thought that what may seem to you simple assignments or everyday acts could have eternal consequences.</p>

Your deacons quorum president next week may ask you to invite to come with you to a Sunday meeting a boy who has never attended nor has anyone in his family. You may trudge up to his house, get him to come with you a few times, and then see him move away. You may think you haven’t done much that mattered. But the grandfather of such a boy came up to me during a stake conference, described in detail how a deacon had done just that for his grandson—more than ten years before and almost a continent away—and with tears in his eyes asked me if I could thank that deacon for him, now grown older, unaware that the Savior had reached out through a twelve-year-old servant assigned by a thirteen-year-old quorum president.</p>

The mother of his grandson was raising him alone with no contact with the Church. The grandfather had tried every way he knew to reach out to touch their lives. He loved them. He felt responsible for her and for his grandson. And he knew what you know: He knew that someday, when they saw things as they really are, they would wish with all their hearts that they had made the choices that would qualify them for eternal life, choices which won’t and can’t be made without faith in Jesus Christ sufficient to salvation.</p>

The first thing to know about how faith in him increases is to think of its growth like that of a tree. You remember how Alma used that illustration. The seed is the word of God. It must be planted in the heart of the person you serve and whose faith you want to see increase. He described what must happen this way:</p>

But even with that preparation of the old king’s heart, Aaron taught the word of God in a way to emphasize God’s love and our need for him. Listen to this description of how he did it:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/to-touch-a-life-with-faith.p28" pid="wFEQkh3ao0WaoVnoxntLxw" hash="QVn6CQ">“And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading the scriptures unto the king—how God created man after his own image, and that God gave him commandments, and that because of transgression, man had fallen.</p>

After hearing the word of God taught that way, in what the scriptures sometimes call the plan of happiness, the old king said that he would give whatever he had to root the wickedness out of him and have eternal life. When Aaron told him to cry to God in prayer for forgiveness, the king bowed down on the spot. The seed was planted. He was doing the will of God (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.15-18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:15–18</a>).</p>

But you will do some of the same things. You will try to help them feel that God loves them by the way you treat them. You will be humble so that they are more likely to choose to be meek and lowly of heart. You will teach the word of God, when the Spirit prompts you, in a way that testifies of God’s love for them and their need for the atonement of Jesus Christ. And you will teach them commandments they can keep. That is why, when you go into the mission field, you learn to commit those you teach to pray or to read the Book of Mormon or to come with you to a sacrament meeting or to be baptized. You know that when they keep commandments they plant the seed. And you know that it will grow, their souls will be expanded, and that when that happens their faith will increase.</p>

When death occurs in a family, the bishop, quorum members, and the home and visiting teachers reach out to the family because they love them. The family generally feel humbled, longing for comfort and peace. For many, their hearts will be prepared to hear the word of God.</p>

He will be sure that testimony is given of the plan of salvation, of the atonement of Jesus Christ, of the Resurrection, and of glorious reunions, because that will bring comfort and hope. But such teaching will do more than that. The word of God will be heard by people with hearts softened by love and by grief and so more likely to choose living it more fully. And from doing that, faith will increase and the changes will come in people which move them toward eternal life.</p>

Life has in it moments of challenge that will bring even the people most hardened to spiritual things to say to themselves, “Isn’t there more than this?” If you have been a constant friend, if you have proved your love by service and so become trusted, they may turn to you with that question. When they do, you can say, knowing that their hearts are prepared, “Yes, there is, and I can tell you where it is and what you can do to find it.”</p>

For instance, a deacon or an elder might choose to follow the command to search the scriptures and so read passages that tell him of the honor and glory bestowed through the holy priesthood (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:34</a>). From such obedience in reading scriptures, he might be able to hear the Holy Ghost whisper that such an honor, such a holy calling, deserves wearing better than everyday clothes when he performs priesthood ordinances or more considerate speech wherever they are. Because others may not honor the dignity of the priesthood in those ways, such obedience may take faith. But faith when exercised increases. And that increase in faith will give greater power to hear and to obey.</p>

There are reasons for that. Blessings when they are no longer seen as coming from our Heavenly Father can lead to pride. The peace of forgiveness can lead to overconfidence, forgetting to pray always lest we be overcome. Even some who have exercised faith enough to have great spiritual experiences have later been deceived into apostasy or overcome with the trials of life. All of them need your help in nurturing faith, in learning to put all their trust in God.</p>

You will love them. You will encourage them as they choose to be humble. You will present the word of God to them in the way most likely to lead to their choosing to exercise enough faith to repent and thus see that there is more that God would have them do. And that will help them endure in faith.</p>

You can take heart that you were called by the Savior. You have the same promise he gave those he called at the beginning of his earthly ministry.

But in our thoughtful moments we know that we will need help. We will need to invite the powers of heaven to guide our families in days when we are not there and to face spiritual dangers we may not foresee.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-legacy-of-testimony.p2" pid="9qtqcK3ZYU-aYq-1oTvxag" hash="FMcG8g">Our families can be given a gift to know what God would have them do and to learn it in a way that will encourage them to do it. God has provided such a guide. It is the Holy Ghost. We cannot give that to our family members as a companion, but they can earn it. The Holy Ghost can be their constant companion only after they have been faithful and after they have received the ordinances of baptism and the laying on of hands by those with proper authority. But even before baptism, a child or an adult can have the Holy Ghost testify to their hearts of sacred truth. They must act on that testimony to retain it, but it will guide them toward goodness, and it can lead them to accept and keep the covenants which will in time bring them the companionship of the Holy Ghost. We would, if we could, leave our families a legacy of testimony that it might reach through the generations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-legacy-of-testimony.p3" pid="p0w2B_HUsU2qraFrzluyug" hash="rwC-Gg">What we can do to create and transmit that legacy comes from an understanding of how testimony is instilled in our hearts. Since it is the Holy Ghost who testifies of sacred truth, we can do at least three things to make that experience more likely for our families. First, we can teach some sacred truth. Then we can testify that we know what we have taught is true. And then we must act so that those who hear our testimony see that our actions conform with what we said was true. The Holy Ghost will then confirm to them the truth of what we said and that we knew it to be true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-legacy-of-testimony.p4" pid="gkUlYBfec0qSUnWsM-nstQ" hash="PXpr6A">That is how a legacy of testimony is created, preserved, and transmitted in a family. It isn’t easy, but ordinary people have done it. Like many of you, I had such ancestors. One was my great-grandfather John Bennion. We cannot duplicate what he did because the world has changed, but we can learn from it.</p>

He, his wife, and his children came into the Salt Lake Valley in one of the early companies of pioneers. We know something of his life because after that time he kept a journal, making a short entry nearly every day. We have the journals from 1855 to 1877. They were published in one bound volume because his descendants hoped to transmit that legacy of testimony. My mother was one of them. Her last labor before she died was to transform the day books in which he’d written into a manuscript for publication.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-legacy-of-testimony.p6" pid="K3dYlEsH90KB65aHNmeIdw" hash="ENdA7Q">His short entries don’t have much preaching in them. He doesn’t testify that he knew Brigham Young was a prophet. He just records having answered “yes” every time the prophet called him on a mission from “over Jordan” to the Muddy mission, then on to a mission back to Wales. He also answered “yes” to the call to ride into the canyons to track Johnston’s army and the call to take his family south when the army invaded the valley. There is even a family legend that the reason he died so close to the day when Brigham Young was buried was to follow the prophet one more time.</p>

The few entries which record his testimony seem to appear when death took a child. His testimony is to me more powerful because he offered it when his soul was tried.</p>

We need to start with ourselves as parents. No program we follow or family tradition we create can transmit a legacy of testimony we do not have. We must start where Alma started so that our descendants can know that we testified from the same ground from which he testified. Here are his words as recorded in the Book of Mormon. It is what we must be able to say:</p>

Be sure that some truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ is taught simply and plainly, so that even a child could understand. A child could do the teaching. The child may choose to end with a testimony, if that is the way we end our teaching. A shy child may not easily bear testimony in larger settings but may in the safety of our homes. And the Holy Ghost will testify to those who hear and to the child who testifies.</p>

It may take unusual determination and inspiration to find a time and a setting. But reading and hearing the words of life from the scriptures will invite the Holy Ghost to confirm their truth. The Savior said it this way: “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.39" class="scriptureRef">John 5:39</a>).</p>

Romney recounted reading the Book of Mormon aloud, alternating paragraphs with his young son, he on the bottom level of a double-decker bed and his son on the upper. He thought his son was catching a cold but then learned that the tears came from his son feeling testimony that the book was true. And because they read together, both were blessed. (See Conference Report, Apr. 1949, 41.)</p>

There may be times when the prayer seems rote and when those not praying let their minds wander. But there will be other priceless moments when someone will petition in faith for real needs and the Holy Ghost will touch hearts with testimony. I don’t remember as much of my mother’s teaching as I do her prayers for us. I could feel her love, and the Spirit confirmed in my heart that she loved Heavenly Father and the Savior and that her prayers would be answered. She brought blessings down on our heads then, and the memory of her prayers still does.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-legacy-of-testimony.p20" pid="8XM3LCvMaUS4UTZTORqFGw" hash="B81qPQ">Fourth, fast and allow your children to fast once a month before the meeting in which they will partake of the Lord’s Supper, hear others bear testimony, and perhaps themselves feel prompted to testify. The spiritual blessing will be even greater for them if they know that their choice to overcome their physical desires for food is making possible the caring for the poor. That can’t happen unless we pay a generous fast offering with a joyful heart. It can if we do. And the likelihood will be greatly increased that they will feel the Spirit confirm that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ if we have first taught and testified that the Savior always organizes his disciples to care for the poor and the needy among them.</p>

For instance, the warmth and confidence with which we receive home teachers can allow our children to feel confirmation that they come as God’s servants. The giving of priesthood blessings as children start a school year or leave home invites the Spirit at a time when hearts are humble and thus receptive to the whisperings of the Spirit.</p>

Tragedy, loss, and hurt often arrive unanticipated. How we react when we are surprised will tell our families whether what we have taught and testified lies deep in our hearts. Most of us will have taught our children of the power of the Savior to carry us through whatever befalls us. These words are from the Book of Mormon: “And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:12</a>).</p>

Our children will watch, feel the Spirit confirm that we lived as we preached, remember that confirmation, and pass the story across the generations.</p>

Grandmother Eyring learned from a doctor in his office that she would die of stomach cancer. My father, her oldest son, had driven her there and was waiting for her. He told me that on the way home she said, “Now, Henry, let’s be cheerful. Let’s sing hymns.” They sang “O My Father” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 292) and “Come, Come, Ye Saints,” where the last verse begins, “And should we die before our journey’s through” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 30).</p>

She spent part of her last months in the home of her oldest child, her daughter. Aunt Camilla told me that Grandma complained only once, and then it was not really a complaint but just to say that it hurt.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-legacy-of-testimony.p26" pid="q3Ldaz5qbE24zayHigKJww" hash="6SPZxA">Now, there are many people who have been cheerful and brave in the face of death. But it means far more to her family when the person has taught and testified of the power of the Savior to succor, of the sureness of the Resurrection, and of the hope of eternal life. The Spirit confirmed to me that Grandma’s peace and her courage were signs that her testimony was true, and because of that, all was well, all was well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-legacy-of-testimony.p27" pid="b5UTYhrnE0W7C2TSwsm0AQ" hash="AymGjg">Sadly, each of us knows that even teaching, testifying, and living true to that testimony may not pass on the legacy. Great and good parents have done that and then seen their families or some in their families reject that testimony. There is reason for us to have great hope and optimism. It comes first from our testimony of the nature of our Heavenly Father: he loves our family members; he is their Heavenly Father as well as ours. It also comes from our testimony of the mission of Jesus Christ: he paid the price to redeem them. And it comes from our testimony of the restoration of priesthood keys. Because of that, the power is on the earth again to make covenants with God, which seals families together, covenants which God honors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-legacy-of-testimony.p28" pid="kkmfUQ1W8UShDrGee39ALQ" hash="Z7BadQ">That is why we must not despair. As we offer the legacy of testimony to our families, some may not receive it. It may even seem to skip over generations. But God will reach out to offer the legacy again and again. More than we can imagine, our faithful effort to offer to our family the testimony we have of the truth will be multiplied in power and extended in time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-legacy-of-testimony.p29" pid="1_rQl1-NzU-2x4-NK_3F5A" hash="bi4BFw">We have all seen evidence of that in families we have known. I saw it in South America as I looked into the faces of missionaries. Hundreds of them passed by me, shaking my hand and looking deeply into my eyes. I was nearly overwhelmed with the confirmation that these children of Father Lehi and of Sariah were there in the Lord’s service because our Heavenly Father honors His promises to families. To nearly his last breath, Lehi taught and testified and tried to bless his children. Terrible tragedy came among his descendants when they rejected his testimony, the testimonies of other prophets, and of the scriptures. But in the eyes and faces of those missionaries I felt confirmation that God has kept his promises to reach out to Lehi’s covenant children and that he will reach out to ours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/a-legacy-of-testimony.p30" pid="3VS_yu5huUSubaWlMbjlNw" hash="YVknWQ">I testify that I know that God, our Heavenly Father, lives and that he loves us and that he knows us. I know that Jesus Christ lives and that we will be resurrected and can be sanctified because of his sacrifice. I testify that we can know the truth by the power of the Holy Ghost. I know that we can live together in families in eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God. I pray that we may, with all our hearts for all our lives, offer testimony of the truth to our families. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

From the day of baptism through the spiritual milestones of our lives, we make promises with God and He makes promises with us. He always keeps His promises offered through His authorized servants, but it is the crucial test of our lives to see if we will make and keep our covenants with Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p2" pid="g803_zcIGkqRSp9rYcBLcQ" hash="kHXzIA">I saw again the power of keeping covenants through a chance conversation with a man I sat down next to on a trip. I had never met him before, but apparently he had seen me in the crowd because his first words after I introduced myself were, “I’ve been watching you.” He told me about his work. I told him about mine. He asked about my family, and then he told me something about his. He said that his wife was a member of the Church and that he was not.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p3" pid="_0IO_L5-2kiK-yCKCxDXkA" hash="TNAg4g">After he came to trust me, he said something like this: “You know, there is something in your church you should fix. You need to tell your people when to quit.” He explained that he and his wife had been married for 25 years. She had been a member of the Church since childhood. In their years of marriage she had only once stepped into a building of the Church, and that was to tour a temple before its dedication, and then only because her parents had arranged it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p4" pid="P8COCgGPxU-ZyyFISIQBrA" hash="GzuQEA">Then, he told me why he thought we ought to make a change. He said that in those 25 years of married life, in which his wife showed no interest in the Church, visiting teachers and home teachers had never stopped coming to their home. He told of one evening when he went out to walk his dog alone only to find the home teacher happening by with his dog, eager to visit with him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p5" pid="S1wcbWbo6Uu7GRYuXvCraw" hash="9h8b4Q">He told, with a touch of exasperation, of another night when he came home from a long business trip, put his car in the garage, and then came out to find his home teachers standing there, smiling. He said to me something like, “And there they were, right in my face, with another plate of cookies.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p6" pid="ETCR_RbwRE2E1LHnMwMJbg" hash="R4RYLQ">I think I understood his feelings. And then I tried, as best I could, to tell him how hard it would be to teach such teachers to quit. I told him that the love that he had felt from those many visitors and their constancy over the years in the face of little response came from a covenant they had made with God. I told him about the baptismal covenant as Alma described it in the Book of Mormon. I didn’t quote these words, but you will remember them as Alma asked those he had taught whether they wished to be baptized:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p7" pid="HQ3QSsEGiUiiENck9KfkYA" hash="aPlzog">“And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p8" pid="KxuWHOBXwUasm4ObABxLWA" hash="zJLoJA">“Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:8–9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p9" pid="_8wYm1lL0UiCY80NUkgr5A" hash="7HO2uw">Those home teachers and visiting teachers understood and believed that the covenant to be a witness and to love were intertwined and that they reinforced each other. There is no other way to explain what had happened. My new friend recognized that the visitors had genuine concern for him and for his wife. And he knew their caring sprang from a belief that impelled them to come back. He seemed, at least to me, to understand that those visitors were driven from within by a covenant they would not break. As we parted I think he knew why he could expect that there would be more visits, more evidence of caring, and more patient waiting for the opportunity to bear testimony of the restored gospel. As we parted, I realized that I had learned something too. I will never again see home teaching or visiting teaching as only programs of the Church. Those faithful teachers saw what they were doing for what it really was. Such work is an opportunity, not a burden. Every member has made the covenant in the waters of baptism to be a witness for God. Every member has made a covenant to do works of kindness as the Savior would do. So any call to bear witness and to care for others is not a request for extra service; it is a blessing designed by a loving Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. They have provided such calls as well as other settings, sometimes without a formal call, all for the same purpose. Each is a chance to prove what blessings flow from being a covenant people, and each is an opportunity for which you agreed to be accountable. Each is a sacred responsibility for others accepted in the waters of baptism but too often not met because it may not be recognized for what it is.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p10" pid="hpHpnodXfkOt9HnpDmxejw" hash="DA72fw">The power of that covenant to love and to witness should transform what members do in other settings across the world. One of the most important is in the family. Prophets in our time have consolidated our meetings on Sunday to allow time for families to be together. The prophets have also been inspired to help us reserve Monday night for family home evenings. Those opportunities require choices. In thousands of homes the choices made are guided by the covenant to comfort those that stand in need of comfort and to stand as witnesses of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p11" pid="wENsf4TzJkWjA_Tq9GR8PA" hash="vsZxkA">Both the consolidation of the Sunday meetings and the creation of a family home evening are to provide opportunity for families to have time together to give Christlike service and to study the scriptures and gospel principles. The power of that possibility was taught by President Spencer W. Kimball this way: “I wonder what this world would be like if every father and mother gathered their children around them at least once a week, explained the gospel, and bore fervent testimonies to them. How could immorality continue and infidelity break families and delinquency spawn?” (<span class="emphasis">The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</span> ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 345).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p12" pid="gmQYKBBD-E6QLWvhJ8aggQ" hash="DY7F0g">There are in those hours on Sunday and in a family home evening on Monday the opportunity to combine genuine caring, teaching the gospel, and the bearing of testimony. Across the earth there are families who love and understand their covenants who do that. From my front window I have seen parents, their children at their sides, move down the street to the home of a neighbor to offer comfort, to give Christlike service. I wasn’t there to see it, but surely the warmth of those moments lingered later at home when a song of Zion was sung, a prayer given that likely included a plea for the person visited, a scripture read, a short lesson taught, and testimonies of the restored gospel borne.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p13" pid="Ic9Fbazx7kyLPzayr3SwYQ" hash="hSG7Eg">There is a caution I would give and a promise I would offer about such choices of how to use family time. For a person not yet a member of the Church, to fail to provide such moments of love and faith is simply a lost opportunity. But for those under covenant, it is much more. There are few places where the covenant to love and to bear witness is more easily kept than in the home. And there are few places where it can matter more for those for whom we are accountable. For members of the Church, my caution is that to neglect those opportunities is a choice not to keep sacred covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p14" pid="dvW8D60QwUiysHVtu7BvKg" hash="vvdBqA">Because God always honors covenants, I can make a promise to those who in faith keep the covenant to create experiences of giving love and bearing testimony with their families. They will reap a harvest of hearts touched, faith in Jesus Christ exercised unto repentance, and the desire and the power to keep covenants strengthened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p15" pid="SorNe6pn2EeOpGWKtlge8A" hash="TLB0EA">There is another circumstance in which the covenant to combine kindness with bearing witness has great power to change lives. Thousands of times every day members of the Church are watched, as I was by the man I met on a trip, by people curious to know something about our lives. Because we are under covenant to be a witness, we will try to tell them how the gospel has brought us happiness. What they think of what we say may depend largely on how much they sense we care for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p16" pid="ezMUCJsuQ0-jAp0KGV7zFQ" hash="PXI-_Q">That was true when King Lamoni met Ammon, as we have it described in the Book of Mormon. Ammon had been captured by guards and brought to the king, who could take his life. But apparently within minutes King Lamoni recognized that Ammon cared enough for him to want to serve him. Ammon said, when offered high station, “Nay, but I will be thy servant” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.25" class="scriptureRef">Alma 17:25</a>). Within days the king knew that Ammon was willing to risk his life for him. And then came the opportunity for Ammon to be a witness of God to the king.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p17" pid="4dVHQOaek0q2gYqciD6b9A" hash="M1PDBA">Those we meet will feel the love that springs from our long practice in keeping a covenant to “mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>). It may not be in hours or days as it was for King Lamoni, but they will feel our love after testing our hearts. And when they find our concern sincere, the Holy Spirit can more easily touch them to allow us to teach and to testify, as it did for Ammon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p18" pid="Gin7Q4fmkEOI8rbfC1OFlQ" hash="QhS92Q">Again I have a caution and a promise. The caution is that sorrow will come from failure either to love or to bear witness. If we fail to feel and show honest concern for those we approach with the gospel, they will reasonably distrust our message. But if out of fear of rejection we fail to tell them what the gospel has meant in our lives and could mean in theirs, we will someday share their sorrow. Either in this life or in the life to come, they will know that we failed to share with them the priceless gift of the gospel. They will know that accepting the gospel was the only way for them to inherit eternal life. And they will know that we received the gospel with a promise that we would share it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p19" pid="ms_gsz9PS0uJ8m63KybIZQ" hash="NRnhMQ">I can make two promises to those who offer the gospel to others. The first is that even those who reject it will someday thank us. More than once I have asked missionaries to visit friends far from where I lived, learned that the missionaries had been rejected, and then received a letter from my friend with words like this: “I was honored that you would offer to me something that I knew meant so much to you.” If not in this life, such messages will be sent to us in the world to come when those we approached will know the truth and how much we cared for them. My second promise is that as you offer the gospel to others, it will go down more deeply into your own heart. It becomes the well of water springing up into eternal life for us as we offer it to others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p20" pid="JzwdOJJT3kG3aNWsXJNRgw" hash="4oZoTQ">There is one other setting which provides a near-perfect opportunity to combine love and testimony. In every ward and branch in the Church, once a month we hold a fast and testimony meeting. We fast for two meals. With the money saved, and adding more to it whenever we can, we pay a generous fast offering. The bishop and the branch president use those offerings, under inspiration, to care for the poor and the needy. Thus, by paying a fast offering we give comfort to those in need of comfort as we promised that we would.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p21" pid="bmKZyh6wwEOLh8J2Y9kK6w" hash="DeBfVA">The fast also helps us to feel humble and meek so that the Holy Ghost may more easily be our companion. By our fast, we both keep our covenant to care for others and we prepare to keep our covenant to bear testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p22" pid="9c9gj3A68UqBRxdVDfoiTA" hash="k40mTQ">Those who have prepared carefully for the fast and testimony meeting won’t need to be reminded how to bear testimony should they feel impressed to do it in the meeting. They won’t give sermons or exhortations or travel reports or try to entertain as they bear witness. Because they will have already expressed appreciation to people privately, they will have less need to do it publicly. Neither will they feel a need to use eloquent language nor to go on at length.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p23" pid="vcdvyNSsjk-WR7lHqbkRow" hash="O7ChPQ">A testimony is a simple expression of what we feel. The member who has fasted both for the blessing of the poor and for the companionship of the Spirit will be feeling gratitude for the love of God and the certainty of eternal truth. Even a child can feel such things, which may be why sometimes the testimony of a child so moves us and why our preparation of fasting and prayer produces in us childlike feelings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p24" pid="TgF_cvRHAE6m-pXgYVoplg" hash="C78_Pw">That preparation for the fast and testimony meeting is a covenant obligation for members of the Church. The offering of the gospel to those we meet and to our families are covenant obligations. We can take heart that our honest effort to keep our covenants allows God to increase our power to do it. We all need that assurance at times when our promise to love and to witness seems hard for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p25" pid="oLJz2B6uSUGt6UNQu3tQ4A" hash="v8WaBg">The fruit of keeping covenants is the companionship of the Holy Ghost and an increase in the power to love. That happens because of the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ to change our very natures. We are eyewitnesses of that miracle of greater spiritual power coming to those who accept covenants and keep commandments. For instance, there are families across the Church who read and reread letters from their missionary children with wonder, and a few tears, at the miracle that in so short a time they have become new, better people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p26" pid="Wq8fZ4GdVUmkR8EwlfAzYA" hash="RmDchQ">Yet I have also seen that same miracle in a mature man and woman, called to serve as proselyting missionary companions in the most difficult of circumstances which would have taxed the bravest youth. As the husband made his report, I thought back to the man I had known. I realized that the promised miracle of spiritual growth is not a product of youth but of the faith simply to try to keep covenants. That couple went out to love the people and to bear witness, and they returned transformed as much as any 21-year-old.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p27" pid="YGOE7O8jgEKlBvg5VA9hHg" hash="1P11vA">Each of us who have made covenants with God face challenges unique to us. But each of us shares some common assurances. Our Heavenly Father knows us and our circumstances and even what faces us in the future. His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior, has suffered and paid for our sins and those of all the people we will ever meet. He has perfect understanding of the feelings, the suffering, the trials, and the needs of every individual. Because of that, a way will be prepared for us to keep our covenants, however difficult that may now appear, if we go forward in faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p28" pid="G2GEf-Fk_UORNWKSxTV90A" hash="L7yVwQ">I share with you the obligation to be a witness for God at all times and in all places that I will be in as long as I live. And I share with you the confidence that God can grant us the power to keep all our covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/witnesses-for-god.p29" pid="2cyGesZ350CgRXxmWPKNNA" hash="LvxSRQ">I am grateful that I know as surely as did the Apostles Peter, James, and John that Jesus is the Christ, our risen Lord, and that he is our advocate with the Father. I know that the Father bore direct witness of His Beloved Son by introducing the resurrected Lord to the boy Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove. I know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, translated by the Prophet Joseph through the power of God. I know that the keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood were restored by those who received them from the Savior and that President Gordon B. Hinckley is now the only person on earth authorized to direct the use of all those keys. I bear solemn testimony that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ, in which the ordinances and the covenants are offered, which if accepted and honored produce peace in this life and assure us eternal life in the world to come. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

He has said more than once, “How oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10.5" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 10:5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p2" pid="dp1Xi_VnkE2_m80rI0APnQ" hash="O-dZoA">The Lord expressed the same lament in our own dispensation after describing the many ways in which He calls us to safety:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p3" pid="Z3u_7AnAa02xQfjhMrlilA" hash="vi2GSg">“How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines and pestilences of every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long, and by the voice of glory and honor and the riches of eternal life, and would have saved you with an everlasting salvation, but ye would not!” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 43:25</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p4" pid="zBBLMZOJSk22qVpmo_yipA" hash="jy4G6w">There seems to be no end to the Savior’s desire to lead us to safety. And there is constancy in the way He shows us the path. He calls by more than one means so that it will reach those willing to accept it. And those means always include sending the message by the mouths of His prophets whenever people have qualified to have the prophets of God among them. Those authorized servants are always charged with warning the people, telling them the way to safety.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p5" pid="VEaZSpwIc0C27oUMRgb3pA" hash="4mnChA">When tensions ran high in northern Missouri in the fall of 1838, the Prophet Joseph Smith called for all the Saints to gather to Far West for protection. Many were on isolated farms or in scattered settlements. He specifically counseled Jacob Haun, founder of a small settlement called Haun’s Mill. A record of that time includes this: “Brother Joseph had sent word by Haun, who owned the mill, to inform the brethren who were living there to leave and come to Far West, but Mr. Haun did not deliver the message” (Philo Dibble, in “Early Scenes in Church History,” in <span class="emphasis">Four Faith Promoting Classics</span> [1968], 90). Later, the Prophet Joseph recorded in his history: “Up to this day God had given me wisdom to save the people who took counsel. None had ever been killed who [had abided] by my counsel” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:137). Then the Prophet recorded the sad truth that innocent lives could have been saved at Haun’s Mill had his counsel been received and followed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p6" pid="do9hkD3K602DBOE_qYywRA" hash="XrzeZQ">In our own time, we have been warned with counsel of where to find safety from sin and from sorrow. One of the keys to recognizing those warnings is that they are repeated. For instance, more than once in these general conferences, you have heard our prophet say that he would quote a preceding prophet and would therefore be a second witness and sometimes even a third. Each of us who has listened has heard President Kimball give counsel on the importance of a mother in the home and then heard President Benson quote him, and we have heard President Hinckley quote them both. The Apostle Paul wrote that “in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/13.1" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 13:1</a>). One of the ways we may know that the warning is from the Lord is that the law of witnesses, authorized witnesses, has been invoked. When the words of prophets seem repetitive, that should rivet our attention and fill our hearts with gratitude to live in such a blessed time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p7" pid="39LG6q1-zkyn4ni4oSZVOA" hash="VgN-hg">Looking for the path to safety in the counsel of prophets makes sense to those with strong faith. When a prophet speaks, those with little faith may think that they hear only a wise man giving good advice. Then if his counsel seems comfortable and reasonable, squaring with what they want to do, they take it. If it does not, they consider it either faulty advice or they see their circumstances as justifying their being an exception to the counsel. Those without faith may think that they hear only men seeking to exert influence for some selfish motive. They may mock and deride, as did a man named Korihor, with these words recorded in the Book of Mormon:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p8" pid="aK2jd5t3X0aVTwN5nczvWg" hash="BweD0Q">“And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their rights and privileges” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:27</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p9" pid="KZZ_QR7GGEKhtM0HOgxWKA" hash="KxHdtA">Korihor was arguing, as men and women have falsely argued from the beginning of time, that to take counsel from the servants of God is to surrender God-given rights of independence. But the argument is false because it misrepresents reality. When we reject the counsel which comes from God, we do not choose to be independent of outside influence. We choose another influence. We reject the protection of a perfectly loving, all-powerful, all-knowing Father in Heaven, whose whole purpose, as that of His Beloved Son, is to give us eternal life, to give us all that He has, and to bring us home again in families to the arms of His love. In rejecting His counsel, we choose the influence of another power, whose purpose is to make us miserable and whose motive is hatred. We have moral agency as a gift of God. Rather than the right to choose to be free of influence, it is the inalienable right to submit ourselves to whichever of those powers we choose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p10" pid="foFaOBFKSEivZ_ICc8iILg" hash="XZMmdw">Another fallacy is to believe that the choice to accept or not accept the counsel of prophets is no more than deciding whether to accept good advice and gain its benefits or to stay where we are. But the choice not to take prophetic counsel changes the very ground upon which we stand. It becomes more dangerous. The failure to take prophetic counsel lessens our power to take inspired counsel in the future. The best time to have decided to help Noah build the ark was the first time he asked. Each time he asked after that, each failure to respond would have lessened sensitivity to the Spirit. And so each time his request would have seemed more foolish, until the rain came. And then it was too late.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p11" pid="bqf63YMUmkWdgJNwXub8xA" hash="kYXqlg">Every time in my life when I have chosen to delay following inspired counsel or decided that I was an exception, I came to know that I had put myself in harm’s way. Every time that I have listened to the counsel of prophets, felt it confirmed in prayer, and then followed it, I have found that I moved toward safety. Along the path, I have found that the way had been prepared for me and the rough places made smooth. God led me to safety along a path which was prepared with loving care, sometimes prepared long before.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p12" pid="a7WNdyknyUGOUncMajCtBQ" hash="ILu0Jg">The account at the beginning of the Book of Mormon is of a prophet of God, Lehi. He was also the leader of a family. He was warned by God to take those he loved to safety. Lehi’s experience is a type of what happens as God gives counsel through His servants. Of Lehi’s family, only those who had faith and who themselves received confirming revelation saw both the danger and the way to safety. For those without faith, the move into the wilderness seemed not only foolish but dangerous. Like all prophets, Lehi, to his dying day, tried to show his family where safety would lie for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p13" pid="9vdsyiVu8UOW0Tya6k918Q" hash="Hnb74g">He knew that the Savior holds responsible those to whom He delegates priesthood keys. With those keys comes the power to give counsel that will show us the way to safety. Those with keys are responsible to warn even when their counsel might not be followed. Keys are delegated down a line which passes from the prophet through those responsible for ever smaller groups of members, closer and closer to families and to individuals. That is one of the ways by which the Lord makes a stake a place of safety. For instance, I have sat with my wife in a meeting of parents called by our bishop, our neighbor, so that he could warn us of spiritual dangers faced by our children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p14" pid="IAKzB61dLUCW764A4w1yFQ" hash="GgRU7w">I heard more than the voice of my wise friend. I heard a servant of Jesus Christ, with keys, meeting his responsibility to warn and passing to us, the parents, the responsibility to act. When we honor the keys of that priesthood channel by listening and giving heed, we tie ourselves to a lifeline which will not fail us in any storm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p15" pid="51jiFzP1SU-fFj8fHw1wEw" hash="uBayOA">Our Heavenly Father loves us. He sent His Only Begotten Son to be our Savior. He knew that in mortality we would be in grave danger, the worst of it from the temptations of a terrible adversary. That is one of the reasons why the Savior has provided priesthood keys so that those with ears to hear and faith to obey could go to places of safety.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p16" pid="w6FAaPnO_0KpbbNFMSbKug" hash="lhFbBA">Having listening ears requires humility. You remember the Lord’s warning to Thomas B. Marsh. He was then the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The Lord knew that President Marsh and his brethren of the Twelve would be tested. He gave counsel about taking counsel. The Lord said, “Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 112:10</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p17" pid="WsjKkUINmECW5AqWWOjTfw" hash="44p72A">The Lord added a warning that is applicable to any who follow a living prophet: “Exalt not yourselves; rebel not against my servant Joseph; for verily I say unto you, I am with him, and my hand shall be over him; and the keys which I have given unto him, and also to youward, shall not be taken from him till I come” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 112:15</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p18" pid="_Xdm6yCHlEyNJFdFrsud3g" hash="-Ls58A">God offers us counsel not just for our own safety, but for the safety of His other children, whom we should love. There are few comforts so sweet as to know that we have been an instrument in the hands of God in leading someone else to safety. That blessing generally requires the faith to follow counsel when it is hard to do. An example from Church history is that of Reddick Newton Allred. He was one of the rescue party sent out by Brigham Young to bring in the Willie and Martin Handcart Companies. When a terrible storm hit, Captain Grant, captain of the rescue party, decided to leave some of the wagons by the Sweetwater River as he pressed ahead to find the handcart companies. With the blizzards howling and the weather becoming life-threatening, two of the men left behind at the Sweetwater decided that it was foolish to stay. They thought that either the handcart companies had wintered over somewhere or had perished. They decided to return to the Salt Lake Valley and tried to persuade everyone else to do the same.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p19" pid="vMmXR1sV1kit5FBcKuh9sw" hash="cVm3WQ">Reddick Allred refused to budge. Brigham had sent them out and his priesthood leader had told him to wait there. The others took several wagons, all filled with needed supplies, and started back. Even more tragic, each wagon they met coming out from Salt Lake they turned back as well. They turned back 77 wagons, returning all the way to Little Mountain, where President Young learned what was happening and turned them around again. When the Willie Company was finally found, and had made that heartrending pull up and over Rocky Ridge, it was Reddick Allred and his wagons that waited for them. (See Rebecca Bartholomew and Leonard J. Arrington, <span class="emphasis">Rescue of the 1856 Handcart Companies</span> [1992], 29, 33–34.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p20" pid="fhxey8b28EydKpEloWlZmQ" hash="r0aU0A">In this conference you will hear inspired counsel, for instance, to reach out to the new members of the Church. Those with the faith of Reddick Newton Allred will keep offering friendship even when it seems not to be needed or to have no effect. They will persist. When some new member reaches the point of spiritual exhaustion, they will be there offering kind words and fellowship. They will then feel the same divine approval Brother Allred felt when he saw those handcart pioneers struggling toward him, knowing he could offer them safety because he had followed counsel when it was hard to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p21" pid="Pp_0TWufw0W9mkVMuwhnqg" hash="_vsDlQ">While the record does not prove it, I am confident that Brother Allred prayed while he waited. I am confident that his prayers were answered. He then knew that the counsel to stand fast was from God. We must pray to know that. I promise you answers to such prayers of faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p22" pid="LrwZaXY6ekODFvF-t8x28g" hash="HGY2Mw">Sometimes we will receive counsel that we cannot understand or that seems not to apply to us, even after careful prayer and thought. Don’t discard the counsel, but hold it close. If someone you trusted handed you what appeared to be nothing more than sand with the promise that it contained gold, you might wisely hold it in your hand awhile, shaking it gently. Every time I have done that with counsel from a prophet, after a time the gold flakes have begun to appear and I have been grateful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel.p23" pid="rfcPKOT2oUaMd1WVkiNQhw" hash="vTtROA">We are blessed to live in a time when the priesthood keys are on the earth. We are blessed to know where to look and how to listen for the voice that will fulfill the promise of the Lord that He will gather us to safety. I pray for you and for me that we will have humble hearts, that we will listen, that we will pray, that we will wait for the deliverance of the Lord which is sure to come as we are faithful. I testify that God, our Heavenly Father, lives and loves us. This is the Church of Jesus Christ. He lives and loves us. He is the head of the Church, and He is our Savior. I testify that Gordon B. Hinckley holds all the keys of the priesthood of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p1" pid="jqU_XWYIm0KJu1r6LDNhhA" hash="vVoJTQ">The Savior taught Peter and His other Apostles and disciples why and how they were to nourish others. You remember that in the Bible account He fed them before He taught them. He had been crucified and then resurrected. His servants had gone to Galilee. They had fished through the night, catching nothing. When they drew near to shore, in the dawn, they did not at first recognize Him. He called out to them, telling them where to cast their nets, and when they did the nets were filled. They rushed to greet Him on the shore.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p2" pid="TPdhiNEECEy9xHUQv8_oww" hash="A1wXPQ">They found a fire of coals with fish cooking and bread. I have often wondered, as you may have done, who laid the fire, who caught the fish, and who cooked the meal, but it was the Master who prepared His disciples to be fed more than fish and bread. He let them eat first. And then He taught them of spiritual feeding. And He gave a commandment to them which still stands for each of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p3" pid="1p4A0gUIl0y2LVhjKfhiRw" hash="R4vveA">“So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.15" class="scriptureRef">John 21:15</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p4" pid="EUcaL8NSvkWtzGycG6-yBA" hash="MLmgvQ">The Saints of God have always been under covenant to nourish each other spiritually, especially those tender in the gospel. We are blessed to live in a time when a great increase in that capacity to nourish new members of the Church must and therefore will be poured out upon the faithful Saints. That power has been given before among the Lord’s people. This is the description of how the Lord’s people did it once in a time recounted in the Book of Mormon. In a scripture that we’ve heard today, you remember that “they were numbered … that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 6:4</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p5" pid="e1JPBQM9X0-APcI--toCQw" hash="yWFPcg">All of us have tried at some time to nourish another person’s faith. Most of us have felt the concern of others for our own faith, and with it we have felt their love. More than a few of us have had a child look up to us and say, “Would you like to go to church with me?” or “Would you pray with me?” And we have had our disappointments. Someone we love may not have accepted our attempts to nourish their faith. We know from painful experience that God respects the choice of His children not to be nourished. Yet this is a time to feel renewed optimism and hope that our power to nourish will be increased.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p6" pid="ClDiYHSBzkWb7itLlWndmw" hash="Bae9Xg">The Lord through His living prophet has told us that He will preserve the bounteous harvest of new converts entering the waters of baptism across the earth. And the Lord will do it through us. So we can have confidence that by doing simple things, things that even a child can do, we will be granted soon greater power to nourish tender faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p7" pid="iI6-qctLm0-pTKcXA6txow" hash="CFXqeA">The place to start is with our own hearts. What we want with all our hearts will determine in large degree whether we can claim our right to the companionship of the Holy Ghost, without which there can be no spiritual nourishing. We can begin today to try to see those we are to nourish as our Heavenly Father sees them and so feel some of what He feels for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p8" pid="8HS0miBQgUup_eKkqTOuOA" hash="TiG0tw">Those new members of the Church are His children. He has known them and they have known Him in the world before this one. His purpose and that of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is to have them return to Him and to give them eternal life if only they will choose it. He has led and sustained His missionaries by the Holy Spirit to find and teach and baptize them. He allowed His Son to pay the price of their sins. Our Father and the Savior see those converts as tender lambs, purchased with a price we cannot fathom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p9" pid="DrL3u02giESIBW8uj2KBIA" hash="0UelJg">A mortal parent may appreciate, in some small way, the feelings of a loving Heavenly Father. When our children come to the age when they must leave our direct care, we feel anxiety for their safety and concern that those who are to help them will not fail them. We can feel at least some of the Father’s and the Savior’s love for the new members of the Church and the trust they place in us to nourish.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p10" pid="mkNUDb0QrU6zX2PldBFPBg" hash="s4cPJQ">Those feelings in our hearts for the new members will go far to qualify us for the help of the Spirit and thus overcome the fears which may deter us from our sacred responsibility. It is wise to fear that our own skills are inadequate to meet the charge we have to nourish the faith of others. Our own abilities, however great, will not be enough. But that realistic view of our limitations creates a humility which can lead to dependence on the Spirit and thus to power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p11" pid="BYUyqCdLREeto_0Mkd8fww" hash="6lutWg">Brigham Young told us to have courage despite our weaknesses. He did it in this language that seems so much like him:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p12" pid="c4CWMTGM-USGVOlGFVjP1w" hash="PDuQiw">“In addressing a congregation, though the speaker be unable to say more than half a dozen sentences, and those awkwardly constructed, if his heart is pure before God, those few broken sentences are of more value than the greatest eloquence without the Spirit of the Lord and of more real worth in the sight of God, angels, and all good men. In praying, though a person’s words be few and awkwardly expressed, if the heart is pure before God, that prayer will avail more than the eloquence of a Cicero. What does the Lord, the Father of us all, care about our mode of expression? The simple, honest heart is of more avail with the Lord than all the pomp, pride, splendor, and eloquence produced by men. When he looks upon a heart full of sincerity, integrity, and child-like simplicity, he sees a principle that will endure forever—‘That is the spirit of my own kingdom—the spirit I have given to my children’” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Brigham Young,</span> sel. John A. Widtsoe [1954], 169).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p13" pid="r6YXYSY1J0KEijJQX0a5uQ" hash="zA74FA">A child can do the things which will give us power to nourish the faith of others. Children could invite a recent convert to come with them to a meeting. Children could smile and greet a new member coming into a chapel or into a class. So can we. And as surely as we do, the Holy Ghost will be our companion. The fear of not knowing what to say and of being rejected will be taken from us. The newcomer will not appear to be a stranger to us. And the Holy Ghost will begin nourishing them even before we have spoken of gospel truths.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p14" pid="8B9gGIrGzUKVhVyBk-vLGA" hash="AqteAg">It does not require a calling more than being a member to nourish by reaching out in kindness. And even those who have no calling to teach or to preach can nourish with the good word of God if we prepare for it. We can do it every time we speak with a new member and every time we participate in a class discussion. Every word we speak can strengthen or weaken faith. We need help from the Spirit to speak the words which will nourish and which will strengthen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p15" pid="QNZu5P7igEyYyvaMjLOwQQ" hash="OMnBhQ">There are two great keys to inviting the Spirit to guide what words we speak as we feed others. They are the daily study of the scriptures and the prayer of faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p16" pid="2lC4DHqMRkeI9JkyTPINVg" hash="6RjaIA">The Holy Ghost will guide what we say if we study and ponder the scriptures every day. The words of the scriptures invite the Holy Spirit. The Lord said it this way: “Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 11:21</a>). With daily study of the scriptures, we can count on this blessing even in casual conversations or in a class when we may be asked by a teacher to respond to a question. We will experience the power the Lord promised: “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.85" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:85</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p17" pid="3_ncAlSpw0yMgjac6Kd1Ng" hash="TEE8rA">We treasure the word of God not only by reading the words of the scriptures but by studying them. We may be nourished more by pondering a few words, allowing the Holy Ghost to make them treasures to us, than to pass quickly and superficially over whole chapters of scripture.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p18" pid="fVtA3dY0u026p6kdl1ZdRA" hash="K0fMSA">Just as pondering the scriptures invites the Holy Ghost, so does daily pleading in prayer. If we do not ask in prayer, He will rarely come, and without our petition He is not likely to linger. “And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:14</a>). Heartfelt, constant pleading for the companionship of the Holy Ghost, with the pure intent to nourish our Father’s children, will surely bring blessings to us and to those we love and serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p19" pid="2sl5fVfZSkeMyy5njbM5wQ" hash="-H824g">The good word of God with which we must nourish is the simple doctrine of the gospel. We need not fear either simplicity or repetition. The Lord himself described how that doctrine goes into the hearts of men and women to nourish them: “Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto you my doctrine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p20" pid="OEN7oI_9wUa39gxmtO04dA" hash="3NSvbg">“And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p21" pid="rYQnd9kD00ygVIeCKzpotw" hash="3WP-Ig">“And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p22" pid="gWsb48Bnb0aPZzh4M0fY8A" hash="CaLGIQ">“And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p23" pid="k7SaGdPpOEuUCkWg0UgJlA" hash="efQW_w">“Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.31-35" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:31–35</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p24" pid="G4OrMEBVXUWnnmUjJl8GHw" hash="ZwUrXQ">The Lord went on to describe those who would be nourished by that simple doctrine and so endure, those who would inherit the celestial kingdom, as those who were childlike. It takes a childlike heart to feel the promptings of the Spirit, to surrender to those commands, and to obey. That is what it takes to be nourished by the good word of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p25" pid="h01Eo3yGn0SvjPuavq5iIA" hash="6O0PrQ">And that is why we can be so optimistic in our charge to nourish the new members of the Church. However much or little they knew of the doctrine, they have just submitted humbly to the ordinance of baptism and received the right to the companionship of the Holy Ghost. And so the very tenderness of their faith, which leads the Savior to refer to them as lambs, comes at a time when they have proven themselves willing to do what the Savior asks of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p26" pid="iP-zHaXqOEmNXAeutfMRmQ" hash="wPbIyg">If the full requirements of their new membership are explained clearly and with love, if the opportunity to serve in the Church is extended wisely and their performance in that service judged with charity and nurtured with patient encouragement, they will be strengthened by the companionship of the Holy Ghost and then they will be nurtured by power beyond our own. As they endure, even the gates of hell will not prevail against them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p27" pid="wua68VjwIEyxmY80bwrzEQ" hash="kAtE9A">Brigham Young made the promise of how their strength to stand would grow in these words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p28" pid="Swp1rsjlxEeRSF3ngIrziA" hash="MmG9eg">“Those who humble themselves before the Lord, and wait upon Him with a perfect heart and willing mind, will receive little by little, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little, ‘Now and again,’ as brother John Taylor says, until they receive a certain amount. Then they have to nourish and cherish what they receive, and make it their constant companion, encouraging every good thought, doctrine and principle and doing every good work they can perform, until by and bye the Lord is in them a well of water, springing up unto everlasting life” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 4:286–87).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p29" pid="Dw-JCAhkjUuRne--NjXuPA" hash="YaP7cw">That is what it means in Moroni when it says, “Relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 6:4</a>). It is the Savior who made possible our being purified through His Atonement and our obedience to His commandments. And it is the Savior who will nourish those who go down in faith into the waters of baptism and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. When they always remember Him, and when they continue in childlike obedience, it is He who will assure that they have His Spirit always to be with them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p30" pid="QMpq3G4xeUCyfqVcvgOYzQ" hash="OXvUwg">You and I can and will by small means be part of a great work. We will study and pray and serve to qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost. We will then be allowed to see the new members as precious, beloved children of our Heavenly Father, and we will be led to nourish them with love, with opportunity to serve, and with the good word of God. And then we will see in our own time what the great missionary Ammon described to his missionary companions, just as we are now companions to the missionaries laboring across the world:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p31" pid="sNcsErRIGU2DM-dl1ybU5A" hash="8Tuizg">“Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves!

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/feed-my-lambs.p33" pid="r65o4lMiR0af-MURHEJ5Aw" hash="gswtIA">“But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.5-7" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:5–7</a>).</p>

And at the creation of man and woman, unity for them in marriage was not given as hope, it was a command! “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/2.24" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 2:24</a>). Our Heavenly Father wants our hearts to be knit together. That union in love is not simply an ideal. It is a necessity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p2" pid="iTtnB0UY5Um3evAdEWNIrQ" hash="xA2-qA">The requirement that we be one is not for this life alone. It is to be without end. The first marriage was performed by God in the garden when Adam and Eve were immortal. He placed in men and women from the beginning a desire to be joined together as man and wife forever to dwell in families in a perfect, righteous union. He placed in His children a desire to live at peace with all those around them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p3" pid="-kEzQmlc5k-cVz0-MQVglA" hash="wXjSOA">But with the Fall it became clear that living in unity would not be easy. Tragedy struck early. Cain slew Abel, his brother. The children of Adam and Eve had become subject to the temptations of Satan. With skill, hatred, and cunning, Satan pursues his goal. It is the opposite of the purpose of our Heavenly Father and the Savior. They would give us perfect union and eternal happiness. Satan, their enemy and ours, has known the plan of salvation from before the Creation. He knows that only in eternal life can those sacred, joyful associations of families endure. Satan would tear us from loved ones and make us miserable. And it is he who plants the seeds of discord in human hearts in the hope that we might be divided and separate.</p>

Sometimes in families and perhaps in other settings we have glimpsed life when one person put the interests of another above his or her own, in love and with sacrifice. And all of us know something of the sadness and loneliness of being separate and alone. We don’t need to be told which we should choose. We know. But we need hope that we can experience unity in this life and qualify to have it forever in the world to come. And we need to know how that great blessing will come so that we can know what we must do.</p>

He taught it clearly in the prayer He gave in His last meeting with His Apostles before His death. That supernally beautiful prayer is recorded in the book of John. He was about to face the terrible sacrifice for all of us that would make eternal life possible. He was about to leave the Apostles whom He had ordained, whom He loved, and with whom He would leave the keys to lead His Church. And so He prayed to His Father, the perfect Son to the perfect Parent. We see in His words the way families will be made one, as will all the children of our Heavenly Father who follow the Savior and His servants:</p>

Those who would believe the truth He taught could accept the ordinances and the covenants offered by His authorized servants. Then, through obedience to those ordinances and covenants, their natures would be changed. The Savior’s Atonement in that way makes it possible for us to be sanctified. We can then live in unity, as we must to have peace in this life and to dwell with the Father and His Son in eternity.</p>

The ultimate purpose of what they taught, and of what we teach, is to unite families: husbands, wives, children, grandchildren, ancestors, and finally all of the family of Adam and Eve who will choose it.</p>

The Holy Ghost is a sanctifier. We can have it as our companion because the Lord restored the Melchizedek Priesthood through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The keys of that priesthood are on the earth today. By its power we can make covenants which allow us to have the Holy Ghost constantly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p13" pid="SqRH6S45xEenGEp5D3XoNQ" hash="tGpMtw">Where people have that Spirit with them, we may expect harmony. The Spirit puts the testimony of truth in our hearts, which unifies those who share that testimony. The Spirit of God never generates contention (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.29" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:29</a>). It never generates the feelings of distinctions between people which lead to strife (see Joseph F. Smith, <span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 13th ed. [1963], 131). It leads to personal peace and a feeling of union with others. It unifies souls. A unified family, a unified Church, and a world at peace depend on unified souls.</p>

The sacramental prayer tells us. We hear it every week as we attend our sacrament meetings. In those sacred moments we renew the covenants we made at baptism. And the Lord reminds us of the promise we received as we were confirmed members of the Church—the promise that we might receive the Holy Ghost. Here are the words of the sacramental prayer: “They are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>).</p>

First, we promise to take His name upon us. That means we must see ourselves as His. We will put Him first in our lives. We will want what He wants rather than what we want or what the world teaches us to want. As long as we love the things of the world first, there will be no peace in us. Holding an ideal for a family or a nation of comfort through material goods will, at last, divide them (see Harold B. Lee, <span class="emphasis">Stand Ye in Holy Places</span> [1974], 97). The ideal of doing for each other what the Lord would have us do, which follows naturally from taking His name upon us, can take us to a spiritual level which is a touch of heaven on earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p16" pid="_3Rs2yWcwEa8NVdchtTGyw" hash="1p82Aw">Second, we promise always to remember Him. We do that every time we pray in His name. Especially when we ask for His forgiveness, as we must do often, we remember Him. At that moment we remember His sacrifice that makes repentance and forgiveness possible. When we plead, we remember Him as our advocate with the Father. When the feelings of forgiveness and peace come, we remember His patience and His endless love. That remembering fills our hearts with love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p17" pid="jSFSbmawc0qF_WnL8NQQBw" hash="2qfwoQ">We also keep our promise to remember Him when as families we pray together and when we read the scriptures. At family prayer around a breakfast table, one child may pray for another to be blessed that things will go well that day in a test or in some performance. When the blessings come, the child blessed will remember the love of the morning and the kindness of the Advocate in whose name the prayer was offered. Hearts will be bound in love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p18" pid="TGcOrom_uUChlRJxE_mlDg" hash="yQzUew">We keep our covenant to remember Him every time we gather our families to read the scriptures. They testify of the Lord Jesus Christ, for that is the message and always has been of prophets. Even if children do not remember the words, they will remember the true Author, who is Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p19" pid="bzmiOjpv60iOd94qxs-gcw" hash="aWXDpQ">Third, we promise as we take the sacrament to keep His commandments, all of them. President J. Reuben Clark Jr., as he pled—as he did many times—for unity in a general conference talk, warned us against being selective in what we will obey. He put it this way: “The Lord has given us nothing that is useless or unnecessary. He has filled the Scriptures with the things which we should do in order that we may gain salvation.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p20" pid="EBjRj5yDrkKBhn6u6bdtTw" hash="zJcnEw">President Clark went on: “When we partake of the Sacrament we covenant to obey and keep his commandments. There are no exceptions. There are no distinctions, no differences” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1955, 10–11). President Clark taught that just as we repent of all sin, not just a single sin, we pledge to keep all the commandments. Hard as that sounds, it is uncomplicated. We simply submit to the authority of the Savior and promise to be obedient to whatever He commands (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>). It is our surrender to the authority of Jesus Christ which will allow us to be bound as families, as a Church, and as the children of our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p21" pid="wa2zcseLqkiidzuM66BYBQ" hash="fyxQag">The Lord conveys that authority through His prophet to humble servants. That faith turns our call as a home teacher or a visiting teacher into an errand from the Lord. We go for Him, at His command. An ordinary man and a teenage junior companion go into homes expecting that the powers of heaven will help them assure that families are united and that there is no hardness, lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking. That faith—that the Lord calls servants—will help us ignore their limitations when they reprove us, as they will. We will see their good intent more clearly than their human limitations. We will be less likely to feel offense and more likely to feel gratitude to the Master who called them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p22" pid="9KFLBmSdEEKAPDfMFj1u7w" hash="Cq-Nqg">There are some commandments which, when broken, destroy unity. Some have to do with what we say and some with how we react to what others say. We must speak no ill of anyone. We must see the good in each other and speak well of each other whenever we can (see David O. McKay, in Conference Report, Oct. 1967, 4–11).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p23" pid="s-7aSeKZWEKBqy58GM-rZg" hash="_bIHdQ">At the same time, we must stand against those who speak contemptuously of sacred things, because the certain effect of that offense is to offend the Spirit and so create contention and confusion. President Spencer W. Kimball showed the way to stand without being contentious as he lay on a hospital gurney and asked an attendant who, in a moment of frustration, took the name of the Lord in vain: “‘Please! Please! That is my Lord whose names you revile.’ There was a deathly silence, then a subdued voice whispered: ‘I am sorry’” (<span class="emphasis">The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</span> ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 198). An inspired, loving rebuke can be an invitation to unity. Failure to give it when moved upon by the Holy Ghost will lead to discord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p24" pid="KUJ4rEg_ZkSPZhyku27keQ" hash="dqJGTA">If we are to have unity, there are commandments we must keep concerning how we feel. We must forgive and bear no malice toward those who offend us. The Savior set the example from the cross: “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.34" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:34</a>). We do not know the hearts of those who offend us. Nor do we know all the sources of our own anger and hurt. The Apostle Paul was telling us how to love in a world of imperfect people, including ourselves, when he said, “Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.4-5" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13:4–5</a>). And then he gave solemn warning against reacting to the fault of others and forgetting our own when he wrote, “For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as I am known” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13:12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p25" pid="T_uT7KhsnkSRPQdRfpgM_Q" hash="NBTzwg">The sacramental prayer can remind us every week of how the gift of unity will come through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. When we keep our covenants to take His name upon us, to remember Him always, and to keep all His commandments, we will receive the companionship of His Spirit. That will soften our hearts and unite us. But there are two warnings which must come with that promise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p26" pid="C30rP79_iEORXK-7v3EkJw" hash="0dpjvg">First, the Holy Ghost remains with us only if we stay clean and free from the love of the things of the world. A choice to be unclean will repel the Holy Ghost. The Spirit only dwells with those who choose the Lord over the world. “Be ye clean” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20.41" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 20:41</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:42</a>) and love God with all your “heart, … might, mind, and strength” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:5</a>) are not suggestions but commandments. And they are necessary to the companionship of the Spirit, without which we cannot be one.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/that-we-may-be-one.p27" pid="IjdkXkh4YUSbS5468oV3YA" hash="sDHh7A">The other warning is to beware of pride. A unity which comes to a family or to a people softened by the Spirit will bring great power. With that power will come recognition from the world. Whether that recognition brings praise or envy, it could lead us to pride. That would offend the Spirit. There is a protection against pride, that sure source of disunity. It is to see the bounties which God pours upon us not only as a mark of His favor but an opportunity to join with those around us in greater service. A man and his wife learn to be one by using their similarities to understand each other and their differences to complement each other in serving one another and those around them. In the same way, we can unite with those who do not accept our doctrine but share our desire to bless the children of our Heavenly Father.</p>

That call to warn is made harder and more important by the fact that the warnings of most worth are about dangers that people don’t yet think are real. Think of Jonah. He fled at first from the call from the Lord to warn the people of Nineveh who were blinded to the danger by sin. He knew that wicked people through the ages have rejected prophets and sometimes killed them. Yet when Jonah went forward with faith, the Lord blessed him with safety and success.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p2" pid="E8lPWYjIHU2G5ugNiYaIWA" hash="QSS3dA">We can also learn from our experiences as parents and as children. Those of us who have been parents have felt the anxiety of sensing danger our children cannot yet see. Few prayers are so fervent as those of a parent asking to know how to touch a child to move away from danger. Most of us have felt the blessing of hearing and heeding the warning voice of a parent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p3" pid="5KpK_6Z8V0audhc9XwNoPQ" hash="7SuB4w">I can still remember my mother speaking softly to me one Saturday afternoon when, as a little boy, I asked her for permission to do something I thought was perfectly reasonable and which she knew was dangerous. I still am amazed at the power she was granted, I believe from the Lord, to turn me around with so few words. As I remember them, they were: “Oh, I suppose you <span class="emphasis">could</span> do that. But the <span class="emphasis">choice</span> is yours.” The only warning was in the emphasis she put on the words <span class="emphasis">could</span> and <span class="emphasis">choice.</span> Yet that was enough for me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p4" pid="PUbjpz9NU0yiIoK8KzDXNQ" hash="I490xg">Her power to warn with so few words sprang from three things I knew about her. First, I knew she loved me. Second, I knew she had already done what she wanted me to do and been blessed by it. And third, she had conveyed to me her sure testimony that the choice I had to make was so important that the Lord would tell me what to do if I asked Him. Love, example, and testimony: those were keys that day, and they have been whenever I have been blessed to hear and then heed the warning of a servant of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p5" pid="L_KzKfyhyEm0R-R-OvA8Wg" hash="YQJqpA">Our ability to touch others with our warning voice matters to all who are covenant disciples of Jesus Christ. Here is the charge given to each of the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: “Behold, I sent you out to testify and warn the people, and it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.81" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:81</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p6" pid="lIRyYEPwQUejwYp2PRLiNQ" hash="5hsshQ">That command and warning of danger was given to those called as missionaries at the start of the Restoration. But the duty to warn our neighbor falls on all of us who have accepted the covenant of baptism. We are to talk with nonmember friends and relatives about the gospel. Our purpose is to invite them to be taught by the full-time missionaries who are called and set apart to teach. When a person has chosen to accept our invitation to be taught, a “referral” of great promise has been created, one far more likely to enter the waters of baptism and then to remain faithful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p7" pid="m8_gJhm5YEGCLSCl8JyB4Q" hash="yvZq_g">As a member of the Church, you can expect that the full-time or the stake missionaries will ask for the opportunity to visit with you in your home. They will help you make a list of people with whom you could share the gospel. They may suggest you think of relatives, neighbors, and acquaintances. They may ask you to set a date by which you will try to have the person or family prepared to be taught, perhaps even ready to invite the missionaries. I’ve had that experience. Because we in our family accepted that invitation from the missionaries, I was blessed to perform the baptism of a widow in her 80s, taught by sister missionaries.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p8" pid="n0xVxnm-Nkqh8rx-9Ocamg" hash="iG4USg">When I placed my hands on her head to confirm her a member of the Church, I felt impressed to say that her choice to be baptized would bless generations of her family, after and before her. She’s dead now, but in a few weeks I will be in the temple with her son as he is sealed to her.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p9" pid="GHU7VOGZzUKbda6nrMSnKg" hash="JwEr5A">You may have had such experiences with people you have invited to be taught, and so you know that few moments in life are sweeter. The Lord’s words are true for the missionaries and for all of us: “And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p10" pid="ux19mYIMwECLfe2t_C18jQ" hash="Wm6xuQ">The missionaries will help and encourage us, but whether such moments at the baptismal font and in the temple come more often will depend largely on how we see our charge and what we choose to do about it. The Lord would not use the word <span class="emphasis">warn</span> if there is no danger. Yet not many people we know sense it. They have learned to ignore the increasing evidence that society is unraveling and that their lives and family lack the peace they once thought was possible. That willingness to ignore the signs of danger can make it easy for you to think: <span class="emphasis">Why should I speak to anyone about the gospel who seems content? What danger is there to them or to me if I do or say nothing?</span></p>

For instance, at some moment in the world to come, everyone you will ever meet will know what you know now. They will know that the only way to live forever in association with our families and in the presence of our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, was to choose to enter into the gate by baptism at the hands of those with authority from God. They will know that the only way families can be together forever is to accept and keep sacred covenants offered in the temples of God on this earth. And they will know that you knew. And they will remember whether you offered them what someone had offered you.</p>

Years ago I worked for a man in California. He hired me, he was kind to me, he seemed to regard me highly. I may have been the only Latter-day Saint he ever knew well. I don’t know all the reasons I found to wait for a better moment to talk with him about the gospel. I just remember my feeling of sorrow when I learned, after he had retired and I lived far away, that he and his wife had been killed in a late night drive to their home in Carmel, California. He loved his wife. He loved his children. He had loved his parents. He loved his grandchildren, and he will love their children and will want to be with them forever.</p>

But I suppose that I will meet him, that he will look into my eyes, and that I will see in them the question: “Hal, you knew. Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

I want to increase my power to invite people to be taught. With that desire and with faith that God will help us, we will do better. It isn’t hard to see how.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p15" pid="fq70YaZ6CUe0EsNHVtpWwQ" hash="JKrgYw">Love always comes first. A single act of kindness will seldom be enough. The Lord described the love we must feel, and that those we invite must recognize in us, with words like these: “Charity suffereth long,” and it “beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.4,7" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13:4, 7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/a-voice-of-warning.p16" pid="sOXBx8S4LEalOZXc8Kh3uQ" hash="K4GByQ">I’ve seen what “suffereth long” and “endureth all things” mean. A family moved into a house near us. The home was new, so I was part of the crew of Latter-day Saints who spent a number of nights putting in landscaping. I remember the last night, standing next to the husband of the family as we finished. He surveyed our work and said to us standing nearby, “This is the third yard you Mormons have put in for us, and I think this is the best.” And then he quietly but firmly told me of the great satisfaction he got from membership in his own church, a conversation we had often in the years he lived there.</p>

One evening, I came home to see a truck in his driveway. I had been told they were moving to another state. I approached to see if I could help. I didn’t recognize the man I saw loading household things into the truck. He said quietly as I drew near, “Hello, Brother Eyring.” I hadn’t recognized him because he was the son, now grown older, who had lived there, married, and moved away. And because of the love of many for him, he was now a baptized member of the Church. I don’t know the end of that story because it will have no end. But I know that it begins with love.</p>

In a darkening world, this command of the Savior will become more important: “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.16" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:16</a>).</p>

But you and your family are watched more than you may realize. I had the chance in the spring of this year to attend and speak at meetings with nearly 300 ministers and leaders of other churches. I visited alone with as many as I could. I asked them why they had been so attentive to my message, which was to recount the origins of the Church, to tell of the young Joseph Smith’s First Vision and of living prophets. In every case, they gave essentially the same answer. They told a story of a person or a family—a story of knowing some of you. One repeated often was of a neighbor family, Latter-day Saints: “They were the finest family I have ever known.” Often they spoke of some community effort or public response to a disaster where members of the Church worked in a way which to them seemed remarkable.</p>

They were ready to listen to the truths of the Restoration—that families can be sealed forever and that the gospel can change our very natures. They were ready because of your examples.</p>

Love and example will open the way. But we still have to open our mouths and bear testimony. We are helped by a simple fact. Truth and choice are inseparably connected. For everyone, there are some choices we must make to qualify for a testimony of spiritual truths. And for everyone, once we know a spiritual truth we must choose whether we will conform our lives to it. That means there are some things we must do before we invite our friends to make choices. And when we bear testimony of truth to them, we must convey to them the choices which, once they know that truth, they must make. There are two important examples: inviting someone to read the Book of Mormon and inviting someone to agree to be taught by the missionaries.</p>

When we have done that, we can testify from personal experience to our friends that they can make that choice and know the same truth. When they know the Book of Mormon is the word of God, they will face another choice: whether to accept your invitation to be taught by the missionaries. To make that invitation with testimony, you will need to know that the missionaries are called as servants of God.</p>

Missionaries will welcome the opportunity. When you sit with them as they teach, as I have, you will know they are inspired with power beyond their years and their education. Then, when you invite others to choose to be taught by the missionaries, you will be able to bear testimony that they will teach the truth and that they offer the choices which lead to happiness.</p>

But the Lord knew we might feel that way.

You have felt His love and His caring, even when you did not respond, as those you approach with the gospel may not respond. Time after time He has invited you to be taught by His servants. You may not have recognized that in the visits of home teachers and visiting teachers or in a bishop’s phone call, but those were His invitations to be helped and taught. And the Lord has always made consequences clear and then allowed us to choose for ourselves.</p>

The battle still rages, and the casualties seem to be increasing. All of us have family members we love who are being buffeted by the forces of the destroyer, who would make all God’s children miserable. For many of us, there have been sleepless nights. We have tried to add every force for good we can to the powers swirling around the people who are at risk. We have loved them. We have set the best example we could. We have pled in prayer for them. A wise prophet long ago gave us counsel about another force which we may at times underestimate and thus use too little.</p>

In the face of that danger, he could not do everything, so he had to choose. He could have built fortifications or created armaments or trained armies. But his only hope of victory was to get God’s help, and for that he knew the people must repent. And so he chose to try one thing first:</p>

Alma knew that words of doctrine had great power. They can open the minds of people to see spiritual things not visible to the natural eye. And they can open the heart to feelings of the love of God and a love for truth. The Savior drew on both those sources of power, to open our eyes and open hearts, in the 18th section of the Doctrine and Covenants as He taught His doctrine to those whom He wants to serve Him as missionaries. As you listen, think of that young man in your family now wavering in preparing himself for a mission. Here is how the Master taught two of His servants and how you might teach His doctrine to the young man you love:</p>

Doctrine gains its power as the Holy Ghost confirms that it is true. We prepare those we teach, as best we can, to receive the quiet promptings of the still, small voice. That takes at least some faith in Jesus Christ. It takes at least some humility, some willingness to surrender to the Savior’s will for us. The person you would help may have little of either, but you can urge that they desire to believe. More than that, you can take confidence from another of the powers of doctrine. Truth can prepare its own way. Simply hearing the words of doctrine can plant the seed of faith in the heart. And even a tiny seed of faith in Jesus Christ invites the Spirit.</p>

The Holy Ghost is the Spirit of Truth. His confirmation is invited by our avoiding speculation or personal interpretation. That can be hard to do. You love the person you are trying to influence. He or she may have ignored the doctrine they have been taught. It is tempting to try something new or sensational. But we invite the Holy Ghost as our companion when we are careful to teach only true doctrine.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-power-of-teaching-doctrine.p32" pid="cB0m3L4mTUq9slAMDQW7KA" hash="NuMfUg">That caused some problems with her weaving. In those days, many children died very young. The women around the loom had lost children in death, some of them several children. When Mary taught the truth that little children were heirs of the celestial kingdom and that those women might again be with them and with the Savior and our Heavenly Father, tears rolled down the faces of the women. Mary cried too. All those tears falling got the cloth wet that Mary had woven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-power-of-teaching-doctrine.p33" pid="HGNdX3RKyUSZV3pESCc6Yw" hash="OFe3Sw">Mary’s teaching created a more serious problem. Even though Mary begged the women not to talk about what she told them, they did. They shared the joyous doctrine with their friends. So one night there was a knock at the door. It was the police. They took Mary off to jail. On the way, she asked the policeman for the name of the judge she was to appear before the next morning. She asked if he had a family. She asked if he was a good father and a good husband. The policeman smiled as he described the judge as a man of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-power-of-teaching-doctrine.p34" pid="STh-CA3k0kWKYVQJe3aYNw" hash="3AEPqQ">At the jail, Mary asked for a pencil and some paper. She wrote a letter to the judge. She wrote about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the Book of Mormon, about the spirit world, and about how long the judge would have to think and to consider his life before facing the final judgment. She wrote that she knew he had much to repent of which would break his family’s heart and bring him great sorrow. She wrote through the night. In the morning she asked the policeman to take her letter to the judge. He did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-power-of-teaching-doctrine.p35" pid="n8yMg7MIMESjTLAdCRZ1zw" hash="3pivfg">Later, the policeman was summoned by the judge to his office. The letter Mary had written was irrefutable evidence that she was teaching the gospel and so breaking the law. Nevertheless, it wasn’t long until the policeman came back to Mary’s cell. He told her that all charges were dismissed and that she was free to go, on the conditions she had stated in her letter. Her teaching the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ had opened eyes and hearts enough to get her cast into jail. And her declaring the doctrine of repentance to the judge got her cast out of jail (see Theresa Snow Hill, <span class="emphasis">Life and Times of Henry Eyring and Mary Bommeli</span> [1997], 15–22).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-power-of-teaching-doctrine.p36" pid="zbpzmawhy0embGMh6C_KTQ" hash="SkKgCw">The teaching of Mary Bommeli touched more than those women around the loom and the judge. My father, her grandson, talked to me during the nights as he approached death. He spoke of joyous reunions that were coming soon in the spirit world. I could almost see the bright sunlight and the smiles in that place of paradise as he talked about it with such assurance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-power-of-teaching-doctrine.p37" pid="WD9GVCvmeES-OgiJRETMMQ" hash="88OeDg">At one point, I asked him if he had some repenting to do. He smiled. He chuckled softly as he said, “No, Hal, I’ve been repenting as I went along.” The doctrine of paradise that Mary Bommeli taught those women was real to her grandson. And even the doctrine Mary taught the judge had shaped my father’s life for good. That will not be the end of Mary Bommeli’s teaching. The record of her words will send true doctrine to generations of her family yet unborn. Because she believed that even a new convert knew enough doctrine to teach it, the minds and hearts of her descendants will be opened, and they will be strengthened in the battle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-power-of-teaching-doctrine.p38" pid="g3rN5tCfC0KDZrpJ5bBziA" hash="UAKI3g">Your descendants will teach doctrine to each other because you taught it. Doctrine can more than open minds to spiritual things and hearts to the love of God. When that doctrine brings joy and peace, it also has the power to open mouths. Like those women in Berlin, your descendants will not be able to keep the good news to themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/the-power-of-teaching-doctrine.p39" pid="gDsAZtgYbkWcj5lncfwVgQ" hash="J3_YIA">I am grateful to live in a time when we and our families have the fulness of the gospel restored. I am grateful for the Savior’s mission of love for us and for the words of life which He has given us. I pray that we may share those words with those we love. I testify that God our Father lives and loves all His children. Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten Son in the flesh and our Savior. He is risen. We can be washed clean through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The keys of the priesthood are restored. President Gordon B. Hinckley holds those keys. I know that is true. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p1" pid="e3k-Q_mLyE6N6f4A9cy-xg" hash="VB0wTQ">All of us have faced deadlines. Fear can grip us when we realize that there may not be enough time left to finish what we promised we would do. The thought comes, “Why didn’t I start earlier?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p2" pid="JjP4smbDkEyii0lci9Hu9A" hash="tJzUvw">The Lord knew we would be tempted to procrastinate the most important preparation we could ever make in this life. More than once He warned us about delay. He taught the parable of the ten virgins, five of whom did not fill their lamps for the coming of the bridegroom. He also gave the parable of the servants who were faithless because they believed their Lord would delay His coming. The results of delay were tragic.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p3" pid="ReBktKdv5E6JnNiwdiBpFg" hash="bgq6bQ">For the five unprepared virgins, it was this:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p4" pid="zyCjx_AJsEeZt4swNphNIQ" hash="0CJRoA">“Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p5" pid="Z40tf1bWGESWphFmKf48vg" hash="kn8IXQ">“But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:11–12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p6" pid="bGZ5bAmqg0u6R5aY8XXu5Q" hash="dne46Q">For the faithless servants who delayed their preparation, it was this:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p7" pid="xY9I7kTMVkGU_8Gq5ZDAFw" hash="aInezg">“The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p8" pid="LXeFJkwn6k2q_8XuQEGsiQ" hash="TV4KrQ">“And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.50-51" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:50–51</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p9" pid="0ZO8bnto4kaivmAvJEEzcg" hash="1VkJLA">The temptation to delay repentance comes not only at the end of the world as suggested by those scriptures. That temptation seems to have been nearly constant since the beginning of time and goes on throughout our lives. In youth we may have thought: “There will be time enough to worry about spiritual things just before my mission or before marriage. Spiritual things are for older people.” Then, in the early years of marriage, the pressures of life, of jobs, of bills, of finding a moment for rest and recreation seem to crowd us so closely that delay in meeting obligations to God and family again seems reasonable. It is easy to think, “Perhaps there will be more time for that in the middle years.” But the compression of time does not ease in the years that follow. There is so much to do, and time seems to shrink. The 55th birthday and the 65th and the 75th don’t seem to be a decade apart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p10" pid="wJrARNFA202PuPI9MeOEQA" hash="wnMDDQ">With aging comes physical and emotional challenge. We cannot seem to get as much done in an hour as we did in youth. And it is harder to be patient with others, and they seem more demanding. It is tempting then to excuse ourselves yet again from rising to the standards required by our early covenants, now so long neglected.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p11" pid="4ZJqHHPgW0mmAbY-LBzb4g" hash="n0LgoA">Not all of us fall into that trap of inaction. But enough people do that we each have at least one person we love and often more—a child, a parent, a friend—someone for whom we feel responsibility, for whom we ache with concern. They have been taught the gospel. They have made covenants. And yet they go on in disobedience or neglect, despite the emptiness we know that brings them. The choice to repent or to remain a prisoner of sin is their own. Yet knowing something of how the trap of inaction and resistance was built in their minds and hearts may help us hear more easily the answer to our fervent prayer: “Please, Heavenly Father, what can I do to help?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p12" pid="8G8YggUO3kGn4UJVZm3Dug" hash="OeK9Ng">That temptation to delay comes from our enemy, Lucifer. He knows that we can never be truly happy unless we have hope in this life and then realization, in the next, of eternal life. It is the greatest of all the gifts of God. It is to live in families forever with our Heavenly Father and with Jesus Christ and to have eternal increase. Satan wants us to be miserable as he is. And he knows that we can only have that true happiness if we are washed clean through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, by deep and continuing repentance, and the making and keeping of sacred covenants offered only through God’s authorized servants. The scriptures confirm the hazard:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p13" pid="NY2LguaXZkS8GRnHr4rNZA" hash="uIM3yw">“Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10.21" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 10:21</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p14" pid="x9lldDwAGkKOo7O9iLC0aQ" hash="uBOesA">And so Satan tempts with procrastination throughout our days of probation. Any choice to delay repentance gives him the chance to steal happiness from one of the spirit children of our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p15" pid="7yIiL_viCku-8kB2EScEuA" hash="jxPr9Q">We have all been tempted with that delay. We know from our own experience that President Spencer W. Kimball was right when he wrote, “One of the most serious human defects in all ages is procrastination,” and then he defined it: “an unwillingness to accept personal responsibility <span class="emphasis">now”</span> (<span class="emphasis">The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</span> ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 48; emphasis in original). And so Satan works on both our desire to think we have no cause to repent and our desire to push anything unpleasant into the future. He has tempted you and me, and those we love, with thoughts like this: “God is so loving; surely He won’t hold me personally responsible for mistakes which are simply the result of being human.” And then, if that fails, there is the thought that will almost surely come: “Well, I may be responsible to repent, but this is not a good time to start. If I wait, later will be better.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p16" pid="xAfBb8gf0kiOI7OAClmQ9w" hash="EjasgQ">There are some truths which expose those lies intended to tempt us to procrastinate repentance. Let’s start with the deception, which is so attractive, that we have no need to repent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p17" pid="np9TcY7crU2ZafIN9-a_9w" hash="T2-cTA">The truth is that we all need repentance. If we are capable of reason and past the age of eight, we all need the cleansing that comes through applying the full effects of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. When that is clear, we cannot be tricked into delay by the subtle question: “Have I crossed the line of serious sin, or can I put off even thinking about repentance?” The question that really matters is this: “How can I learn to sense even the beginning of sin and so repent early?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p18" pid="vD9he_UNrE2Pj1I_HOJ-Bg" hash="qTdXJw">A second truth about our accountability is to know that we are not the helpless victims of our circumstances. The world tries to tell us that the opposite is true: imperfections in our parents or our faulty genetic inheritance are presented to us as absolving us of personal responsibility. But difficult as circumstances may be, they do not relieve us of accountability for our actions or our inactions. Nephi was right. God gives no commandments to the children of men save He prepares a way for them to obey. However difficult our circumstances, we can repent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p19" pid="CaGmBe3vrUCv0UySotHDVw" hash="tsEvKg">Similarly, the world might be willing to excuse our bad behavior because those around us behave badly. It is not true that the behavior of others removes our responsibility for our own. God’s standards for our behavior are unchanged whether or not others choose to rise to them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p20" pid="E3eqADpMwkWNJzxIM11rew" hash="C5SxUg">That becomes especially difficult when others hurt us and we feel justified in our anger. It is a lie that our anger justifies our impulse to hurt or ignore our antagonists. We are to forgive to be forgiven. To wait for them to repent before we forgive and repent is to allow them to choose for us a delay which could cost us happiness here and hereafter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p21" pid="tYBvmspU40W6C3mutFDCWQ" hash="NHK_0w">Finally, we are personally accountable because the Lord has given us ample warning. We receive the Spirit of Christ at birth to tell us right from wrong and to allow us to experience the connection between sin and unhappiness. From the beginning of time He has sent prophets to speak against sin and to invite faith and repentance. He has restored the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Gordon B. Hinckley is His living prophet, holding all the keys of the priesthood which allow those who live now to repent and to choose to gain eternal life. We are made accountable this day as the Holy Ghost confirms that these words are true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p22" pid="SAuTYXH5Z0Gb4ZZuudQX2w" hash="HDCNwA">Even the acceptance of personal responsibility may not overcome the temptation to believe that now is not the time to repent. “Now” can seem so difficult, and “later” appear so much easier. The truth is that today is always a better day to repent than any tomorrow. First, sin has its debilitating effects on us. The very faith we need to repent is weakened by delay. The choice to continue in sin diminishes our faith and lessens our right to claim the Holy Ghost as our companion and comforter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p23" pid="LGRJ84kAPkurf2aJzq63UA" hash="II5ecg">And second, even should we be forgiven at some later time, the Lord cannot restore the good effects our repentance today might have had on those we love and are to serve. That is particularly poignant for the parents of young children. In those tender years there are chances for shaping and lifting spirits which may never come again. But even the grandfather who may have missed chances with his own children might, by choosing to repent today, do for grandchildren what he once could have done for their parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p24" pid="WWNBkMBJSkW1epglFfC_Kg" hash="OO4MQQ">When responsibility is accepted and the urgency to repent is felt, the question may come, “Where do I start?” Each life is unique. But for all, repentance will surely include passing through the portal of humble prayer. Our Father in Heaven can allow us to feel fully the conviction of our sins. He knows the depths of our remorse. He can then direct what we must do to qualify for forgiveness. For serious sin, we will need to confess to a judge in Israel and accept his guidance. Prayer alone will in that case not be enough. But for all of us, whatever the gravity of our sins, prayer will open the door to repentance and forgiveness. Without earnest prayer, repentance and cleansing are not possible. When the door is opened by prayer, there is possibility for peace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p25" pid="NQ0joHOjnk-Uf2uiowZV8w" hash="t7QNYw">One of the questions we must ask of our Heavenly Father in private prayer is this: “What have I done today, or not done, which displeases Thee? If I can only know, I will repent with all my heart without delay.” That humble prayer will be answered. And the answers will surely include the assurance that asking today was better than waiting to ask tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p26" pid="N0kCHfEY3kuIMC_19IG_8g" hash="aNo4zA">I testify that the words of a servant of God, spoken long ago, are true:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p27" pid="9FK9EOnCakyAgyHeVcDilQ" hash="zA9HGQ">“And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have received so many witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come forth and bring fruit unto repentance.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p31" pid="33fTWYsXv0mgcZHJky8NnA" hash="t9tGYA">“Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.30-34" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:30–34</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p32" pid="qIfZqGIYxkOo9jsw_R78kA" hash="JPzRWw">There is another temptation to be resisted. It is to yield to the despairing thought that it is too hard and too late to repent. I knew a man once who could have thought that and given up. When he was 12 he was ordained a deacon. Some of his friends tempted him to begin to smoke. He began to feel uncomfortable in church. He left his little town, not finishing high school, to begin a life following construction jobs across the United States. He was a heavy-equipment operator. He married. They had children. The marriage ended in a bitter divorce. He lost his children. He lost an eye in an accident. He lived alone in boardinghouses. He lost everything he owned except what he could carry in a trunk.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p33" pid="YUwNyVtHcU6iAwDmLXDkAA" hash="Rf0xAw">One night, as he prepared to move yet again, he decided to lighten the load of that trunk. Beneath the junk of years, he found a book. He never knew how it got there. It was the Book of Mormon. He read it through, and the Spirit told him it was true. He knew then that all those years ago he had walked away from the true Church of Jesus Christ and from the happiness which could have been his.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p34" pid="CtX4SLJ_O0iiFSsn5ocvkA" hash="P0kyrw">Later, he was my more-than-70-year-old district missionary companion. I asked the people we were teaching, as I testified of the power of the Savior’s Atonement, to look at him. He had been washed clean and given a new heart, and I knew they would see that in his face. I told the people that what they saw was evidence that the Atonement of Jesus Christ could wash away <span class="emphasis">all</span> the corrosive effects of sin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p35" pid="PofY2bUMpEGVTyGNWQ8iZw" hash="2Q4aQg">That was the only time he ever rebuked me. He told me in the darkness outside the trailer where we had been teaching that I should have told the people that while God was able to give him a new heart, He had not been able to give him back his wife and his children and what he might have done for them. But he had not looked back in sorrow and regret for what might have been. He moved forward, lifted by faith, to what yet might be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p36" pid="-RWfw3x2j0OVFlKb1YBilw" hash="C3Qebg">One day he told me that in a dream the night before, the sight in his blind eye was restored. He realized that the dream was a glimpse of a future day, walking among loving people in the light of a glorious resurrection. Tears of joy ran down the deeply lined face of that towering, raw-boned man. He spoke to me quietly, with a radiant smile. I don’t remember what he said he saw, but I remember that his face shone with happy anticipation as he described the view. With the Lord’s help and the miracle of that book in the bottom of a trunk, it had not for him been too late nor the way too hard.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/do-not-delay.p37" pid="2Zom3VkAIEOEOaw_Ox7oWA" hash="vdYIzA">I testify that God the Father lives. I know that. And He loves us. His Only Begotten Son lives. Because He was resurrected, we too will live again. We will see then those we have loved and who have loved us. We can through faith and obedience have family associations forever. Those in our families who love us, on both sides of the veil, would say as we consider whether to humble our hearts and repent, “Please, do not delay.” That is the Savior’s invitation and His plea. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p1" pid="zGXKddGY7U6Tf8LbXPMHgw" hash="l3AsAA">Hundreds of thousands of people in the last year were baptized and confirmed members of the Church. Each was given the opportunity of a call to serve. For them and for the Church, that experience will shape the future. Many of us remember the first time we gave a talk or conducted a meeting or knocked on the door of a home as an official visitor. My heart beats a little faster just thinking about it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p2" pid="lm2-iRGu80O6dcWJlHDXUQ" hash="vLgpsg">The new members may have been baptized only days or weeks before their call to serve. Some of them had never seen anyone perform the service that now was theirs. Because we have no professional clergy, the challenge of calls to serve came to more than the new members. In the last year, it is estimated that nearly two million Latter-day Saints received either a new call to be a shepherd or were given some new sheep to watch over. Just less than half of those called were youth, some as young as 12 or 13 years of age. More than 30,000 missionaries were called and set apart in that time. Most of them were less than 20 years of age. They went with only brief training and little experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p3" pid="wxIJiWhFO0WHelAJx_uZtA" hash="Z_2E_g">Someone who knows organizations in the world might predict failure for a rapidly growing church depending on so many novice lay members. Even those called may well have felt some apprehension. And yet when they see through the eyes of faith the challenge as it really is, confidence replaces fear because they turn to God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p4" pid="Q9wq_Qi_bkuUoRheNUT9cA" hash="txT1IQ">My message is first to those newly called to serve in the Church, then to those who called them, and finally to those they will serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p5" pid="B5Vm2mtmkkSv135Wz3hNKw" hash="nZf_iQ">First, to the newly called: Confidence depends on your seeing the call for what it is. Your call to serve is not from human beings. It is a trust from God. And the service is not simply to perform a task. Whatever name it has, every call is an opportunity and an obligation to watch over and strengthen the children of our Heavenly Father. The Savior’s work is to bring to pass their immortality and eternal life (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>). He called us to serve others so that we could strengthen our own faith as well as theirs. He knows that by serving Him we will come to know Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p6" pid="Ff7DEt713kifsDKF4tKHFg" hash="cjlyRQ">An inspired prophet saw service as the way we come to want what the Lord wants. He wrote: “For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p7" pid="viYFANxGmU2meXn-RnXgBw" hash="EOXSbg">Because you are called by Jesus Christ to His service, you may go forward with great confidence. First, you may be assured that He knows you and your capacity to grow. He has prepared you. Calls will stretch you, often at the start and always over their course, but He will give you the Holy Ghost to be your companion. The Holy Ghost will tell you what to do when your own abilities and efforts are not enough (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>). The Holy Ghost will prompt you to bear testimony with conviction. The Savior will let you feel the love He feels for those you serve. The call is an invitation to become like Him (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p8" pid="k_a2573wt06ZiC_1ZNQ7iw" hash="dj6YnQ">You might well ask, “How will seeing my call that way make me more confident of success?” The answer is that seeing it in that lofty way will make it more likely that you will go for help to the only source that is never-failing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p9" pid="FHnbqqNNkE2zxTPH5cCAvw" hash="znlFnA">I saw a young man nearly overwhelmed by a new call not long ago. The Lord had inspired His servant to call him to be the president of a stake. The young man had never been a bishop. He had never served in a stake presidency. The stake had in it many men of greater maturity and experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p10" pid="sOqCgPqfW0GT97O7Dk9h4w" hash="FTvpZg">He was humbled when he heard the call. His wife through tears said to the servant of the Lord who called him, “Are you sure?” Her husband said quietly that he would serve. His wife nodded her support, tears streaming down her face. As you might have done at such a time, he wanted to talk with his father, who was far away. He called him that afternoon on the telephone. His father has been a dairy farmer all his life. He raised the boy into a man through milking cows and letting his son observe him stop to talk with neighbors to see how they were doing. The next morning, in his first talk as a stake president, this is how he recounted the conversation with his father:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p11" pid="AWGH4WUlPUOwV9V1F0otjg" hash="gmcwSw">“Many of you that know me know I am a man of few words. I must have gotten that from my father. As I called him yesterday to let him know that I was being called as a stake president, his one response to me was, ‘Well, you better do a lot of praying.’ That was his counsel to me. What better counsel could he give?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p12" pid="4Tb9IINeHk6XDedaDMkVAg" hash="Qk7g5g">His father couldn’t have done much better. And you can see why. The Lord is his only hope for success. Most of the help will come through the ministrations of the Holy Ghost. The Lord’s servants cannot succeed without it. We can only have the Holy Ghost as a companion if we plead for it and if we qualify for it. And both require a lot of praying, praying with real faith in our Heavenly Father and in His Beloved Son and in the Holy Ghost (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 90:24</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.1" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:1</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p13" pid="VaIkFQ7So0mQOu8v4AyKow" hash="JWguEg">To have the companionship of the Holy Ghost, we must be cleansed of sin (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.29" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:29</a>). That only comes through faith enough in Jesus Christ to repent and qualify for forgiveness (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 3:20</a>). And then we have to stay away from sin. That takes prayer, both frequent and fervent (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.18" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 18:18</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p14" pid="LyAGCtbfc0erzbtWb89shQ" hash="WDhlSg">“You better do a lot of praying” is good counsel for all of the Lord’s servants, new or seasoned. It is what His wise servants do. They pray.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p15" pid="FJcqnU0HHEG7cK6j-KF1oQ" hash="Traohw">The disciples of Jesus Christ when He lived on the earth noticed that about Him. He was the Son of God. He was Jehovah. And yet He prayed often enough to His Heavenly Father that His disciples realized that they must know how to pray to be His servants. So they asked Him to teach them. You remember the record:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p16" pid="16Gvjj0DikSntP2mKFOFmQ" hash="nzHgJQ">“And it came to pass, that, as [Jesus] was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p17" pid="zZNfWJb3nkuYlaL7JayBXQ" hash="rYiIuQ">“And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p18" pid="O_99hv95eke7Ec53bPL6ow" hash="r5o8xA">“And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/11.1-2,4" class="scriptureRef">Luke 11:1–2, 4</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.9-13" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:9–13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p19" pid="SQnJTUpcwk2qkFMvqx2yog" hash="58lbjw">We seldom use those exact words as we pray. But the words of that prayer are a perfect summary of what a servant of the Lord pleads for to qualify for the promise the Savior makes to all whom He calls: “And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:88</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p20" pid="4PgKuSBIJUq3JWExeIcsHg" hash="AlWafg">Think of that prayer as a standard of service. The prayer begins with reverence for our Heavenly Father. Then the Lord speaks of the kingdom and its coming. The servant with a testimony that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ feels joy in its progress and a desire to give his or her all to build it up.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p21" pid="8UeeHpuIV06mCVaKb57j9A" hash="4scOHA">The Savior Himself exemplified the standard set by these next words of the prayer: “Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/11.2" class="scriptureRef">Luke 11:2</a>). That was His prayer in the extremity of offering the Atonement for all mankind and all the world (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.42" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:42</a>). The faithful servant prays that even the apparently smallest task will be done as God would have it done. It makes all the difference to work and to pray for His success more than for our own.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p22" pid="6B0do3Xg9EC7r6Yk-31Y4Q" hash="jKvjBA">Then the Savior set for us this standard of personal purity: “And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/11.4" class="scriptureRef">Luke 11:4</a>). The strengthening we are to give those we watch over comes from the Savior. We and they must forgive to be forgiven by Him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.14" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:14</a>). We and they can only hope to remain clean with His protection and with the change in our hearts that His Atonement makes possible. We need that change to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. Such a gift might seem too lofty and too distant for us and for those we serve. But a prophet of the Lord named Samuel called and anointed a young man named Saul. On that very day, Samuel promised Saul: “And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/10.6" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 10:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p23" pid="AAWTI40RDUyKcCN6Rblg_A" hash="vNd3cw">That promise was fulfilled, not after many years or months or even days. Listen to the account in 1 Samuel, the tenth chapter:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p24" pid="_TAsi8f8zkeJYXg9aJ13GQ" hash="pnyzag">“And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p26" pid="NX56ZFW1c0iOYxMcU9ZStA" hash="pvVD4w">You may have confidence in the Lord’s service. The Savior will help you do what He has called you to do, be it for a time as a worker in the Church or forever as a parent. You may pray for help enough to do the work and know that it will come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p27" pid="fcIECxSxH0-O9guxwSiN2g" hash="9A8eBA">Now, a word to those who have issued those calls in the Church. When you did, you conveyed the trust of the Lord. But He placed a trust with you as well. Just as those members were called to watch over and strengthen others, you were placed under the same obligation to watch over and strengthen them. If you issued the call and gave no training or did not watch to see that the training was enough, you failed them and the Lord. Even with that training, the path will become difficult for them. You know that, and so you must watch and listen to see when they need strengthening. You will give just enough help to strengthen their faith that the Lord is watching over them and over the people they serve and that they may turn with confidence to Him. To do that well, you must do a lot of praying yourself, for guidance and for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p28" pid="wSvJ1oMYGkK0W0xN2weBBA" hash="gQZUog">Finally, a word to those of us who are served by those who are newly called. Our opportunity and our obligation is the same as theirs. We are to watch and strengthen. And each of us has almost endless chances to do it. Every meeting you attend, every class, every activity will have someone doing something that to them is at the limit of their capacities, or maybe a little beyond. Most of us carry into those situations the attitudes we learn in the world, where we may be quick to notice inferior service. It is too easy to think, <span class="emphasis">In the Lord’s true Church, our standard of performance should be higher than that.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p29" pid="xGEIlD0MBUO_2D-X0xN8TQ" hash="Jdv3BQ">There is more than one way to help the Lord lift them to that standard. One is to express or show our displeasure. I’ve been the beneficiary of another way, the better way. I’ve sensed when I was not doing very well when I was speaking or teaching or leading in a meeting. Most people can tell when they are failing. I have been able to tell when I have been not doing well, and I’ve looked out and seen someone in the audience apparently not paying attention to me, with eyes closed. I’ve learned not to be irritated. And then they’ve opened their eyes and smiled at me, with a look of encouragement that was unmistakable. It was a look that said as clearly as if they had spoken to me: <span class="emphasis">I know the Lord will help you and lift you up. I’m praying for you.</span> I’ve been in settings where many people listening to me were doing that. And I was lifted beyond what I knew were my abilities, or at least what I had thought my abilities were. You could serve that way when you see people struggling in their service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p30" pid="yZKcO8tHeUaa4jrnApqn1w" hash="DEQd2w">It will take a lot of praying, but you could watch and you could strengthen, even when your only call in the Church at that moment is to be a follower of Jesus Christ and your only tools are to pray and smile and encourage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/watch-over-and-strengthen.p31" pid="NRezyQ3BZUSvyU2-Mtsjhg" hash="eHCxFg">There is a miracle appearing in the Church. I see it as I travel back to nations after an absence of only a short time. The members and the leaders are changed. Just as Alma promised, their souls have been enlarged and their understanding enlightened and their minds expanded (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28,34" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:28, 34</a>). They have served each other in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He has sent them the Holy Ghost as a companion in answer to fervent prayer. Their watching over and testifying and loving and helping each other has let the Lord give a miracle of growth in the hearts and capacities of humble sons and daughters of God.</p>

The child learns both from what the parents do and what they say. The child who sees a mother or a father pass through the trials of life with fervent prayer to God and then hears a sincere testimony that God answered in kindness will remember what they saw and heard. When their trials come, they will be prepared.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/write-upon-my-heart.p2" pid="TfJ--DZ1CkSYgfzg5n1tMw" hash="4FNG-w">In time, when the child is away from home and family, prayer can provide the shield of protection the parent will want so much for them to have. Parting can be hard, particularly when the parent and the child know that they may not see each other for a long time. I had that experience with my father. We parted on a street corner in New York City. He had come there for his work. I was there on my way to another place. We both knew that I probably would never return to live with my parents under the same roof again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/write-upon-my-heart.p3" pid="aBPiUL8mHUqGK9EGVE8DpA" hash="z1U1WQ">It was a sunny day, around noontime, the streets crowded with cars and pedestrians. On that particular corner there was a traffic light which stopped the cars and the people in all directions for a few minutes. The light changed to red; the cars stopped. The crowd of pedestrians hurried off the curbs, moving every way, including diagonally, across the intersection.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/write-upon-my-heart.p4" pid="lfYCUUF21UeauMGaLc8KdQ" hash="lWugjg">The time had come for parting, and I started across the street. I stopped almost in the center, with people rushing by me. I turned to look back. Instead of moving off in the crowd, my father was still standing on the corner looking at me. To me he seemed lonely and perhaps a little sad. I wanted to go back to him, but I realized the light would change and so I turned and hurried on.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/write-upon-my-heart.p5" pid="i5yNlWM2b0qfaZY4nihgKg" hash="YvcC_g">Years later I talked to him about that moment. He told me that I had misread his face. He said he was not sad; he was concerned. He had seen me look back, as if I were a little boy, uncertain and looking for assurance. He told me in those later years that the thought in his mind had been: <span class="emphasis">Will he be all right? Have I taught him enough? Is he prepared for whatever may lie ahead?</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/write-upon-my-heart.p6" pid="PpKy0JDxuEuq1pv6yJ1gvw" hash="VTnH6Q">There were more than thoughts in his mind. I knew from having watched him that he had feelings in his heart. He yearned for me to be protected, to be safe. I had heard and felt that yearning in his prayers, and even more in the prayers of my mother, for all the years I had lived with them. I had learned from that, and I remembered.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/write-upon-my-heart.p7" pid="mtE6VYRt3EiqaSqY82NJPw" hash="E8Visg">Prayer is a matter of the heart. I had been taught far more than the rules of prayer. I had learned from my parents and from the Savior’s teachings that we must address our Heavenly Father in the reverent language of prayer. “Our Father … in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:9</a>). I knew that we never profane His sacred name—never. Can you imagine how the prayers of a child are harmed by hearing a parent profane the name of God? There will be terrible consequences for such an offense to the little ones.</p>

I had been taught that we ask for what we need and pray for others to be blessed. “Give us this day our daily bread” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.11" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:11</a>). I knew that we must surrender our will. “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.10" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:10</a>). I had been taught and found it true that we can be warned of danger and shown early what we have done which displeased God. “And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.13" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:13</a>).</p>

But something I had seen and heard had taught me those words were more than a formality. There was a picture of the Savior on the bedroom wall where my mother was bedridden in the years before she died. She had put it there because of something her cousin Samuel O. Bennion had told her. He had traveled with an Apostle who described seeing the Savior in a vision. Elder Bennion gave her that print, saying that it was the best portrayal he had ever seen of the Master’s strength of character. So she framed it and placed it on the wall where she could see it from her bed.</p>

I had learned from her that we do not close in the name of a stranger when we approach our Father in prayer. I knew from what I had seen of her life that her heart was drawn to the Savior from years of determined and consistent effort to serve Him and to please Him. I knew the scripture was true which warns, “For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:13</a>).</p>

If I were to go, and all the rest were to go, with this spirit, then the Spirit of God would be felt in our midst, and that which we would decide upon would be the mind and will of God, because God would reveal it to us.

They cannot lift the weight of sin from their own shoulders. And even the most hardened may at times feel the prick of conscience and thus the need for forgiveness from God. A loving father, Alma, taught that need to his son Corianton this way: “And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:15</a>).</p>

You will someday be separated from them, with a longing in your heart to be reunited. A loving Heavenly Father knows that longing would last forever unless we are reunited as families with Him and His Beloved Son. He put in place all His children will need to have that blessing. To find it, they must ask of God for themselves, nothing doubting, as the boy Joseph Smith did.</p>

We sat quietly in the darkened living room for a while. Dad excused himself and went to his bedroom. He was gone for a few minutes. When he walked back into the living room, there was a smile on his face. He said that he’d been concerned for Mother. During the time he had gathered her things from her hospital room and thanked the staff for being so kind to her, he thought of her going into the spirit world just minutes after her death. He was afraid she would be lonely if there was no one to meet her.</p>

I can’t remember a sermon from my mother or my father about prayer. They prayed when times were hard and when they were good. And they reported in matter-of-fact ways how kind God was, how powerful and how close. The prayers I heard most were about what it would take for us to be together forever. And the answers which will remain written on my heart seem most often to be the assurances that we were on the path.</p>

That is who we are. When we accepted the priesthood, we took upon us the responsibility to do our part in watching over the Church. None of us can escape accountability. The president of the priesthood in all the earth bears the total responsibility. Through the keys of the priesthood, each quorum bears its part. Even the newest deacon in the most distant place on earth has a part in the great responsibility to watch over the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p2" pid="G5ogd8ndAUeN62SPnNGcnw" hash="nR3mLQ">Listen to these words from the Doctrine and Covenants: “Therefore, let every man stand in his own office, and labor in his own calling; and let not the head say unto the feet it hath no need of the feet; for without the feet how shall the body be able to stand?” And then the Savior includes even the deacons in His listing of assignments: “The deacons and teachers should be appointed to watch over the church, to be standing ministers unto the church” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.109,111" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:109, 111</a>).</p>

In many places in the scriptures, the Lord has described Himself and those He calls to the priesthood as shepherds. A shepherd watches over sheep. In the scriptural stories, the sheep are in danger; they need protection and nourishment. The Savior warns us that we must watch the sheep as He does. He gave His life for them. They are His. We cannot approach His standard if, like a hired servant, we watch only when it is convenient and only for a reward. Here is His standard:</p>

They are His, and we are called by Him to watch over them. We are to do more than warn them against danger. We are to feed them. Once, long ago, the Lord commanded His prophet to rebuke the shepherds of Israel. Here is the warning, which is still in force, in the words of the prophet Ezekiel:</p>

One of the great shepherds in the Book of Mormon described both what that food is and how it can be provided:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p11" pid="KmwYldjfo0Cz3xl2reITdw" hash="2MdrKQ">It is painful to imagine a shepherd feeding himself and letting the sheep go hungry. Yet I have seen many shepherds who feed their flocks. One was the president of a deacons quorum. One of his quorum members lived near my home. That neighbor boy had never attended a quorum meeting nor done anything with the members of his quorum. His stepfather was not a member, and his mother did not attend church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p12" pid="Ge8BFjopf0iBsBRcenj1ig" hash="-grb0g">The presidency of his deacons quorum met in council one Sunday morning. Each week they were fed the good word of God by the fine adviser and teacher. In their presidency meeting, those 13-year-old shepherds remembered the boy who never came. They talked about how much he needed what they received. The president assigned his counselor to go after that wandering sheep.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p13" pid="7LfKPKUJTU27JbVwtm0pAA" hash="FRSn_A">I knew the counselor, and I knew he was shy, and I knew the difficulty of the assignment, so I watched with wonder through my front window as the counselor trudged by my house, going up the road to the home of the boy who never came to church. The shepherd had his hands in his pockets. His eyes were on the ground. He walked slowly, the way you would if you weren’t sure you wanted to get where you were headed. In 20 minutes or so, he came back down the road with the lost deacon walking by his side. That scene was repeated for a few more Sundays. Then the boy who had been lost and was found moved away.</p>

It was just three boys sitting in a room around a small table. Then it was a boy walking up a road and coming back with another boy. But years later, I was in a stake conference, a continent away from the room in which that presidency had met in council. A gray-haired man came up to me and said quietly, “My grandson lived in your ward years ago.” With tenderness, he told me of that boy’s life. And then he asked if I could find that deacon who walked slowly up that road. And he wondered if I could thank him and tell him that his grandson, now grown to be a man, still remembered.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p15" pid="KPrBxt3_sE2nu3SREi7oCQ" hash="3bi8Fg">He remembered because in those few weeks he had been, for the first time in his life that he recognized, watched over by the shepherds of Israel. He had been warned by hearing eternal truth from people who cared about him. He had been offered the bread of life. And young shepherds had been true to their trust from the Lord.</p>

The Savior showed us how, and how to train others to do it. He established His Church. He had to leave His Church in the hands of inexperienced servants, just as many of us are. He knew they would face difficulties beyond their human powers to resolve. What He did for them can be a guide for us.</p>

But He took His priesthood servants with Him. Here is the account from Matthew: “Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and <span class="emphasis">watch with me</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.38" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:38</a>; emphasis added).</p>

He watches with us. He who sees all things, whose love is endless, and who never sleeps—He watches with us. He knows what the sheep need at every moment. By the power of the Holy Ghost, He can tell us and send us to them. And we can by the priesthood invite His power to bless them.</p>

The wolf who would kill the sheep will surely tear at the shepherd. So we must watch over ourselves as well as others. As a shepherd, we will be tempted to go near the edges of sin. But sin in any form offends the Holy Ghost. You must not do anything or go anywhere that offends the Spirit. You cannot afford that risk. Should sin cause you to fail, you would not only be responsible for your own sins but for the sorrow you might have prevented in the lives of others had you been worthy to hear and obey the whisperings of the Spirit. The shepherd must be able to hear the voice of the Spirit and bring down the powers of heaven or he will fail.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p23" pid="I4-qwoxjb0CgfMgUugaJ5w" hash="XIqntQ">The warning given to an ancient prophet is a warning to us as well:</p>

But the Lord taught Peter how to build the foundation for success. He repeated a simple message three times. It was that love for the Lord would be in the heart of a true shepherd. Here is the end of the account:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p27" pid="mThNCXiOxUinnjjB-nKvmQ" hash="Vi9YwA">“He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.17" class="scriptureRef">John 21:17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p28" pid="VR1JyRsk9EG8CrqtfSXaxw" hash="wCvPtA">It is love that must motivate the shepherds of Israel. That may seem difficult at the start, because we may not even know the Lord well. But if we begin with even a little grain of faith in Him, our service to the sheep will increase our love for Him and for them. It comes from simple things that every shepherd must do. We pray for the sheep, every one for whom we are responsible. When we ask, “Please tell me who needs me,” answers will come. A face or a name will come into our minds. Or we may have a chance meeting that we feel isn’t chance. In those moments, we will feel the love of the Savior for them and for us. As you watch over His sheep, your love for Him will grow. And that will increase your confidence and your courage.</p>

I have so many people to watch over. And I have so little time.</span> But where the Lord calls He prepares a way, His way. There are shepherds who believe that. I’ll tell you about one.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p30" pid="OIKcegmSt0ikJ8OJfX2acg" hash="7nPOdw">Two years ago, a man was called as the president of his elders quorum. He had been a member of the Church for less than 10 years. He had just become worthy to be sealed to his wife and family in the temple. His wife was an invalid. He had three daughters. The oldest was 13, and she cooked the meals and, with the others, cared for the house. His scant earnings from manual labor supported not only those five people but a grandfather who lived with them in their small house.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p31" pid="Z_sypv5pAUyh1D7UCqwGEQ" hash="rI8ctQ">When he was called to be president of his elders quorum, it had 13 members. That tiny quorum was responsible for another 101 men who either had no priesthood at all or who were deacons, teachers, or priests. He was responsible to watch over the souls of 114 families, with little hope that he could devote more than his Sundays and perhaps one night a week to his service, with all he did to serve his own family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p32" pid="qmPe6y6dEUudP0PIaXlFhQ" hash="6NA9xw">The difficulty of what he faced drove him to his knees in prayer. Then he stood up and went to work. In his efforts to meet and know his sheep, his prayers were answered in a way he had not expected. He came to see beyond individuals. He came to know that the Lord’s purpose was for him to build families. And even with his limited experience, he knew that the way to build families would be to help them qualify to make and keep temple covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p33" pid="sf-RCE_xbUOBGLVAWPGLZQ" hash="Vdu-HQ">He began to do what a good shepherd always does, but he did it differently when he saw the temple as their destination. First, he prayed to know who were to be his counselors to go with him. And then he prayed to know which families needed him and had been prepared.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p34" pid="88IVN3kAskqC3T4joU-Pdg" hash="csq8fQ">He called on as many as he could. Some were cold and did not accept his friendship. But with those who did, he followed a pattern. As soon as he saw interest and trust, he invited them to meet the bishop. He had asked the bishop beforehand: “Please tell them what it takes to be worthy to go to the temple to claim its blessings for them and their families. And then please testify to them, as I have, that it will be worth it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p35" pid="GRXdbruvJEivtsZRtkGJmw" hash="97OmFA">A few then accepted the quorum president’s invitation to a temple preparation class taught by stake leaders. Not all completed the course and not all qualified for the temple. But each family and each father was prayed for. Most were invited at least once to a feast of the good word of God. With every invitation came the president’s testimony of the blessings of being a family sealed forever and the sadness of being separated. Every invitation was issued with the love of the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p36" pid="A9PznfMup0WVyg2ZtfKNBg" hash="7tWtyg">During the president’s service, he has seen 12 of the men he taught ordained elders. He has seen four of his elders ordained high priests. Those numbers don’t come close to measuring the miracle. The families of those men will be blessed over generations. Fathers and mothers are now sealed to each other and to their children. They are praying over their children, receiving the help of heaven, and teaching the gospel with the love and inspiration the Lord gives to faithful parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p37" pid="1UV1yOyKbkqf4LEQWd6yLA" hash="Ve7W0w">That president and his counselors have become true shepherds. They have watched over the flock with the Master and have come to love Him. They are eyewitnesses to the truth of what the Savior taught an Apostle, Thomas B. Marsh. It is true for all who watch with the Lord over His sheep:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/watch-with-me.p38" pid="a9yDOxhZ8064wUcJZ803fg" hash="fISKBw">“Go your way whithersoever I will, and it shall be given you by the Comforter what you shall do and whither you shall go.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p1" pid="ZXLoI2c2RkqAuJANhoysqQ" hash="WKfzMA">The world seems to be in commotion. There are wars and rumors of wars. The economies of whole continents are faltering. Crops are failing from lack of rain in places all over the earth. And the people in peril have flooded heaven with prayers. In public and in private, they are petitioning God for help, for comfort, and for direction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p2" pid="UYFKIiy-U0mpOI2ZU3T1Lg" hash="VeDylA">You have probably noticed, as I have in recent days, that prayers have not only become more numerous but more heartfelt. I often am seated on the stand in a meeting near the person who has been asked to pray. I have listened recently with wonder. The words spoken are clearly inspired by God, both eloquent and wise. And the tone is that of a loving child seeking help, not as we might from an earthly parent but from an all-powerful Heavenly Father who knows our needs before we ask.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p3" pid="MJDMjIx6iEiDdhb-1emKAA" hash="b_ZFnw">Such a turning to fervent prayer when the world seems out of joint is as old as mankind. In times of tragedy and danger, people turn to God in prayer. Even the ancient King David would recognize what is happening. You remember his words from the book of Psalms:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p4" pid="7hniofeGw06KH4EbxvbSWA" hash="OKXGZA">“The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p5" pid="oNCQFgdfLkaBCa-ci3xTAA" hash="0PVpaw">“And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p6" pid="sVzvrOQ1y0eJZiByIp9fsQ" hash="p9B96A">The great increase in heartfelt prayer, and the public acceptance of it, has been remarkable to me and to others. More than once in recent days, someone has said to me with great intensity and with a sound of worry in the voice, “I hope that the change lasts.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p7" pid="tpoElXUtKUS4kEkpFxfTNw" hash="fdiiRQ">That worry is justified. Our own personal experience and God’s record of His dealing with His children teaches us that. Dependence on God can fade quickly when prayers are answered. And when the trouble lessens, so do the prayers. The Book of Mormon repeats that sad story over and over again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p8" pid="WHjSCE5NqkGvFkUv0Pg_JQ" hash="xHDLZQ">From the book of Helaman, “O, how could you have forgotten your God in the very day that he has delivered you?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> And later from the same book, after God had answered prayers with gracious kindness, the awful pattern is described again:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p9" pid="biCOWsaIi0y07Y20dkUPuA" hash="M0lnEQ">“And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p10" pid="KHCLSUPoIECZGLdVDw9EDw" hash="vnpQfA">“Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One—yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p11" pid="xXtlHMWg2UeGs2-LbiHYbA" hash="6SlmCw">“And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p12" pid="uIE3ooC0mUKiVnLmMpx7EA" hash="V9gDhQ">And now, from the next words of that same scripture, we learn why it is we forget so easily the source of our blessings and cease to feel our need to pray with faith:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p13" pid="WJebmSCnaUqxbp8Uw7ppAw" hash="FRf2iA">“O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p14" pid="_ARKXzHM2k6ARSbJLeqfAA" hash="98hLJw">“Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p15" pid="6E4YNaeiHUW6E7WPrRpdtQ" hash="Ub0GxQ">“Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p16" pid="sNwuKFBRtEme8gZdT6RInw" hash="XchsOw">From those three short verses of scripture, we see three causes for the sad drift away from humble prayer. First, while God implores us to pray, the enemy of our souls belittles and then derides it. The warning from 2 Nephi is true: “And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p17" pid="QbYR06-aN0SYm_GGBwb4bA" hash="NVhJzw">Second, God is forgotten out of vanity. A little prosperity and peace, or even a turn slightly for the better, can bring us feelings of self-sufficiency. We can feel quickly that we are in control of our lives, that the change for the better is our own doing, not that of a God who communicates to us through the still, small voice of the Spirit. Pride creates a noise within us which makes the quiet voice of the Spirit hard to hear. And soon, in our vanity, we no longer even listen for it. We can come quickly to think we don’t need it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p18" pid="uqdB2AAvmkuPP89FfzcE1A" hash="OYVE1g">The third cause is rooted deeply within us. We are spirit children of a loving Heavenly Father who placed us in mortality to see if we would choose—freely choose—to keep His commandments and come unto His Beloved Son. They do not compel us. They cannot, for that would interfere with the plan of happiness. And so there is in us a God-given desire to be responsible for our own choices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p19" pid="V0KsnICckkaf7WopRJrDlQ" hash="mOgO_Q">That desire to make our own choices is part of the upward pull toward eternal life. But it can, if we see life only through our mortal eyes, make dependence on God difficult or even impossible when we feel such a powerful desire to be independent. This true doctrine can sound hard:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p20" pid="iyoEUhsYYUWi3eEYyydYfQ" hash="Z28FOA">“For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p21" pid="XFvkyLR9K0-1F07Ir0nlKQ" hash="NT5WzA">Those who submit like a child do it because they know that the Father wants only the happiness of His children and that only He knows the way. That is the testimony we must have to keep praying like a submissive child, in the good times as well as the times of trouble.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p22" pid="Y9CsYXw3NEaYn8NdXAVhGA" hash="oCjihQ">With that faith, we will be able to pray for what we want and appreciate whatever we get. Only with that faith will we pray with the diligence God requires. When God has commanded us to pray, He has used words like “pray unceasingly” and “pray always” and “mighty prayer.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p23" pid="QnIsh4ArP0SzHIiiv8VRag" hash="DKl1WA">Those commands do not require using many words. In fact, the Savior has told us that we need not multiply words when we pray. The diligence in prayer which God requires does not take flowery speech nor long hours of solitude. That is taught clearly in Alma in the Book of Mormon:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p24" pid="nHf38x15IE2aoWIb5oRrJg" hash="GsVsHg">“Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p25" pid="SFFte3oK6kS_H9svukPQRA" hash="4iVniQ">Our hearts can only be drawn out to God when they are filled with love for Him and trust in His goodness. Joseph Smith, even as a boy, gave us an example of how we can come to pray from a heart filled with the love of God and then pray unceasingly through a life filled with trials and blessings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p26" pid="-ezF7QHcG0uXexswhOdi0w" hash="ZBpVDg">Joseph started for the grove to pray with faith that a loving God would answer his prayer and relieve his confusion. He gained that assurance reading the word of God and receiving a witness that it was true. He said that he read in James, “Let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> His faith to ask of God in prayer came after pondering a scripture which assured him of God’s loving nature. He prayed, as we must, with faith in a loving God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p27" pid="lDc40hAa70SIauxGm0F4xQ" hash="-oUCRg">He prayed with the intent not only to listen but to obey. He did not ask only to know the truth. He was committed to act upon whatever God would communicate to him. His written account makes clear that he prayed with real intent, determined to comply with whatever answer he received. He wrote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p28" pid="4tzI7Y8NAESZ6xoAeQwuVA" hash="V07Efg">“Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p29" pid="XaBykQefQ0yKEITYOee3XQ" hash="KSEojg">The Father and His Beloved Son appeared to him in answer to his prayer. And he was told how to act, as he had desired. He obeyed like a child. He was told to join none of the churches. He did as he was told. And because of his faithfulness, in the days and months and years ahead his prayers were answered with a flood of light and truth. The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the keys of the kingdom of God were restored to the earth. His humble dependence on God led to the Restoration of the gospel, with authority and sacred ordinances. Because of that Restoration, we have the chance to choose the most priceless independence to be free of the bondage of sin through the cleansing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p30" pid="G_IbaB-n3EqCl7bqb7BXvA" hash="r2CZMQ">Joseph Smith’s mission was unique, yet his humble prayer can be a helpful model for us. He began, as we must, with faith in a loving God who can and wants to communicate with us and help us. That faith was rooted in impressions which came to him as he pondered the words of God’s servants in the scriptures. We can and must go often and carefully to the word of God. If we become casual in our study of the scriptures, we will become casual in our prayers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p31" pid="7fG-yC9YbkiD4L8il277Nw" hash="YvA-jA">We may not cease to pray, but our prayers will become more repetitive, more mechanical, lacking real intent. Our hearts cannot be drawn out to a God we do not know, and the scriptures and the words of living prophets help us know Him. As we know Him better, we love Him more.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p32" pid="hePyPTKTCky-yJOlqJIbkQ" hash="1ljL5g">We must also serve Him to love Him. Joseph Smith did that, finally surrendering life itself in His service. Joseph prayed with the intent to obey. That obedience always includes service to others. Service in God’s work allows us to feel a part of what He feels and come to know Him.</p>

From what you hear you will feel promptings to go to the scriptures. Follow the promptings. You will be reminded in this conference of service you committed to give when you entered the waters of baptism. Choose to obey.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p35" pid="TbXokJ4lekWMiiuPZ-lPbg" hash="vOXltg">If you ponder the scriptures and begin to do what you covenanted with God to do, I can promise you that you will feel more love for God and more of His love for you. And with that, your prayers will come from the heart, full of thanks and of pleading. You will feel a greater dependence on God. You will find the courage and the determination to act in His service, without fear and with peace in your heart. You will pray always. And you will not forget Him, no matter what the future brings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/prayer.p36" pid="f-Z3XRbRP0meauMthTZWng" hash="iWttqQ">I bear you my testimony that God the Father lives. He loves us.

The keys of the priesthood are only in this Church. I know as surely as I live that President Gordon B. Hinckley holds and exercises the keys on the earth.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p1" pid="7ugpMoRyzUesU_tQSfFFEQ" hash="Acy_wQ">Each year, hundreds of thousands of the children of our Heavenly Father come into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. For most it requires a great change in their lives. All of them have made a sacred covenant with great promises and with a solemn pledge to endure. That covenant is so important that our Heavenly Father described the blessing and the challenge to the prophet Nephi:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p2" pid="oQYsOuIzGUyKzNe0kIrYdw" hash="BkVhLw">“And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p3" pid="IHteUuUhJUSTdmcV0IJSwg" hash="ekZNSg">“And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p4" pid="4eqo_tb8KkyHugk3QL0pKQ" hash="Kw44Nw">The Savior warns that if we start along the path and go far enough and then fail and deny Him, it would have been better if we had never begun.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p5" pid="ZlCVjJlnOUinggrWI5SQWQ" hash="Gw5ZLw">I think of that each time I visit with new members of the Church. I get that opportunity often, across the world. I see their trusting faces, and often they tell me about some trial of their faith, and then, with urgency in their voices, they whisper, “Please pray for me.” At those moments, I feel again the weight of the charge to each of us from the Lord’s living prophet. It is to keep the promise we made in the waters of baptism “to bear one another’s burdens.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> It is to be a friend.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p6" pid="DgPZ8b6jQE-PA1PUq7Sq7w" hash="tSfulQ">These words of President Hinckley energize me: “I hope, I pray, I plead with you, every one of you, to embrace every new member of the Church. Make a friend of him or her. Hold onto them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p7" pid="_cdULVcCJUSE0QMXaQ1T3w" hash="jXaj_Q">President Hinckley can’t be there as a friend for every new member. But you can be there for at least one. All it takes is to feel something of what they feel and something of what the Savior feels for them. Try to feel the heart of a young man, Nkosiyabo Eddie Lupahla, in Africa, writing about his friend.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p8" pid="1wSMLw24JkSEjXRXpYZSvw" hash="NpDvow">“Two and a half years prior to my joining the Church in 1999, my good friend, Mbuti Yona, looked me up. We had been friends through grades 5 to 12, then [were] separated when we attended different [schools].</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p9" pid="TI-emDbPDUCrky7b6NoCnQ" hash="EhQE3g">“Mbuti was baptized in April 1999, and four weeks later he visited me at home and introduced the gospel to me. Regardless of the rumors about the Church, I was impressed by the ‘fellow Saints’ who gave me a warm welcome on my first visit. It was this same Sunday that my friend introduced me to the missionaries. Arrangements were made to be taught. My friend was there for every discussion, and he kept inviting me to the activities. I really enjoyed being around people with the same values, interests, standards, and goals. It was during this same time period that I began attending institute [of religion]. It all seemed very natural: Thursday nights [5:30]—missionary discussion, followed by institute.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p10" pid="bLPYqfvZVUmdjDhms6MIBw" hash="Duz1uQ">“I learned a lot in institute and especially enjoyed our class about how to achieve a celestial marriage. The first semester ended in May, shortly after I began attending, and I felt cheated. But I was fortunate enough to catch the second semester class, Teachings of the Living Prophets. While in institute, I bought myself the four standard works and I continued to learn and grow in the Church line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. I was baptized September 17, 1999, by another friend I had made while attending institute.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p11" pid="QJJhjkbz_EKDF_ukjbPRbw" hash="pOtkNg">“I am thankful for the institute program. It has not only shaped me, but it has also helped me qualify to become a missionary, which mission I started preparing for five months after my baptism. I have been blessed with many opportunities to serve and to teach prior to my mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p12" pid="qpW2oPz16Uq4RMfoX2R9mA" hash="bYwhqw">“I am thankful for my friend. I hope he realizes what he has done for me. We have both served missions, I to South Africa Durban, he to South Africa Cape Town. All it takes is a friend to bring such a mighty change in one’s life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p13" pid="ZPuNcTL8u0iQaF0sG5MPhQ" hash="__Zeww">Now, there seems to be nothing miraculous in that story. But there is a miracle of wisdom beyond human capacity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p14" pid="Kc_kiVPs6UOvPMIyzARyQQ" hash="2HygxQ">Perhaps because Mbuti had walked the path himself or perhaps by revelation, he knew what his friend would have to do to endure. And so he knew how to lift and help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p15" pid="2aaET0ZYqEOsVHXYihiVaQ" hash="KPGpxQ">He introduced his friend to the missionaries. He saw that his friend was baptized and received the gift of the Holy Ghost. He took his friend, even before baptism, to where he would study the scriptures and thus be nurtured by the good word of God. Even before baptism he helped his friend discover this promise: “Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> The words must have told him to buy scriptures, which he did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p16" pid="6hoGxvmUbUq7ovZ3VMSAQg" hash="4B0uGQ">At baptism, Brother Lupahla received the gift of the Holy Ghost to serve as his constant companion as long as he invited it and lived worthy of it. That assured him of another promise, “For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> The Holy Ghost must have told him to begin to prepare for a mission, which he did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p17" pid="gsjOClCeJEqdTSpteyi4sQ" hash="9M1xnQ">We do not know which friends went with him to his sacrament meetings both before and after baptism, but some must have greeted him warmly, as they did on his first visit. There, he renewed his covenant to always remember the Savior, to keep His commandments, and to receive again the promise of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. We don’t know what part his friends had in his calls to serve and to speak. But we can be sure that they thanked him and told him when they felt the Spirit in his service and in his teaching.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p18" pid="U3OabWH9ikOe-dLRb6H3yg" hash="vPEMQQ">We can know something of his private life. Remember that he wrote that he continued to learn. He wrote that he grew in the Church line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. He said that he had been shaped by his experiences in the Church Educational System institute. We know from the scriptures what caused those changes in him. He had to be praying with faith in the Savior. He was receiving testimony and directions through the Spirit. And then he was not only doing what he was inspired to do but he was asking God to let the Atonement work in his life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p19" pid="Xrebh_JnqUu6A5AfYoOdew" hash="iSdZug">Nephi, describing that miracle of change and what brings it, said this:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p20" pid="pFYoEqRt0Uu4jmfWVeRPLA" hash="WZQGbw">“And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p21" pid="uZNjLNf6w0Ge2FYgUeIXFA" hash="qS5uOw">“But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p22" pid="8X7u2hKp8kuM_S6o8Rr0hA" hash="4qDLoA">The Holy Ghost is a comforter and a guide. But it is also a cleansing agent. That is why service in the kingdom is so crucial to enduring. When we are called to serve, we can pray for the Holy Ghost to be our companion with assurance it will come. When we ask in faith, a change can come in our natures both for the welfare of our souls and to strengthen us for the tests we all must face.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p23" pid="xPGfhOwTSUq5JpaGo-dKpQ" hash="nGlsng">There are limits on what friends can do to help the ones who must endure. It is the new members who must pray. It is they who must rely on the strength they will receive in answers to their prayers. They must choose for themselves in faith to be baptized, trusting in their perfect friend, the Savior. They must choose in faith in Him to repent, to be humble and contrite.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p24" pid="Ku4Eh0sTz0mC_68O6wBp9g" hash="rp0gDw">They must choose to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. The words of confirmation into the Church are an invitation: “Receive the Holy Ghost.” And that choice must be made not once, but every day, every hour, every minute. Even when the Holy Ghost comes and inspires them what they should do, doing it or not is a choice. Even when they read the scriptures regularly, it takes a choice to “feast upon the words of Christ.” And even the feast is not nourishing without a choice to do what the words of Christ tell them to do. With faith and obedience practiced long enough, the Holy Ghost becomes a constant companion, our natures change, and endurance becomes certain.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p25" pid="S2FDBm5RIEiH7i7XRHaW_Q" hash="jHGmWg">The member must make the choices, but the true friend is vital. There are important ways for us to share the new member’s burden that it may be bearable. We can love, listen, show, and testify.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p26" pid="wGr__BdY1kqIbliHqavPrQ" hash="2EfY5A">First, we must love them. That is what the Savior does. We can do it with Him and for Him. He showed us the way in His mortal ministry. He taught by precept and example that we are to love His disciples.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p27" pid="9wexuwacz0GfPsyKKQpqlg" hash="VtEXXg">“This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p28" pid="01jV9NpvuEGjt6j77sZPzA" hash="1KyRaw">“Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p29" pid="Is9G0ORMNUuR8nPj5GsJfg" hash="dGaL1Q">“Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p30" pid="l3P9p1GsPEW8_3SoFThKoA" hash="lAT65w">“Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p31" pid="Na86GgrsGEassbO7M4mttw" hash="H8YnHw">The Savior watches over the struggling member as a friend. He laid down His life for all of us. He loves us and will grant us, if we are faithful, the gift of feeling a part of His love for them. I have at times been blessed by the Holy Ghost to sense the Savior’s love for a struggling new member. I know for myself that is possible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p32" pid="7-rRTx71mEyfLeMNiNxgRw" hash="l4iEAQ">Second, we must listen to the new member with understanding and empathy. That also will take spiritual gifts, since our experience will rarely parallel theirs. It will not be enough to say, “I understand how you feel,” unless we do. But the Savior does. He is prepared to help you be a friend who understands even those you have just met, if you ask in faith. Before He was born, prophets knew what He would do to be able to help you be a friend for Him:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p33" pid="O7IXMCJLbEGvaAkkWxELrw" hash="6oJs_A">“And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p34" pid="tOWfAbUc9kuxlAqOjP4-NQ" hash="H4PQMg">“And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p35" pid="wFlkwzGF0UOP7WSUAT6R4A" hash="n8Pnjg">Third, we must be an example for the new member. We can feast upon the word of God. We can ask for and live for the companionship of the Holy Ghost. We can be obedient out of our faith in Jesus Christ. And in time we can become an example of a disciple who is born again through the Atonement. It may be gradual. It may be hard for us to discern in ourselves. But it will be real. And it will give hope to the new member and to all those we befriend on the path to eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p36" pid="Xdbth0O9BEqDYespeW8YUw" hash="y0Xcmw">Fourth, we must testify of the truth to the new member. It must be sincere, and it is best when it is simple. It is most helpful when it is about the reality and mission of the Savior, about our Heavenly Father’s love, and of the gifts and companionship of the Holy Ghost. And it is essential to testify that the Father and the Son appeared to the young Joseph Smith and that the full gospel and the true Church have been restored by heavenly messengers. The Holy Ghost will confirm those simple declarations as truth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p37" pid="h0xSkH_KEkytixEdH4e2jg" hash="axL87A">The new member will need that confirmation, again and again, even when we are not there to testify. Should they choose to reject the companionship of the Holy Ghost, he or she will not endure. But that is true for all of us, wherever we are and however faithful we have been. All of us will be tested. And all of us need true friends to love us, to listen to us, to show us the way, and to testify of truth to us so that we may retain the companionship of the Holy Ghost. You must be such a true friend.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p38" pid="ojP_EuoYM0ajUPDZ40R08w" hash="7uxmlw">I can still remember, as if it were today, friends who touched my life for good long ago. They are gone, but the memory of their love, example, faith, and testimony still lifts me. And your friendship to even one new member may, in this life and in the next, cause hundreds or even thousands of their ancestors and their descendants to call you blessed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/true-friends.p39" pid="VzVamZMgMEWZWEKhZAsv8g" hash="ZoiB5g">This is the true Church of Jesus Christ. He lives. He loves you, and He loves those whom you must serve and who will become your true friends forever.</p>

Then you might be about to tell them how their work will be evaluated, when you will notice concern in their eyes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p4" pid="eTZP3q1Vvkq--_WgQI8KEw" hash="viF52g">You see, even the newest member of the Church can sense that a call to service should be primarily a matter of the heart. It is by giving our whole hearts to the Master and keeping His commandments that we come to know Him. In time, through the power of the Atonement, our hearts are changed, and we can become like Him. So there is a better way to help those who are called than descriptions of what they are to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p5" pid="x23Q4HQH9ESlDAxHp6V1Cw" hash="TyD8mA">What they will need, even more than to be trained in their duties, is to see with spiritual eyes what it means to be called to serve in the restored Church of Jesus Christ. This is the kingdom of God on the earth. Because of that, it has a power beyond any other endeavor in which humans can engage. That power depends on the faith of those called to serve in it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p6" pid="QorlkAt2CkKfVgyEbPMhbg" hash="ggPPdQ">And so, to everyone, man or woman, girl or boy, who has been called or who will yet be, I give you my counsel. There are a few things you must come to know are true. I will try to put them in words. Only the Lord through the Holy Ghost can put them deep in your heart. Here they are:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p7" pid="DGiYsBb1eU6kBLSyRECenQ" hash="qgHOAw">First, you are called of God. The Lord knows you. He knows whom He would have serve in every position in His Church. He chose you. He has prepared a way so that He could issue your call. He restored the keys of the priesthood to Joseph Smith. Those keys have been passed down in an unbroken line to President Hinckley. Through those keys, other priesthood servants were given keys to preside in stakes and wards, in districts and branches. It was through those keys that the Lord called you. Those keys confer a right to revelation. And revelation comes in answer to prayer. The person who was inspired to recommend you for this call didn’t do it because they liked you or because they needed someone to do a particular task. They prayed and felt an answer that you were the one to be called.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p8" pid="RnNvWA4tYk-C045o1WGosA" hash="WrCLGA">The person who called you did not issue the call simply because he learned by interviewing you that you were worthy and willing to serve. He prayed to know the Lord’s will for you. It was prayer and revelation to those authorized of the Lord which brought you here. Your call is an example of a source of power unique to the Lord’s Church. Men and women are called of God by prophecy and by the laying on of hands by those God has authorized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p9" pid="qWPXNQERa0qR4JBLx5v-rw" hash="6j3mrg">You are called to represent the Savior. Your voice to testify becomes the same as His voice, your hands to lift the same as His hands. His work is to bless His Father’s spirit children with the opportunity to choose eternal life. So, your calling is to bless lives. That will be true even in the most ordinary tasks you are assigned and in moments when you might be doing something not apparently connected to your call. Just the way you smile or the way you offer to help someone can build their faith. And should you forget who you are, just the way you speak and the way you behave can destroy faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p10" pid="GlB90_9CCk-3nJZQHc6jcw" hash="qzMO2A">Your call has eternal consequences for others and for you. In the world to come, thousands may call your name blessed, even more than the people you serve here. They will be the ancestors and the descendants of those who chose eternal life because of something you said or did, or even what you were. If someone rejects the Savior’s invitation because you did not do all you could have done, their sorrow will be yours. You see, there are no small callings to represent the Lord. Your call carries grave responsibility. But you need not fear, because with your call come great promises.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p11" pid="w8INCFqvmEuYa8zXSMc3Xg" hash="fOtYMg">One of those promises is the second thing you need to know. It is that the Lord will guide you by revelation just as He called you. You must ask in faith for revelation to know what you are to do. With your call comes the promise that answers will come. But that guidance will come only when the Lord is sure you will obey. To know His will you must be committed to do it. The words “Thy will be done,” written in the heart, are the window to revelation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p12" pid="2IWG5zYpUU6fNmZQSwIMLQ" hash="IEB1sQ">The answer comes by the Holy Spirit. You will need that guidance often. To have the Holy Ghost as your companion you must be worthy, cleansed by the Atonement of Jesus Christ. So, your obedience to the commandments, your desire to do His will, and your asking in faith will determine how clearly the Master can guide you by answers to your prayers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p13" pid="fqw9LMTni06F4ZtFoGjhpQ" hash="hC0i7A">Often the answers will come as you study the scriptures. They contain accounts of what the Lord did in His mortal ministry and the guidance He has given His servants. They have doctrine in them which will apply in every time and every situation. Pondering the scriptures will lead you to ask the right questions in prayer. And just as surely as the heavens were opened to Joseph Smith after he pondered the scriptures in faith, God will answer your prayers and He will lead you by the hand.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p14" pid="Rb6TCtRIgUaUOVd8QLzxCQ" hash="NvGrfQ">There is a third thing you need to know: Just as God called you and will guide you, He will magnify you. You will need that magnification. Your calling will surely bring opposition. You are in the Master’s service. You are His representative. Eternal lives depend on you. He faced opposition, and He said that facing opposition would be the lot of those He called. The forces arrayed against you will try not only to frustrate your work but to bring you down. The Apostle Paul described it this way: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p15" pid="oEjYW0Dv7U-_h9aGD-uK_Q" hash="ANsRDw">There will be times when you will feel overwhelmed. One of the ways you will be attacked is with the feeling that you are inadequate. Well, you are inadequate to answer a call to represent God with only your own powers. But you have access to more than your natural capacities, and you do not work alone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p16" pid="kVPI2b7DIEuRikYKenzH6w" hash="-rU3sg">The Lord will magnify what you say and what you do in the eyes of the people you serve. He will send the Holy Ghost to manifest to them that what you spoke was true. What you say and do will carry hope and give direction to people far beyond your natural abilities and your own understanding. That miracle has been a mark of the Lord’s Church in every dispensation. It is so much a part of your call that you may begin to take it for granted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p17" pid="43tCj98or0mh0a6SIGPK4g" hash="x_O7wQ">The day of your release will teach you a great lesson. On the day I was released as a bishop, one of the ward members came to my home afterwards and said: “I know you are no longer my bishop, but could we talk just one more time? You have always spoken words I needed and given me such good counsel. The new bishop doesn’t know me the way you do. Could we just talk one more time?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p18" pid="cHa4AH2hd0C3d5CGPxwbTQ" hash="BAexUA">Reluctantly I agreed. The member sat down in a chair opposite mine. It seemed to be just as it had been in the hundreds of times I had interviewed members of the ward as a judge in Israel. The conversation began. There came the moment when counsel was needed. I waited for the ideas, the words, and the feelings to flow into my mind, as they always had.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p19" pid="1CG8R9RMBUmrCC7GW-UjqA" hash="XvDJlQ">Nothing came. In my heart and mind there was only silence. After a few moments, I said: “I’m sorry. I appreciate your kindness and your trust. But I’m afraid I can’t help you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p20" pid="O5AVTBL0fUWgkfVrBXGaqw" hash="CoApWg">When you are released from your calling, you will learn what I learned then. God magnifies those He calls, even in what may seem to you a small or inconspicuous service. You will have the gift of seeing your service magnified. Give thanks while that gift is yours. You will appreciate its worth more than you can imagine when it is gone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p21" pid="hfEiuzSpyU-4-EuYm1BN5A" hash="N8yJPg">The Lord will not only magnify the power of your efforts. He will work with you Himself. His voice to four missionaries, called through the Prophet Joseph Smith to a difficult task, gives courage to everyone He calls in His kingdom: “And I myself will go with them and be in their midst; and I am their advocate with the Father, and nothing shall prevail against them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p22" pid="5CUj8viPBU21Gz7CBqi2_A" hash="IDGkxQ">Because the Savior is a resurrected and glorified being, He is not physically with every one of His servants at every moment. But He is perfectly aware of them and their circumstance and able to intervene with His power. That is why He can promise you: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p23" pid="ZqVd3b_wkUaCLmomp4nckw" hash="1KHBzw">There is yet another way the Lord will magnify you in your call to His service. You will feel at some time, perhaps at many times, that you cannot do all you feel you must. The heavy weight of your responsibilities will seem too great. You will worry that you can’t spend more time with your family. You will wonder how you can find the time and the energy to meet your responsibilities beyond your family and your calling. You may feel discouragement and even guilt after you have done all you could to meet all your obligations. I have had such days and such nights. Let me tell you what I have learned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p24" pid="M0VWBPUxXkuONNI-BpjakA" hash="pb_RWw">It is this: If I only think of my own performance, my sadness deepens. But when I remember that the Lord promised that His power would go with me, I begin to look for evidence of what He has done in the lives of the people I am to serve. I pray to see with spiritual eyes the effects of His power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p25" pid="q9n8y282MkWNIZWjkbEvCw" hash="-70RRw">Then, invariably, the faces of people flood back into my memory. I remember the shine in the eyes of my child whose heart was softened, the tears of happiness on the face of a girl on the back row of a Sunday School class I was teaching, or a problem that was resolved before I had time to get to it. I know then that I have done enough for the promise made by Joseph Smith to be fulfilled once again: “Let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p26" pid="Pvo7k8Ili0G6aGX1JdGvsA" hash="wGs6Fg">You can have the utmost assurance that your power will be multiplied many times by the Lord. All He asks is that you give your best effort and your whole heart. Do it cheerfully and with the prayer of faith. The Father and His Beloved Son will send the Holy Ghost as your companion to guide you. Your efforts will be magnified in the lives of the people you serve. And when you look back on what may now seem trying times of service and sacrifice, the sacrifice will have become a blessing, and you will know that you have seen the arm of God lifting those you served for Him, and lifting you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p27" pid="bE9dVvY0HkueRLyXvuuKLA" hash="P6mJlw">I know that God the Father lives. He hears and answers our prayers. Those we serve are His spirit children. This is the true Church of Jesus Christ. His is the only name through which our Father’s children may be sanctified and gain eternal life. The keys of the priesthood are exercised by the Lord’s living prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/rise-to-your-call.p28" pid="cndsKsG8BkKESqTjs0sJsg" hash="UkohoA">I testify that the Savior lives and leads His living Church. I know that. I am a witness for Him and of Him. He sees and appreciates your faithful service in the work to which He called you.</p>

Yet some members clear that barrier with ease. I have observed them carefully in my travels. I can picture some of them now.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p2" pid="P_9zGFR6dE-5WBG9KiKPXQ" hash="hP_Oxw">Saturday is a market day across the world. In the countryside of Ghana, in Ecuador, and in the Philippine Islands, countless people bring the produce of their farms and their handicrafts to a town to sell. They talk with those they meet on the road. And they visit with those near them as they wait for someone to buy. Much of the talk is about the struggles of existence, of breaking out of poverty, and sometimes about danger.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p3" pid="qK5Bk3WgnkG5SywsUwRFhw" hash="14-bBA">Among those on the roads and in the markets are Latter-day Saints. Much of their talk with those they meet would be the same as you would hear anywhere in the world. “Where are you from?” “Is that your son with you?” “How many children do you have?” But there will be a difference in the Latter-day Saints. It would be noticeable in their eyes as much as in their words. They listen carefully with the look of someone who cares about the answers to questions and who cares about the person.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p4" pid="29mDiWBYV0C9RqsVl7nVfA" hash="ob06JQ">If the conversation lasts more than a few minutes, it would turn to things that matter deeply to both of them. They would talk of what they believe brings happiness and what brings sadness. And the talk would turn to hopes for this life and the next. The Latter-day Saint would express quiet assurance. Not every time, but sometimes, the Latter-day Saint would be asked, “Why are you so much at peace?” “How do you know these things you say you know?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p5" pid="YlQTU7c3okeVYoFyDolx4w" hash="iiTqRQ">And then there would come a quiet answer. Perhaps it would be about Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appearing to the young boy Joseph Smith. It might be about the resurrected Savior’s loving ministry, as described in the Book of Mormon, to common people who had faith in Him and who loved Him as we do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p6" pid="4PRtNkXxCk6KRuhDXDG-Iw" hash="7fRVpQ">If you could hear such a conversation, which reaches spiritual things in a marketplace or on a street, you might ask: “How could I do that? How could I become better at sharing my faith with those who do not yet feel what I feel?” It is a question for each of us who are members. That same question is on the mind of every bishop and branch president in the Church who now has the charge to lead missionary work among his people. The answer to that question is at the heart of the harvest which will come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p7" pid="I8AyuNKha0mDkf2A_w4P7A" hash="JMxcfQ">I’ve studied carefully and prayerfully some who are remarkably faithful and effective witnesses of the Savior and His Church. Their stories are inspiring. One humble man was called as the president of a tiny branch. There were so few members he could not see how the branch could function. He walked into a grove of trees to pray. He asked God what he should do. An answer came. He and the few members began inviting friends to join with them. In a year, hundreds had come into the waters of baptism and become fellow citizens in the Lord’s Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p8" pid="eWIlt4Pd2EahE7fJ3ionOA" hash="jKq3lg">I know a man who travels almost every week in his work. On any day there are missionaries somewhere in the world teaching someone he met. There is another man who seems undeterred by how many he must speak to before any of them wish to be taught by the missionaries. He doesn’t count the cost in his effort but only the happiness of those whose lives are changed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p9" pid="4WiaBaEfEEqNYnsTcNb8xA" hash="0aOPiQ">There is no single pattern in what they do. There is no common technique. Some always carry a Book of Mormon to give away. Others set a date to find someone for the missionaries to teach. Another has found questions which draw out feelings about what matters most in life to a person. Each has prayed to know what to do. They each seem to get a different answer, suited especially to them and to the people they meet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p10" pid="Ymd32LZn_USmWGfFGA8orw" hash="J9aK9Q">But in one way they are all alike. It is this: they have a common way of seeing who they are. They can do what they have been inspired to do because of who they are. To do what we are to do, we will have to become like them in at least two ways. First, they feel that they are the beloved children of a loving Heavenly Father. Because of that they turn to Him easily and often in prayer. They expect to receive His personal direction. They obey in meekness and humility, as the children of a perfect parent. He is close to them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p11" pid="1XUmzuhKzE6XDbXjxe7qwA" hash="BuJEYg">Second, they are the grateful disciples of the resurrected Jesus Christ. They know for themselves that the Atonement is real and necessary for all. They have felt cleansed through baptism by those in authority and the receipt of the Holy Ghost for themselves. And because of the peace they have experienced, they are like the sons of Mosiah, “desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

They think of that great blessing often. It is the memory of the gift they have received which makes them eager for others to receive it. They have felt the love of the Savior. For them these words are their daily, hourly reality:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/a-child-and-a-disciple.p13" pid="liC5gemPbkucCEZDKkSHFw" hash="0oJRzA">“There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</p>

The Apostle John was clear about that: fear will be gone when we are made <span class="emphasis">perfect</span> in love. We can pray for that gift of perfect love. We can pray with confidence that we can feel the Savior’s love for us and for all we meet. He loved us and them enough to pay the price of all our sins. It is one thing to believe that. It is something far more to have our hearts changed to feel it every moment. The command to pray to feel the Savior’s love is also a promise. Listen:</p>

He carries with him a copy of the Book of Mormon. The night before a short trip recently, he decided not to take a copy with him but instead to carry what is called a pass-along card. But in the morning, a spiritual impression came: “Take a Book of Mormon with you.” He put one in his bag.</p>

Now he thought, “How should I bring the gospel up?”</p>

She said that she was supposed to pay tithing to her church but she didn’t. And then she said, “What is this about the Book of Mormon?” He explained that it was scripture, another witness of Jesus Christ, translated by the Prophet Joseph Smith. She seemed interested. So he reached down into his bag and said: “I was impressed to bring this book with me. I think it is for you.”</p>

As they parted, she said, “You and I are going to have to have more conversations about this.” What my friend could not know, but God did, was that she was looking for a church. God knew she had watched my friend and wondered what about his church made him so happy. God knew she would ask about the Book of Mormon, and He knew she would be willing to be taught by the missionaries. She was prepared. So was my friend. And so can you and I be.</p>

You will be excited about the Lord’s Church and His work, and it will show. You will be His disciple 24 hours a day in every situation. You won’t need to build up your courage for one great moment to speak to someone and then retreat. The fact that most people are not interested in the restored gospel will have little bearing on what you do and say. Speaking what you believe will be part of what you are.</p>

He lectured to audiences in countries around the world. Once I read a talk he had given to a large scientific convention. In it, he referred to creation and a Creator as he talked about his science. I knew that few, if any, in that audience would have shared his faith. So I said to him with wonder and admiration, “Dad, you bore your testimony.” He looked at me with surprise on his face and said, “Did I?”</p>

They see themselves as children of a loving, living Father in Heaven. And they see themselves as disciples of Jesus Christ. It takes no discipline for them to pray. They do it naturally. It is no special effort to remember the Savior. His love for them and theirs for Him is always with them. That is who they are and how they see themselves and see those around them.</p>

I promised them then that a great day would dawn in that nation. I said that there would be a great increase in the members speaking eagerly to those they met of their testimony of the restored gospel.

You will meet people prepared by the Lord. You will find yourself feeling and saying things beyond your past experience.

He testified of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon. He bore witness of the administration of angels and that the kingdom of God was again established upon the earth.</p>

The Holy Ghost was ready to tell them that the remarkable message was true. With a testimony of the Spirit they would have known that they should ask for baptism. And then they could have received the priceless gift of the Holy Ghost. With that gift, they could know the truth of all things. I wonder if any of them sensed that night how close they were to starting down the only path which would lead them to the Savior in the world to come, to see His face with pleasure and hear the words, “Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my Father.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Think of them now. They may be our children or our grandchildren. Perhaps you think of your husband or your wife. It may be someone you are teaching as a missionary. It may be a friend. You want with all your heart to have them someday hear those words from the Master. And for that blessing to come, they will need that testimony offered by the Prophet in Carthage burning in their hearts through all the tests of life, as it did in his.</p>

The Lord gave others to stand with Joseph to verify what the Lord had done. They were with the Prophet when the heavens were opened.</p>

He went into the mission field to proclaim what he knew by what he saw and heard and felt. With two others he signed a testimony which they never denied. Their witness is printed in the front of the Book of Mormon:</p>

And we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true. And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true. And it is marvelous in our eyes. Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen. Oliver Cowdery David Whitmer Martin Harris”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Those three witnesses had something more, something we all need. The Holy Ghost bore witness to their minds and hearts that what they saw and heard was true. The Spirit told them that the angel was from God and that the voice was that of the Lord Jesus Christ. That witness of the Spirit was given to them and many who were not there. It is a witness that can, if we qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost, be ours and stay with us forever.</p>

They could not because they knew it was true. They made sacrifices and faced difficulties beyond what most people ever know. Oliver Cowdery gave the same testimony about the divine origin of the Book of Mormon as he lay dying. But in the times of trial, they wavered in their faith that Joseph was still God’s prophet and that the only way to come unto the Savior was through His restored Church. That they continued to affirm what they saw and heard in that marvelous experience, during long periods of estrangement from the Church and from Joseph, makes their testimony more powerful.</p>

Brigham Young, John Taylor, Heber C. Kimball, and many others stayed steady in their testimony. They endured in faith because they paid the price to keep the companionship of the Holy Ghost and the burning testimony He alone brings.</p>

And they had more than a memory of the feeling of peace and the joy that witness brought. Because they qualified for the companionship of the Holy Ghost, they could say in every circumstance, however difficult: “I knew it then. I felt it was true then. I feel so now.”</p>

We can teach those we love to do those same things. Done faithfully, they allow the Holy Ghost to be a constant companion. And we can promise those we love that they will feel joy and peace as the Spirit confirms truth, if they ask for that blessing in faith.</p>

I don’t remember much of what my parents said about the Holy Ghost, but I remember what I felt when I saw them do the things which brought the Holy Ghost into our home. Here are some things you can teach those you love with your example and testimony, with confidence that the Lord will send the Spirit to confirm truth to their minds and to their hearts.</p>

He believed in the promise he read in the book of James.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> He went to the grove with faith that his prayer would be answered. He wanted to know which church to join. He was submissive enough to be ready to do whatever he was told to do. So he prayed, as we must, already committed to obey.</p>

He endured during the 24 years that followed by continuing to pray with that childlike faith and humility. We can teach those we love to pray with the intent to obey. We can promise them they will gain the companionship of the Holy Ghost. The Spirit will testify the truth to their hearts every time they read in the scriptures which came to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith. And the Spirit will confirm again that God spoke through His prophet.</p>

The youngest and the newest member can seek to build up the kingdom of God. Zion is made up of individuals and families. When their faith increases, the kingdom is established more firmly. We can try to help with that every day. Even the smallest act to build faith in another person or in a family qualifies us for the gift and power of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost testifies of truth. Therefore, in our service, our faith increases that Jesus is the Christ, that our Heavenly Father lives and loves us, and that Joseph was Their prophet. You can expect that, every time you go to a home to build faith, as a home teacher or a visiting teacher or a friend.</p>

But that is because they have focused on the mechanics and not the glorious opportunity of publishing “peace, yea, tidings of great joy” to God’s children in His kingdom. When that is how we see our service, we will not only be lifted up at the last day but refreshed and encouraged along the way. And the Spirit will testify that this is the Lord’s kingdom restored in the latter days.</p>

That brings the Spirit. The Prophet Joseph taught that, and he lived it. Of the many examples recorded of his loving nature, the one which most touches me occurred in Carthage Jail the night before his death. One of the men who went there with him was Dan Jones. The Prophet sensed the danger from the mob. He had reason to turn inward, to think of himself and his own peril. Instead his heart turned outward to comfort someone else.</p>

Engaged in such a cause I do not think that death would have many terrors.’ Joseph replied, ‘You will yet see Wales, and fulfill the mission appointed you before you die.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

Thousands of Welsh converts came to Zion. Some were gifted singers. They were among the first members of what became the Tabernacle Choir. When we hear the choir sing, I hope we remember Dan Jones, the faithful friend of the Prophet Joseph. Teach those you love to remember Joseph’s comfort given when he needed comfort. When we comfort others, out of our faith in the Lord, He sends the Comforter to us. And the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, gave Joseph the power to give prophetic and loving encouragement.</p>

I do not worship him, but I thank and love him as the Lord’s prophet of the Restoration. He has helped me pray with the intent to obey. I am better able to feast in the word and the love of God. Because of him I feel the Holy Ghost more often in the moments when I try to build the faith of a person in the Lord’s kingdom. And because of what I know of the Prophet Joseph and the scriptures which were revealed through him, I more often feel the love of God for His children and of His for me when I reach down to lift someone up.</p>

He tried to teach me. One of the things I remember wondering about was this advice he gave: “When you meet someone, treat them as if they were in serious trouble, and you will be right more than half the time.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p2" pid="sfJ6U9TudEq9h-vkqgSLrA" hash="l3oIfw">I thought then that he was pessimistic. Now, more than 40 years later, I can see how well he understood the world and life. As time passes, the world grows more challenging, and our physical capacities slowly diminish with age. It is clear that we will need more than human strength. The Psalmist was right: “But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord: he is their strength in the time of trouble.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p3" pid="eyk_wISeLkyzRzCP7PCibg" hash="Ofh68Q">The restored gospel of Jesus Christ gives us help in knowing how to qualify for the strength of the Lord as we deal with adversity. It tells us why we face tests in life. And, even more importantly, it tells us how to get protection and help from the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p4" pid="2eq5VVZZ40qeopVyuqyuwg" hash="gJAiFg">We have trials to face because our Heavenly Father loves us. His purpose is to help us qualify for the blessing of living with Him and His Son, Jesus Christ, forever in glory and in families. To qualify for that gift we had to receive a mortal body. With that mortality we understood that we would be tested by temptations and by difficulties.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p5" pid="pkYz39sEikWr7bz-B0eKJw" hash="OGIWaQ">The restored gospel not only teaches us why we must be tested, but it makes clear to us what the test is. The Prophet Joseph Smith gave us an explanation. By revelation, he was able to record words spoken at the Creation of the world. They are about us, those of the spirit children of our Heavenly Father who would come into mortality. Here are the words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p6" pid="YLjEnvZJ80mmMY_P38wxWQ" hash="GaYEMQ">“And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p7" pid="AtXI8-mmPUyzRNhN5GUINA" hash="lFv9vQ">That explanation helps us understand why we face trials in life. They give us the opportunity to prove ourselves faithful to God. So many things beat upon us in a lifetime that simply enduring may seem almost beyond us. That’s what the words in the scripture “Ye must … endure to the end”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> seemed to mean to me when I first read them. It sounded grim, like sitting still and holding on to the arms of the chair while someone pulled out my tooth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p8" pid="pbo_yUHA4UqjRQSM-Ynelw" hash="cO-25Q">It can surely seem that way to a family depending on crops when there is no rain. They may wonder, “How long can we hold on?” It can seem that way to a youth faced with resisting the rising flood of filth and temptation. It can seem that way to a young man struggling to get the training he needs for a job to support a wife and family. It can seem that way to a person who can’t find a job or who has lost job after job as businesses close their doors. It can seem that way to a person faced with the erosion of health and physical strength which may come early or late in life for them or for those they love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p9" pid="XXQIm8NqCkmsaIOVUadiUA" hash="7ZUnHw">But the test a loving God has set before us is not to see if we can endure difficulty. It is to see if we can endure it well. We pass the test by showing that we remembered Him and the commandments He gave us. And to endure well is to keep those commandments whatever the opposition, whatever the temptation, and whatever the tumult around us. We have that clear understanding because the restored gospel makes the plan of happiness so plain.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p10" pid="XYlYnxu82E6d9DvCA8aJEg" hash="sPNyMw">That clarity lets us see what help we need. We need strength beyond ourselves to keep the commandments in whatever circumstance life brings to us. For some it may be poverty, but for others it may be prosperity. It may be the ravages of age or the exuberance of youth. The combination of trials and their duration are as varied as are the children of our Heavenly Father. No two are alike. But what is being tested is the same, at all times in our lives and for every person: will we do whatsoever the Lord our God will command us?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p11" pid="tKEiuQ-xak6_KXVRJORVRw" hash="FPmMEw">Knowing why we are tested and what the test is tells us how to get help. We have to go to God. He gives us the commandments. And we will need more than our own strength to keep them.</p>

And it gives us confidence that the help we need will come if we do those things early and persistently, long before the moment of crisis.</p>

There is a promise of help from God that comes with that daily practice. Faithful study of scriptures brings the Holy Ghost to us. The promise is given in the Book of Mormon, but it applies as well to all the words of God that He has given and will give us through His prophets.</p>

More than once He has said that He would gather us to Him as a hen would gather her chickens under her wings. He says that we must choose to come to Him in meekness and with enough faith in Him to repent “with full purpose of heart.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Go to your meetings, even when it seems hard. If you are determined, He will help you find the strength to do it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p25" pid="Re_-vmH-vEKzYnGBLOTdlg" hash="eWmvEQ">A member wrote to me from England. When her bishop asked if she would accept a call to teach early-morning seminary, he told her she’d better pray about it before she accepted. She did. She accepted. When she met the parents for the first time the bishop stood beside her. She announced that she felt the program should go to five days a week. Some parents looked doubtful. One person said, “They won’t come. They’ll vote with their feet.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p26" pid="a0gVPSXSp0uPvdk0MkX1Xg" hash="s-RkCA">Well, the doubt was half right. The students did vote with their feet. But their attendance in those cold and dark morning hours is now above 90 percent. That teacher and her bishop believed that if the students would start to come they would be strengthened by power more than their own. It came. That power will protect them when they go to places where they will be the only Latter-day Saints. They will not be alone nor without strength, because they accepted the invitation to gather with the Saints when it was not easy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p27" pid="GIcEn7K0GkiYTLCbDyBHpA" hash="6hzCBA">That strength is given to those who are older as well as the young. I know a widow more than 90 years of age. She is in a wheelchair. She prays as you do, pleading for help to solve problems beyond her human power to resolve. The answer is a feeling in her heart. It draws her to keep a commandment: “And behold, ye shall meet together oft.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> So she finds a way to get to her meetings. People who attend there have told me, “We are so glad to see her. She brings such a spirit with her.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p28" pid="yhUR57OAW0ice-5j1ATehw" hash="H93JDw">She partakes of the sacrament, and she renews a covenant. She remembers the Savior, and she tries to keep His commandments. And so she takes His Spirit with her, always. Her problems may not be resolved. Most of them come from the choices of others, and even the Heavenly Father who hears her prayers and loves her cannot force others to choose the right. But He can send her to the safety of the Savior and the promise of His Spirit to be with her. And so I am sure that she will, in the strength of the Lord, pass the test she faces, because she keeps the commandment to gather often with the Saints. That is both the evidence that she is enduring well and the source of her strength for what lies ahead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p29" pid="_XQ_KlFBhES5ZF5NrvAhkg" hash="M3I1Wg">There is another simple thing to do. The Lord’s Church has been restored, and so any call to serve in it is a call to serve Him. That bishop in England was so wise. He asked the woman to pray about her call to serve. He knew what answer she would receive. It would be an invitation from the Father and His Beloved Son. He knew what she has learned by responding to the call from the Master. In His service the Holy Ghost comes as a companion to those who try to do the best they can. She must have felt that as she stood before the parents and when she saw the students vote with their feet. What looked hard, almost impossible under her own power, became a joy in the strength of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p30" pid="I2eDEos8M0GinT8XQ9It_g" hash="uADyFQ">When she reads and ponders over the scriptures and prays to prepare for those classes, she knows that the Savior has asked the Father to send her the Holy Ghost, just as He promised His disciples He would at the Last Supper, when He knew what trials they would face and that He must leave them. He did not leave them comfortless. He promised them the Holy Ghost, and He promises it to us in His service. So, whenever the invitation to serve comes, take it. It brings with it help to pass tests far beyond those of that call.</p>

But every disciple serves the Master by bearing testimony and being kind to people around them. All have promised in the waters of baptism to do that. And all will gain the companionship of the Spirit as they persist in keeping their commitments with God.</p>

You will, if you persevere in prayer and faithful service, begin to sense that the Holy Ghost has become a companion. Many of us have for a period given such service and felt that companionship. If you think back on that time, you will remember that there were changes in you. The temptation to do evil seemed to lessen. The desire to do good increased. Those who knew you best and loved you may have said, “You have become more kind, more patient. You don’t seem to be the same person.”</p>

And the promise is real that we can become new, changed, and better. And we can become stronger for the tests of life. We then go in the strength of the Lord, a strength developed in His service. He goes with us. And in time we become His tested and strengthened disciples.</p>

They will become more fervent and more frequent. The words you speak will have a different meaning to you. By commandment we always pray to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ. But you will feel a greater confidence as you pray to the Father, knowing that you go to Him as a trusted and proven disciple of Jesus Christ. The Father will grant you greater peace and strength in this life and with it a happy anticipation of hearing the words, when the test of life is over, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

I testify that He hears and answers our every prayer. I know that His Son, Jesus Christ, paid the price of all of our sins and that He wants us to come to Him. I know that the Father and the Son want us to pass the tests of life. I testify that They have prepared the way for us. Through the Restoration of the gospel in the last days, the way is made clear for us. We can know the commandments. We have the right to claim the promise of the companionship of the Holy Ghost in the true Church of Jesus Christ. And we can endure well. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

He led his young son by the hand. As they reached me, he looked down at the boy, called him by name, and said, nodding his head towards me, “This is an Apostle.” I could tell by the sound of the father’s voice that he was hoping his son would feel more than that he was meeting a dignified visitor. He hoped that his son would feel a conviction that priesthood keys were on the earth in the Lord’s Church. His son will need that conviction again and again. He will need it when he opens a letter from some future prophet he has never seen calling him to a mission. He will need it when he buries a child or a wife or a parent. He will need it for courage to follow direction to serve. He will need it for the comfort that comes from trusting a sealing power that binds forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p2" pid="wUTx2Zk1F0KTPHs3hAx7Pw" hash="UlKnHw">Missionaries will invite investigators to meet a bishop or branch president today with the same intent. They hope that the investigators will feel far more than that they have met a nice man or even a great man. They will be praying that the investigators will feel a conviction that this apparently ordinary man holds priesthood keys in the Lord’s Church. The investigators will need that conviction when they go into the waters of baptism. They will need it when they pay tithing. They will need that conviction when the bishop is inspired to give them a calling. They will need it when they see him presiding in the sacrament meeting and when he nourishes them by teaching the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p3" pid="dLG8vHBM906wFNKXAsw2dw" hash="R4uWsg">And so missionaries and fathers, and all of us who serve others in the true Church, want to help those we love gain a lasting testimony that the keys of the priesthood are held by the Lord’s servants in His Church. I speak today to encourage all who labor to instill and strengthen that testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p4" pid="BcWzs4SIvkCiqYpy5zmcVg" hash="ooE_YQ">It will help to recognize some things. First, God is persistent and generous in offering the blessings of priesthood power to His children. Second, His children must choose for themselves to qualify for and receive those blessings. And third, Satan, the enemy of righteousness, has from the beginning tried to undermine the faith necessary to receive the blessings made possible by priesthood power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p5" pid="qUPkve0-O0aBNRYfhJ12UA" hash="mvpgFQ">I learned about those realities from a wise teacher nearly 25 years ago. I spoke in an ancient theater in Ephesus. Bright sunlight flooded the ground where the Apostle Paul had stood to preach. My topic was Paul, the Apostle called of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p6" pid="5gJci8YpTUKyjnUECImk8w" hash="JtxH9g">The audience was hundreds of Latter-day Saints. They were arranged on the rows of stone benches the Ephesians sat upon more than a millennium before. Among them were two living Apostles, Elder Mark E. Petersen and Elder James E. Faust.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p7" pid="3vkQhRoqQkGDN1kD6nENUQ" hash="ZW7USA">As you can imagine, I had prepared carefully. I had read the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles, both those of Paul and his fellow Apostles. I had read and pondered Paul’s Epistle to the Ephesians.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p8" pid="oXJfgRGJd06yaMTTdHPtRg" hash="7NEV4Q">I tried my best to honor Paul and his office. After the talk, a number of people said kind things. Both of the living Apostles were generous in their comments. But later, Elder Faust took me aside and, with a smile and with softness in his voice, said, “That was a good talk. But you left out the most important thing you could have said.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p9" pid="sTvxgo7gYUqI7IUuwRik5A" hash="BJbrXw">I asked him what that was. Weeks later he consented to tell me. His answer has been teaching me ever since.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p10" pid="LsN7uZ_Imk-T1-C4v3iALA" hash="UQrRSg">He said that I could have told the people that if the Saints who heard Paul had possessed a testimony of the value and the power of the keys he held, perhaps the Apostles would not have had to be taken from the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p11" pid="wyxHHitvdEys1OLAHtosQA" hash="_-Q6eg">That sent me back to Paul’s letter to the Ephesians. I could see that Paul wanted the people to feel the value of the chain of priesthood keys reaching from the Lord through His Apostles to them, the members of the Lord’s Church. Paul was trying to build a testimony of those keys.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p12" pid="wjMfZ43n0UOXdwNZ7zPe3w" hash="42lYDg">Paul testified to the Ephesians that Christ was at the head of His Church. And he taught that the Savior built His Church on a foundation of apostles and prophets who hold all the keys of the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p13" pid="CgpJz_CP-kGiN0Bl3dcoiw" hash="xkxjLA">Despite the clarity and the power of his teaching and his example, Paul knew that an apostasy would come. He knew that apostles and prophets would be taken from the earth. And he knew that they would, in some great, future day, be restored. He wrote of that time to the Ephesians, speaking of what the Lord would do: “That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p14" pid="Fo_CZuX53UimID1czP0vLg" hash="wyIN3g">Paul looked forward to the ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith, when the heavens would be opened again. It happened. John the Baptist came and conferred on mortals the priesthood of Aaron and the keys of the ministering of angels and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p15" pid="tnpF2ZyQIEKtT5D0GCKkng" hash="oqOmtg">Ancient apostles and prophets returned and conferred upon Joseph the keys they held in mortality. Mortal men were ordained to the holy apostleship in February of 1835. Priesthood keys were given to the Twelve Apostles in the latter part of March 1844.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p16" pid="cITPDOYTcEmB2QRWJoGncQ" hash="ywU6NA">The Prophet Joseph Smith knew that his death was imminent. He knew that the precious priesthood keys and the apostleship must not be and would not be lost again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p17" pid="crLPnliCNkqqb1cR2bqQ1A" hash="w77ZDw">One of the Apostles, Wilford Woodruff, left us this account of what happened in Nauvoo as the Prophet spoke to the Twelve:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p18" pid="RcygkjDs50KCg_MtVRBbyQ" hash="i9krZw">“On that occasion the Prophet Joseph rose up and said to us: ‘Brethren, I have desired to live to see this temple built. I shall never live to see it, but you will. I have sealed upon your heads all the keys of the kingdom of God. I have sealed upon you every key, power, principle that the God of heaven has revealed to me. Now, no matter where I may go or what I may do, the kingdom rests upon you.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p19" pid="eOTnqlKVJkSfXcHJ0gIvBw" hash="amkZiQ">Every prophet that followed Joseph, from Brigham Young to President Hinckley, has held and exercised those keys and has held the sacred apostleship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p20" pid="y2Tzh4W_HUS-KIm6ryo5Yw" hash="N1m1_A">But just as in the time of Paul, the power of those priesthood keys for us requires our faith. We have to know by inspiration that the priesthood keys are held by those who lead and serve us. That requires the witness of the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p21" pid="yqbU-BWwF0-mOWIeCPhikg" hash="JD2n6A">And that depends upon our testimony that Jesus is the Christ and that He lives and leads His Church. We must also know for ourselves that the Lord restored His Church and the priesthood keys through the Prophet Joseph Smith. And we must have an assurance through the Holy Ghost, refreshed often, that those keys have been passed without interruption to the living prophet and that the Lord blesses and directs His people through the line of priesthood keys which reaches down through presidents of stakes and of districts and through bishops and branch presidents to us, wherever we are and no matter how far from the prophet and the apostles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p22" pid="hbBcZkn5RUuus8bv7pFePw" hash="UtkVIA">That is not easy today. It was not easy in the days of Paul. It has always been hard to recognize in fallible human beings the authorized servants of God. Paul must have seemed an ordinary man to many. Joseph Smith’s cheerful disposition was seen by some as not fitting their expectations for a prophet of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p23" pid="OShsrRXo5UmWrnkOpm_Cyg" hash="LLcdOw">Satan will always work on the Saints of God to undermine their faith in priesthood keys. One way he does it is to point out the humanity of those who hold them. He can in that way weaken our testimony and so cut us loose from the line of keys by which the Lord ties us to Him and can take us and our families home to Him and to our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p24" pid="ATumXYPABEiOjUhb23wK1w" hash="1NinRg">Satan succeeded in undermining the testimony of men who had, with Joseph Smith, seen the heavens opened and heard the voices of angels. The evidence of their physical eyes and ears was not enough when they no longer could feel the testimony that the priesthood keys were still in place with Joseph.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p25" pid="oRhEwm1feUK4JAn27LWeCg" hash="MxagUw">The warning for us is plain. If we look for human frailty in humans, we will always find it. When we focus on finding the frailties of those who hold priesthood keys, we run risks for ourselves. When we speak or write to others of such frailties, we put them at risk.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p26" pid="50V0k7C2hEGDNU3At-OG3w" hash="nj9Ecw">We live in a world where finding fault in others seems to be the favorite blood sport. It has long been the basis of political campaign strategy. It is the theme of much television programming across the world. It sells newspapers. Whenever we meet anyone, our first, almost unconscious reaction may be to look for imperfections.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p27" pid="LBHVpvBFjEOBB3XyNtv49A" hash="XNfkQA">To keep ourselves grounded in the Lord’s Church, we can and must train our eyes to recognize the power of the Lord in the service of those He has called. We must be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. And we need to pray for the Holy Ghost to help us know that men who lead us hold this power. For me, such prayers are most often answered when I am fully engaged in the Lord’s service myself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p28" pid="72BE2v6f20eWK8yKWpY7Dw" hash="yDXzpQ">It happened in the aftermath of a disaster. A dam in Idaho broke on a June day. A wall of water struck the communities below it. Thousands of people, mostly Latter-day Saints, fled their homes to go to safety.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p29" pid="Ewc34g_NTUCpe6BjHwcAng" hash="UQqUyw">I was there as the people faced the terrible task of recovery. I saw the stake president gather his bishops to lead the people. We were cut off in those first days from any supervision from outside. I was in the meeting of local leaders when a director from the federal disaster agency arrived.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p30" pid="Qq4io-Gwh06wWWbgTLZEKA" hash="WUprdw">He tried to take over the meeting. With great force he began to list the things that he said needed to be done. As he read aloud each item, the stake president, who was sitting near him, said quietly, “We’ve already done that.” After that went on for five or ten minutes, the federal official grew silent and sat down. He listened quietly as the stake president took reports from the bishops and gave directions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p31" pid="C-6d1i8pmk6je2yD2KKqfg" hash="N3tWsw">For the meeting the next day, the federal disaster official arrived early. He sat toward the back. The stake president began the meeting. He took more reports, and he gave instructions. After a few minutes, the federal official, who had come with all the authority and resources of his great agency, said, “President Ricks, what would you like us to do?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p32" pid="Q28ocVBXW0Cfak_ISWrVYQ" hash="KaC0mA">He recognized power. I saw more. I recognized the evidence of keys and the faith that unlocks their power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p33" pid="RFCATA-CKU-JbCvCfdN6Zg" hash="ln-ivw">It happened again when a man and his wife arrived back in town just after the dam had broken. They didn’t go to their home. They went first to find their bishop. He was covered in mud, leading his members in mucking out homes. They asked what he would have them do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p34" pid="qVuoVq99Uk23Zn0-eowGPQ" hash="TJZWKQ">They went to work. Much later, they took a few minutes to check on their own house. It was gone. So they went back to work wherever their bishop asked them to help. They knew where to go to get the Lord’s direction for service in His Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p35" pid="m28RKdaGOk2hEnQL1NO7Qg" hash="plCG_g">I learned then as I have since how the stakes of Zion become places of safety. They become like a great family, united, caring for each other. It comes by simple faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p36" pid="AMXvlJc4GkK84dsf1W2pfA" hash="kL-1NQ">By faith they are baptized and receive the Holy Ghost. As they continue to keep the commandments, that gift becomes constant. They can recognize spiritual things. It becomes easier to see the power of God working through the common people God calls to serve and lead them. Hearts are softened. Strangers become fellow citizens in the Lord’s kingdom, united in loving bonds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p37" pid="BDzjZjWGMkWzJNpqMz_J3Q" hash="y_Ntlw">That happy condition will not last without a constant renewal of faith. The bishop we love will be released, as will the stake president. The Apostles we followed in faith will be taken home to the God who called them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p38" pid="ahQ_bAde7UG9ln0ZaoutfA" hash="o-GmXw">With those continual changes comes a great opportunity. We can act to qualify for the revelation that allows us to know that the keys are being passed by God from one person to another. We can seek to have that experience again and again. And we must, in order to receive the blessings God has for us and wants us to offer to others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p39" pid="LeNNjLiWxkCuvrNDu64XXA" hash="yOvHLQ">The answer to your prayer is not likely to be as dramatic as it was when some saw Brigham Young, as he spoke, take on the appearance of the martyred Prophet Joseph. But it can be as sure. And with that spiritual assurance will come peace and power. You will know again that this is the Lord’s true and living Church, that He leads it through His ordained servants, and that He cares about us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p40" pid="d4edXt-O6kGFEvkFujXvOQ" hash="UTBc3A">If enough of us exercise that faith and receive those assurances, God will lift up those who lead us and so bless our lives and our families. We will become what Paul so wanted for those he served: “built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/faith-and-keys.p41" pid="maMSdow6tEmJg46SuKDVJg" hash="iSgWow">I testify, I know that Jesus Christ is our Savior and that He lives. I know that He is the rock upon which this, His true Church, stands. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

More than half the members of the Church today chose to be baptized after the age of eight. So you are not the exception in the Church. To you I wish to say how much the Lord loves you and trusts you. And, even more, I wish to tell you how much He depends on you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p2" pid="AF6NuO4C9UCtJRkQnwpwuA" hash="MI-N5A">You felt His love at least to some degree when you were baptized. Years ago I took a young man, 20 years of age, into the waters of baptism. My companion and I had taught him the gospel. He was the first in his family to hear the message of the restored gospel. He asked to be baptized. The testimony of the Spirit made him want to follow the example of the Savior, who was baptized by John the Baptist even though He was without sin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p3" pid="h8D4nbDAN0-MEVg5l-I3KA" hash="hH2uJg">As I brought that young man up out of the waters of baptism, he surprised me by throwing his arms around my neck and whispering in my ear, tears streaming down his face, “I’m clean, I’m clean.” That same young man, after we laid our hands on his head with the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood and conferred on him the Holy Ghost, said to me, “When you spoke those words, I felt something like fire go down from the top of my head through my body, all the way to my feet.”</p>

Since then, you have felt the reality of the promises made to you and the promises you made. You have felt the cleansing that came from your baptism, because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. And you have felt the change in your heart as the Holy Ghost has become your companion. Your desires have begun to change.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p5" pid="Rwdt-IQGtkqZpyDZksP6Ww" hash="wmMwMA">When someone tells me that he or she is a convert to the Church, I ask, “Has anyone else in your family accepted the gospel?” When the answer is “Yes,” there follows an excited description of the happy miracle in the life of a parent or a brother or sister or a grandparent. There is joy in knowing that someone in his or her family is sharing the blessing and the happiness. When the answer is “No, so far I am the only member,” he or she will almost always speak of parents, saying something like this, “No, not yet. But I am still trying.” And you can tell from the sound in the voice that the convert will never stop trying, not ever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p6" pid="AoxB5O2Qx0y3W4ol7OyUFA" hash="kde2Tw">The Lord knew you would have those feelings when He allowed you to receive the covenants which are blessing your life. He knew you would feel a desire for your family to share the blessings you felt coming into the Church. Even more, He knew how that desire would increase when you came to know the joy of the promises He makes to us in sacred temples. There, for those who qualify, He lets us make covenants with Him. We promise to obey His commandments. And He promises us, if we are faithful, that we may live with Him in glory in families forever in the world to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p7" pid="156v4DL4hE2rxXJAXIIrrg" hash="NMpr6g">In His loving-kindness, He knew you would have a desire to be bound forever to your parents and their parents. You may have had a grandfather like mine, who always seemed to treasure my visits. I thought I was his favorite grandchild until my cousins told me they felt the same way. He is gone now. All my grandparents and their ancestors have died. Many of your ancestors died never having the chance to accept the gospel and to receive the blessings and promises you have received. The Lord is fair and He is loving. And so He prepared for you and me a way for us to have the desire of our hearts to offer to our ancestors all the blessings He has offered us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p8" pid="na2aUzj9JEin5WpmcqDTZw" hash="xOsW_g">The plan to make that possible has been in place from the beginning. The Lord gave promises to His children long ago. The very last book of the Old Testament is the book of the prophet Malachi. And the last words are a sweet promise and a stern warning:</p>

The great and dreadful day of the Lord is the end of the world. Jehovah, the Messiah, will come in glory. The wicked will all be destroyed. We live in the last days. Time could be running out for us to do what we have promised to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p12" pid="0YgX7fVS8EeChPSRWv7vRw" hash="exe-PQ">It is important to know why the Lord promised to send Elijah. Elijah was a great prophet with great power given him by God. He held the greatest power God gives to His children: he held the sealing power, the power to bind on earth and have it bound in heaven. God gave it to the Apostle Peter. And the Lord kept His promise to send Elijah. Elijah came to the Prophet Joseph Smith on April 3, 1836, just after the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, the first temple built after the Restoration of the gospel. Joseph described the sacred moment:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p13" pid="FSkbCYqvbkGSUK9Wvj5yKg" hash="UQJeBw">“Another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, and said:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p16" pid="Z6Srv89d5EaG3Izjx-t4JA" hash="TSoQcw">“Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p17" pid="68CywCxkuk2VQ0oNQ-Vxsg" hash="RGij3w">As you came into the Church, you have felt your heart being turned toward family, both those who are living and those who are in the spirit world. The Lord provided another vision to help you know what to do with those feelings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p18" pid="HBX4LxHugUO8eCNxPFVkfA" hash="hBUDrg">After Joseph Smith, the Lord called other prophets to lead His Church. One was Joseph F. Smith. He saw in vision what happened in the spirit world when the Savior appeared there between the time of His death and His Resurrection.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> President Smith saw the joy of the spirits when they learned that the Savior had broken the bands of death and because of His Atonement they could be resurrected. And he saw the Savior organize His servants among the spirits to preach His gospel to every spirit and offer the chance to choose the covenants and the blessings which are offered to you and which you want for your ancestors. All are to have that chance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p19" pid="-opQBOsi3UC_Yil3kQQCUA" hash="QJad0g">President Smith also saw the leaders the Savior called to take the gospel to Heavenly Father’s children in the spirit world. He named some of them: Father Adam, Mother Eve, Noah, Abraham, Ezekiel, Elijah, prophets we know from the Book of Mormon, and some from the last days, including Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, and Wilford Woodruff. Think of the power of those missionaries to teach the gospel and to touch the hearts of your ancestors. It is not surprising that Wilford Woodruff said while he lived that he believed few, if any, of the ancestors of the Latter-day Saints in the spirit world would choose to reject the message of salvation when they heard it.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p20" pid="VgR0X7SVjESu3Ix_dxHwTg" hash="e8cqCQ">Many of your deceased ancestors will have received a testimony that the message of the missionaries is true. When you received that testimony you could ask the missionaries for baptism. But those who are in the spirit world cannot. The ordinances you so cherish are offered only in this world. Someone in this world must go to a holy temple and accept the covenants on behalf of the person in the spirit world. That is why we are under obligation to find the names of our ancestors and ensure that they are offered by us what they cannot receive there without our help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p21" pid="P1yY5oSBX0GFIeNGVzEUEQ" hash="cZPCOA">For me, knowing that turns my heart not only to my ancestors who wait but to the missionaries who teach them. I will see those missionaries in the spirit world, and so will you. Think of a faithful missionary standing there with those he has loved and taught who are your ancestors. Picture as I do the smile on the face of that missionary as you walk up to him and your ancestors whom he converted but could not baptize or have sealed to family until you came to the rescue. I do not know what the protocol will be in such a place, but I imagine arms thrown around your neck and tears of gratitude.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p22" pid="FN3n2OX_BUG8EzNrON8L1w" hash="tijNPQ">If you can imagine the smile of the missionary and your ancestor, think of the Savior when you meet Him. You will have that interview. He paid the price of the sins of you and all of Heavenly Father’s spirit children. He is Jehovah. He sent Elijah. He conferred the powers of the priesthood to seal and to bless out of perfect love. And He has trusted you by letting you hear the gospel in your lifetime, giving you the chance to accept the obligation to offer it to those of your ancestors who did not have your priceless opportunity. Think of the gratitude He has for those who pay the price in work and faith to find the names of their ancestors and who love them and Him enough to offer them eternal life in families, the greatest of all the gifts of God. He offered them an infinite sacrifice. He will love and appreciate those who paid whatever price they could to allow their ancestors to choose His offer of eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p23" pid="vU1amn8O0UCSyJai0zCb4g" hash="ipRRBQ">Because your heart has already been turned, the price may not seem high. You begin by doing simple things. Write down what you already know about your family. You will need to write down the names of parents and their parents with the dates of birth or death or marriage. When you can, you will want to record the places. Some of that you will know from memory. But you can also ask relatives. They may even have some certificates of births, marriages, or deaths. Make copies and organize them. If you learn stories about their lives, write them down and keep them. You are not just gathering names. Those you never met in life will become friends you love. Your heart will be bound to theirs forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p24" pid="WeB4s6pzjUWGW5mlYIGCPA" hash="jnS51w">You can start searching in the first few generations going back in time. From that you will identify many of your ancestors who need your help. Someone in your own ward or branch of the Church has been called to help you prepare those names for the temple. There they can be offered the covenants which will free them from their spirit prisons and bind them in families—your family—forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p25" pid="MoNDzWeJV02HFQjwW7Oeyg" hash="JFb1VQ">Your opportunities and the obligations they create are remarkable in the whole history of the world. There are more temples across the earth than there have ever been. More people in all the world have felt the Spirit of Elijah move them to record the identities and facts of their ancestors’ lives. There are more resources to search out your ancestors than there have ever been in the history of the world. The Lord has poured out knowledge about how to make that information available worldwide through technology that a few years ago would have seemed a miracle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p26" pid="8OrkOJ3NmkeOQEg3xUIf5Q" hash="rSgy_Q">With those opportunities there comes greater obligation to keep our trust with the Lord. Where much is given, much is required.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> After you find the first few generations, the road will become more difficult. The price will become greater. As you go back in time, the records become less complete. As others of your family search out ancestors, you will discover that the ancestor you find has already been offered the full blessings of the temple. Then you will have a difficult and important choice to make. You will be tempted to stop and leave the hard work of finding to others who are more expert or to another time in your life. But you will also feel a tug on your heart to go on in the work, hard as it will be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p27" pid="g__m-rcq10uH0l5xfRdlbA" hash="BFF8Gw">As you decide, remember that the names which will be so difficult to find are of real people to whom you owe your existence in this world and whom you will meet again in the spirit world. When you were baptized, your ancestors looked down on you with hope. Perhaps after centuries, they rejoiced to see one of their descendants make a covenant to find them and to offer them freedom. In your reunion, you will see in their eyes either gratitude or terrible disappointment. Their hearts are bound to you. Their hope is in your hands. You will have more than your own strength as you choose to labor on to find them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/hearts-bound-together.p28" pid="PS3MucAW90qpGNtOIJdz9w" hash="p07IhQ">A few nights ago I had a dream. I saw a piece of white paper with a name on it I did not know and a date I could only partially read. I got up and went to the records of my family. The last name on the slip of paper is from a line which came into my mother’s ancestry 300 years ago in a place called Eaton Bray. Someone is anxious for a long wait to end. I have not yet found that person. But I have found again the assurance that a loving God sends help in answer to prayer in this sacred work of redeeming our families, which is His work and His glory and to which we have pledged our hearts. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We have seen and felt the suffering of women, men, and children, and of the aged and the weak, caught in hurricanes, tsunamis, wars, and droughts. One reaction is to ask, “How can I be prepared?” And there is a rush to buy and put away whatever people think they might need for the day they might face such calamities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/spiritual-preparedness-start-early-and-be-steady.p2" pid="7PoA8fvdCUqWMNVtnS6y8Q" hash="OvfddQ">But there is another even more important preparation we must make for tests that are certain to come to each of us. That preparation must be started far in advance because it takes time. What we will need then can’t be bought. It can’t be borrowed. It doesn’t store well. And it has to have been used regularly and recently.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/spiritual-preparedness-start-early-and-be-steady.p3" pid="l-vJ9R39BUiYxZ0Gx79dgg" hash="pckcGQ">What we will need in our day of testing is a spiritual preparation. It is to have developed faith in Jesus Christ so powerful that we can pass the test of life upon which everything for us in eternity depends. That test is part of the purpose God had for us in the Creation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/spiritual-preparedness-start-early-and-be-steady.p4" pid="sTq_ZSR5c0-SDbje-wwJ_Q" hash="b_5eVQ">The Prophet Joseph Smith gave us the Lord’s description of the test we face. Our Heavenly Father created the world with His Son, Jesus Christ. We have these words to tell us about the purpose of the Creation: “We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

It is not to endure storms, but to choose the right while they rage. And the tragedy of life is to fail in that test and so fail to qualify to return in glory to our heavenly home.</p>

He loved us and He taught us before we were born into this world. He told us that He wished to give us all that He had. To qualify for that gift we had to receive mortal bodies and be tested. Because of those mortal bodies, we would face pain, sickness, and death.</p>

Subtle and powerful forces of evil would tempt us to surrender to those temptations. Life would have storms in which we would have to make choices using faith in things we could not see with our natural eyes.</p>

He would assure that we would all be resurrected. And He would make it possible for us to pass the test of life if we exercised faith in Him by being obedient. We shouted for joy at the good news.</p>

It is by using that faith we can know the will of God. It is by acting on that faith we build the strength to do the will of God. And it is by exercising that faith in Jesus Christ that we can resist temptation and gain forgiveness through the Atonement.</p>

Those spiritual storms are already raging. We can expect that they will worsen until the Savior returns.</p>

We can do that by deciding now to be more quick to obey and more determined to endure. Learning to start early and to be steady are the keys to spiritual preparation. Procrastination and inconsistency are its mortal enemies.</p>

One is the command to feast upon the word of God. A second is to pray always. A third is the commandment to be a full-tithe payer. And the fourth is to escape from sin and its terrible effects. Each takes faith to start and then to persevere. And all can strengthen your capacity to know and obey the Lord’s commands.</p>

In August, you received this promise from President Gordon B. Hinckley if you would read the Book of Mormon through by the end of the year: “Without reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

But if we delayed the start of our obedience to that inspired invitation, the number of pages we had to read each day grew larger. If we then missed reading for even a few days, the chance of failure grew. That’s why I chose to read ahead of my daily plan to be sure I will qualify for the promised blessings of the spirit of resolution and testimony of Jesus Christ. When December ends, I will have learned about starting at the moment a command from God comes and being steady in obedience.</p>

There is a promise of that plea being answered in the book itself: “Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

When I complete the project in December, I will have had many experiences of stretching my faith to be obedient. And so my faith will be strengthened. And I will know from my own experience what comes from going to the scriptures early and consistently to know what God wants me to do and then doing it. If we do that, we will be better prepared for the greater storms when they come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/spiritual-preparedness-start-early-and-be-steady.p21" pid="gPYC1yLTDUmGysk_Vgfs6g" hash="6AT2Tw">We will then have a choice of what to do after January 1. We can choose to sigh with relief and say to ourselves: “I have built a great reservoir of faith by starting early and being steady in obedience. I will store it away against the times when I will be tested in storms.” There is a better way to prepare, because great faith has a short shelf life. We could decide to persist in studying the words of Christ in the scriptures and the teachings of living prophets. This is what I will do. I will go back to the Book of Mormon and drink deeply and often. And then I will be grateful for what the prophet’s challenge and promise did to teach me how to gain greater faith and maintain it.</p>

We are commanded to pray <span class="emphasis">always</span> that we will not be overcome. Some of the protection we need will be direct intervention of God. But more of it will come from building our faith to obey. We can pray every day to know what God would have us do. We can commit to start to do it quickly when the answer comes. My experience is that He always answers such petitions. Then, we can choose to obey. As we do, we will build faith enough that we will not be overcome. And we will gain the faith to go back again and again for further instruction. When the storms come, we will be ready to go and do what the Lord commands.</p>

He prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane as He worked out the Atonement that His Father’s will would be done. He knew that His Father’s will would be for Him to do what was so painful and so terrible that we cannot comprehend it. He prayed not simply to accept the Father’s will but to do it. He showed us the way to pray in perfect and determined submission.</p>

We should not wait until the annual tithing settlement to decide to be a full-tithe payer. We can decide now. It takes time to learn to control our spending with faith that what we have comes from God. It takes faith to pay our tithing promptly and without procrastination.</p>

By our decision now to be a full-tithe payer and our steady efforts to obey, we will be strengthened in our faith and, in time, our hearts will be softened. It is that change in our hearts through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, beyond the offering of our money or goods, that makes it possible for the Lord to promise full-tithe payers protection in the last days.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> We can have confidence that we will qualify for that blessing of protection if we commit now to pay a full tithe and are steady in doing it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/spiritual-preparedness-start-early-and-be-steady.p26" pid="WsszT8_EEEO7uCXRpaN1XQ" hash="pQ-4og">The same power of an early choice to exercise faith and to be persistent in obedience applies to gaining the faith to resist temptation and to gain forgiveness. The best time to resist temptation is early. The best time to repent is now. The enemy of our souls will place thoughts in our minds to tempt us. We can decide early to exercise faith, to cast out evil thoughts before we act on them. And we can choose quickly to repent when we do sin, before Satan can weaken our faith and bind us. Seeking forgiveness is always better now than later.</p>

He probably heard a little hint in my voice that he might fear death and the Judgment. He just chuckled quietly, smiled up at me, and said, “Oh no, Hal, I’ve been repenting as I went along.”</p>

A loving Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son have given us all the help They can to pass the test of life set before us. But we must decide to obey and then do it. We build the faith to pass the tests of obedience over time and through our daily choices. We can decide now to do quickly whatever God asks of us. And we can decide to be steady in the small tests of obedience which build the faith to carry us through the great tests, which will surely come.</p>

The Apostle Paul wrote to Timothy, “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Anyone with eyes to see the signs of the times and ears to hear the words of prophets knows that the peril is great. The peril comes from the forces of wickedness. Those forces are increasing. And so it will become harder, not easier, to keep the covenants we must make to live the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/as-a-child.p2" uuid="3ae6e1d5-6693-4339-b165-6c3daaeeb3ec" pid="yQ7RwbLCPES0AN6yxH0pJA" hash="hBZ4sg">For those of us who are concerned about such a future for ourselves and for those we love—in our families, in our quorums, and in our classes—there is hope in the promise the Lord has given us of a place of safety in the storms ahead. Here is a word picture of that place. You have read about it in scripture. It has been repeatedly described by living prophets. A loving father told his sons of it this way as he tried to strengthen them against the storms of temptation:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/as-a-child.p3" uuid="8e003a5e-e1fa-4d79-a6a6-1c225b0eb918" pid="RYK3jitfIUSLSt1sPWLJWw" hash="89Dlxw">“And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation … whereon if men build they cannot fall.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

For me, there is no better place to look than in the last sermon of King Benjamin recorded in the Book of Mormon. Most of us have read it again recently and have pondered it more than once. King Benjamin could see us and our descendants. He knew by prophetic power what we face. He knew from his own experience the terrors of war. He had defended his people in combat, relying on the power of God. He saw clearly the terrible powers of Lucifer to tempt and to overcome us.</p>

People have to believe that the danger is real to want to find safety. They have to fear the consequence of ignoring the peril. He made clear the hazards we face because we are free to choose between right and wrong and because we cannot avoid the consequence of those choices. He spoke directly and sharply because he knew what sorrow would come to those who might not hear and heed his warnings.</p>

When King Benjamin speaks to me of shrinking from the presence of the Lord, it puts fear into my heart. I can see myself standing in that day of judgment before the glorified and resurrected Savior. I want with all my heart not to shrink, but rather to look up at Him and see Him smile and say, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Enter in.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

That is the only way we can build on the sure foundation and so stand firm in righteousness during the storms of temptation.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/as-a-child.p13" uuid="8ef136ec-72c0-4de3-95a0-656b30852a69" pid="KLwb5F78tkSseVTLp0NioA" hash="X3AQYg">King Benjamin describes that change with a beautiful comparison, used by prophets for millennia and by the Lord Himself. It is this: that we can, and we must, become as a child—a little child.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/as-a-child.p14" uuid="dccd5f60-c5ce-4dc4-9a53-132e2d7a8601" pid="7xIAfnODkEac7-XiL0Kn_A" hash="aJQFQw">For some that will not be easy to understand or to accept. Most of us want to be strong. We may well see being like a child as being weak. Most parents have wanted their children at times to be less childish. Even the Apostle Paul used these words as he was about to urge us to incorporate charity, the pure love of Christ, into our lives: “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/as-a-child.p15" uuid="6d7fc7e0-2511-4fc8-916c-c6fd70d2f05f" pid="yZ6Gp_uMiEGBtrh0CJ9u1w" hash="56HwRg">But King Benjamin, who understood as well as any mortal what it meant to be a man of strength and courage, makes it clear that to be like a child is not to be childish. It is to be like the Savior, who prayed to His Father for strength to be able to do His will and then did it. Our natures must be changed to become as a child to gain the strength we must have to be safe in the times of moral peril.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/as-a-child.p16" uuid="3f5d01db-25bf-44dd-8e98-a789352b8c80" pid="tnL5vvr_Q0qbaKWlTnHa-Q" hash="9vEcyQ">Here is King Benjamin’s stirring description of what that change to become like a child is and how it comes to us:</p>

When we have, by that experience, become as a child in our capacity to love and obey, we are on the sure foundation.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/as-a-child.p19" uuid="191f833c-1ae5-4ba1-a505-b649f9f95110" pid="aephLrnmvkKmDPliPlLOdg" hash="dWV7FA">From King Benjamin we learn what we can do to take us to that safe place. But remember: the things we do are the means, not the end we seek. What we do allows the Atonement of Jesus Christ to change us into what we must be. Our faith in Jesus Christ brings us to repentance and to keeping His commandments. We obey and we resist temptation by following the promptings of the Holy Ghost. In time our natures will change. We will become as a little child, obedient to God and more loving. That change, if we do all we must to keep it, will qualify us to enjoy the gifts which come through the Holy Ghost. Then we will be safe on the only sure rock.</p>

I have prayed, as you have, to know what to do when choices that I faced would have eternal consequences. Over many years I have seen a recurring pattern in the times when the answers to such a prayer have come most clearly.</p>

I knew that no other choice could have had a greater effect on the lives of others and on my own. I knew what choice looked most comfortable to me. I knew what outcome I wanted. But I could not see the future. I could not see which choice would lead to which outcome. So the risk of being wrong seemed too great to me.</p>

Just before dawn, a feeling came over me. More than at any time since I had been a child, I felt like one. My heart and my mind seemed to grow very quiet. There was a peace in that inner stillness.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/as-a-child.p23" uuid="b29cdd63-d388-42f8-8f61-3321bda9d6a6" pid="RuqaNimKbkS99ztodstuBw" hash="5lF8qw">Somewhat to my surprise, I found myself praying, “Heavenly Father, it doesn’t matter what I want. I don’t care anymore what I want. I only want that Thy will be done. That is all that I want. Please tell me what to do.”</p>

And the message came, and I was sure who it was from. It was clear what I was to do. I received no promise of the outcome. There was only the assurance that I was a child who had been told what path led to whatever He wanted for me.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/as-a-child.p25" uuid="0da6c963-d7bc-4736-bb93-7a018a09963a" pid="21bqwyto90CRQglqoVybsg" hash="f1-e4A">I learned from that experience and countless repetitions that the description of the Holy Ghost as a still, small voice is real. It is poetic, but it is not poetry. Only when my heart has been still and quiet, in submission like a little child, has the Spirit been clearly audible to my heart and mind.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="43"></span>I am grateful to be with you in this great priesthood meeting. All of us are members of a quorum in the priesthood. That may not seem remarkable to you, but it does to me. I was ordained a deacon in the Aaronic Priesthood in a tiny branch of the Church. There was only one family in the branch. We had no chapel. We met in our house. I was the only deacon and my brother the only teacher.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p2" pid="3q2RyN_jV02tU6w8-b08BQ" hash="dAhCzg">So I know what it is like to exercise the priesthood alone, without serving with others in a quorum. I was content in that small branch without a quorum. I had no way to know what I was missing. And then my family moved across a continent to where there were many priesthood holders and strong quorums.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p3" pid="27YnaDxpEUeN14pZ0lbWNA" hash="9KJ_HQ">I have learned over the years that the strength in a quorum doesn’t come from the number of priesthood holders in it. Nor does it come automatically from the age and maturity of the members. Rather, the strength of a quorum comes in large measure from how completely its members are united in righteousness. That unity in a strong quorum of the priesthood is not like anything I have experienced in an athletic team or club or any other organization in the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p4" pid="AhzZ3nD0xUi1LncHN47KbA" hash="kbyc4g">The words of Alma, recorded in the book of Mosiah, come closest to describing the unity I have felt in the strongest priesthood quorums:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p5" pid="PTwx9EqvKkKrbA_SMC6hdQ" hash="4b56RQ">“And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p6" pid="Pbtwdd09UEydsgU9w9geLA" hash="aE0mZA">Alma even told his people how to qualify for that unity. He told them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p7" pid="624mNV4q1UC_MGQ7n6uHPQ" hash="r-2O0A">What Alma was teaching, and what is true in any unified priesthood quorum I have seen, is that the members’ hearts are being changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. That is how their hearts become knit together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p8" pid="03ZunXtd2k6qYfaJGZkTzw" hash="uuaylw">You can see then why the Lord charges the presidents of quorums to lead in the way that He does. In the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, He uses almost the same words describing the duties of the president in each quorum. The deacons quorum president is to teach the quorum members their duty “as it is given according to the covenants.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> The president of the teachers quorum is to teach its members their duties as “given in the covenants.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> The president of the priests quorum, who is the bishop, is commanded “to preside over forty-eight priests, and sit in council with them, to teach them the duties of their office, as is given in the covenants.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p9" pid="6yojd73Ag0ulblI-s9or9w" hash="5BiEfQ">The elders quorum president is charged this way:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p10" pid="WWih_u-AcEeC98KF1w9_Pw" hash="lN1SjQ">“Again, the duty of the president over the office of elders is to preside over ninety-six elders, and to sit in council with them, and to teach them according to the covenants.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p11" pid="px3edOFJy02Tkz3-vyOgfw" hash="Hq324g">It is easy to understand why God wants His quorums taught “according to the covenants.” Covenants are solemn promises. Heavenly Father has promised us all eternal life if we will make and keep covenants. For instance, we receive the priesthood with a covenant to be faithful in helping Him in His work. The people we baptize into His Church promise to have faith in Jesus Christ and to repent and to keep His commandments. Every covenant requires faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to His commandments to qualify for the forgiveness and purified hearts necessary to inherit eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p12" pid="yBCKB0h3F0m5s0vrcksSCw" hash="SnutUQ">You might ask, “Does that mean that every lesson in the quorum must only be about faith and repentance?” Of course not. But it does mean that <span class="pageBreak" page-number="44"></span>the teacher and those who participate must always desire to bring the Spirit of the Lord into the hearts of the members in the room to produce faith and a determination to repent and to be clean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p13" pid="aXA4qVV8eUaZcWkpE3o5Lg" hash="1PRghQ">And that desire goes beyond the walls of the room where the quorum meets. In a truly united quorum, that desire extends to the members wherever they are.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p14" pid="KS5YkverakWSaOfQ_Z5E9g" hash="VQopCw">I saw that a few years ago in a deacons quorum where I had been called to teach the lessons. A few of the deacons failed to come to the quorum meetings from time to time. I knew that the teaching in that quorum—and in every quorum—was the charge of the president, who had keys. He was to sit in council with all of them. And so I have made a habit of seeking the counsel of the one with the charge from God by asking him, “What do you think I should teach? What should I try to accomplish?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p15" pid="tPZabQIUl0--ayFD488ajQ" hash="OLgogA">I learned to follow his counsel because I knew God had given him responsibility for the teaching of his quorum members. I knew one Sunday that God had honored the charge to a young quorum president. I was teaching the deacons. I noticed an empty chair. There was a recording device sitting on the chair, and I could see that it was running. After the class, a boy sitting next to the empty chair picked up the recorder. As he started to leave the room, I asked him why he had recorded our discussion. He smiled and said that another deacon had told him that he wouldn’t be in the quorum that day. He was taking the recorder to his friend at home so that he could listen to our lesson.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p16" pid="g6QjBsLQfEmbN1z8ucaRXg" hash="FDv4ZQ">I had trusted in the responsibility given to a young quorum president, so help from heaven came. The Spirit came to touch the members in that room and sent one of them to a friend to try to strengthen his faith and lead him to repentance. The deacon carrying the recorder had learned according to the covenants, and he reached out to help his friend and fellow member in the quorum.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p17" pid="jXPBubFEkkKLB9oK2wnfWA" hash="Cjzymw">Priesthood quorum members are taught in more ways than by lessons in a class. The quorum is a service unit, and the members learn in their service. A quorum can give greater service than the members could give alone. And that power is multiplied by more than their numbers. Every quorum has a leader with authority and responsibility to direct priesthood service. I have seen the power that comes when quorums are called to move out to help in times of disaster. Time and again I have had people outside the Church express surprise and admiration for the effectiveness of the Church in organizing to give help. It seems to them like a miracle. In all priesthood service the miracle of power comes because leaders and members honor the authority of those who direct the service in priesthood quorums across the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p18" pid="KOqCGxUDfUC5trI-MaB9JA" hash="mkyKgw">Miracles of power can come as quorums reach out to serve others. They come as well when the priesthood service is to members within the quorum. A deacons quorum president met early one Sunday, before the quorum meeting, with his counselors and with the quorum secretary. After prayerful consideration in council, he felt inspired to call a deacon to invite to the next quorum meeting another deacon who had never attended. He knew that the deacon who had never attended had a father who was not a member of the Church and that his mother had little interest in the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p19" pid="L4Y0o5hXokyLumzPd015Xw" hash="dNZKKA">The designated deacon accepted the call from his president to contact the boy. He went. I watched him go. He went a little reluctantly, as if it might be a hard task. The boy he invited to come with him to quorum came only a few times before his family moved away. Many years later I was in a stake conference thousands of miles away from where that deacons quorum had met. Between conference meetings, a man I did not know came up to me and asked if I knew someone. He gave me a name. It was the boy who was called by his deacons quorum president to go after and care for one lost sheep. The man said to me, “Will you thank him for me? I am the grandfather of the boy he invited to a deacons quorum years ago. He is grown now. But he still talks with me about the deacon who invited him to go with him to church.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p20" pid="gn2ZQY-MSkOjR7Bk9RtvzQ" hash="Z8t86g">He had tears in his eyes, and so did I. A young quorum president had been inspired to reach out to a lost member of his quorum. He was inspired to send a boy on the errand to serve. That president had done what the Master would have done. And in the process a young president trained a new priesthood holder in his duty to serve others according to the covenants. Hearts were knit which were still connected after more than 20 years and across thousands of miles. Quorum unity lasts when it is forged in the Lord’s service and in the Lord’s way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p21" pid="DUQpAqvp_EGHxmdW3HjhGg" hash="lZnNbQ">One of the hallmarks of a strong quorum is the feeling of fellowship among its members. They care for each other. They help each other. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="45"></span>Quorum presidents can build that fellowship best if they remember the Lord’s purpose for unity in the quorum. It is of course so that they will help each other. But it is more, much more. It is so that they will lift and encourage each other to serve in righteousness with the Master in His work to offer eternal life to Heavenly Father’s children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p22" pid="Q1RDLNYaW0uZvO0iu9gjbA" hash="QoJm5Q">Understanding that will change the way we try to build fellowship in the quorum. For instance, it might even change the way a teachers quorum plays basketball. The members might hope to build fellowship, more than just to win a game. They could choose to invite a boy who is always left out because he doesn’t play very well. If he accepts and comes, the members of the quorum are likely to pass the ball a little more, looking for the open man, especially the boy who isn’t likely to score. Twenty years later they may not remember whether they won that night, but they will always remember how they played together and why—and whose team it was. It was the Lord who said, “If ye are not one ye are not mine.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p23" pid="7XhREEYYXUyigGyJYYjNlQ" hash="4BnSEQ">Understanding why the Lord wants fellowship can change the way an elders quorum party is planned. I’ve been to a party where the man who planned it was a convert to the Church. Finding the gospel was the sweetest thing that had ever happened to him. So neighbors and friends not yet members of the Church were invited to the party. I still remember the feeling of fellowship as we visited with them about what the Church meant to us. I felt in that party more than fellowship with brothers in the priesthood. The Master invited His disciples to His first Quorum of the Twelve in His mortal ministry this way: “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> And so that night at a party, I felt that I was in the fellowship of the Master and His disciples, becoming what He wants us to be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p24" pid="EaCvpYOaYEGhjxuAsoiS8Q" hash="75dIWw">I was blessed with that same feeling of fellowship by a priesthood leader when I was in the Aaronic Priesthood. He understood how to build priesthood fellowship that can last. He arranged with the owner of a woodlot for us to spend an afternoon chopping wood and putting it in bundles. The bundles were for widows so that they could have a fire in the cold of winter. I still remember the warmth of fellowship I felt with my priesthood brethren. But even more I remember feeling that I was doing what the Savior would do. And so I felt fellowship with Him. We can build that precious fellowship in our quorums in this life and then we can have it forever, in glory and in families, if we live according to the covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p25" pid="tjM3GBgABU24tilMcHDhng" hash="Y9n-UA">My prayer is that you will accept the Lord’s invitation to become united, as one, in our quorums of the priesthood. He has marked the way. And He has promised us that with His help good quorums can become great quorums. He wants that for us. And I know that He needs stronger quorums to bless the children of our Heavenly Father, according to the covenants. I have faith that He will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/a-priesthood-quorum.p26" pid="H8Y9fm2VF0GFaJxzpOnPaw" hash="8WWxFw">I know that our Heavenly Father lives. I know that His Son, Jesus Christ, atoned for our sins and those of everyone we will ever meet. He was resurrected. He lives. He leads His Church. He holds the keys of the priesthood. Through inspiration to those who hold keys in the Church, He calls every president of every priesthood quorum. I testify that the priesthood was restored with all its keys to Joseph Smith. And I bear solemn witness that those keys have been passed to the present day to the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who is the president of the priesthood in all the earth.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p10" pid="QvcGL4NMdkmhjsMPfC0Zrw" hash="YOuR0Q">Even the Savior, who was without sin, set an example of the need not to procrastinate. He said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p11" pid="wBbVC9NylEeS4earHrhXOQ" hash="OtLirw">“I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p12" pid="JBrKwN3vQESFrYlaS8Hb3A" hash="2GvYHA">“As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p13" pid="YNw_5Cm-VE-94E5thyfs_g" hash="c0pcLQ">As the risen Savior, He is this day and forever the Light of the World. It is He who invites us to come unto Him and serve Him, without delay. His encouragement to you and to me is this: “I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p14" pid="6k6Zl863mEOPmW_mFnO5SA" hash="XG0zJA">That is as true of a day as it is of a life. A morning prayer and an early search in the scriptures to know what we should do for the Lord can set the course of a day. We can know which task, of all those we might choose, matters most to God and therefore to us. I have learned such a prayer is always answered if we ask and ponder with childlike submission, ready to act without delay to perform even the most humble service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p15" pid="W_O0Is0K20Sy8h5dp6pTPw" hash="Upq5cw">On many days, doing what matters most will not be easy. It is not supposed to be. God’s purpose in creation was to let us prove ourselves. The plan was explained to us in the spirit world before we were born. We were valiant enough there to qualify for the opportunity to choose against temptation here to prepare for eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God. We rejoiced to know the test would be one of faithful obedience even when it would not be easy: “And we will prove <span class="pageBreak" page-number="90"></span>them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p16" pid="xvtWpzZObk6oj181NDX1yQ" hash="e0DKAg">Hard as we knew the test would be, we felt joy because we had confidence that we could pass it. Our confidence came from knowing that Jesus Christ would come into the world as our Savior. He would overcome death. He would make it possible for us to be cleansed of our sins by qualifying for the effects of His Atonement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p17" pid="tM8gRmMFLEGOstCWWBMQnQ" hash="wF-oPA">We also knew some reassuring facts about what it would take to receive the purifying which we would need. Everything that cleansing would require—baptism by authority, receiving the Holy Ghost under the hands of authorized priesthood bearers, remembering Him and therefore having His Spirit to be with us, and then keeping His commandments—all would be possible for the humblest of us. It would not take superior intellect, nor would it take wealth, nor long life. And we knew that the Savior would draw us to Him and would have the power to help us when the test would be hard and the temptation to procrastinate great. Alma, the great prophet, described how Christ gained that ability:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p18" pid="SjIc39SdMUSJvDpwZOpmNg" hash="6oJs_A">“And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p19" pid="PqFXpTTXYUajxFtIQ5FCaw" hash="4ZJM4A">“And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p20" pid="VbVt3TywAEOMdtrDDpCZpw" hash="Xsqdcw">All of us will need His help to avoid the tragedy of procrastinating what we must do here and now to have eternal life. For most of us the temptation to delay will come from one or both of two feelings. They are polar opposites: one is to be complacent about what we have already done, and the other is to feel overwhelmed by the need to do more.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p21" pid="TetZzuJdnEWuxYthjZGi6w" hash="QFiMag">Complacency is a danger for us all. It can come to naive youth who feel that there will be plenty of time in the future for spiritual things. They might think that they have already done enough, considering the brief time they have lived. I know from experience how the Lord can help such a youth to see that he or she is in the midst of spiritual things, now. He can help you see that classmates are watching you. He can help you see that their eternal future is shaped by what they observe you do or not do. Your simple thanks for their influence for good on you can lift them more than you imagine. When you ask God, He can and will reveal to you the opportunities to lift others for Him, which He has placed around you from your infancy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p22" pid="Gb34zXlFXkiBROzu1ocNBg" hash="l-xWMQ">Complacency can affect even the seasoned adult. The better and the longer you serve, the more likely that the tempter can place this lie in your mind: “You have earned a rest.” You may have been the Primary president in your little branch twice. Or you may have worked long and hard on your mission and sacrificed so much to serve. Or perhaps you were the pioneer in the Church where you live. The thought may come: “Why not leave the service to the new people. I have done my part.” The temptation will be to believe that you will return to serve again, someday.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p23" pid="EsmQWNi2bEaWQ9GnsMpOqQ" hash="fkkvqw">The Lord can help you see the danger in taking a rest because you feel you have done enough. He helped me by letting me have a conversation with one of His aged servants. He was feeble, his body weakened by decades of faithful labor and by illness. His doctors no longer allowed him to leave his home. At his request, I reported a trip I had taken in the Lord’s service, across several nations, in dozens of meetings, and in many private interviews, helping individuals and families. I told him of the gratitude people expressed to me for him and his many years of service. He asked me if I had another assignment soon. I told him about another long trip soon to come. He surprised me, and he gave me an inoculation against complacency which I hope will last forever, when he grabbed my arm and said, “Oh, please, take me with you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p24" pid="bPVSCdrxnE2hwYwK06U_iA" hash="amBt9Q">It is hard to know when we have done enough for the Atonement to change our natures and so qualify us for eternal life. And we don’t know how many days we will have to give the service necessary for that mighty change to come. But we know that we will have days enough if only we don’t waste them. Here is the good news:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p25" pid="wWBEW9xJtUuZ_b5_mRP7Lw" hash="SD6DpA">“And the days of the children of men were prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of probation, and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p26" pid="hAIx3_BfX0SqkvgvkvN7mQ" hash="OCSGRQ">That assurance from the Master can help those of us feeling overwhelmed by our circumstances. In the hardest trials, as long as you have the power to pray, you can ask a loving God: “Please let me serve, this day. It doesn’t matter to me how few things I may be able to do. Just let me <span class="pageBreak" page-number="91"></span>know what I <span class="emphasis">can</span> do. I will obey this day. I know that I can, with Thy help.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p27" pid="oG9a5oFow0avHBalXutQlg" hash="BVCvdQ">The quiet invitation to you may be to do so simple a thing as to forgive someone who has offended you. You can do that from a hospital bed. It may be to go to help someone who is hungry. You may feel overwhelmed by your own poverty and the labors of the day. But if you decide not to wait until you have more strength and more money, and if you pray for the Holy Spirit as you go, you will when you arrive know what to do and how to help someone even poorer than you are. You may find when you get there that they were praying and expecting that someone like you would come, in the name of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p28" pid="bG_BLsqCLE6kQI0IuQvctQ" hash="B4uvog">For those who are discouraged by their circumstances and are therefore tempted to feel they cannot serve the Lord this day, I make you two promises. Hard as things seem today, they will be better in the next day if you choose to serve the Lord this day with your whole heart. Your circumstances may not be improved in all the ways which you desire. But you will have been given new strength to carry your burdens and new confidence that when your burdens become too heavy, the Lord, whom you have served, will carry what you cannot. He knows how. He prepared long ago. He suffered your infirmities and your sorrows when He was in the flesh so that He would know how to succor you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p29" pid="HgToEfh-jkq83lLN5LY3Hg" hash="5mCEhw">The other promise I make to you is that by choosing to serve Him this day, you will feel His love and grow to love Him more. You may remember the scripture:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p30" pid="m0Vfx50kE0uFAG2ZUdV99w" hash="iNsVIw">“I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts … that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p31" pid="0kWMla6rRkq8jT8yhtPxOw" hash="o2geWA">“For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p32" pid="3P2oUNzBw0ybTlr9fVXAmQ" hash="Qt23Pg">By serving Him this day, you will come to know Him better. You will feel His love and appreciation. You would not want to delay receiving that blessing. And feeling His love will draw you back to His service, wiping away both complacency and discouragement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p33" pid="goPr96A2hk64TedaGDk0XQ" hash="ujFc0w">As you serve Him, you will come to know better the voice by which you shall be called. When you go to sleep at the end of a day, the words may come back in memory: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> I pray for that benediction on this day, on every day, and on our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/this-day.p34" pid="KS-dkqNObkuFq_lqB-XDSw" hash="biC_-A">I know that Heavenly Father lives and answers our prayers.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="55"></span>Tonight my thoughts are about a boy somewhere in the world. He is wondering if he can do what being a priesthood holder will require of him. I had that worry when I was about 13 or 14.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="YXLP2yrYIk6sNrkB06sQWw" hash="mICXpQ">I had grown up in the mission field where there was only a tiny branch, which met in my home. Then my family moved to where there were stakes and large wards and chapels and quorums of boys who all seemed to know so much more than I did about what priesthood holders do. They had in that ward a complicated pattern for passing the sacrament. I felt almost certain that I would make a mistake when my turn to pass or prepare the sacrament came.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="Y0cwaJR920m_6WqiRbseHg" hash="_Bh4YA">In my fear and desperation, I remember going outside the chapel to be alone. I was worried. I prayed for help and for some assurance that I would not fail in serving God in His priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="f2p0Y9pS20eYAdhJTq4fpA" hash="593ERA">It is now many years later. I have held the Melchizedek Priesthood for more than 50 years. But in the last few days I have prayed with that same pleading for help and assurance that I will not fail in the call which has come to me to serve in the First Presidency. Others seem so much more able to serve and so much better prepared. But as I prayed this time I think I could feel an answer that was probably sent to me outside the Yalecrest Ward chapel long ago. It is the same answer you can expect to get when you face a call to serve in the priesthood which seems beyond you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="omarUBpt1kqc6m-s_1G6Bg" hash="LP1c5Q">The message may come in words to your mind or in a feeling or both. But it will include at least three things to give you assurance and guidance in <span class="pageBreak" page-number="56"></span>what you must do in this seemingly overwhelming calling.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="VZGHVMqKA0WRWmU_wmCcZQ" hash="-3mXZg">First, the assurance will come from a memory of times Heavenly Father has helped you through dangers and difficulties. That’s happened to me in the last few days.</p>

My mother went out to meet them, standing alone in this crowd of people who looked very dangerous to me. I couldn’t hear what she said, but after a few minutes they went away peacefully. I still remember that I had seen a miracle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="1-Kg8AAGhEG26HkD4G7XZw" hash="mPXNJA">From when I was older, I have a more recent memory of a crowd of angry people I was called by the First Presidency to face who suddenly and inexplicably were touched by a spirit of calm and reconciliation.</p>

My subject was to be: Why there was a need for a restoration of the true Church through Joseph Smith. I was a last-minute substitute for Elder Neal A. Maxwell.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="de3dU3saXEappLJ1Zcsu8w" hash="ebHXMQ">When I arrived in the city the night before the meetings and looked at the program, I called President Hinckley. I told him that the meetings were to last three days, that many talks were to be given at the same time, that the crowd could choose which one to attend. I told him that I thought if I told the truth, I feared that no one would come to my second session and that I might be coming home very quickly. I asked him what he thought I should do. He said, “Use your best judgment.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="VpTPLFgJ40S7dCK0wuLM8g" hash="f4rb0g">I prayed through the night. Somewhere near dawn, I was sure I was to say about the Restoration not, “This is what we believe happened to Joseph Smith and why we believe it happened,” but, “This is what happened to Joseph Smith, and this is why the Lord did it.” In the nighttime I was given no assurance of the outcome, just a clear direction—go forward.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="c5RMk8GLlkO5vYmeXRrv8Q" hash="t5zC7Q">To my amazement, after my talk the ministers lined up to speak to me. Every one of them, one after another coming to me, told essentially the same story. Each of them had met a member of the Church somewhere in their lives that they admired. Many of them said that they lived in a community where the stake president had come to the aid of not just his members but of the community in a disaster. They asked if I could take back their greeting and their thanks to people I not only didn’t know but had no hope of ever meeting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="ou-JChcF1Eez3Iv7HVy35Q" hash="lD2swQ">By the end of the three days of meetings, larger and larger crowds were coming to hear the message of the Restoration of the gospel and the true Church of Jesus Christ not because they believed the message but because they had seen goodness in people’s lives—the fruits of that restoration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="P9tpAmYauEyfe7gLxet9tQ" hash="WBDkXQ">As I prayed in these last few nights, those and other memories flooded back with an assurance something like this: “Haven’t I always looked after you? Think of the times I have led you beside the still waters. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="57"></span>Remember the times I have set a table before you in the presence of your enemies. Remember, and fear no evil.” (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/23.title" class="scriptureRef">Psalm 23</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="8ckqgtfQokGKyj-Ei11XVg" hash="fmznTQ">So to the new deacons: remember. He has always taken care of you from your childhood. To the new quorum presidents: remember. To you fathers with children who are a challenge to you: remember, and have no fear. What is impossible for you is possible with God’s help in His service. And even when you were very small and in the years since, He has with His power and His Spirit gone before your face and been on your left hand and on your right hand when you went in His service (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:88</a>). You can receive assurance that God will watch over you if you pray for it in faith. I know that.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="h8K7BhdJg0iiz9MQxKOLcg" hash="gqtQTg">The second part of the message you will receive as you pray for help in facing a hard assignment came to me very early Friday morning. I had prayed, as you will, about overwhelming inadequacies. The answer was very clear and very direct and really a rebuke as I prayed. “Forget yourself—start praying about the people you are to serve.” That does wonders, I can testify, to bring the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="WCabAcQpYkCMljI6t-m9mQ" hash="cMLO0w">But be prepared to lose track of time as you pray. You will feel love for the people you are to serve. You will feel their needs, their hopes, their hurts, and those of their families. And as you pray, the circle will grow wider than you would imagine, to perhaps people not in your quorum or your family but to those they love across the world. When you forget yourself to pray for the circle of others, your service will be extended in your heart. It will change not only your service but your heart. That is because the Father and His Beloved Son, whom you are called to serve, know and love so many people your service will touch, however limited to a few it may seem to be to you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="mc2CQLLaNEeCmVhuFD0C6w" hash="TJFGMQ">The third and final message you can watch for when you pray for help in a hard priesthood assignment is this one—I got this one as well—go to work. Priesthood power is given you to bless others. And that always takes moving out and doing something, usually something hard to do. So you can expect, in addition to assurance of God’s help and the command to forget yourself, the clear prompting by the Holy Ghost to go and do something which will bless someone’s life. That may be as obvious as going prayerfully to visit a person or a family or a quorum member to whom you are assigned to serve. For a father it may be to correct one of his children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="lbjT_ih8RE20RiZ8vhsZcg" hash="h9cMGQ">Whether what you do is to correct or to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ, you will do it better if you remember what success will be. You are to help Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, make eternal life possible for those you serve. To do that, the Spirit must take a testimony down into their hearts. And that testimony has to lead them to choose to keep the commandments of God, whatever storms and temptations may come.</p>

You will keep yourself clean so that you will teach with the Spirit. You will pray for the Spirit to tell you when to correct and how to correct and how to show an increase of love (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.43-44" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:43–44</a>). Whatever you do in your priesthood service can be guided and measured by how well it could or did help the person take a testimony of the truth down into his or her life and heart, enough for the Atonement to work and keep working.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="_p0ZV-Jwl0W-RFelxZRj6w" hash="NtUTxw">You can get assurance in your service. You can forget yourself and begin to pray for and love those you are to serve. And you can choose what to do and measure success by the degree to which it changes the hearts of the people you serve.</p>

There will always be pain in service and in the repentance necessary to bring the power of the Atonement to change hearts. That is in the nature of what you are called to do. Think of the Savior, whose service you are in. At what point in His mortal life can you see an instance when it was easy for Him? Did He ask easy things of His disciples then? Then why should it ever be easy in His service or for His disciples?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="YdLWQ7lZiU25AqoZ1D6mCQ" hash="-VEtzg">The reason for that is suggested by the phrase “a broken heart,” about which you have been taught so well today. The scriptures sometimes speak of people’s hearts being softened, but more often the words describing the state we seek for ourselves and for those we serve are a “broken heart.” This may help us accept that our call to serve and the need for the repentance we need and seek will not be easy. And it helps us understand better why testimony needs to go down into the hearts of our people. Faith that Jesus Christ atoned for their sins has to go down into the heart—a broken heart.</p>

All of us, whatever our callings may be, face tasks that are beyond our own powers. I do and you do. That’s true from the simple fact that success is to get testimony down into the hearts of people. We can’t make that happen. Even God won’t force that on anyone.</p>

The Spirit is ready. But many people aren’t ready to invite the Spirit. Our task, which <span class="emphasis">is</span> in our power, is to invite the Spirit into our lives so that people we serve will want to have the fruits of the Spirit in their lives—the fruits that they can see in ours.</p>

Some things we can do invite the Spirit. Some force the Spirit to withdraw. You know that from your own experience.</p>

Choosing to look at images which incite lust will cause the Spirit to withdraw. You have been warned by Elder Clayton as well as you may ever be warned about the dangers of the Internet and the media in putting pornographic images before us. But immodesty is now so common that everyday life requires discipline—a conscious choice not to linger watching whatever might create in us feelings which would repel the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/god-helps-the-faithful-priesthood-holder.p" pid="8nA9CenUgU6ydBO98e6Hhg" hash="F4MhUw">The same care is required in what we say. We cannot hope to speak for the Lord unless we are careful with our speech. Vulgarity and profanity offend the Spirit. Just as immodesty seems to be more common, so does vulgar and profane language. It used to be that only in certain places and with certain groups would we hear the name of the Lord taken in vain or hear vulgar words and crude humor. Now it seems to be everywhere and, for many, socially acceptable, where once it was not.</p>

But I know from my own experience that even in such a terrible situation you can count on God’s help. Years ago I was an air force officer serving for two years in an office with a marine colonel, an army colonel, and a grizzled navy commander. They had learned to speak in war and in peace in a way which offended me, and I know it repelled the Holy Ghost. I was at the time serving as a district missionary, trying in the evenings to go out to find people and teach them under the influence of the Holy Ghost. It was very hard. I was only a lieutenant. They were very senior to me. I had no way of changing their language. But I prayed for help. I don’t know how God did it, but in time their language changed. Slowly the profanity disappeared and then the vulgarity. Only when they drank liquor did it come back, but that was in the evenings, so I could excuse myself for missionary work.</p>

God helps the faithful priesthood holder who decides to see and say no evil, even in a wicked world. It will not be easy. It never is. But you can have the promise fulfilled for you as I know that it can be for me: “Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>).</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="66"></span>I was grateful for the choir in their broadcast this morning, which was about the Savior, and grateful to see that the words of one of the songs they sang, “This Is the Christ,” were written by President James E. Faust. As I sat down next to Brother Newell, I leaned over to him and asked, “How are your children?” He said, “When President Faust sat in that chair, that’s what he always asked.” I’m not surprised, because President Faust was always a perfect example of a disciple that was described in <span class="emphasis">Music and the Spoken Word</span> today. I always felt that when I grew up, I wanted to be like President Faust. There may still be time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="FGnvqmKPhEyHP-dSShDFpw" hash="ECNRbg">When our children were very small, I started to write down a few things about what happened every day. Let me tell you how that got started. I came home late from a Church assignment. It was after dark. My father-in-law, who lived near us, surprised me as I walked toward the front door of my house. He was carrying a load of pipes over his shoulder, walking very fast and dressed in his work clothes. I knew that he had been building a system to pump water from a stream below us up to our property.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="jiwcuO-_2kmY_LSElLq1UQ" hash="aucmGg">He smiled, spoke softly, and then rushed past me into the darkness to go on with his work. I took a few steps toward the house, thinking of what he was doing for us, and just as I got to the door, I heard in my mind—not in my own voice—these words: “I’m not giving you these experiences for yourself. Write them down.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="cKtDPYEHQEqecfsZvo7FDA" hash="KEuZRQ">I went inside. I didn’t go to bed. Although I was tired, I took out some paper and began to write. And as I did, I understood the message I had heard in my mind. I was supposed to record for my children to read, someday in the future, how I had seen the hand of God blessing our family. Grandpa <span class="pageBreak" page-number="67"></span>didn’t have to do what he was doing for us. He could have had someone else do it or not have done it at all. But he was serving us, his family, in the way covenant disciples of Jesus Christ always do. I knew that was true. And so I wrote it down, so that my children could have the memory someday when they would need it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="i1Ls3zH4p0uRYylWxMUzoQ" hash="82myrQ">I wrote down a few lines every day for years. I never missed a day no matter how tired I was or how early I would have to start the next day. Before I would write, I would ponder this question: “Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?” As I kept at it, something began to happen. As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="jDtHpX5g2UiakcMbYMAxmQ" hash="eD-i_A">More than gratitude began to grow in my heart. Testimony grew. I became ever more certain that our Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. I felt more gratitude for the softening and refining that come because of the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ. And I grew more confident that the Holy Ghost can bring all things to our remembrance—even things we did not notice or pay attention to when they happened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="Dmct9s3d2Ee2CiFoN1UMNA" hash="_2z7MQ">The years have gone by. My boys are grown men. And now and then one of them will surprise me by saying, “Dad, I was reading in my copy of the journal about when …” and then he will tell me about how reading of what happened long ago helped him notice something God had done in his day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="pn10GhY3VEqxRPtNZUw6DQ" hash="0ikEYw">My point is to urge you to find ways to recognize and remember God’s kindness. It will build our testimonies. You may not keep a journal. You may not share whatever record you keep with those you love and serve. But you and they will be blessed as you remember what the Lord has done. You remember that song we sometimes sing: “Count your many blessings; name them one by one, And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="2JhJLsXwh0GUnzyzNOxWbA" hash="Q0Qekw">It won’t be easy to remember. Living as we do with a veil over our eyes, we cannot remember what it was like to be with our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, in the premortal world; nor can we see with our physical eyes or with reason alone the hand of God in our lives. Seeing such things takes the Holy Ghost. And it is not easy to be worthy of the Holy Ghost’s companionship in a wicked world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="XwfxdbUrj0mO95n81218Yw" hash="043Abw">That is why forgetting God has been such a persistent problem among His children since the world began. Think of the times of Moses, when God provided manna and in miraculous and visible ways led and protected His children. Still, the prophet warned the people who had been so blessed, as prophets always have warned and always will: “Take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="MfhI7MF-uUuFRpMoSsypGQ" hash="AO1KkA">And the challenge to remember has always been the hardest for those who are blessed abundantly. Those who are faithful to God are protected and prospered. That comes as the result of <span class="pageBreak" page-number="68"></span>serving God and keeping His commandments. But with those blessings comes the temptation to forget their source. It is easy to begin to feel the blessings were granted not by a loving God on whom we depend but by our own powers. The prophets have repeated this lament over and over:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="_K1XMRNoWUi5WVcVT25nsg" hash="M0lnEQ">“And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="Ch890pxcbU6G37M7YDV0iA" hash="vnpQfA">“Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One—yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="IejxTpjghE6rnNimb3pqgw" hash="_FXL5g">And the prophet goes on to say: “Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="_MJsXrYmFkyOhoZ0H6xZiw" hash="6Y9UOg">Sadly, prosperity is not the only reason people forget God. It can also be hard to remember Him when our lives go badly. When we struggle, as so many do, in grinding poverty or when our enemies prevail against us or when sickness is not healed, the enemy of our souls can send his evil message that there is no God or that if He exists He does not care about us. Then it can be hard for the Holy Ghost to bring to our remembrance the lifetime of blessings the Lord has given us from our infancy and in the midst of our distress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="kBbFJ3HVqEej_NPtdO5DpQ" hash="Te2kag">There is a simple cure for the terrible malady of forgetting God, His blessings, and His messages to us. Jesus Christ promised it to His disciples when He was about to be crucified, resurrected, and then taken away from them to ascend in glory to His Father. They were concerned to know how they would be able to endure when He was no longer with them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="IzzP1_haj0uO3qRH2hSZKQ" hash="C6SSmw">Here is the promise. It was fulfilled for them then. It can be fulfilled for all of us now:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="UHRqcl2em0e7dydD7GLl0w" hash="E6wPug">“These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="PNUJb4nbb02t_LXJ-qP0Vg" hash="LCF6Eg">“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="lAZUUSTniE2aJNiG2G1vlg" hash="C3Cp-Q">The key to the remembering that brings and maintains testimony is receiving the Holy Ghost as a companion. It is the Holy Ghost who helps us see what God has done for us. It is the Holy Ghost who can help those we serve to see what God has done for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="e-VcvurrLUKGwrvFXv6jWw" hash="QibX9A">Heavenly Father has given a simple pattern for us to receive the Holy Ghost not once but continually in the tumult of our daily lives. The pattern is repeated in the sacramental prayer: We promise that we will always remember the Savior. We promise to take His name upon us. We promise to keep His commandments. And we are promised that if we do that, we will have His Spirit to be with us.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Those promises work together in a wonderful way to strengthen our testimonies and in time, through the Atonement, to change our natures as we keep our part of the promise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="0_i3S48x0EiIl_iyyc0DnA" hash="16znsw">It is the Holy Ghost who testifies that Jesus Christ is the Beloved Son of a Heavenly Father who loves us and wants us to have eternal life with Him in families. With even the beginning of that testimony, we feel <span class="pageBreak" page-number="69"></span>a desire to serve Him and to keep His commandments. When we persist in doing that, we receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost to give us power in our service. We come to see the hand of God more clearly, so clearly that in time we not only remember Him, but we come to love Him and, through the power of the Atonement, become more like Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="lWS4ccqgCUqsvn1CKx90hQ" hash="zyETnQ">You might ask, “But how does this process get started in someone who knows nothing about God and claims no memory of spiritual experiences at all?” Everyone has had spiritual experiences that they may not have recognized. Every person, upon entering the world, is given the Spirit of Christ. How that spirit works is described in the book of Moroni:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="z7A5HCgbbE6dJ_PfelfHqQ" hash="YLbTYA">“For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="Qm4D07qURUipGNZdYC-MhA" hash="6Jgy3g">“But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="SH9uTgtMPU6ekBWLlwBdLA" hash="L1ZDfA">“Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a child of Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="cCWF5ej4nECRwrsd3eLsTw" hash="D0XPVQ">So, even before people receive the right to the gifts of the Holy Ghost, when they are confirmed as members of the Church, and even before the Holy Ghost confirms truth to them before baptism, they have spiritual experiences. The Spirit of Christ has already, from their childhood, invited them to do good and warned them against evil. They have memories of those experiences even if they have not recognized their source. That memory will come back to them as missionaries or we teach them the word of God and they hear it. They will remember the feeling of joy or sorrow when they are taught the truths of the gospel. And that memory of the Spirit of Christ will soften their hearts to allow the Holy Ghost to testify to them. That will lead them to keep commandments and want to take the name of the Savior upon them. And when they do, in the waters of baptism, and as they hear the words in confirmation “Receive the Holy Ghost” spoken by an authorized servant of God, the power to always remember God will be increased.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="fischSC3Uk2K_BRb-B8wqA" hash="akVu0w">I testify to you that the warm feelings you have had as you have listened to truth being spoken in this conference are from the Holy Ghost. The Savior, who promised that the Holy Ghost would come, is the beloved, glorified Son of our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember.p" pid="E38LXRBxO0iBK-3g4RQV8Q" hash="KRCYUA">Tonight, and tomorrow night, you might pray and ponder, asking the questions: Did God send a message that was just for me? Did I see His hand in my life or the lives of my children? I will do that. And then I will find a way to preserve that memory for the day that I, and those that I love, will need to remember how much God loves us and how much we need Him. I testify that He loves us and blesses us, more than most of us have yet recognized. I know that is true, and it brings me joy to remember Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="123"></span>For each of us, life is a journey. Heavenly Father designed it for us out of love. Each of us has unique experiences and characteristics, but our journey began in the same place before we were born into this world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p2" pid="S3rzJfGLBUmdlun_0oKGlQ" hash="_qXe-g">We all were taught by Elohim, the Father of our spirits. We loved Him and wanted to be like Him and to be with Him forever. He told us plainly what it would require for us to have that joy. We would have to receive a physical body, with all of the trials that would bring. We would be subject to illness and have within our bodies the processes which would finally lead to death. And our bodies would have in them powerful cravings for physical satisfaction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p3" pid="sOc_vZZCYEyITWc-z3nG5A" hash="hiYLyA">Heavenly Father explained to us what it would take to make the journey from where we were then to be with Him forever and live the life that He lives. We would make the journey through life without a memory of our time with Him in the spirit world. And the only way back to Him would be for us to overcome physical death and the effects of sin which would come from our breaking commandments. He told us that we could not overcome the effects of either death or sin by ourselves—without our having a Savior who would break the bands of death and provide a way for us to be washed clean from the sin which we would surely commit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p4" pid="cBSR5fUSOEeUVM1yew-wCQ" hash="vrvs3w">You know from the scriptures revealed by God through prophets that there was a rebellion in the spirit world when the plan for our journey was offered to us. Those who rebelled did not want to accept and to depend upon a Savior nor run any risk that they might not return again to Heavenly Father. Every one of you was among the brave, the faithful, and the true in that conflict. You accepted the Savior and the plan for this journey to return to the joy of our Heavenly Father’s presence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p5" pid="k51msApQFEWOyoC2KiwKQg" hash="mIDEjg">You are remarkable, even among those who chose right in the contest in the spirit world. You qualified to come into mortality and to make this journey at a time when the gospel of Jesus Christ was on the earth. And among the billions of Heavenly Father’s children now living, you were privileged to find the gospel of Jesus Christ and His true Church. Even more than that, the fact that you are listening tonight means that you have chosen to make the journey of life walking in the light.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p6" pid="dvnmdYI-4kWPVpw3nuvXhw" hash="Db_uJQ">Every child of Heavenly Father born in the world is given at birth, as a free gift, the Light of Christ. You have felt that. It is the sense of what is right and what is wrong and what is true and what is false. That has been with you since your journey in life began. The fact that you were baptized and received the Holy Ghost is evidence that you chose to walk in the Light of Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p7" pid="Uhbw1R60W0OZboS1qyAkvg" hash="cF8Csw">When you were confirmed a member of the Church, you were given the right to have the Holy Ghost as your companion. The Holy Ghost is a powerful source of light to recognize truth, to follow and love the Lord Jesus Christ, and to find your way back to God after this life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p8" pid="LWAcONI30EO2ir6dfToW6w" hash="EmAU6Q">But the spirit who led the rebellion in the world before still opposes the plan and wants you to be miserable. He wants you never to find your way home again. That enemy of your soul knows you and your goodness. He knows that if he can turn you away from walking in the light, he can both capture you and stop you from helping others along the journey. He knows how good you are and your power to teach and influence hundreds of Heavenly Father’s children in this life—and thousands over the generations that will follow your path. If he can get you to wander away from the light on your journey, he can do harm and bring misery to many.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p9" pid="Scnfk8objUa9d_LGZKIe1A" hash="z_Tu6w">The fact that you are listening now is evidence that God recognizes your great importance and that you have chosen to walk in the light He offers you. Such choices are not always easy to see clearly. You make choices every day and almost every hour that keep you walking in the light or moving <span class="pageBreak" page-number="124"></span>away toward darkness. Some of the most important choices are about what you set your heart upon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p10" pid="8mcZj5ulQEympQ5O88r6Ow" hash="S4FLnw">There are so many things you may consider desirable. For instance, all of us want, to some degree, the approval of other people. All of us feel a need for friends. All of us are searching for some evidence that we are persons of worth. We make choices based on those desires. Some might lead us away from the light God offers us as a guide. Some may brighten that light by which we can find our way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p11" pid="D8d4akxIeE-sEga5kYaRSA" hash="3oROQw">As I look back, I realize that I was unaware of the importance of some of those desires and choices. I wanted to be selected for athletic teams. I wanted to do well in school. I wanted to find good and true friends. And when I made the choices that came from those desires, more than I realized, I was either moving away from the light or toward it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p12" pid="UTAoDSf9CEi_GWBDGHTiag" hash="Cs63iA">Some of my achievements and some of my friends were major factors in my sensing light. Others, more than I knew at the time, were edging me away from the light. In important and long-lasting ways, choices I made to satisfy my desires for companionship and a sense of recognition were taking me either toward or away from the light to guide my path.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/walk-in-the-light.p13" pid="OToY5rLQAE6ToY5WZGCDmQ" hash="rz_MfQ">Long ago Heavenly Father, through His prophets, gave us a way to know which choices matter most and why—and how to make them.</p>

There were friends, some of them not members of the Church of Jesus Christ, who by their example influenced me to do good and to remember the Savior.</p>

Just as you are marked as a target by the enemy of righteousness, you have been protected and watched over by your Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. They know you. They know all of the forces and individuals around you. They know what is ahead of you. And so They know which of the choices you make, which of the desires you decide to satisfy, and which of the circumstances around you will make the most difference in keeping you walking in the light. I testify that by the Spirit of Christ and by the Holy Ghost, you may walk confidently in whatever difficulties will come. Because you are so valuable, some of your trials may be severe. You need never be discouraged or afraid. The way through difficulties has always been prepared for you, and you will find it if you exercise faith.</p>

Todd Christofferson as an Apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, we have seen and felt evidence that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is both true and living. The Lord spoke to those through whom He restored the Church in the latter days. He said of them that they “might have power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not individually—</p>

The keys of the priesthood <span class="pageBreak" page-number="21"></span>are held by mortals, but the way has been prepared by the Lord for the keys to remain functioning on the earth so long as the people exercise faith both that the keys are on the earth and that they have been passed on by the will of God to His chosen servants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p8" pid="tReUW5-4p0eSa97hmagBYw" hash="xI12zw">God’s people have not always been worthy of the marvelous experience we have shared today. The Apostles, after the Ascension of Christ, continued to exercise the keys He left with them. But because of disobedience and loss of faith by the members, the Apostles died without the keys being passed on to successors. We call that tragic episode “the Apostasy.” Had the members of the Church in those days had the opportunity and the will to exercise faith as you have today, the Lord would not have taken the keys of the priesthood from the earth. So this is a day of historical significance and of eternal importance in the history of the world and to the children of our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p9" pid="lZ29LiINRkOnqZ1uBRkYqQ" hash="_xzjSQ">Now our obligation is to remain worthy of the faith necessary for us to fulfill our promise to sustain those who have been called. The Lord was well pleased with the Church at the beginning of the Restoration, as He is today. But He cautioned the members then, as He does now, that He cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance. For us to sustain those who have been called today, we must examine our lives, repent as necessary, pledge to keep the Lord’s commandments, and follow His servants. The Lord warns us that if we do not do those things, the Holy Ghost will be withdrawn, we will lose the light which we have received, and we will not be able to keep the pledge we have made today to sustain the Lord’s servants in His true Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p10" pid="wLGOAx5yx0mkWozbKgCWUQ" hash="Dwp3FA">Each of us must make an individual evaluation. First, we need to measure the depth of our gratitude for membership in the true Church of Jesus Christ. Second, we need to know by the power of the Holy Ghost in what ways we can do better in keeping the commandments.</p>

Our lives will be transformed for the better as we exercise faith unto repentance, always remember the Savior, and try ever harder to keep His commandments. The scriptures contain promises that when the Lord comes again to His Church, He will find it spiritually prepared for Him. That should make us both determined and optimistic. We must do better. We can. And we will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p12" pid="61dvXotIhU64l2VRPfjIVQ" hash="KwCmsQ">On this day especially it would be wise to determine to sustain with our faith and our prayers all those who serve us in the kingdom. I am personally aware of the power of the faith of members of the Church to sustain those who have been called. In the last few weeks I have felt in powerful ways the prayers and the faith of people whom I do not know and who know me only as someone called to serve through the keys of the priesthood. President Thomas S. Monson will be blessed by your sustaining faith. His family will likewise have blessings poured out upon them because of your faith and your prayers. All those who were sustained by you today will be sustained by God because of their faith and yours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p13" pid="Jbb2sKvMckeZLkdKHQnLAg" hash="2Cy2pg">Every member will have opportunities to sustain through service given in the name of God. The Church is a powerful force for the blessing of its members and all people across the earth. For instance, the Church has done remarkable humanitarian work across the earth. All of that is possible because of the faith of members and of friends that God lives and that the Lord wishes to succor all of those in need whom He can reach through His faithful disciples.</p>

This is a true and living Church, reaching even to those who are no longer living. As you have the faith to find the names of your ancestors, as you go to the house of the Lord to offer them vicarious ordinances, you sustain this great work, whose purpose is to offer salvation to all of Heavenly Father’s children who come into this world.</p>

I have felt forgiveness and cleansing through baptism by those with authority. I have felt the burning in my bosom that is only possible because of words spoken by servants of God: “Receive the Holy Ghost.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p17" pid="Psj1RvBi6kGiGSTiYiYSpw" hash="9YPlBw">My sense of gratitude stems also from blessings to my family. It is the sealing power and our knowledge of it which changes and transforms our family life here and our expectations for the joy of family life in the world to come. The thought and the hope that I can have eternal relationships carries me through the trials of separation and the loneliness which are part of mortal existence. The promise to the faithful in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that we may have associations and an expansion of families in the eternities. That assurance changes forever and for the better all of our associations in families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p18" pid="XIpSOYwIxEqWkZM3wGoWaQ" hash="VbN2Tg">For example, I am at a stage in my life when, because of great distances, I cannot come to know well grandchildren and, in time, great-grandchildren. There are also people who have never had the opportunity for marriage and parenthood who have the same yearning as I do to somehow be close to family. Because of the restoration of the knowledge of eternal families, we are more hopeful and more kindly in all our family relations. The greatest joys in this life center in families, as they will in the worlds to come. I am so grateful for the assurance I have that if we are faithful, the same sociality which we enjoy here in this life will be forever with us in the world to come, in eternal glory.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

For example, as I travel and come to know the members of the Church, I see that there is a steady improvement in their lives. In their simple faith and obedience, the Atonement is changing and edifying the members. Frequently I am in meetings with obviously humble people who are allowed to teach lessons and give sermons which have in them power like that given to Lehi and Nephi, the sons of Helaman. You remember the account:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p20" pid="zvZ_D-LZ5kO0dSWP-d-Uzw" hash="TD5nlg">“And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority, for they had power and authority given unto them that they might speak, and they also had what they should speak given unto them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p21" pid="fv45ICHwOEatoNzmxKRccg" hash="3xVmcg">I am confident that the repeated wish of President Gordon B. Hinckley will be granted. He taught that all who come into the Church might be retained in full fellowship if they are nourished by the good word of God. I remember him saying that the last words that he might speak at the end of his service would be “retention, retention, retention.” His words live on in the leadership of President Monson and in all of us as we qualify to have the power of a Lehi and a Nephi to nourish with the good word of God. I am confident that you will continue, as I will, to be amazed by humble Latter-day Saints who home teach, visit teach, and speak to their nonmember friends with ever greater power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p22" pid="hKNwtzwrnEyDIswSrr42ug" hash="9XopPQ">For years we have remembered the words of President David O. McKay: “Every member a missionary.” I am confident that the day is coming that through the faith of the members we will see increasing numbers of people invited to hear the word of God who will then come into the true and living Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p23" pid="P0w2L7QMtkWxnTEvsBKnSA" hash="ZgPUeg">There is another improvement I am confident will come. Families across the Church are searching for ways to strengthen and protect their children against the evils around them. In some cases those parents are desperately trying to bring back some in their family who have wandered. I am confident that there will be, increasingly, a reward given by God for their efforts. Those who never give up will find that God never gave up and that He will help them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p24" pid="zCBmVZ9Mw0KIVbaCuT3D2A" hash="datJAA">Much of that help will come from those called to serve in the Church. The spirit of reaching out will increase so that many will be as the young Bishop Thomas Monson was, inspired with practical ways to invite and encourage those who may, for a time, not recognize the blessings God has <span class="pageBreak" page-number="23"></span>in store for them. President Monson to this day remembers people he labored to rescue when he was their bishop. My hope would be that all of us would have the confidence that God will guide us in reaching out, and back, to those God would have us bring with us as we go home to Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p25" pid="6hCepcAbXUyEZ4zx6PJzNQ" hash="LBvObg">Another improvement I see coming in the kingdom is a desire and a capacity to reach out to the poor and those in need. I have seen an amazing increase among the members of the Church in sympathy for victims of natural disasters across the world. In obituary notices I see families asking that donations be sent to the Perpetual Education Fund or to the Church’s Humanitarian Fund.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p26" pid="UFLiBG0w-USo18mNus1mkg" hash="GUFKcA">The Prophet Joseph Smith saw that wonderful development. He said that as a person becomes truly converted, he or she will want to range across the earth caring for Heavenly Father’s children.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> That is already beginning to happen among more of the members of the Church. What is remarkable to me is that the pattern of giving to those in need extends to those who have less themselves and seems to be unaffected by whether we are in good or difficult economic times. That is evidence to me that the Atonement is working ever more effectively among the members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p27" pid="isqO9agRn0K07ItmgXp3rA" hash="en0ixg">My testimony that this is the true and living Church began in my childhood. One of my earliest memories is of a conference meeting held not in some place like this but in a rented room of a hotel. A man was speaking whom I did not know, nor do I know his name today. I knew only that he was someone sent to our little district in the mission field by someone who held the priesthood. I do not know what he said. But I received a powerful, certain witness before I was eight, even before I was baptized, that I was hearing a servant of God in the true Church of Jesus Christ. It was not the rental room nor the size of the congregation, which was small, but it was a witness that I had been blessed at that moment to be in a meeting of the true Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p28" pid="FPJJMQInKUaDgF-rPzvlEQ" hash="BkEeMQ">When I moved with my family to the organized stakes of the Church in my teen years, for the first time I felt the power of priesthood quorums and of a loving bishop. I still remember and can feel the assurances that came when I sat in a priests quorum next to a bishop and knew that he had the keys of a true judge in Israel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p29" pid="p9aLPPYRiUCOd8tecgCaRA" hash="7Q6eGw">That same witness came early in my life on two Sundays, one in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the other in Boston, Massachusetts. In each case I was present on the day that a stake was organized from a district. Seemingly ordinary men <span class="pageBreak" page-number="24"></span>whom I knew well were called as stake presidents. I raised my hand on those days as you did today and had a witness come to me that God had called His servants and that I would be blessed by their service and for sustaining them. I have now felt that same miracle countless times across the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p30" pid="aj-X1D_MHEWsUCMOydtTWA" hash="NDfVvQ">I saw in the days and months that followed their being sustained that those stake presidents were lifted up to their callings. I have seen the same miracle in the service of President Monson as he received the call to preside as the prophet and President of the Church and to exercise all the keys of the priesthood in the earth. Revelation and inspiration have come to him in my presence, which confirms to me that God is honoring those keys. I am an eyewitness. They are keys of a priesthood which is, in the Lord’s words, “without beginning or end.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-true-and-living-church.p31" pid="K0fotFaNyECdkwydwtZoNQ" hash="lZsczA">I bear you my solemn witness that this is the true and living Church of Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father will answer your fervent prayers to know that for yourself. You can have a witness that the calls which you sustained today were from God. Even more, you can know that within this Church, ordinances are performed which can cleanse souls and bind on earth and in heaven, as they were in the days of Peter, James, and John. Those keys and ordinances are now restored in their fulness through the Prophet Joseph Smith and have been passed on through his successors. Jesus is the Christ. He lives. I know that. I testify that Thomas S. Monson is His living prophet. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it lives on. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="61"></span>My purpose tonight is to help you grow in your confidence that you can and will rise to the blessings of the oath and covenant of the priesthood. It is the magnitude of the possible consequences of that oath and covenant which may require a regular boost in your confidence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p2" pid="CgT5wAVRwEO-hZ66pktW4A" hash="Oe5E4Q">The Lord has made those consequences clear. Rising to the possibilities of the oath and covenant brings the greatest of all the gifts of God: eternal life. That is a purpose of the Melchizedek Priesthood. Through keeping the covenants as we receive the priesthood and renewing them in the temple ceremonies, we are promised by an oath made by our Heavenly Father, Elohim, that we will gain the fulness of His glory and live as He lives. We will have the blessing of being sealed in a family forever with the promise of eternal increase.</p>

The Lord was clear about that as well. These are the words often read to young men by their leaders when they are approaching the time when they may receive the Melchizedek Priesthood. You likely will remember your feelings when you first heard them. They are the words of the Savior Jesus Christ given to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith:</p>

There are at least two reasons why you should be confident rather than discouraged with the penalties that would follow either failing to keep the oath and covenant or deciding not to accept it. Whether you accept the oath and covenant and find it too difficult or if you fail to try, the penalty is the same. There is no question, therefore, that your best course and mine is to receive the holy priesthood and try with all of our hearts to keep its covenants. If we choose not to try, we would certainly lose the opportunity for eternal life. If we try and with God’s help succeed, we will gain eternal life.</p>

God promises you the help and power which, if you exercise faith, will give you success.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="62"></span>Let me describe some of the blessings you will receive as you go forward in faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p16" pid="0lkT_5HT8Ua4s_xC6dJnZw" hash="5wRc3g">First, the very fact that you have been offered the oath and covenant is evidence that God has chosen you, knowing your power and capacity. He has known you since you were with Him in the spirit world. With His foreknowledge of your strength, He has allowed you to find the true Church of Jesus Christ and to be offered the priesthood. You can feel confidence because you have evidence of His confidence in you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/faith-and-the-oath-and-covenant-of-the-priesthood.p17" pid="hRvwef9G10u5db7XCNXXQQ" hash="7kMPmA">Second, as you will try to keep your covenants, the Savior has promised His personal help. He has said that as you go forward in honoring the priesthood: “There I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

The Lord foresaw your need for reassurance. He said, “For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

A friend of mine served as a mission president. He told me that at the end of every day while he was serving, he could barely make it upstairs to bed at night wondering if he would have the strength to face another day. Then in the morning, he would find his strength and his courage restored. You have seen it in the lives of aged prophets who seemed to be renewed each time they stood to testify of the Lord Jesus Christ and the restored gospel.

A young man hearing my words today can have confidence that by honoring his priesthood he will be protected against the temptation to sexual sin so prevalent in the world in which we live. It will be possible for the Aaronic Priesthood holder hearing me tonight, as his faith increases in the sure reward of eternal life through the eternal priesthood, that he will have the power to see in the daughters of God their true worth and in the promise of a posterity a reason to be pure and to stay clean.</p>

So have many of you. And so have many outside the Church. I was in the office of President Gordon B. Hinckley when he was asked to take a phone call. He spoke briefly on the phone and then returned to our conversation. But he took a moment to explain. He said that the call was from the president of the United States, who was flying over Utah in Air Force One on his way to Washington. The president of the United States had called to thank President Hinckley for what priesthood holders had done in the aftermath of a hurricane. The president of the United States had said that it was a miracle that we were able to get so many people, so quickly, working together so well. He praised our people by saying that we knew how to do things.</p>

That was part of the miracle. But the greater reason for the miracle was that hundreds and perhaps thousands of priesthood holders had such faith in the oath and covenant of the priesthood. It was not how they were organized that made the difference: faith in the oath and covenant of the priesthood impelled them to go long distances, stay long hours, and endure hardship as representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ in caring for those in great need.</p>

Those instances of priesthood service have occurred in our outreach to people, as brothers and sisters in God’s family across the earth, time and time again.</p>

You can do it in simple things. When you meet with your quorum, you can decide to see them as brothers in the family of God. There will be someone in your quorum or priesthood group who is in need. He may not show it. You may not be able to see it with your eyes. But God knows and invites you to be His servant in helping him.</p>

But he somehow found out about her illness and her great age. I cannot tell you how much it meant to me to see the hand of God reaching out to me and my wife in consolation and comfort through a priesthood holder. You can have that same effect every time you gather with priesthood holders if you always think of your covenant to succor and help those whose hands hang down and who carry heavy burdens. As you do, you will be developing the very qualities which will qualify you to be a member of a family forever.</p>

You can study the word of God, not for yourself alone but to be an emissary of the Lord Jesus Christ to all the world. When you increase your power to teach the gospel, you are qualifying to help Heavenly Father in gathering His children. As you do that, another blessing will come. Should the need ever come in family life in this world, or in the world to come, to draw back lost sheep, you will have received more power than you may now recognize.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="57"></span>My dear brethren, tonight I wish to encourage priesthood holders who at times feel overwhelmed with their responsibilities. That is a challenge I have spoken of before. I return to it because it returns so often in the lives of those I love and serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p2" pid="vwXImIUbskOKmEZW62_AhQ" hash="P2mcnw">Most of you have discovered that your priesthood duties will stretch you to the point that you wonder if you can stretch that far. It may have happened when you were asked to speak in a stake conference before hundreds of people. For the recent convert, it may have been being asked to pray in public or teach a class for the first time. For some, it may have been trying to learn a language in a missionary training center. If that didn’t take you to your limit, it surely did on the streets of a strange city when your mission president charged you to speak to every person you met to testify of the Savior and of the Restoration of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p3" pid="47WocoOf4kGHG7cWdvfrDg" hash="lAofyQ">You may have thought then, “Once I finish my mission, being a faithful priesthood holder will get easier.” But in a few years you found yourself getting even less sleep at night, while trying to support a wife and a new baby, being kind and loving, scrambling to get some education, reaching out to the members of your elders quorum, perhaps even helping them to move their furniture, and trying to find time to serve your ancestors in the temple. You may have kept a smile on your face with the thought: “When I get a little older, being a faithful priesthood holder will not require so much. It will get easier.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p4" pid="TPJiWxMiREaNO8d5QyfM7g" hash="CpzdmQ">Those of you further down the road are smiling because you know something about priesthood service. It is this: the more faithful service you give, the more the Lord asks of you. Your smile is a happy one because you know that He increases our power to carry the heavier load.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p5" pid="SsU_e79_ckGsPSmAwQLDIg" hash="jMngnA">The tough part of that reality, however, is that for Him to give you that increased power you must go in service and faith to your outer limits.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p6" pid="ph6bGT3uJkKHuFhLr5LPuA" hash="hem_vw">It is like building muscle strength. You must break down your muscles to build them up. You push muscles to the point of exhaustion. Then they repair themselves, and they develop greater strength. Increased spiritual strength is a gift from God which He can give when we push in His service to our limits. Through the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, our natures can be changed. Then our power to carry burdens can be increased more than enough to compensate for the increased service we will be asked to give.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p7" pid="GUJU_hqPw0WhdRDme1hdgw" hash="FTTKow">That helps me understand when I see someone else who makes priesthood service look easy. I know that they have either passed hard tests or that the tests lie ahead. So rather than envying them, I stand ready to help when the going gets harder for them, because it surely will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p8" pid="0yXIi1uO_kS_Z-0X9n-g7g" hash="mQ_eeA">That testing of our limits in priesthood service is made necessary by God’s plan to qualify His children to live with Him again forever. Heavenly Father loves His children. He offered us eternal life, to live with Him again in families and in glory forever. To qualify us to receive that gift, He gave us a mortal body, the opportunity to be tempted to sin, and a way to be cleansed from that sin and to rise in the First Resurrection. He gave us His Beloved Son, Jehovah, as our Savior to make that possible. The Savior was born in mortal life, was tempted but never sinned, and then in Gethsemane and on Golgotha paid the price of our sins so that we could be cleansed. The purifying can come only to those who have faith enough in Jesus Christ to repent of sin, be cleansed through the ordinance of baptism, and make and keep covenants to obey all His commandments. And there was to be a fierce enemy of our souls, Lucifer, who would with his legions relentlessly try to capture every child of God to keep him or her from having the joy of eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p9" pid="yUZx6mKOykm4NSEJSdhoDQ" hash="xY3-Rw">In His kindness and in great trust, Heavenly Father, with the Savior, allowed a selected few of His sons on earth to hold the priesthood. We have <span class="pageBreak" page-number="58"></span>the authority and the power to act in God’s name, to offer the true gospel of Jesus Christ and its ordinances to as many of Heavenly Father’s children as we can. So you can sense the magnitude of our trust from God. And you can sense its supreme importance and the opposition we face.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p10" pid="rlRSBHouqk6oyvS9bjB_fw" hash="_KpSyw">It is not surprising that we feel from time to time nearly overwhelmed. Your thought that “I’m not sure I can do this” is evidence that you are understanding what it means to hold the priesthood of God. The fact is that you can’t do it by yourself. The responsibility is too difficult and too important for your mortal powers and for mine. Recognizing that is at the foundation of great priesthood service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p11" pid="lyV-qPQAGkyKnEr0khH1cg" hash="dD3_sQ">When those feelings of inadequacy strike us, it is the time to remember the Savior. He assures us that we don’t do this work alone. There are scriptures to put on your mirror and to remember in the moments when you are doubting your capacity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p12" pid="TV9zKHZtSUqYEWdaYiW4Gg" hash="a2Cqhg">For instance, President Thomas S. Monson remembered the promised words of the Savior as he blessed me six months ago to stand fearlessly in my calling when it seemed hard. These words of the Savior, which He gave to His tiny band of priesthood holders in this dispensation, came to the prophet’s mind as he laid his hands on my head: “And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Confidence replaced doubt, the Spirit came, medical helpers were inspired, my life was preserved, and I was borne up. Because of that blessing by President Monson, it will always be easy for me to remember the Savior and trust His promise that He goes before and beside us in His service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p14" pid="0C1FYiNaN0ySzvyWmLXC2w" hash="tlEt3w">I know that the promise of angels to bear us up is real. You might want to bring to memory the assurance of Elisha to his frightened servant. That assurance is ours when we feel close to being overwhelmed in our service. Elisha faced real and terrible opposition:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p15" pid="nd2XIVdwaku35an7CNENCA" hash="jIkQTw">“And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p16" pid="0FLldpeeAUizdo6zXf8NRg" hash="-cDvTQ">“And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p17" pid="Uqma9v9PGUiKSl-CZm4oiQ" hash="7IdBcA">“And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p18" pid="ttJoCG0GBkqUpm2D9QsvjQ" hash="PNaECg">Like that servant of Elisha, there are more with you than those you can see opposed to you. Some who are with you will be invisible to your mortal eyes. The Lord will bear you up and will at times do it by calling others to stand with you. That is why we have quorums. That is why quorum leaders look at faces and into eyes in quorum meetings. That is why the bishop is more than presiding in the priests quorum. He is watching the faces of the priests. You will have such a bishop or such an elders quorum president or such a mission president. And he will come to help you and call others to stand with you. It may be to call the right companion to serve with you in your time of need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p19" pid="wUOXS6Gbg0-tHqiQXBtuiw" hash="sirs1A">That suggests at least two things. One is to recognize and welcome those whom the Lord sends to help us. The other is to see in every assignment the opportunity to strengthen another. A mission president once told me of a missionary he assigned <span class="pageBreak" page-number="59"></span>to more than 12 or 13 companions. He said to me, “Every one of those companions was about to go home early or be sent home. But we didn’t lose one of them.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p20" pid="1ahF-cVH7Em2MpUiVpOdGQ" hash="GWNHkQ">When I mentioned that miraculous fact later to the companion who saved so many at the point of their being overwhelmed, I got a response which surprised and taught me. It was this: “I don’t think that story is true. I never had a companion who was failing.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p21" pid="YKemPEtjNkqiRx3Reryx9g" hash="ooSLkg">I could see that a mission president had been inspired to send the right angel time after time. We can expect in our service to have help sent to us at the right time who will see strength in us and lift us up. And we can look forward to being the one sent by the Lord to encourage another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p22" pid="GkoIWwjUO0WDsc5uA1OCXg" hash="dIl5xw">I can tell you from experience something about how to help if you are the one sent. Shortly after I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve, I got a phone call from President Faust, counselor in the First Presidency. He asked me to come to his office. I went with some concern as to why he would take the time to visit with me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p23" pid="Bo5UN6OO5Eik0Ob90a8gYQ" hash="yM9Wsw">After some pleasantries, he looked at me and said, “Has it happened yet?” When I looked puzzled he went on to say, “I’ve been watching you in meetings. It seems to me that you have been feeling that your calling is beyond you and that you are not qualified.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p24" pid="DizKzPK2YEagoN0t7fV28Q" hash="ceI__A">I said that doubt had come to me, as if I had hit a wall. I expected that he was going to reassure me. I told him that I appreciated his being aware of my doubts and asked for his help. But I was surprised by his kind, firm reply. He said, “Don’t ask me. Go to Him.” Then he pointed up to heaven. Now years later I sit in that same office. When I walk into it I look up and remember him and how he taught me by example how to help those who are feeling overwhelmed in the Lord’s service. Find a way to send them with confidence to Him. If they will follow your counsel, they will gain the strength they need and to spare.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p25" pid="RFezGOUQBEqrUT9qmF4l-Q" hash="aXUTHg">Time and again over your life, the Lord has been giving you the experiences to build strength, courage, and determination. He knew how much you would need that to serve Him. Some of it may have come, as it did for me, when you stood with other priesthood holders and said aloud the words: “Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/o-ye-that-embark.p26" pid="EUmsFWtiuUCVtsTQ6AuIHA" hash="3oNqrQ">When you committed to that high standard and met it, the Lord was building a trust and strength in you that would be there when you needed it, whenever you were called to serve a cause higher than self-interest. I felt it one bright spring day on a lawn. I was being commissioned to defend my country. We were not then at war, but I was heading for an unknown service that I knew would require all I had to offer, perhaps my life. I raised my right hand with the others to pledge that I would defend my country with “true faith and allegiance” and that “I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

In my early years in the priesthood, I sat a number of <span class="pageBreak" page-number="60"></span>times in what was then called a “missionary farewell.” There are now so many rising to the call to serve that we let them speak only briefly in a sacrament meeting before they go. But then an entire meeting was focused on the missionary who was embarking. It always included some selected music. I can still feel what I felt as a quartet of returned missionaries would sing, “I’ll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,” and the words went on to pledge, “I’ll say what you want me to say,” and finally, “I’ll be what you want me to be.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

We will find joy in going wherever the Lord would have us serve. We will be given the revelation to speak His words to invite Heavenly Father’s children to become changed by the Atonement and fit to go home and live with Him. And I felt then as I do now that our faithful service would allow Him to change our hearts to fit us for His companionship and to serve Him forever.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="68"></span>My beloved brothers and sisters, it is a joy to be gathered with you on this Sabbath morning. We live in many different circumstances. We will come from every nation and many ethnic backgrounds into the kingdom of God. And that prophesied gathering will accelerate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p2" pid="jA5tJT6RPEeOf1wN2WEguw" hash="6UkctQ">We see increased conflict between peoples in the world around us. Those divisions and differences could infect us. That is why my message of hope today is that a great day of unity is coming. The Lord Jehovah will return to live with those who have become His people and will find them united, of one heart, unified with Him and with our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p3" pid="TwJ-VAVJUEWVxntLHsYWuA" hash="pg-N1w">You have heard that message of unity from me more than once. I may well speak of it in the future. I have heard it from every prophet of God in my lifetime. A plea for unity was the last message I remember from President David O. McKay. The Lord’s prophets have always called for unity. The need for that gift to be granted to us and the challenge to maintain it will grow greater in the days ahead, in which we will be prepared as a people for our glorious destiny.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p4" pid="dB8eYt0RJEK7kmgeK1OzcA" hash="12J4rg">My message is that we are doing better. Fathers and mothers are pleading for unity in their homes, and those prayers are being answered. Families are praying together night and morning. I was invited to kneel at bedtime with a family when I was a guest in their home. The smallest child was asked to be voice. He prayed like a patriarch for every person in the family, by name. I opened my eyes for an instant to see the faces of the other children and the parents. I could tell that they were joining their faith and their hearts in that little boy’s prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p5" pid="bhkKEVqlik-3wG9C-aTojw" hash="52ZKUg">Some Relief Society sisters recently prayed together as they prepared to visit for the first time a young widow whose husband died suddenly. They wanted to know what to do and how to work together to help prepare the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="69"></span>home for family and friends who would come at the time of the funeral. They needed to know what words of comfort they could speak for the Lord. An answer to their prayer came. When they arrived at the house, each sister moved to complete a task. The house was ready so quickly that some sisters regretted not being able to do more. Words of comfort were spoken which fit perfectly together. They had given the Lord’s service as one, hearts knit together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p6" pid="kjUZqP72z06cK5LjizfZ3g" hash="CUUrvg">You have seen evidence, as I have, that we are moving toward becoming one. The miracle of unity is being granted to us as we pray and work for it in the Lord’s way. Our hearts will be knit together in unity. God has promised that blessing to His faithful Saints whatever their differences in background and whatever conflict rages around them. He was praying for us as well as His disciples when He asked His Father that we might be one.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p7" pid="DcBXgw2KAEqU0GFY3oOTag" hash="LkzQiw">The reason that we pray and ask for that blessing is the same reason the Father is granting it. We know from experience that joy comes when we are blessed with unity. We yearn, as spirit children of our Heavenly Father, for that joy which we once had with Him in the life before this one. His desire is to grant us that sacred wish for unity out of His love for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p8" pid="ISQFthjdcUugHcj2ItshBA" hash="k3Xs9A">He cannot grant it to us as individuals. The joy of unity He wants so much to give us is not solitary. We must seek it and qualify for it with others. It is not surprising then that God urges us to gather so that He can bless us. He wants us to gather into families. He has established classes, wards, and branches and commanded us to meet together often. In those gatherings, which God has designed for us, lies our great opportunity. We can pray and work for the unity that will bring us joy and multiply our power to serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p9" pid="qzu0EXhVa0SlQ5vlAEgNrw" hash="xK2lNg">To the Three Nephites, the Savior promised joy in unity with Him as their final reward after their faithful service. He said, “Ye shall have fulness of joy; and ye shall sit down in the kingdom of my Father; yea, your joy shall be full, even as the Father hath given me fulness of joy; and ye shall be even as I am, and I am even as the Father; and the Father and I are one.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

The Book of Mormon recounts a time of success. It was in the days of Alma at the Waters of Mormon. What the people did in those difficult and dangerous circumstances gives us both a guide and encouragement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p11" pid="YCEhBrSbz0WsywmOAPlngA" hash="OE1EAA">Everything Alma and his people were inspired to do was pointed at helping people choose to have their hearts changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. That is the only way God can grant the blessing of being of one heart.</p>

That is why my children came to expect in every lesson in family night that I would find a way to encourage someone to testify of the Savior and His mission. Sometimes the parents did it. On our best nights we found a way to encourage the children to do it, either by presenting the lesson or answering questions. When testimony about the Savior was borne, the Holy Ghost verified it. On those nights we felt our hearts being knit together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p19" pid="6f_VkejRHE-nBTfjUBx8dw" hash="lcHKQA">In addition to ordinances there are principles we are following as a people which are leading to greater unity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p20" pid="7msOd-inqUadMT6sTqOlSw" hash="Sj89sA">One of those principles is revelation. Revelation is the only way we can know how to follow the will of the Lord together. It requires light from above. The Holy Ghost will testify to our hearts, and the hearts of those gathered around with us, what He would have us do. And it is by keeping His commandments that we can have our hearts knit together as one.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p21" pid="wYtJNObCTEG2GZhKIy6RXQ" hash="guaI4w">A second principle to guide our progress to become one is to be humble. Pride is the great enemy of unity. You have seen and felt its terrible effects. Just days ago I watched as two people—good people—began with a mild disagreement. It started as a discussion of what was true but became a contest about who was right. Voices became gradually louder. Faces became a little more flushed. Instead of talking about the issue, people began talking about themselves, giving evidence why their view, given their great ability and background, was more likely to be right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p22" pid="b9HsY_HFNUuSU9wg85ZR_g" hash="XopYdQ">You would have felt alarm as I did. We have seen the life-destroying effects of such tragic conflict. You and I know people who left the fellowship of the Saints over injured pride.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p23" pid="xOzTuIdzBUyp7R6HGnekAA" hash="oW5mkA">Happily I am seeing more and more skillful peacemakers who calm troubled waters before harm is done. You could be one of those peacemakers, whether you are in the conflict or an observer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p24" pid="q90P01GfIk2VmmUZ4RffHQ" hash="RuPrQA">One way I have seen it done is to search for anything on which we agree. To be that peacemaker, you need to have the simple faith that as children of God, with all our differences, it is likely that in a strong position we take, there will be elements of truth. The great peacemaker, the restorer of unity, is the one who finds a way to help people see the truth they share. That truth they share is always greater and more important to them than their differences. You can help yourself and others to see that common ground if you ask for help from God and then act. He will answer your prayer to help restore peace, as He has mine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p25" pid="GPfr_EwpHUKM2J_cP9wgbA" hash="TEbo3w">That same principle applies as we build unity with people who are from vastly different backgrounds. The children of God have more in common than they have differences. And even the differences can be seen as an opportunity. God will help us see a difference in someone else not as a <span class="pageBreak" page-number="71"></span>source of irritation but as a contribution. The Lord can help you see and value what another person brings which you lack. More than once the Lord has helped me see His kindness in giving me association with someone whose difference from me was just the help I needed. That has been the Lord’s way of adding something I lacked to serve Him better.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p26" pid="p0WbJ8_EAE271PYO3NFP7Q" hash="0Fa9ow">That leads to another principle of unity. It is to speak well of each other. Think of the last time you were asked what you thought about how someone else was doing in your family or in the Church. It happened to me more than once in the past week. Now, there are times we must judge others. Sometimes we are required to pronounce such judgments. But more often we can make a choice. For instance, suppose someone asks you what you think of the new bishop.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p27" pid="beWJ5aP_iUaZOGgswzjOFQ" hash="kioegg">As we get better and better at forging unity, we will think of a scripture when we hear that question: “And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by which ye may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully; for with that same judgment which ye judge ye shall also be judged.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p28" pid="iLSPXBjpcUKLKBTN0fo5bg" hash="imj8ow">Realizing that you see others in an imperfect light will make you likely to be a little more generous in what you say. In addition to that scripture, you might remember your mother saying—mine did—“If you can’t say anything good about a person, don’t say anything at all.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p29" pid="NRAAzptveE6OFxXoh0zLaA" hash="jtDm4g">That will help you look for what is best in the bishop’s performance and character. The Savior, as your loving judge, will surely do that as He judges your performance and mine. The scripture and what you heard from your mother may well lead you to describe what is best in the bishop’s performance and his good intent. I can promise you a feeling of peace and joy when you speak generously of others in the Light of Christ. You will feel, for instance, unity with that bishop and with the person who asked your opinion, not because the bishop is perfect or because the person asking you shares your generous evaluation. It will be because the Lord will let you feel His appreciation for choosing to step away from the possibility of sowing seeds of disunity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p30" pid="vldM4Cif5E-eTbF25sQAcg" hash="jiJkuw">We must follow that same principle as the Lord gathers more and more people who are not like us. What will become more obvious to us is that the Atonement brings the same changes in all of us. We become disciples who are meek, loving, easy to be entreated, and at the same time fearless and faithful in all things. We still live in different countries, but we come into the Church through a process that changes us. We become by the gifts of the Spirit what the Apostle Paul saw:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p31" pid="io9GBjX8g06YMoySnRBL9Q" hash="aCT66w">“For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</p>

The Saints can accomplish any purpose of the Lord when fully united in righteousness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p34" pid="gy9sOaLUFki0m_ZAFN_ARA" hash="AE7vLg">Presidents of countries, governors, and leaders of worldwide charitable organizations have praised us—in my hearing—with words like these: “Your church was the first on the ground to help when disaster came. Hundreds of your people arrived who brought everything with them which the survivors needed. They even brought their own tents and supplies. They were tireless and cheerful. They seemed to know where to go and when.” Then there has come a line usually something like this: “Your church knows how to organize to get things done.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p35" pid="jpexWKG7-ECE31nA_CrsEA" hash="yMCUVw">I thank them without saying that the miracle lies not in organization alone, but in the people’s hearts. The Saints came in the name of the Lord to give the succor He would give. They came listening to the direction of the Lord’s chosen leaders. Because their hearts were knit, they were magnified in their power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one.p36" pid="FvGSWrmcN02WCm7wuyqX9Q" hash="vtrAjA">I bear you my solemn witness that the unity we now experience will increase. God the Father lives. He hears and answers our prayers in love. The Savior Jesus Christ, resurrected and glorious, lives and reaches out to us in mercy. This is His true Church. President Monson is the living prophet of God. If we are united in sustaining him with all our hearts, with willing obedience to do what God would have us do, we will move together in power to go wherever God would have us go and to become what He wants us to be.</p>

Particularly when the comfortable times have gone on for a while, the arrival of suffering or the loss of material security can bring fear and sometimes even anger.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p3" pid="bM2zGaB7w0Sz_KD_ykx9kg" hash="heYIqA">The anger comes at least in part from a feeling that what is happening is unfair. The good health and the serene sense of being secure can become to seem deserved and natural. When they vanish, a feeling of injustice can come. Even a brave man I knew wept and cried out in his physical suffering to those who ministered to him: “I have always tried to be good. How could this happen?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p4" pid="vA_O70tudkWIETym6tmJTw" hash="3mutxA">That aching for an answer to “How could this happen?” becomes even more painful when those struggling include those we love. And it is especially hard for us to accept when those afflicted seem to us to be blameless. Then the distress can shake faith in the reality of a loving and all-powerful God. Some of us have seen such doubt come to infect a whole generation of people in times of war or famine. Such doubt can grow and spread until some may turn away from God, whom they charge with being indifferent or cruel. And if unchecked, those feelings can lead to loss of faith that there is a God at all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p5" pid="PS0Cjk2-QUubt6PgD3iD9A" hash="N46fmg">My purpose today is to assure you that our Heavenly Father and the Savior live and that They love all humanity. The very opportunity for us to face adversity and affliction is part of the evidence of Their infinite love. God gave us the gift of living in mortality so that we could be prepared to receive the greatest of all the gifts of God, which is eternal life. Then <span class="pageBreak" page-number="24"></span>our spirits will be changed. We will become able to want what God wants, to think as He thinks, and thus be prepared for the trust of an endless posterity to teach and to lead through tests to be raised up to qualify to live forever in eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p6" pid="AzW7wiPzJkOiSaB_P7QiHg" hash="3mr3KQ">It is clear that for us to have that gift and to be given that trust, we must be transformed through making righteous choices where that is hard to do. We are prepared for so great a trust by passing through trying and testing experiences in mortality. That education can come only as we are subject to trials while serving God and others for Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p7" pid="6xIvMj8aIEi-yzRmGBqCLQ" hash="qai49g">In this education we experience misery and happiness, sickness and health, the sadness from sin and the joy of forgiveness. That forgiveness can come only through the infinite Atonement of the Savior, which He worked out through pain we could not bear and which we can only faintly comprehend.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p8" pid="Jxl8aKnyiEmAfhT2e3et1g" hash="t-eOHA">It will comfort us when we must wait in distress for the Savior’s promised relief that He knows, from experience, how to heal and help us. The Book of Mormon gives us the certain assurance of His power to comfort. And faith in that power will give us patience as we pray and work and wait for help. He could have known how to succor us simply by revelation, but He chose to learn by His own personal experience. Here is the account from Alma:</p>

He knows that hundreds of thousands of people with exactly his skills are looking desperately for work to feed their families. His quiet confidence led me to ask him what he had done to become so confident that he would find a way to support his family. He said he had examined his life to be sure that he had done all he could to be worthy of the Lord’s help. It was clear that his need and his faith in Jesus Christ were leading him to be obedient to God’s commandments when it is hard to do. He said that he saw that opportunity as he and his wife were reading in Alma where the Lord had prepared a people to find the gospel through adversity.</p>

He had begun to prepare his heart to be worthy of the Lord’s help which he knew he would in the near future need. When I asked his wife on the day he lost his job if she was worried, she said with cheerfulness in her voice, “No, we’ve just come from the bishop’s office. We are full-tithe payers.” Now, it is still too early to tell, but I felt assured as they seemed to be assured: “Things will work out.” Tragedy did not erode their faith; it tested it and strengthened it. And the feeling of peace the Lord has promised has already been delivered in the midst of the storm. Other miracles are sure to follow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p29" pid="es4s1LgiQ02lUWxBnChtpQ" hash="egzxmA">The Lord always suits the relief to the person in need to best strengthen and purify him or her. Often it will come in the inspiration to do what might seem especially hard for the person who needs help himself. One of the great trials of life is losing to death a beloved husband or wife. President Hinckley described the hurt when Sister Hinckley was no longer at his side. The Lord knows the needs of those separated from loved ones by death. He saw the pain of widows and knew of their needs from His earthly experience. He asked a beloved <span class="pageBreak" page-number="26"></span>Apostle, from the agony of the cross, to care for His widowed mother, who would now lose a son. He now feels the needs of husbands who lose their wives and the needs of wives who are left alone by death.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p30" pid="glPBQvGjT06cixpj0SqtcQ" hash="N-AC6A">Most of us know widows who need attention. What touches me is to hear, as I have, of an older widow whom I was intending to visit again having been inspired to visit a younger widow to comfort her. A widow needing comfort herself was sent to comfort another. The Lord helped and blessed two widows by inspiring them to encourage each other. So He gave succor to them both.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p31" pid="5-d9xTATVkCPTc5wdp6nQQ" hash="mTp8PQ">The Lord sent help in that same way to the humble poor in <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34</a> who had responded to the teaching and testimony of His servants. Once they had repented and were converted, they were still poor. But He sent them to do for others what they might reasonably have thought was beyond them and which they still needed. They were to give others what they would have hoped He would give them. Through His servant, the Lord gave these poor converts this hard task: “After ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need—I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p32" pid="28ZsjTlIJUKXW6zet5l9mw" hash="s1pPtQ">That may seem much to ask of people in such great need themselves. But I know one young man who was inspired to do that very thing early in his marriage. He and his wife were barely getting by on a tiny budget. But he saw another couple even poorer than they were. To the surprise of his wife, he gave help to them from their scanty finances. A promised blessing of peace came while they were still in their poverty. The blessing of prosperity beyond their fondest dreams came later. And the pattern of seeing someone in need, someone with less or in pain, has never ceased.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p33" pid="j5l5p0YAgUK7_FsLBpyqCA" hash="2MX4yw">There is yet another trial which, when endured well, can bring blessings in this life and blessings forever. Age and illness can test the best of us. My friend served as our bishop when my daughters were still at home. They speak of what they felt when he bore his simple testimony around campfires in the mountains. He loved them, and they knew it. He was released as our bishop. He had served as a bishop before in another state. Those I have met who were from his earlier ward remember him as my daughters do.</p>

His health began a slow decline. I can’t remember all the ailments he suffered. He needed surgery. He was in constant pain. Yet every time I visited him to give him comfort, he turned the tables; I always was the one comforted. His back and legs forced him to use a cane to walk. Yet there he was in church, always sitting near the door, where he could greet those arriving early, with a smile.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p35" pid="z-9jgXseuUuIMj-1Qx7rXw" hash="g9kE5A">I will never forget the feeling of wonder and admiration which came over me when I opened the back door at home and saw him coming up our driveway. It was the day we put out our garbage cans to be picked up by city workers. I had put the can out in the morning. But there he was dragging my garbage can up the hill with one hand while he balanced himself with a cane in his other hand. He was giving me the help he thought I needed when he needed it far more than I did. And he was helping with a smile and without being asked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/adversity.p36" pid="_5Nrn-HJ6UefeKfGmX3KDw" hash="MyXkHw">I visited him when he finally had to be cared for by nurses and doctors. He was lying in a hospital bed, still in pain and still smiling. His wife had called me to say that he was getting weaker. My son and I gave him a priesthood blessing as he lay in the bed with tubes and bottles connected to him. I sealed the blessing with a promise that he would have time and the strength to do all that God had for him to do in this life, to pass every test. He stretched out his hand to grasp mine as I stepped away from his bed to leave. I was surprised at the strength of his grip and the firmness in his voice when he said, “I’m going to make it.”</p>

He was gone to the glorious place where he will see the Savior, who is his perfect judge and will be ours.

His Atonement makes possible our being purified as we keep His commandments and our sacred covenants. And I know from my own experience that He can and will give us strength to rise through every trial. President Monson is the Lord’s prophet. He holds all the keys of the priesthood. This is the Lord’s true Church in which we are, with Him, lifting each other and being blessed to succor the fellow sufferers He places in our way. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="63"></span>I am grateful for the honor and the blessing of speaking to the priesthood of God. My purpose tonight is to help you to be brave and bold in your priesthood service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p2" pid="WCPQpw7cKE2YU5SHqTMurQ" hash="WGDjCA">You will need bravery and you will need boldness because you are enlisted in the Lord’s army in the last dispensation. This is not a time of peace. That has been so since Satan arrayed his forces against our Heavenly Father’s plan in the premortal existence. We don’t know the details of the combat then. But we know one result. Satan and his followers were cast down into the earth. And since the creation of Adam and Eve, the conflict has continued. We have seen it intensify. And the scriptures suggest that the war will become more violent and the spiritual casualties on the Lord’s side will mount.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p3" pid="ywFsW8mAx0WbCDAfGm4gkw" hash="j5bfsA">Almost all of us have seen a battlefield portrayed in a film or read the description in a story. Over the din of explosions and the shouts of soldiers, there comes a cry, “Man down!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p4" pid="cz-hzuWC0kisl5Svc3n-fQ" hash="6UBeUA">When that cry sounds, faithful fellow soldiers will move toward the sound. Another soldier or a medic will ignore danger and move to the injured comrade. And the man down will know that help will come. Whatever the risk, someone will run low or crawl to get there in time to protect and give aid. That is true in every band of men joined in a difficult and dangerous mission which they are determined to fulfill at any sacrifice. The histories of such groups are full of stories of those loyal men who were determined that no man would be left behind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p5" pid="H9jM6Bhbl0ixvtJHADpVPA" hash="SUh6nw">Here is one instance from an official account.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> During fighting in Somalia in October of 1993, two United States Army Rangers in a helicopter during the firefight learned that two other helicopters near them had fallen to the earth. The two rangers, in their relative safety aloft, learned by radio that no ground forces were available to rescue one of the downed aircrews. Growing numbers of the enemy were closing in on the crash site.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p6" pid="L_3-ICVR2ESBCMUVZxz9qA" hash="_B2HJg">The two men watching from above volunteered to go down to the ground (the words they used on the radio were to “be inserted”) to protect their critically wounded comrades. Their request was denied because the situation was so dangerous. They asked a second time. Permission was again denied. Only after their third request were they put down on the ground.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p7" pid="rS-Qkz4jo0y-xQKJlPNXQw" hash="2-CtZA">Armed only with their personal weapons, they fought their way to the crashed helicopter and the injured fliers. They moved through intense small arms fire as enemies converged on the crash site. They pulled the wounded from the wreckage. They put themselves in a perimeter around the wounded, placing themselves in the most dangerous positions. They protected their comrades until their ammunition was depleted and they were fatally wounded. Their bravery and their sacrifice saved the life of a pilot who would have been lost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p8" pid="i-5h4wuFTkSkqb3S0Slqqw" hash="zQt2iw">They were each awarded posthumously the Medal of Honor, their nation’s highest recognition for bravery in the face of an armed enemy. The citation reads that what they did was “above and beyond the call of duty.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p9" pid="s0V5q9Zx7UO8oIFsJimSWA" hash="2QrAiA">But I wonder if they saw it that way as they moved to the downed airmen. Out of loyalty they felt a duty to stand by their fellow soldiers, whatever the cost. The courage to act and their selfless service came from feeling that they were responsible for the lives, the happiness, and the safety of comrades.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p10" pid="U6umT7hPYUyabza1vWWgkg" hash="x25Thg">Such a feeling of responsibility for others is at the heart of faithful priesthood service. Our comrades are being wounded in the spiritual conflict around us. So are the people we are called to serve and protect from harm. Spiritual wounds are not easily visible, except with inspired eyes. But bishops, branch presidents, and mission presidents sitting before fellow disciples of the Savior can see the wounded and the wounds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p11" pid="_IvmuCnM40GqW8D13_FcfQ" hash="vTFZ2Q">It has happened for years and across the earth. I remember as a bishop looking out at the face and the posture of a young man of the priesthood and having the thought come to my mind so clearly that it seemed <span class="pageBreak" page-number="64"></span>audible: “I need to see him—and soon. Something is happening. He needs help.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p12" pid="0m7FeCX6oEuHNuwGBs3hQQ" hash="uXKL8w">I would never put off such an impression because I had learned that the wounds of sin are often not felt at first by the one being hurt. Satan seems sometimes to inject something to deaden the spiritual pain while inflicting the wound. Unless something happens soon to begin repentance, the wound can worsen and widen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p13" pid="tBFuZkGw-kG-sTrMAFixgQ" hash="eexdOA">Consequently, as a priesthood holder responsible for the spiritual survival of some of Heavenly Father’s children, you will then move to help without waiting for a cry, “Man down!” Even a best friend or other leaders or parents may not see what you have seen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p14" pid="1qiY2Ljbg0uA6zi8h3NY8w" hash="iLcNfA">You may have been the only one to sense by inspiration the warning cry. The others may feel, as you will be tempted to think, “Maybe the trouble I thought I saw is just my imagination. What right do I have to judge another? It’s not my responsibility. I’ll leave it alone until he asks for help.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p15" pid="NrQ8G8aNDkG-qemqOaxQzw" hash="dnlKYg">Only an authorized judge in Israel is given the power and the responsibility to verify that there is a serious wound, to explore it, and then, under inspiration from God, to prescribe the necessary treatment for healing to begin. Yet you are under covenant to go to a spiritually wounded child of God. You are responsible to be brave enough and bold enough not to turn away.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p16" pid="ICAMkJCLnk-fCQMf0nZ49A" hash="t_S0pw">I need to explain, as best I can, at least two things. First, why do you have a responsibility to move to help your wounded friend? And, second, how do you meet that responsibility?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p17" pid="WfS0Bi6CiUul632J4kAm4A" hash="xdMJwQ">First, you are under covenant, as has been made clear to you, that when you accepted the trust from God to receive the priesthood, you accepted a responsibility for whatever you might do or fail to do for the salvation of others however difficult and dangerous that might appear to be for you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p18" pid="ty7B7LoNvUqlAOEUgHIiwA" hash="jLmP1w">There are countless examples of priesthood holders who shouldered that grave responsibility as you and I must. This is how Jacob in the Book of Mormon described his sacred trust when he moved in difficult circumstances to give aid: “Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the responsibility which I am under to God, to magnify mine office with soberness, and that I might rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple this day that I might declare unto you the word of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

But your office, whatever it is in the priesthood, brings with it an obligation to “lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> of those around you. You are the Lord’s servant covenanted to do for others, as best you can, what He would do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p20" pid="thX921KbOUyw3Q0tgVqyCw" hash="h9PY7w">Your great opportunity and your responsibility are described in Ecclesiastes:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p21" pid="vOSQLUdohkGa-ELQmZzm9w" hash="OjSZPw">“Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</p>

Your happiness and that of those you are called to serve as a priesthood holder are bound together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p24" pid="G3Pq5EOduEWislp92HOx_Q" hash="FMkfVg">Now, we come to the question of how best to help those you are called to serve and rescue. That will depend on your capacities and on the nature of your priesthood relationship to the person who is in spiritual peril. Let me give three cases which may be your opportunity at times in your priesthood service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p25" pid="3I8zIvTnfUKM7RbZTXrmDg" hash="ABNtGA">Let’s start when you are an inexperienced junior companion, a teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood assigned with a seasoned companion to visit a young family. Before preparing for the visit you will pray for strength and inspiration to see their needs and know what help you could give. If you can, you will have that prayer with your companion, naming those you will visit. As you pray your heart will be drawn out to them personally and to God. You and your companion will agree on what you hope to accomplish. You will work out a plan for what you will do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p26" pid="ZYuUQZxXzEW4J3pE7-GxaQ" hash="Rcf2fQ">Whatever the plan, you will watch and listen with great intensity and humility during the visit. You are young and inexperienced. But the Lord knows their spiritual state and their needs perfectly. He loves them. And because you know He sends you to act for Him, you can have faith that you can sense their needs and what you can do to meet your charge to help. It will come as you visit face-to-face in their home. That is why you have this priesthood charge in the Doctrine and Covenants: “Visit the house of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p27" pid="mRufXGifXk2QaF1FUaEEGA" hash="vdCDDQ">And then you have an added charge which takes even greater discernment:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p28" pid="ZVJHkrhoKkehZStqO8nryw" hash="vGsECA">“The teacher’s duty is to watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p29" pid="lt096N-o-0CMRbSD9fLSPg" hash="WD4W-w">“And see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p30" pid="NROUE6LLI0SeTaE-u-DI-A" hash="CLSpyA">“And see that the church meet together often, and also see that all the members do their duty.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p31" pid="TibcsR_zUEmCBMp4eI5dCw" hash="lZPhVw">You and your companion will rarely receive inspiration to know the details of the degree to which they are meeting that standard. But I can promise you from experience that you will be given the gift to know what is well with them. And from that you will be able to encourage them. There is another promise I can make: you and your companion will be inspired to know what changes they could make to begin the spiritual healing they need. The words of what you are charged to have happen in their lives will almost certainly contain some of the most important changes the Lord would have them make.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p32" pid="PFZ0WgdGk0-9wGhOwQumVw" hash="hMofoQ">If your companion feels an impression to urge change, watch what he does. You will likely be surprised at the way the Spirit guides him to speak. There will be the sound of love in his voice. He will find a way to tie the needed change with a blessing that will follow. If it is the father or mother who needs to make a change, he may show how it would lead to happiness for the children. He will describe the change as a move away <span class="pageBreak" page-number="66"></span>from unhappiness to a better and safer place.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p33" pid="n_CIVQo9gUSg6Pvy2VE6iA" hash="jG9Lqg">Your contribution during the visit may seem to you small, but it can be more powerful than you may think possible. You will show by your face and manner that you care for the people. They will see that your love for them and the Lord makes you unafraid. And you will be bold enough to bear your testimony to truth. Your humble, simple, and perhaps brief testimony may touch the heart of a person more easily than that of your more experienced companion. I have seen it happen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p34" pid="mXfDReQDH0-MtXmnSMxWoA" hash="up5htg">Whatever part you play in that priesthood visit, your desire to go to the people for the Lord to help them will bring at least two blessings. First, you will feel the love of God for the people you visit. And, second, you will feel the Savior’s gratitude for your desire to give the help the Savior knew they needed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p35" pid="iWnzu99ZlUS7O9xUqmdAsg" hash="Mrteuw">He sent you to them because He trusted that you would go feeling responsible to urge them toward Him and toward happiness.</p>

You will come to know your fellow quorum members well. You may have played basketball or football or shared some youth activities and service projects. With some you will have become close friends.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p37" pid="4juK65q_fUiQr3uvajjaGg" hash="727cNA">You will have come to recognize when they are happy and when they are sad. Neither of you may be in a position of authority in the quorum. But you will feel responsible for your fellow member in the priesthood. He may confide in you that he is beginning to break a commandment which you know will do him spiritual harm. He may ask for advice because he trusts you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p38" pid="HxdjUvOd0Ua15FMUxPTkHQ" hash="umnn4Q">I can tell you from experience that if you succeed in influencing him away from a dangerous path, you will never forget the joy which came from being his true friend. If you do not succeed, I promise that when his grief and sadness come, as they will, you will feel his pain as if it were your own. Yet if you tried to help, you will still be his friend. And, in fact, for years he may talk with you about what good things there might have been and how grateful he is that you cared enough to try. You will comfort him then and invite him again, as you did in your youth, to come back to the happiness which the Atonement still makes possible for him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p39" pid="V0rXKho0gE-Uo8rJCzUjaA" hash="ULdF5A">Now, later in your life you will be a father—a priesthood father. What you have learned in your priesthood service as you helped others away from sadness and toward happiness will give you the power you will need and want. Years of being responsible for the souls of men will prepare you for helping and protecting your family, whom you will love more than you can imagine in your youth. You will know how to lead them with priesthood power to safety.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/man-down.p40" pid="7oG85qJd8UmzMb1IrYPBMQ" hash="LnReFw">My prayer is that you will have joy in your priesthood service throughout your life and forever. I pray that you will develop the bravery and love for Heavenly Father’s children that led the sons of Mosiah to plead for the chance to face death and danger to take the gospel to a hardened people. Their desire and their bravery came from feeling responsible for the eternal happiness of strangers in danger of eternal misery.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

I so testify to you in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="121"></span>I am grateful to be with you tonight. I express to you the love and the gratitude of President Monson and President Uchtdorf. From its founding in 1842, the Relief Society has been blessed by the careful and loving oversight of the prophet of God. At the start in Nauvoo, Joseph Smith instructed the leaders and the assembled members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p2" pid="4qiIw8A_WEOJYKVKL3aFXA" hash="mYn72A">Knowing that you have that glorious history, I felt the weight of this invitation from President Monson to speak to you. In one of those early meetings of the society, the Prophet Joseph Smith surprised Bishop Newel K. Whitney by asking him to speak in his place. Bishop Whitney said that he had arrived in happy anticipation of being taught by the Prophet. I understand <span class="emphasis">his</span> feelings of disappointment—and perhaps yours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p3" pid="Bqlg_NO3ekmzMBdgX3igJQ" hash="KPu6FA">And so I asked President Monson as I was preparing for this hour what he felt would be most helpful for you to hear. What he said confirmed the impressions which had already come as I studied and prayed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p4" pid="woeI6nEpF0ufSxHl-UsryA" hash="KQ-cPg">I will speak to you tonight of the great legacy those who went before you in the Relief Society have passed on to you. The part of the foundation they laid for you which seems to me most important and persistent is that charity is at the heart of the society and is to come into the heart, to be part of the very nature, of every member. Charity meant to them far more than a feeling of benevolence. Charity is born of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and is an effect of His Atonement working in the hearts of the members. There are many benevolent groups of women who do great good. There are many who have overpowering feelings of sympathy for the unfortunate, the sick, and the needy. But this organization is unique and has been from its start.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p5" pid="Q0Q9DzPXRUeD61AwkileyA" hash="zf6Wvw">In the foundation they created, those great sisters set “charity never faileth”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> at the center. It served them at the beginning, it served them in the great period that followed, it serves them now in a new time, and it will serve the Relief Society in all the periods ahead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p6" pid="jiOgs3eoJ0yRScz4uHZNYw" hash="3Qt0Cw">This society is composed of women whose feelings of charity spring from hearts changed by qualifying for and by keeping covenants offered only in the Lord’s true Church. Their feelings of charity come from Him through His Atonement. Their acts of charity are guided by His example—and come out of gratitude for His infinite gift of mercy—and by the Holy Spirit, which He sends to accompany His servants on their missions of mercy. Because of that, they have done and are able to do uncommon things for others and to find joy even when their own unmet needs are great.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p7" pid="ciOA_9RTi062dKkFlzU_8A" hash="wFbInw">The history of the Relief Society is filled with accounts of such remarkable selfless service. In the terrible days of persecution and deprivation as the faithful moved from Ohio to Missouri to Illinois and then across the deserts going west, the sisters in their poverty and sorrows cared for others. You would weep as I did if I now read to you some of the accounts in your history. You would be touched by their generosity but even more by your recognition of the faith which lifted and sustained them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p8" pid="j4xP_BgFvUuTZqHF1R-dgQ" hash="8NCtBw">They came from a great diversity of circumstances. All faced the universal trials and heartaches of life. Their determination born of faith to serve the Lord and others seemed to take them not around the storms of life but directly into them. Some were young and some old. They were from many lands and peoples, as you are today. But they were of one heart, one mind, and with one intention. They were <span class="pageBreak" page-number="122"></span>determined to help the Lord build His Zion, where there could be the happy existence the Book of Mormon had described so vividly for them. You remember some of the scenes from 4 Nephi which they carried in their hearts wherever the Lord led them on the journey to Zion:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p9" pid="pVqo7T3RNEWO3Clk7Jd0UQ" hash="Dhf2ew">“And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year, the people were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.</p>

But the love of God dwelt in their hearts. So it—and they—endured during the journey west and in the years that followed. Because of hard circumstances, for nearly four decades the Relief Society ceased to function as a Churchwide organization. But in 1868 Brigham Young called Eliza R. Snow to assist bishops in organizing Relief Societies. She was called as the second general president of the Relief Society in 1880. The record of Relief Society shows that when the leaders approached the sisters across the Church to begin again formal Relief Society work, they found that charity in their hearts was undiminished. They had continued to reach out in mercy to those in need. For those who stayed faithful to their covenants, the gift of charity, the pure love of Christ, had endured. It was still theirs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p13" pid="MMu4nyJPHEeR9UHkk0opGg" hash="0HWT0Q">In the years that followed, the Relief Society grew in numbers and in power to serve those in need. Under the leadership of women of great vision and capacity, the Relief Society took the lead in starting charitable services which did not exist on the frontier for those in need. They created a small hospital. They supported women in going to the East to get medical training to staff it. That was the beginning of one of the great hospital systems in the United States.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p14" pid="uXNvAtId302ykf-K39mT0g" hash="g3b4Xw">They began programs which became over the years the worldwide LDS Family Services programs. They created a grain storage system so effective that they could respond to a request for help from the federal government in a time of war and crisis. They began what became the Primary and what became the organization for young women in the Church. They created their own magazine for women. They became one of the largest organizations for women in the world. They were also in the leadership of organizations for women in the United States.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p15" pid="D8BPyWlt10C98NmUrPSE7Q" hash="gA7pPA">The Relief Society was at the heart of the beginning of the Church’s power to give humanitarian aid across the world. Leaders of nations, when they visit Utah, express awe and admiration for what the Church is doing for the poor and the victims of war and natural disaster across the world. Those remarkable gifts to the children of God are part of the enduring legacy of Relief Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p16" pid="k7XG7apxaE2dOtSY9j72IA" hash="S1f9AA">The Prophet Joseph Smith told the Relief Society in their first meetings that such remarkable things would come from their faithful service. He said that queens would come to learn from and be part of their service.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> I have seen that prophecy fulfilled. And I can discern from the records that a scriptural promise to those who serve the Lord in His work was also granted to those Relief Society pioneers. That promise, given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, is recorded in the 88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. It speaks of those who will be called to serve with the Lord in successive seasons:</p>

It was hard for the faithful men who inherited, for instance, the hospital system they had expanded on the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="123"></span>foundation the Relief Society had built. The Lord, through His prophets, made clear that His priesthood servants could hand the trust of maintaining and building that powerful instrument for good to others. And so the Church gave away its marvelous hospital system.</p>

And I saw their recognition that the joy had come from being at work with the Lord, not from their own accomplishments. So they smiled and gave away gladly what they had built. They had faith that the Lord saw a greater need for their service elsewhere, in other fields in another season.</p>

The services the Relief Society had created began to require massive resources and constant oversight in an expanding Church and a world with increasing turmoil. Running large and centralized programs would have lessened the opportunity of Relief Society leaders and members to feel the joy of serving individuals for and with the Lord.</p>

The only system which could provide succor and comfort across a church so large in a world so varied would be through individual servants near the people in need. The Lord had seen that coming from the beginning of Relief Society.</p>

Two Relief Society sisters accept their assignment to visit another as a call from the Lord. That was true from the start. Relief Society officers organized members who they knew had faith to give compassionate service when it was beyond the power of two assigned visiting teachers. It was always close to home, among acquaintances. Members teach the gospel in local meetings and bear testimony of the Savior and of the Restoration. Daughters watch over mothers. Mothers listen to, teach, and care for daughters.</p>

Every bishop and every branch president has a Relief Society president to depend upon. She has visiting teachers, who know the trials and the needs of every sister. She can, through them, know the hearts of individuals and families. She can meet needs and help the bishop in his call to nurture individuals and families.</p>

I have seen it as you have. My family’s bishop said to me years ago, with a smile, “Why is it that when I go to someone in the ward in need, your wife always seems to have been there ahead of me?” Every bishop and branch president with any experience at all has felt the gentle <span class="pageBreak" page-number="124"></span>prod of inspired example from the sisters of the Relief Society. They help us remember that for all, both women and men, there will be no salvation without compassionate service.</p>

Romney quoting this scripture when he said he was as determined as were the sisters to be faithful in providing that compassionate service. He quoted King Benjamin: “And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you—that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God—I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

And so he thought he would join the sisters in every act of compassionate service he could.</p>

It will take small and simple things. Just remember that the legacy is passed from heart to heart. Charity, the pure love of Christ, is part of the mighty change of heart which the Lord promises to His faithful disciples. So it is not hard to see what simple things you can and must do to pass the legacy along.</p>

It will be more than getting in the door. It will be more than giving a message. It will be more than asking how you can help. Success will come perhaps only after many visits. And you may not in this world see the evidence that you have succeeded. But you can feel by the Spirit if you are on the way.</p>

It was to a woman who would soon lose her husband suddenly and tragically. In recent years the woman had only intermittent contact with Relief Society.</p>

It was a season when the tulips were stacked for sale in many colors. She chose one color, her favorite, but then felt impressed to try another. She didn’t know why she selected yellow, but she did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-enduring-legacy-of-relief-society.p38" pid="WARTsSAuI0yYweBjuLBKjA" hash="KTtsvA">When she presented the yellow tulips at the door, the woman smiled and said, “Come. See my backyard garden.” It was filled with yellow tulips in full bloom. The woman said, “I was just wondering if I should cut some for the house. But now I can leave them and enjoy them a little longer in my garden because you brought me these.” They chatted pleasantly as if they were old friends. From that impression to bring some flowers and to choose yellow tulips, that visiting teacher had evidence that she was on the Lord’s errand. When she told me, I could hear the joy in her voice.</p>

But if the widow felt that God loved her and that He had sent an angel to her, the visiting teacher had helped her move down the road to success in the Lord’s eyes. That visitor may verify success from her faithful effort only in the world to come.</p>

After hard trials, she passed away just weeks ago. From what I learned from a son of the widow, I am confident that those teachers succeeded. They will have the happy experience the Prophet Joseph Smith’s mother described to the sisters in a meeting of the society which she attended. She said, “We must cherish [and] watch over one another, comfort one another and gain instruction that we may all sit down in heaven together.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

They will then be able to pass it to others. The history of Relief Society is recorded in words and numbers, but the heritage is passed heart to heart. That is why families are such beneficiaries of Relief Society.</p>

It was her love and the Lord’s love, which I saw and felt in the simple things she did, giving compassion for Him. She was a Relief Society woman. My mother had no daughters, but my wife has passed the heritage to our two daughters. And they will keep it alive in the hearts of others. It will endure because charity never faileth.</p>

He lives. As we serve others with Him, we feel His joy. By His Atonement He made it possible for us to plead for and receive the gift of charity. I know that the Father lives and answers our prayers. You are members of a society founded and set on its course by the Prophet of the Restoration, Joseph Smith. Sister Beck and her counselors were called through inspiration from God, which was given to a living prophet. I know that is true.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="59"></span>Wherever I am in the day or night, there is nearby a small container of olive oil. This is the one which I keep in the middle drawer of the desk where I work. There is one in my pocket when I am working outdoors or traveling. There is also one in the kitchen cabinet in my home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p2" pid="D1voHqnIq0WvP43M7oWhpg" hash="M-C2Qw">The one I hold now has a date on it. It is the day when someone exercised the power of the priesthood to consecrate the pure oil for the healing of the sick. The young men of the Aaronic Priesthood and even their fathers might think that I am a little extreme in my preparation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p3" pid="1CraVzmd-UuxMFuFbQvDwQ" hash="oCQOLQ">But the call during the day or the knock at the door at night always comes as a surprise. Someone will say, “Please, could you come quickly?” Once, years ago, it was a father calling from a hospital. His three-year-old daughter had been thrown 50 feet (15 m) by a speeding car as she ran across the street to join her mother. When I arrived at the hospital, the father pled that the power of the priesthood would preserve her life. The doctors and the nurses only reluctantly let us reach through a plastic barrier to place a drop of oil on the one opening in the heavy bandages which covered her head. A doctor said to me, with irritation in his voice, “Hurry with whatever you are going to do. She is dying.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p4" pid="7yly8DlCWEGVUpg8oK3uSw" hash="-CgjBg">He was wrong. She lived, and contrary to what the doctor had said, she not only lived, but she learned to walk again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p5" pid="auNfh87Kg06NZYotkfi7Aw" hash="ybX-bQ">When the call came, I was ready. The preparation was far more than having consecrated oil close at hand. It must begin long before the crisis which requires priesthood power. Those who are prepared will be ready to answer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p6" pid="T-__I7p4Ak-J0d3B8SO6-A" hash="3YAbIQ">The preparation begins in families, in Aaronic Priesthood quorums, and mostly in the private lives of young men. The quorums and the families must help, but the preparation that counts will be made by the young men making choices to rise to their great destiny as priesthood servants for God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p7" pid="f2Lkq6oTbkuJgLjKK4Orrw" hash="S6FLSA">The destiny of the rising generation of priesthood holders is far more than to be ready to bring God’s power down to heal the sick. The preparation is to be ready to go and do whatever the Lord wants done as the world is preparing for His coming. None of us knows exactly what those errands will be. But we know what it will take to be ready, so each of us can prepare.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p8" pid="itJ3-QL92kCFwWwT4ivbfw" hash="SL8XhA">What you will need in the dramatic moment will be built in the steady performance of obedient service. I will tell you two of the things you will need and the preparation it takes to be ready.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p9" pid="-yzOkKiYP0GgasQdjE9izw" hash="Gf08Hg">The first is to have faith. The priesthood is the authority to act in the name of God. It is the right to call down the powers of heaven. So you must have faith that God lives and that you have won His confidence to allow you to use His power for His purposes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p10" pid="r7nwhzuAEEWcpg5N_SmyKA" hash="a5FbZA">An instance from the Book of Mormon will help you see how one man made that preparation. There was a priesthood holder named Nephi who received a hard assignment from the Lord. He was sent by God to call wicked people to repentance before it was too late for them. In their wickedness and hatred, they were killing each other. Even their sorrow had not humbled them enough to repent and obey God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p11" pid="jjAGN-Zjt0yR3yayjOSUTg" hash="VOxWyw">Because of Nephi’s preparation, God blessed him with power to fulfill his assignment. In His loving and empowering words to Nephi, there is a guide for us:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p12" pid="ihEd0iJUrkegzFK_ZPhH4g" hash="yjmRaQ">“Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p13" pid="fU7FcjOD5kSFYh5Z5SrM_w" hash="KIz9ew">“And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and <span class="pageBreak" page-number="60"></span>I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p14" pid="xPcsQPWx0kyOq5lRafuf0g" hash="AYrtxA">“Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God. Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye shall have power over this people, and shall smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness of this people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p15" pid="A9JYNZX4qUqmWSNzdcA3PA" hash="HgBuwQ">“Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p16" pid="R0iYZWLhxkWP25hDk2ssdw" hash="0orvFg">As the account from the Book of Mormon tells us, the people did not repent. So Nephi asked God to change the seasons. He asked for a miracle to help the people choose to repent because of famine. The famine came. The people repented, and then they begged Nephi to have God send rain. He did ask God, and God honored his unshakable faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p17" pid="lRDTEC7dgkyPddVmL12c3g" hash="azs4aA">That faith did not come in the moment when Nephi needed it, nor did God’s trust in Nephi. He earned that great faith and God’s confidence by courageous and sustained labor in the Lord’s service. You young men are building that faith now for the days ahead when you will need it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p18" pid="oM81O01Qx0mzq-2GwMH18Q" hash="1UXEeg">It may be so small a thing as to keep careful minutes in a deacons or a teachers quorum. There were young men years ago who kept meticulous records of what was decided and what was done by boys only months older than they were. That took faith that God called even 12-year-olds into His service who were being guided by revelation. Some of those quorum secretaries of long ago now sit in the presiding councils of the Church. They now read the minutes others prepare. And revelation flows to them now as it did to the leaders they served when they were boys like you. They had been prepared to trust that God reveals His <span class="emphasis">will,</span> even in apparently small matters, in His kingdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p19" pid="0gSSVtCCQ0mqG0xAC21X1w" hash="rtqwLw">Now, the Lord said Nephi could be trusted because he would ask nothing contrary to God’s will. To have that confidence in Nephi, the Lord had to be sure that Nephi believed in revelation, sought it, and followed it. Long experience following inspiration from God was a part of Nephi’s priesthood preparation. It must be part of yours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p20" pid="73NRPSbdkU6f80OJp7Fhrw" hash="pQ3YqA">I see that happening today. In recent months I have heard deacons, teachers, and priests give talks which are clearly as inspired and powerful as you will hear in this general conference. As I have felt the power being given to young holders of the priesthood, I have thought that the rising generation is rising around us, as if on an incoming tide. My prayer is that those of us in the generations which have come before will rise on the tide with them. The preparation of the Aaronic Priesthood is a blessing to us all as well as to those they will serve in their generation and the generations to follow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p21" pid="2p9-JZlojUu4JxiSvFcrow" hash="QkoFdQ">Yet all is not perfect in Zion. Not all of the youth choose to prepare. That choice must be their own. They are responsible for themselves. That is the Lord’s way in His loving plan. But many young men have little or no support from those who could help as they prepare. Those of us who can help will be held accountable by the Lord. A father who neglects or interferes with a son’s development of faith or his ability to follow inspiration will someday know sorrow. That will be true for anyone placed in a position to help these young men choose wisely and well in their days in the preparatory priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p22" pid="Oj3jUXZgA0qpsseVm1lF3Q" hash="yr-brw">Now, the second thing they will need is confidence that they can live up to the blessings and the trust which God has offered them. Most of the influences around them drag them down to doubt the existence of God, of His love for them, and of the reality of the sometimes quiet messages they receive through the Holy Ghost and the Spirit of Christ. Their peers may urge them to choose sin. If young men choose sin, those messages from God will become more faint.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p23" pid="uaxl_lRAzEG1ACwreTK3yw" hash="AZKrIw">We can help them choose to prepare by loving them, warning them, and by showing confidence in them. But we can help them even more by our example of a faithful and inspired servant. In our families, in quorums, in classes, and as we associate with them in any setting, we can act as true priesthood holders who use its power as God has taught us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p24" pid="SdTDaCYwwEWhsC3j8mBOzQ" hash="P6vRaA">For me, that instruction is most clear in the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord warns us in that section to have our motives pure: “No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> As we lead and influence young men, we must never do it to gratify our pride or our ambition. We must never use compulsion in any <span class="pageBreak" page-number="61"></span>degree of unrighteousness. That is a high standard of the example we must set for our youth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p25" pid="ZYf7ixCioUiJZzmWyQnlWA" hash="vHIzpA">I saw it done when I was a teacher and a priest. My bishop and those who served under him were determined not to lose even one of us. As nearly as I could see, their determination was motivated by love for the Lord and for us, not for any selfish purpose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p26" pid="B8iRqs5PUE-zSAtvxx3wkA" hash="4pd0rQ">The bishop had a system. Every adviser of every quorum was to contact every young man he had not spoken to that Sunday. They were not to go to bed until they had either talked to the boy who had been missing, to his parents, or to a close friend. The bishop promised them that he would not turn out his light until he had heard a report about every boy. I don’t think he gave them an order. He simply made it clear that he did not expect their lights to go out until they had given that report.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p27" pid="2uGedVyDXkS5gOVpMhYcTQ" hash="HpUQ4g">He and those who served under him were doing far more than watching over us. They were showing us by example what it means to care for the Lord’s sheep. No effort was too much for him or for those who served us in our quorums. By their example, they taught us what it means to be unwearying in the Lord’s service. The Lord was preparing us by example.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p28" pid="LpENtfqnHU-g7xlmYXTf1A" hash="aKClfA">I have no idea whether they thought any one of us was going to be anything special. But they treated us as if they did by being willing to pay any personal price to keep us from losing faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p29" pid="7LxK2e3Z20-9ATbhEPGCnw" hash="Q2ezvA">I don’t know how the bishop got so many people to have such high expectations. As nearly as I can tell, it was done “by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned.” The “no lights out” method the bishop used would not work in some places. But the example of unwavering care for every young man and reaching out quickly brought the power of heaven into our lives. It always will. It helped young men prepare for the days when God needed them in families and in His kingdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p30" pid="O2trMG1r7kyIEqqdeKMw_g" hash="dAnPEA">My father was an example for me of what the Lord teaches in the 121st section about getting heaven’s help in preparing young men. During my early years, he was sometimes disappointed by my performance. He let me know it. Hearing his voice, I could feel he thought I was better than that. But he did it in the Lord’s way: “Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p31" pid="HSIbxCpyd0GNrxFQtQNfHQ" hash="F4wQwQ">I knew, even after the most direct correction, that Dad’s reproof was given in love. In fact, his love seemed to increase when he used even his strongest correction, which was a disapproving and disappointed look. He was my leader and my trainer, never using compulsory means, and I am <span class="pageBreak" page-number="62"></span>sure that the promise given in the Doctrine and Covenants will be fulfilled for him. His influence on me will flow unto him “forever and ever.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p32" pid="ipWe5Z5zj0KBoP1sbPx8Xw" hash="jhOyzw">Many fathers and leaders, when they hear the words of the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants, will feel that they must rise higher to come up to that standard. I do. Can you remember a moment when you rebuked a child or youth with sharpness when you were moved by something other than inspiration? Can you remember a time when you told a son to do something or make a sacrifice you were not willing to do or make yourself? Those feelings of regret can spur us to repentance to become more nearly the examples we have covenanted to be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p33" pid="Xb7um996mUi-6IyX_CgEhQ" hash="S7m58w">As we meet our obligations as fathers and leaders, we will help the next generation rise to their glorious future. They will be better than we are, just as you have tried to be even better parents than your parents and better leaders than the great ones who helped you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p34" pid="K8EySdkRQEeynqLhe4oZmQ" hash="8XUW2g">It is my prayer that we will be determined to do better every day to prepare the rising generation. Each time I see a bottle of consecrated oil, I will remember this night and the feeling I have now of wanting to do more to help young men prepare for their days of service and opportunity. I pray for a blessing of preparation for them. I am confident that, with the Lord’s help and ours, they will be ready.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/be-ready.p35" pid="lKzp3UjC1UCE19EGhaj7Zw" hash="5Z_rFQ">I bear you my witness that God the Father lives and that Jesus Christ lives and leads this Church. He is the perfect exemplar of the priesthood. President Thomas S. Monson holds and exercises all the keys of the priesthood on the earth. That is true. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="70"></span>I feel blessed to have the opportunity to speak with you on this Sabbath day. Different as we are in circumstances and experiences, we share a desire to become better than we are. There may be a few who mistakenly feel they are good enough and a few who have given up trying to be better. But, for all, the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is that we can and must expect to become better as long as we live.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p2" pid="VtikB28TPkaAf16z13c_FA" hash="fvWOWA">Part of that expectation is set for us in a revelation given by God to the Prophet Joseph Smith. It describes the day when we will meet the Savior, as we all will. It tells us what to do to prepare and what to expect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p3" pid="oS0iVHf_NUac7eA89P7oDw" hash="mQ5sjA">It is in the book of Moroni: “Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p4" pid="8NlaVjXW6k6NGTXsnu70yw" hash="01hJeg">That ought to help you understand why any believing Latter-day Saint is an optimist about what lies ahead for him or her, however difficult the present may be. We believe that through living the gospel of Jesus Christ we can become like the Savior, who is perfect. Considering the attributes of Jesus Christ should quash the pride of the self-satisfied person who thinks he or she has no need to improve. And even the most humble person can take hope in the invitation to become like the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p5" pid="QY5CkaTV10eA_A1rkBAMHw" hash="v-S56w">How that wonderful transformation will happen is captured for me in a song written for children. I remember watching the faces of a room full of children singing it on a Sunday. Each of the children was leaning forward, almost to the front of the chair. I could see light in their eyes and determination in their faces as they sang with gusto. You may have heard the song too. I hope it will sound forever in our memories. I only hope I can give it the feeling those children had.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p6" pid="1RarfbdW40mUwl_GU2nzRw" hash="UzXkKQ">It seemed to me that they were not just singing; they were declaring their determination. Jesus Christ was their example. To be like Him was their fixed goal. And their eager looks and their shining eyes convinced me that they had no doubts. They expected to succeed. They believed that the instruction of the Savior to be perfect was not a hope but a command. And they were sure He had prepared the way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p7" pid="nx8JilDJpU2qveZtrOZndA" hash="5fhx5g">That determination and confidence can and must be in the heart of every Latter-day Saint. The Savior has prepared the way through His Atonement and His example. And even the children who sang that song knew how.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p8" pid="yBwK7GZDWUGfkl8aT7-BUw" hash="mMEnYA">Love is the motivating principle by which the Lord leads us along the way towards becoming like Him, <span class="emphasis">our perfect example.</span> Our way of life, hour by hour, must be filled with the love of God and love for others. There is no surprise in that, since the Lord proclaimed those as the first and great commandments. It is love of God that will lead us to keep His commandments. And love of others is at the heart of our capacity to obey Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p9" pid="4vBOIWQDa0yPKF89Xy40tg" hash="SiuQ6g">Just as Jesus used a child in His mortal ministry as an example for the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="71"></span>people of the pure love they must and could have to be like Him, He has offered us the family as an example of an ideal setting in which we can learn how to love as He loves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p10" pid="wVa0zawh-kWKcgUpFr0wdw" hash="mahDBA">That is because the greatest joys and the greatest sorrows we experience are in family relationships. The joys come from putting the welfare of others above our own. That is what love is. And the sorrow comes primarily from selfishness, which is the absence of love. The ideal God holds for us is to form families in the way most likely to lead to happiness and away from sorrow. A man and a woman are to make sacred covenants that they will put the welfare and happiness of the other at the center of their lives. Children are to be born into a family where the parents hold the needs of children equal to their own in importance. And children are to love parents and each other.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p11" pid="dQShcuoGtEqBd2oWNw8POw" hash="ojFRSA">That is the ideal of a loving family. In many of our homes, there are the words “Our Family Can Be Together Forever.” There is a gravestone near my home of a mother and grandmother. She and her husband were sealed in the temple of God to each other and to their posterity for time and all eternity. The inscription on the gravestone reads, “Please, no empty chairs.” She asked for that inscription because she knew that whether the family will be together depends on the choices each family member makes. The word “please” is there because neither God nor she can compel another to choose happiness. And there is Satan, who wants misery, not happiness, in families in this life and in the next.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p12" pid="ozyz2ZsdjESpB9K_FqXVdg" hash="X6j64A">My hope today is to suggest some choices which may seem difficult but that would assure you that you have qualified for there to be no empty chairs in your family in the world to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p13" pid="whvZrYoUOEaU2Sl0jNOmzA" hash="VvxpLw">First, I give counsel to husbands and wives. Pray for the love which allows you to see the good in your companion. Pray for the love that makes weaknesses and mistakes seem small. Pray for the love to make your companion’s joy your own. Pray for the love to want to lessen the load and soften the sorrows of your companion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p14" pid="pOpHjS3NG026ofX0TVtD0g" hash="V2JLog">I saw this in my parents’ marriage. In my mother’s final illness, the more uncomfortable she became, the more giving her comfort became the dominant intent of my father’s life. He asked that the hospital set up a bed in her room. He was determined to be there to be sure that she wanted for nothing. He walked the miles to work each morning and back to her side at night through those difficult times for her. I believe it was a gift from God to him that his power to love grew when it mattered so much to her. I think he was doing what Jesus would have done out of love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p15" pid="YsvFjvvAuEC8ykR9H0Y-dA" hash="2j7ivw">Now I give counsel to the parents of a wandering child. The Savior is the perfect example of persisting in love. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="72"></span>You remember His words of comfort to the people among the Nephites who had rejected His earlier invitation to come to Him. He spoke to the survivors of the destruction which came after His Crucifixion: “O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p16" pid="lyMvbSA5SEeKsseV_AsrsQ" hash="83TTlA">The story of the prodigal son gives us all hope. The prodigal remembered home, as will your children. They will feel your love drawing them back to you. Elder Orson F. Whitney, in a general conference of 1929, gave a remarkable promise, which I know is true, to the faithful parents who honor the temple sealing to their children: “Though some of the sheep may wander, the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p17" pid="epX4zNIL20CSGMHDJMGm7w" hash="vxBU6g">Then he goes on to say: “Pray for your careless and disobedient children; hold on to them with your faith. Hope on, trust on, till you see the salvation of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> You can pray for your children, love them, and reach out to them with confidence that Jesus reaches for them with you. When you keep trying, you are doing what Jesus does.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p18" pid="-8Fte46UOEKmAoEG7z0Dkw" hash="aY3ZJQ">Now, here is my counsel to children. The Lord gave you a commandment with a promise: “Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> It is the only one of the Ten Commandments with a promise. You may not have parents that are living. In some cases, you may not feel that your parents are worthy of the honor and respect of their children. You may not even have ever known them. But you owe them life. And in every case, even if your life is not lengthened, its quality will be improved simply by remembering your parents with honor.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p19" pid="9PKO04ZawEGui5cLsF_W0Q" hash="RHrFEA">Now to those who have adopted other people’s families as if they were their own: I have friends who remember my children’s birthdays better than I do. My wife and I have had friends who seldom failed to visit or to remember a holiday with us. I often am touched when someone begins a conversation, “How is your family?” and then waits to hear the answer with love showing in their face. They seem attentive when I go through a description of the life of each of my children. Their love helps me to feel more keenly the love of the Savior for our children. In their question, I can sense that they are feeling what Jesus feels and asking what He would ask.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p20" pid="Q8hTD1eAf0mXuP7XJDrVnQ" hash="4VHnNw">For all of us it may be hard to see in our lives an increasing power to love and to see ourselves becoming more like the Savior, <span class="emphasis">our perfect example.</span> I wish to encourage you. You have had evidences that you are moving along the road to becoming more like Jesus. It will help to remember how you have felt, at times, like a little child, even in the midst of cares and trials. Think of those children singing the song. Think of the times you felt, perhaps recently, as those little children did singing, “I’m trying to be like Jesus; I’m following in his ways.” You will remember that Jesus asked His disciples to bring the children to Him and said, “Suffer the little children to come unto me, … for of such is the kingdom of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> You have felt the peace of a pure little child at times when you have tried to be like Jesus.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p21" pid="A5hSSY4n9k2HlWkz-5T3bA" hash="nTu1-w">It may have come when you were baptized. He did not need baptism, because He was pure. But when you were baptized, you had the feeling of being washed clean, like a little child. When He was baptized, the heavens were opened, and He heard the voice of His Heavenly Father: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> You heard no voice, but you felt the approval of Heavenly Father for having done what Jesus did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p22" pid="ZWIiOXlGekGsriNHtUu-8A" hash="2mbHsA">You have felt it in your family when you asked the pardon of your spouse or forgave a child for some mistake or disobedience. These moments will come more often as you try to do the things you know Jesus would do. Because of His Atonement for you, your childlike obedience will bring a feeling of love of the Savior for you and your love for Him. That is one of <span class="pageBreak" page-number="73"></span>the gifts that is promised to His faithful disciples. And this gift can come not only to you alone but also to the loving members of your family. The promise was given in 3 Nephi: “And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p23" pid="91Lk93s8aUSZF3KdB2o44g" hash="KqTt-g">I hope you will go out today looking for opportunities to do as He did and to love as He loves. I can promise you the peace that you felt as a child will come to you often and it will linger with you. The promise is true that He made to His disciples: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p24" pid="2PonczSIOke2HG9XrE9EIA" hash="lpkpqw">None of us is perfect yet. But we can have frequent assurance that we are following along the way. He leads us, and He beckons for us to follow Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/our-perfect-example.p25" pid="qTvxpveopEWtGcnNLgbITQ" hash="TblH7g">I testify that the way lies in faith in Jesus Christ, in baptism, in receiving the Holy Ghost, and in enduring in love to keep His commandments. I testify that the Father lives and loves us. He loves His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is <span class="emphasis">our perfect example.</span> Joseph Smith was the prophet of the Restoration. He saw the Father and the Son. I know that is true. There is in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the priesthood power to offer the ordinances that allow us to become better and better and more like the Savior and our Heavenly Father. I leave you my blessing that you may feel the assurance and the approval you felt as a little child. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="22"></span>Brothers and sisters, our Heavenly Father wants and needs our help to bring His spirit children home to Him again. I speak today of young people already within His true Church and so are started on the strait and narrow way to return to their heavenly home. He wants them to gain early the spiritual strength to stay on the path. And He needs our help to get them back to the path quickly should they begin to wander.</p>

I will tell you one story of a young person who represents many whom I have tried to help over the years.</p>

She spoke to me of her life. She had been baptized and confirmed as a member of the Church when she was eight. There were no tears in her eyes as she recounted the more than 20 years that followed, but there was sadness in her voice. She said that the downward spiral began with choices to associate with what she thought were exciting people. She began to violate what at first seemed to be less important commandments.</p>

But the associations with her friends provided a new feeling of being liked, and so her occasional resolutions to repent seemed less and less important. As the gravity of the commandments she was breaking increased, the dream of a happy eternal home seemed to fade.</p>

She wanted me to rescue her from the trap of sin in which she found herself bound. But the only way out was for her to exercise faith in Jesus Christ, to have a broken heart, to repent, and so be cleansed, changed, and strengthened through the Lord’s Atonement. I bore my testimony to her that it was still possible. And it was, but so much harder than it would have been to exercise faith early in her life on the journey home to God and when she first began to wander.</p>

He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to make safe passage possible and visible. He called as His prophet in these times President Thomas S. Monson. Since his youth President Monson has taught not only how to stay on the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="23"></span>path but also how to rescue those who have been led away into sorrow.</p>

Our most important and powerful assignments are in the family. They are important because the family has the opportunity at the start of a child’s life to put feet firmly on the path home. Parents, brothers and sisters, grandparents, aunts and uncles are made more powerful guides and rescuers by the bonds of love that are the very nature of a family.</p>

In those protected years, because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, Satan’s use of the mists of darkness to hide the path to return home is blocked. In those precious years the Lord helps families by calling Primary workers to help strengthen children spiritually. He also provides holders of the Aaronic Priesthood to offer the sacrament. In those sacramental prayers, the children hear the promise that they may someday receive the Holy Ghost as a guide if they are obedient to God’s commandments. As a result, they are fortified to resist temptation when it comes and then, sometime in the future, to go to the rescue of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/help-them-on-their-way-home.p13" pid="uQGRGulAMUOkvAuTmVFmow" hash="IE9V3g">Many bishops in the Church are inspired to call the strongest people in the ward to serve individual children in the Primary. They realize that if the children are strengthened with faith and testimony, they will be less likely to need rescue as teenagers. They realize that a strong spiritual foundation can make the difference for a lifetime.</p>

She taught in the Primary of her ward, at her own request, until she was almost 90 years old. Little children could feel her love for them. They saw her example. They learned from her the simple principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And above all, because of her example they learned to feel and recognize the Holy Ghost. And when they did, they were well on their way to the faith to resist temptation. They would be less likely to need to be rescued and would be prepared to go to the rescue of others.</p>

He felt confident that he knew the way home. So he started to walk. He said afterward that he had complete confidence and liked the idea of being alone on the trip.

He felt like a little child, not the confident boy who had begun to walk home alone. He realized that he needed help. Then something came to his memory. He knew he was supposed to pray. And so he left the road and headed toward some trees he could barely see in the darkness. He found a place to kneel down.</p>

Two young people had heard him crying. As they approached, they said, “Can we help you?” Through his tears he told them he was lost and that he wanted to go home. They asked if he knew his home phone number or address. He didn’t. They asked if he knew his name. He did know that. They led him to the nearby place where they lived. They found our family name in a phone book.</p>

One, for young women, is called Personal Progress. The other, for Aaronic Priesthood holders, is called Duty to God. We encourage young people in the rising generation to see their own potential to build great spiritual strength. And we plead with those who care about those young people to rise to what the Lord requires of us to help them. And since the future of the Church depends upon them, all of us care.</p>

These habits will strengthen your testimony and help you learn and improve throughout your life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

It will be contained in one simple book for all three Aaronic Priesthood offices. The young men and their leaders will receive a copy of this new book. It is a powerful tool. It will strengthen the testimonies of young men and their relationship with God. It will help them learn and want to fulfill their priesthood duties. It will strengthen their relationships with their parents, among quorum members, and with their leaders.</p>

They are invited to learn and do things that would be challenging for anyone. As I reflect on my own youth, I cannot remember being so challenged. Oh, on a few occasions I was invited to rise to such tests, but only now and then. These programs expect consistency, great effort, and the accumulation of learning and spiritual experiences over years.</p>

I have seen young men following patterns of learning, making plans to do what God wants of them, then moving out to do what they have committed to do and sharing with others how they were changed spiritually. And as I watched and listened, it became clear that fathers, mothers, leaders, friends, and even neighbors in a congregation were touched by the Spirit as they heard youth testify how they had been strengthened. The youth were lifted as they bore testimony, and so were those who were trying to help them rise.</p>

Personal Progress helps young women prepare to receive the ordinances of the temple. They are helped by the examples of mothers, <span class="pageBreak" page-number="25"></span>grandmothers, and every righteous woman around them in the Church. I have seen how parents helped a daughter achieve her goals and dreams by noticing and appreciating all the good things she does.</p>

And we do that best by going with them. Because the path is steep and sometimes rocky, they will at times feel discouraged and even stumble. They may at times become confused about their destination and wander after less eternally important goals. These inspired programs make that less likely because they will lead the young person to invite and receive the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>

So if we are wise, we will encourage, praise, and exemplify everything which invites the companionship of the Holy Ghost. When they share with us what they are doing and feeling, we must ourselves have qualified for the Spirit. Then they will feel in our praise and our smiles the approval of God. And should we feel the need to give corrective counsel, they will feel our love and the love of God in it, not rebuke and rejection, which can permit Satan to lead them further away.</p>

We need to pray for the gifts of the Spirit. We need to ponder in the scriptures and in the words of living prophets. We need to make plans which are not only wishes but covenants. And then we need to keep our promises to the Lord. And we need to lift others by sharing with them the blessings of the Atonement which have come in our lives.</p>

As we do, we will help them feel from the Spirit an assurance that if they will persist, they will hear the words from a loving Savior and Heavenly Father: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> And we who help them along the way will hear those words with joy.</p>

This is His kingdom, restored with priesthood keys through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Thomas S. Monson is the Lord’s prophet today. I promise each of you, as you follow inspired direction in this, the true Church of Jesus Christ, that our youth and we who help and love them can be delivered safely to our home with Heavenly Father and the Savior to live in families and in joy forever. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="60"></span>Brethren, I am grateful to be with you tonight. And I am humbled by what I know of your faithful priesthood service. I speak to you tonight of diligence in the Lord’s service. Recent experiences led me to that choice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/act-in-all-diligence.p2" pid="ZyV6ygoAg0ioYSA6TJZ4Hw" hash="0zk1tw">One was my careful study of the remarkable new booklet for the Aaronic Priesthood, about which Brother David L. Beck spoke. It is entitled <span class="emphasis">Fulfilling My Duty to God.</span> As I read and pondered what it expects young men to do and to become, I realized that it was describing what President Brigham Young promised to the priesthood holder who is diligent over a lifetime: “An individual who holds a share in the Priesthood, and continues faithful to his calling, who delights himself continually in doing the things God requires at his hands, and continues through life in the performance of every duty will secure to himself not only the privilege of receiving, but the knowledge [of] how to receive the things of God, that he may know the mind of God continually.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/act-in-all-diligence.p3" pid="eZhy5egusUCZjg0oIB_Mjg" hash="kqidzA">Just a few weeks ago, I saw a new deacon start on that path of diligence. His father showed me a diagram his son had created that showed every row in their chapel, a number for each deacon who would be assigned to pass the sacrament, and their route through the chapel to serve the sacrament to the members. The father and I smiled to think that a boy, without being asked to do it, would make a plan to be sure he would succeed in his priesthood service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/act-in-all-diligence.p4" pid="QY9NLhQM3km14gaEEDMFwQ" hash="GA6mSA">I recognized in his diligence the pattern from the new <span class="emphasis">Duty to God</span> booklet. It is to learn what the Lord expects of you, make a plan to do it, act on your plan with diligence, and then share with others how your experience changed you and blessed others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/act-in-all-diligence.p5" pid="iPoLKK2JOE-KMyBQwS8Xlg" hash="oS34pg">The deacon made that diagram to be sure that he would be able to do what the Lord had called him to do.

He had been a bishop twice. His first call as a bishop, years before I met him, had been when he was young. Now he was old, released for the second time as a bishop. His increasing physical limitations made any priesthood service very difficult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/act-in-all-diligence.p7" pid="2W9S99VL9kKKQIco5KIVSg" hash="jzXZFw">Yet he had a plan to act in diligence. He sat every Sunday he could get to church near the row nearest the door where most of the people would enter for the sacrament meeting. He got there early to be sure a seat was vacant. Each person arriving could see his look of love and welcome, just as they did when he sat on the stand as their bishop. His influence warmed and lifted us because we knew something of the price he paid to serve. His task as a bishop was finished; his priesthood service did not end.</p>

Tonight, I will try to tell you about what I have learned about them.

Both of them knew by the Spirit that the message those elders brought to them was true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/serve-with-the-spirit.p5" pid="NUXya_xHqE2rRLxSaj5aBw" hash="h2OMxg">The boy and the girl chose to be baptized. The two of them met for the first time on the dusty trail years later, walking hundreds of miles to the mountains of western America. They talked as they walked. What they talked about was the miraculous blessing that in all the world, the servants of God had found them and even more miraculous, that they knew their message was true.</p>

That requires faith in Jesus Christ to repent and be cleansed through His Atonement. So as priesthood holders we should never miss an opportunity to participate with all our hearts in the promise offered in every sacrament meeting for members of the restored Church to “take upon them the name of [God’s] Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Humble prayer to our Heavenly Father, in deep faith in Jesus Christ, is essential to qualify us for the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>

We read words and we may get ideas. We study and we may discover patterns and connections in scripture. But when we ponder, we invite revelation by the Spirit. Pondering, to me, is the thinking and the praying I do after reading and studying in the scriptures carefully.</p>

Smith set an example of how pondering can invite light from God. It is recorded in the 138th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. He had been reading and studying many scriptures, trying to understand how the effects of the Savior’s Atonement would reach those who had died never having heard His message. Here is his account of how revelation came: “As I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Simply by performing the service that pertains to it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

What you say may seem jumbled to you. But you will feel that words were given to you at the moment you needed them.

But the deacon you speak to for the Lord will remember you came to him. I know of one boy, now a man still far away from Church activity, whom a deacon was sent to find, and he told his grandfather of that visit 20 years earlier. And it seemed to have no effect, and yet he even named the deacon who came. The grandfather asked me to find and thank the deacon who was called to invite, to exhort, and to teach. It had been only one day in the life of a boy, but a grandfather and the Lord remember the words the boy was inspired to speak and the boy’s name.</p>

We don’t have to use soaring language or convey deep insights. Simple words of testimony will do. The Spirit will give you the words for you to speak and will carry them down into the hearts of humble people who look for truth from God. If we keep trying to speak for the Lord, we will be surprised someday to learn that we have warned, exhorted, taught, and invited with the help of the Spirit to bless lives, with power far beyond our own.</p>

That is another priesthood service in which we will feel the influence of the Spirit increase our power to serve. You will find yourself more able to recognize pain and worry in the faces of people. Names or the faces of people in your quorum will come into your mind with the impression that they are in need.</p>

I heard a commotion among the nurses in the hallway. Suddenly, President Spencer W. Kimball walked into the room and sat in a chair on the opposite side of the bed from me.

He also had experience with the Holy Ghost as his companion in difficult times and hard service. This is the assurance to us in our priesthood service, in the Church and in our families. For me the promise has been true when I have felt the Spirit in my priesthood service. “Whenever darkness fills our minds, we may know that we are not possessed of the Spirit of God. … When we are filled with the Spirit of God we are filled with joy, with peace, and with happiness, no matter what our circumstances may be; for it is a spirit of cheerfulness and of happiness.

And then by evening I thought of a property we had acquired in another state. For years we had tried to sell it without success.</p>

I had called him a few weeks before, and he had said then, “We haven’t had anyone show interest in your property for years.”</p>

Thousands were out of work and homeless. So, feeling she had her errand from the Lord, she asked her neighbors for old clothes. She washed the clothes, pressed them, and put them in cardboard boxes on her back porch. When men without money needed clothes and asked her neighbors for help, they would say, “Go to the house down the street. There is a Mormon lady living there who will give you what you need.”</p>

With such people and such families, we could create the harmony and the prosperity we want for our people.”</p>

We are a tiny minority among the citizens of that great city and nation. The mayor knew little of our doctrine and few of our people. Yet God had sent him the message that Latter-day Saints, under covenant to trust God and His authorized servants, would become a light to his people.</p>

My purpose tonight is to help you believe that is so. If that belief can become a deep testimony from God, it will shape your daily and hourly choices. And then from what might appear to you to be small choices, the Lord will lead you to the happiness you want. Through your choices He will be able to bless countless others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p2" pid="BfFAg61Nl0SlA1qcRGfMqQ" hash="SjaRew">Your choice to be with us tonight is an example of choices that matter. More than a million young women, mothers, and leaders were invited. Of all the other things you could have chosen to do, you chose to be with us. You did that because of your beliefs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p3" pid="U7ejyWQbd0ynvcx0vOR3GQ" hash="jFbdXA">You are a believer in the gospel of Jesus Christ. You believe enough to come here to hear His servants and have enough faith to hope that something you will hear or feel will move you toward a better life. You felt in your heart that following Jesus Christ was the way to greater happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p4" pid="gAfFpgs-_kytAnMmWNccHg" hash="xGgRxQ">Now, you may not have recognized that as a conscious choice of any great importance. You may have felt drawn to be with us by friends or family. You may have simply responded to the kindness of someone who invited you to come. But even if you did not notice it, you felt at least a faint echo of the invitation of the Savior: “Come, follow me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p5" pid="c8z5b5haU0SOXBFyV1GNdA" hash="_CqIUQ">In the hour we have been together, the Lord has deepened your belief in Him and strengthened your testimony. You have heard more than words and music. You have felt the witness of the Spirit to your heart that there are living prophets on the earth in the Lord’s true Church and that the path to happiness lies within His kingdom. Your testimony has grown that this is the only true and living Church on the earth today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p6" pid="m_LHPLxmmUuwj-l37sTG-g" hash="ReyAAw">Now, we did not all feel exactly the same things. For some it was a witness of the Spirit that Thomas S. Monson is a prophet of God. For others it was that honesty, virtue, and doing good to all men really are attributes of the Savior. And with that came a greater desire be like Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p7" pid="jeXNVXZW5UWUj5975hUwZw" hash="En7lKQ">All of you have a desire for your testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ to be strengthened. President Brigham Young could see your need many years ago. He was a prophet of God, and with prophetic foresight 142 years ago, he saw you and your needs. He was a loving father and a living prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p8" pid="Hx-7plb3zkaQZMyZXMyNCA" hash="yGkFvA">He could see the influence of the world coming down on his own daughters. He saw that those worldly influences were drawing them away from the Lord’s pathway to happiness. In his day those influences were brought in part by the new transcontinental railroad connecting the isolated and protected Saints to the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p9" pid="jqcJYkrCsUajlAm58jeQsA" hash="RzClug">He may not have seen the technological marvels of today where with a device you can hold in your hand you can choose to connect to countless ideas and people across the earth. But he saw the value for his daughters—and for you—in having their choices be made out of a powerful testimony of a living and loving God and His plan of happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p10" pid="P6Mad6bo_U-7xcq8Clmyvg" hash="Z1H-1w">Here is his prophetic and inspired counsel for his daughters and for you always.</p>

He said in a room in his home less than a mile from where this message now goes out to daughters of God in nations across the world: “There is need for the young daughters of Israel to get a living testimony of the truth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p12" pid="TNvlpfeedEOZts1WzSF-bA" hash="oI3vUQ">He then created an association of young women that has become what we now call in the Lord’s Church “Young Women.” You have felt tonight some of the wonderful effect of his choice made in that Sunday evening meeting in the parlor of his home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p13" pid="kq3d8tOePkGqh9vm6_6TEg" hash="ZIBG3w">More than 100 years later, daughters of Israel across the world have that desire for a living testimony of the truth for themselves. Now, for the rest of your lives, you will need that living and growing testimony to fortify you and lead your path to eternal life. And with it you will become the transmitters of the Light of Christ to your brothers and sisters across the world and across generations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p14" pid="RtAEA4VaP0K3djZ94pS8eg" hash="KORtNg">You know from your own experience what a testimony is. President Joseph Fielding Smith taught that a testimony “is a convincing knowledge given by revelation to [a person] who humbly seeks the truth.” He said of testimony and the Holy Ghost, who brings that revelation, “Its convincing power is so great that there can be no doubt left in the mind when the Spirit has spoken. It is the only way that a person can truly know that Jesus is the Christ and that his gospel is true.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p15" pid="vAXyGCQcXkixNQsRWonn8Q" hash="JHsyjA">You have felt that inspiration for yourselves. It may have been to confirm one part of the gospel, as it was for me tonight. When I heard the words from the thirteenth article of faith about “being honest, true, chaste, [and] benevolent,” it was for me as if the Lord spoke them. I felt again that those are His attributes. I felt that Joseph Smith was His prophet. So for me those were not just words.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p16" pid="pX4v_XN1I0-mrE5I_7_oPQ" hash="Od6TCQ">In my mind I saw the dusty roads of Judea and the Garden of Gethsemane. In my heart I felt at least something of what it would have been like to kneel as Joseph did before the Father and the Son in a grove of trees in New York. I couldn’t see in my mind a light above the brightness of the sun at noonday as he did, but I did feel the warmth and wonder of a testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p17" pid="N7CMyMm1EECViNdBHXZuFA" hash="l7pjnA">Testimony will come to you in pieces as parts of the whole truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ are confirmed. For instance, as you read and ponder the Book of Mormon, verses you have read before will appear new to you and bring new ideas. Your testimony will grow in breadth and in depth as the Holy Ghost confirms that they are true. Your living testimony will expand as you study, pray, and ponder in the scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p18" pid="oP6QtqByP0OdG13J_CZ99A" hash="gfg_ew">The best description for me of how to gain and keep this living testimony has already been referred to. It is in the 32nd chapter of Alma in the Book of Mormon. You may have read it many times. I find new light in it every time I read it. Let’s review the lesson it teaches once again tonight.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p19" pid="58kUPfSfeEOPW6dUgHS9Jw" hash="2_6l2w">We are taught in those inspired passages to begin our quest for testimony with “a particle of faith” and with desire for it to grow.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Tonight you have felt faith and that desire as you listened to stirring talks of the Savior’s kindness, His honesty, and of the purity His commandments and Atonement made possible for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p20" pid="-8JsVMUAjEecFNPDLZKQow" hash="VpeHbQ">So a seed of faith is already planted in your heart. You may even have felt some of the expansion of your heart promised in Alma. I did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p21" pid="R67OUpNhuU2rgXZBuIYdug" hash="G8mzGA">But, like a growing plant, it must be nurtured or it will wither. Frequent and heartfelt prayers of faith are crucial and needed nutrients. Obedience to the truth you have received will keep the testimony alive and strengthen it. Obedience to the commandments is part of the nourishment you must provide for your testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p22" pid="vmxlqoIBm0SKJN1gp1bPTw" hash="ZQ9pcA">You remember the promise of the Savior: “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p23" pid="3jngCpcJakiPMfUsuKCMgg" hash="fnK96w">That has worked for me, as it will for you. One of the doctrines of the gospel I was taught when I was young is that the greatest of all the gifts of God is eternal life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> I learned that part of eternal life is to live together in love in families forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p24" pid="8Q_y4W5zh0yBAY78jmfjyQ" hash="XJQBvQ">From the first time that I heard those truths and they were confirmed to my heart, I felt obligated to make every choice I could to avoid contention and seek peace in my family and in my home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p25" pid="sXyPdqLzbk2dti4-5EB0iQ" hash="W19W2Q">Now, only after this life can I enjoy the fulness of that greatest of all blessings, eternal life. But amidst the challenges of this life, I have been given at least glimpses of what my family in heaven can be like. From those experiences my testimony of the reality of the sealing power exercised in temples has grown and been strengthened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p26" pid="ScOJsPLwkkCwYG_k218vWg" hash="fzmg3Q">Watching my two daughters be baptized in the temple for their ancestors has drawn my heart to them and to those ancestors whose names we found. The promise of Elijah that hearts would be turned to each other in families has been granted to us.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> So faith for me has become certain knowledge, as we are promised in the book of Alma.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/a-living-testimony.p27" pid="pGRUMWPsGUWci9NAStpxWg" hash="OoBf7A">I have experienced at least some of the joy which my ancestors felt when the Savior came into the spirit world after His mortal ministry.

He loves His children in need and also those who want to help. And He has created ways to bless both those who need help and those who will give it.</p>

Those pleas have reached Him since He placed men and women on the earth.</p>

Your heart is often stirred with feelings of sympathy. When you meet someone struggling to find employment, you feel that desire to help. You feel it when you go into the home of a widow and see that she has no food. You feel it when you see photographs of crying children sitting in the ruins of their home destroyed by an earthquake or by fire.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p4" pid="xJ0XYcHcLEuspyRkciXY9Q" hash="q8n_Eg">Because the Lord hears their cries and feels your deep compassion for them, He has from the beginning of time provided ways for His disciples to help.

Sometimes it may be a sudden feeling of sympathy for someone in need. A father may have felt it when he saw a child fall and scrape a knee. A mother may have felt it when she heard the frightened cry of her child in the night. A son or a daughter may have felt sympathy for someone who seemed sad or afraid at school.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p11" pid="sXsFIC4YpkKUBuklVqG-bA" hash="8dBSuA">All of us have been touched with feelings of sympathy for others we don’t even know. For instance, as you heard reports of the waves rushing across the Pacific after the earthquake in Japan, you felt concern for those who might be hurt.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p12" pid="nnWRu5wgV0CKO9nyPYJvLg" hash="I3hsYQ">Feelings of sympathy came to thousands of you who learned of the flooding in Queensland, Australia. The news reports were mainly estimates of numbers of those in need. But many of you felt the pain of the people. The wake-up call was answered by 1,500 or more Church member volunteers in Australia who came to help and to comfort.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p13" pid="M-OMym-WnkOjEJhlKCAwpg" hash="NInhmQ">They turned their feelings of sympathy into a decision to act on their covenants. I have seen the blessings that come to the person in need who receives help and to the person who seizes the opportunity to give it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p14" pid="DO9t6HiRcUOhMBYF1eTYwg" hash="XMMmVQ">Wise parents see in every need of others a way to bring blessings into the lives of their sons and daughters. Three children recently carried containers holding a delicious dinner to our front door. Their parents knew that we needed help, and they included their children in the opportunity to serve us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p15" pid="yG5XK3Uh5EWH_q0zCczRng" hash="c23kuQ">The parents blessed our family by their generous service. By their choice to let their children participate in the giving, they extended blessings to their future grandchildren. The smiles of the children as they left our home made me confident that will happen. They will tell their children of the joy they felt giving kindly service for the Lord. I remember that feeling of quiet satisfaction from childhood as I pulled weeds for a neighbor at my father’s invitation. Whenever I am invited to be a giver, I remember and believe the lyrics “Sweet is the work, my God, my King.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p16" pid="Jzgaf0-sAUmM7QsCfrRtFw" hash="FO7Zsw">I know those lyrics were written to describe the joy that comes from worshipping the Lord on the Sabbath. But those children with the food at our door were feeling on a weekday the joy of doing the Lord’s work. And their parents saw the opportunity to do good and spread joy over generations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p17" pid="KX5Frub7ukOO2MayIDQe8Q" hash="kNPQaA">The Lord’s way of caring for the needy provides another opportunity for parents to bless their children. I saw it in a chapel one Sunday. A small child handed the bishop his family’s donation envelope as he entered the chapel before the sacrament meeting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p18" pid="-zGJ1qFQIkO1vSzkoP-e1w" hash="Qwn_EQ">I knew the family and the boy. The family had just learned of someone in the ward in need. The boy’s father had said something like this to the child as he placed a more generous fast offering than usual in the envelope: “We fasted today and prayed for those in need. Please give this envelope to the bishop for us. I know that he will give it to help those with greater needs than ours.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p19" pid="27Sncf-LxEKSn19l7Bxnhg" hash="_R77Qg">Instead of any hunger pangs on that Sunday, the boy will remember the day with a warm glow. I could tell from his smile and the way he held the envelope so tightly that he felt the great trust of his father to carry the family offering for the poor. He will remember that day when he is a deacon and perhaps forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p20" pid="9bkZ0IldOkyauWqh6ka-Ng" hash="n8a5dA">I saw that same happiness in the faces of people who helped for the Lord in Idaho years ago. The Teton Dam burst on Saturday, June 5, 1976. Eleven people were killed. Thousands had to leave their homes in a few hours. Some homes were washed away. And hundreds of dwellings could be made habitable only through effort and means far beyond that of the owners.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p21" pid="MsAQTw-KTEyH8zS7_kpn6w" hash="ZThxJQ">Those who heard of the tragedy felt sympathy, and some felt the call to do good. Neighbors, bishops, Relief Society presidents, quorum leaders, home teachers, and visiting teachers left homes and jobs to clean out the flooded houses of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p22" pid="1sT5sM4Zb0GaPyqv22aRgw" hash="_2CpIw">One couple returned to Rexburg from a vacation just after the flood. They didn’t go to see their own house. Instead, they found their bishop to ask where they could help. He directed them to a family in need.</p>

It may not have been in the wake of a great natural disaster. I have seen it in a priesthood quorum where a brother rises to describe the needs of a man or a woman who seeks an opportunity to work to support himself or herself and his or her family. I could feel sympathy in the room, but some suggested names of people who might employ the person who needed work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p25" pid="lmqp5sAHBkuPA-GYhuwNxw" hash="nx78pQ">What happened in that priesthood quorum and what happened in the flooded houses in Idaho is a manifestation of the Lord’s way to help those in great need become self-reliant. We feel compassion, and we know how to act in the Lord’s way to help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p26" pid="Cx4watAZIEumzMSB1cK6PQ" hash="6FEU7w">We celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Church welfare program this year. It was started to meet the needs of those who lost employment, farms, and even homes in the wake of what became known as the Great Depression.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p27" pid="sKl2E0tgREO9y1bFwHFTJQ" hash="WdooAA">Great temporal needs of the children of Heavenly Father have come again in our time as they have and as they will in all times. The principles at the foundation of the Church welfare program are not for only one time or one place. They are for all times and all places.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p28" pid="ew_4MLhSMEKNzVtcOUL7Dg" hash="VOxRKA">Those principles are spiritual and eternal. For that reason, understanding them and putting them down into our hearts will make it possible for us to see and take opportunities to help whenever and wherever the Lord invites us.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p30" pid="QuGqZ-nGvEqjtCuIiYTJpw" hash="BlK7JA">First, all people are happier and feel more self-respect when they can provide for themselves and their family and then reach out to take care of others. I have been grateful for those who helped me meet my needs. I have been even more grateful over the years for those who helped me become self-reliant. And then I have been most grateful for those who showed me how to use some of my surplus to help others.</p>

With that surplus I have been able to learn that it really is better to give than to receive. That is partly because when we give help in the Lord’s way, He blesses us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p32" pid="AU3R6WUqU06IJ8gO1G2YbQ" hash="An8rRA">President Marion G.

When we join hands to serve people in need, the Lord unites our hearts. President J. Reuben Clark Jr. put it this way: “That giving has … brought … a feeling of common brotherhood as men of all training and occupation have worked side by side in a Welfare garden or other project.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p35" pid="b23xxBOGuEGMviGS4FQIDA" hash="kQOR3w">That increased feeling of brotherhood is true for the receiver as well as the giver. To this day, a man with whom I shoveled mud side by side in his flooded Rexburg home feels a bond with me. And he feels greater personal dignity for having done all he could for himself and for his family. If we had worked alone, both of us would have lost a spiritual blessing.</p>

Your sons and daughters who work with you to serve others in need will be more likely to help each other when they are in need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p37" pid="f9QUNcUoLk21RHXMryULoA" hash="_q7x7A">The fourth valuable principle of Church welfare I learned as a bishop. It came from following the scriptural command to seek out the poor. It is the duty of the bishop to find and provide help to those who still need assistance after all they and their families can do. I found that the Lord sends the Holy Ghost to make it possible to “seek, and ye shall find”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> in caring for the poor as He does in finding truth. But I also learned to involve the Relief Society president in the search. She may get the revelation before you do.</p>

To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Church welfare program, members worldwide will be invited to participate in a day of service. Leaders and members will seek revelation as they design whatever the projects will be.</p>

Only if hearts are softened by the Savior’s Atonement can you see clearly the goal of the project as blessing both spiritually and temporally the lives of the children of Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p41" pid="onNvDWvUuESSlvn0fBU8bQ" hash="_urDQA">My second suggestion is to choose as recipients of your service people within the kingdom or in the community whose needs will touch the hearts of those who will give the service. The people they serve will feel their love. That may do more to make them feel glad, as the song promised, than will meeting only their temporal needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p42" pid="XdI6E62tzUycrc297YGfQg" hash="jdA3Dw">My last suggestion is to plan to draw on the power of the bonds of families, of quorums, of auxiliary organizations, and of people you know in your communities. The feelings of unity will multiply the good effects of the service you give. And those feelings of unity in families, in the Church, and in communities will grow and become a lasting legacy long after the project ends.</p>

By the loving service you have given for the Lord, I have been the recipient of the thanks of people you have helped as I have met them across the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p44" pid="C5D_5_1hlkmRwnQRy6lKXw" hash="_ExCyg">You found a way to lift them higher as you helped in the Lord’s way. You and humble disciples of the Savior like you have cast your bread upon the water in service, and the people you helped have tried to give me a loaf of gratitude in return.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p45" pid="J2QfZZ29iUCWecqxHe3j-w" hash="RRZ1-A">I get that same expression of appreciation from people who have worked with you. I remember one time standing next to President Ezra Taft Benson. We had been talking about welfare service in the Lord’s Church. He surprised me with his youthful vigor when he said, pumping his hand, “I love this work, and it is work!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/opportunities-to-do-good.p46" pid="SQqi3jKgqEmnp3q0Vtz_JQ" hash="7GtE3w">For the Master I extend thanks for your work to serve the children of our Heavenly Father. He knows you, and He sees your effort, diligence, and sacrifice. I pray that He will grant you the blessing of seeing the fruit of your labors in the happiness of those you have helped and with whom you have helped for the Lord.</p>

I know that Jesus is the Christ. You and those you serve can be purified and strengthened by serving Him and keeping His commandments. You can know as I know, by the power of the Holy Ghost, that Joseph Smith was God’s prophet to restore the true and living Church, which this is. I testify that President Thomas S. Monson is the living prophet of God. He is a great example of what the Lord did: going about doing good. I pray that we may seize our opportunities to “lift up the hands [that] hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We are in many different places tonight and at many stages in our priesthood service. Yet with all the variety of our circumstances, we have a need in common. It is to learn our duties in the priesthood and to grow in our power to perform them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p2" pid="GXBjGkKp7kSFc_2UxICo6A" hash="HBf7IQ">As a deacon I felt keenly that need. I lived in a tiny branch of the Church in New Jersey, on the East Coast of the United States. I was the only deacon in the branch—not just the only one attending but the only one on the records. My older brother, Ted, was the only teacher. He is here tonight.</p>

There I found three wonderful things in place to speed my growth in the priesthood. The first was a president who knew how to sit in council with the members of his quorum. The second was great faith in Jesus Christ that led to the great love we have heard of—love for each other. And the third was a shared conviction that our overarching priesthood purpose was to labor for the salvation of men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p4" pid="MdbR05prxUmkdin3n2yctw" hash="JGmSGg">It wasn’t the well-established ward that made the difference. What was there in that ward could be anywhere, in whatever unit of the Church you are in.</p>

For others you may not feel the need for growth, so these helps may be invisible to you. Either way, I pray that the Spirit will help me make them clear and attractive to you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p6" pid="w8E5oKIHXUaATMStGR4a0A" hash="isIwmw">My purpose in speaking of these three aids to growing in the priesthood is to urge you to value them and to use them. If you do, your service will be transformed for the better. And if it is magnified, your priesthood service will bless Heavenly Father’s children more than you can now imagine is possible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p7" pid="i8IaG5wW4UuA_ZTXbiVdYQ" hash="_b_eLg">I found the first when I was welcomed into a priests quorum, with the bishop as our president. That may seem a small, unremarkable thing to you, but it gave me a sense of power in the priesthood that has changed my service in the priesthood ever since. It began by the way he led us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p8" pid="QwZOSVDgbkGaXswdkKg_Cg" hash="RnyIKQ">As near as I could tell, he treated the opinions of young priests as if we were the wisest men in the world. He waited until all who would speak had spoken. He listened. And when he decided what should be done, it seemed to me that the Spirit confirmed the decisions to us and to him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p9" pid="FWKNiolITU2bcborS0nvVw" hash="Se1ZrA">I realize now I had felt what the scripture means when it says that the president is to sit in council with the members of his quorum.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> And years later as I was a bishop with my priests quorum, both they and I were taught by what I had learned as a young priest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p10" pid="-DmAzVK4JE633N94ZtpgDA" hash="dzD91w">Twenty years later as a bishop, I had the opportunity to see the effectiveness of a council not just in the meetinghouse but also in the mountains. During a Saturday activity, a member of our quorum had been lost in the forest overnight. As far as we knew, he was alone and without warm clothes, food, or shelter. We searched for him without success.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p11" pid="Xuffr8ZbBE6-42FkQVsRtw" hash="kOS4Yw">My memory is that we prayed together, the priests quorum and I, and I then asked each to speak. I listened intently, and it seemed to me that they did too, to each other. After a while, a feeling of peace settled on us. I felt that our lost quorum member was safe and dry somewhere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p12" pid="8MMPbDwAjUCD-BxXjok5VA" hash="lFCfiw">It became clear to me what the quorum was to do and not to do. When the people who found him described the place in the woods where he had gone for safety, I felt that I recognized it. But the larger miracle for me was to see a united priesthood council’s faith in Jesus Christ bringing revelation to the man with the priesthood keys. We all grew that day in the power of the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p13" pid="fnWytx-O8U2TuDc2HxNSQg" hash="lvRZpw">The second key to increased learning is to have love for each other that comes from great faith. I am not sure which comes first, but both always seem to be there whenever there is great and rapid learning in the priesthood. Joseph Smith taught that to us by example.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p14" pid="QstjesADhEaHTIDLVfb9IQ" hash="jItDVw">In the early days of the Church in this dispensation, he received a command from God to build strength in the priesthood. He was directed to create schools for priesthood holders. The Lord set the requirement that there be love for each other among those who were to teach and to be taught. Here are the words of the Lord about creating a place of priesthood learning and what it was like for those who were to learn in it:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p15" pid="xxWyAbjeXEOGAlnBpjqXjQ" hash="72m06g">“Organize yourselves; … establish a house … of learning, … a house of order. …</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p17" pid="ilbRG8znEkusHoNMc7s4fg" hash="AealcA">The Lord is describing what we have already seen is the strength of a priesthood council or a class to bring revelation by the Spirit. Revelation is the only way we can come to know that Jesus is the Christ. That great faith is the first rung on the ladder we climb to learn the principles of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p18" pid="7zTLnNSEjkS4n-mZHDnmsg" hash="sZaZ3Q">In section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, in verses 123 and 124, the Lord stressed love for each other and not finding fault with each other. Each gained entry into the priesthood school established by the Lord’s prophet by making a covenant with uplifted hands to be a “friend and brother … in the bonds of love.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Again I have seen it as both a cause and an effect of learning gospel truths. Love invites the Holy Ghost to be present to confirm truth. And the joy of learning divine truths creates love in the hearts of people who shared the experience of learning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p20" pid="Tp_dOdK_HEi3co34m9Y2Mw" hash="mbc2_g">The reverse is true as well. Discord or jealousy inhibits the ability of the Holy Ghost to teach us and inhibits our ability to receive light and truth. And the feelings of disappointment that invariably follow are the seeds of greater discord and faultfinding among those who expected a learning experience that did not come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p21" pid="8DAi-fxJcUms55LaQ8QZeQ" hash="WrvHIA">The priesthood holders who learn well together always seem to me to have great peacemakers among them. You see peacemaking in priesthood classes and in councils. It is the gift to help people find common ground when others are seeing differences. It is the peacemaker’s gift to help people see that what someone else said was a contribution rather than a correction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p22" pid="pndj9ZEiJU2kRzXmcfGs_Q" hash="XlDXLA">With enough of the pure love of Christ and a desire to be peacemakers, unity is possible in priesthood councils and in classes. It takes patience and humility, but I have seen it happen even when issues are difficult and the people in councils or classes come from vastly different backgrounds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p23" pid="DVR-uiAiYUOzEvzEgEFR9g" hash="ejbKAQ">It is possible to rise to the lofty standard set by the Lord for priesthood holders in making decisions in quorums. It is possible when there is great faith and love and the absence of contention. Here is the Lord’s requirement for His endorsement of our decisions: “And every decision made by either of these quorums must be by the unanimous voice of the same; that is, every member in each quorum must be agreed to its decisions, in order to make their decisions of the same power or validity one with the other.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p24" pid="YjrTcdA9zES0TIJobDvSlQ" hash="fkFRuA">The third aid to learning in the priesthood comes with a shared conviction about why the Lord blesses and trusts us to hold and to exercise His priesthood. It is to labor for the salvation of men. This shared conviction brings unity in quorums. We can begin to learn about this from the scriptural account of how we spirit sons were prepared before birth for this rare honor of holding the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p25" pid="3XbwsBGtU0GDLFgYFfCKgA" hash="CmSKOg">Speaking of those given great priesthood trust in this life, the Lord said, “Even before they were born, they, with many others, received their first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

We must do more than learn that this is our duty. It must go down into our hearts so deeply that neither the many demands on our efforts in the bloom of life nor the trials that come with age can turn us from that purpose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/learning-in-the-priesthood.p27" pid="uaPfgh5tbke34uhsFHRnwQ" hash="M7OpGA">Not long ago I visited a high priest in his home. He is no longer able to come to our quorum meetings. He lives alone. His beautiful wife died, and his children live far away from him. Time and illness limit his ability to serve. He still lifts weights to keep what he can of his once-powerful strength.</p>

As I got up to leave, the nurse who comes to his home a few hours every day walked in from another room. During our private conversation, he had told me a little about her. He said she was wonderful.

He motioned toward her and said with a smile, “See, I can’t seem to do anything. I have been trying to get her baptized into the Church, but it hasn’t worked.” She smiled back at him and at me. I walked outside and turned toward my home nearby.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="56"></span>My dear brethren, it is a joy for me to be with you in this worldwide meeting of the priesthood of God. Tonight I will speak of priesthood preparation, both our own and that which we help provide for others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p2" guid="71b23bb3-7ba3-4333-84c6-c045ba377fd4" pid="N4i1l5LoO0CR3YHTWyk2YA" hash="_Gm3RQ">Most of us must wonder to ourselves at times, “Am I prepared for this assignment in the priesthood?” My answer is, “Yes, you have been prepared.” My purpose today is to help you recognize that preparation and draw courage from it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p3" guid="81d96feb-95fb-4766-a9be-bef23d334471" pid="hQEEd9pr1UifCrRgKpU12Q" hash="uMwqDA">As you know, the Aaronic Priesthood is designated as a preparatory priesthood. The great majority of Aaronic Priesthood holders are young deacons, teachers, and priests between 12 and 19 years of age.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p4" guid="b15faff6-fa0c-4240-9d79-f1463dca6a11" pid="pdvo3wzqPUmzfCNQ3wf8sA" hash="yFHaoA">We may come to think of priesthood preparation as occurring in the Aaronic Priesthood years. But our Heavenly Father has been preparing us since we were taught at His knee in His kingdom before we were born. He is preparing us tonight. And He will continue to prepare us as long as we will let Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p5" guid="171d5e22-da25-4ca5-a810-0d59963adf31" pid="kddJ-qThF0m1fK_28scsvw" hash="ziWKMQ">The purpose of all priesthood preparation, in the premortal life and in this life, is to fit us, and those we serve for Him, for eternal life. Some of the first lessons in the premortal life surely included the plan of salvation, with Jesus Christ and His Atonement at its center. We were not only taught the plan but were in councils where we chose it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p6" guid="e0b432c5-7250-40b5-8679-10c08267390e" pid="tPelGGhxeUKy7ZbKuQeQXg" hash="lVDtNQ">Because a veil of forgetfulness was placed over our minds at birth, we have had to find a way to relearn in this life what we once knew and defended. Part of our preparation in this life has been to find that precious truth so that we can then recommit to it by covenant. That has required faith, humility, and courage on our part as well as help from people who had found the truth and then shared it with us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p7" guid="b465fe71-e7d1-4b3d-adba-5858c2aa89d9" pid="npuUhTzKkE25kXZ8lVoBMA" hash="K96rxw">It may have been parents, missionaries, or friends. But that help was part of our preparation. Our priesthood preparation always includes others who have already been prepared to <span class="pageBreak" page-number="57"></span>offer us the opportunity to accept the gospel and then choose to act by keeping covenants to get them down into our hearts. For us to qualify for eternal life, our service in this life must include working with all our heart, might, mind, and strength to prepare others to return to God with us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p8" guid="030a2962-702c-43f1-841d-0288ef0083e7" pid="TVV1te4SQku0jCj4hFgUVQ" hash="GO62Yw">So part of the priesthood preparation we will have in this life will be opportunities to serve and teach others. It may include being teachers in the Church, wise and loving fathers, members of a quorum, and missionaries for the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord will offer the opportunities, but whether we are prepared will depend on us. My intent tonight is to point out some of the crucial choices necessary for priesthood preparation to succeed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p9" guid="73380447-ee4d-4a6d-9f4d-ce247f60c434" pid="40UalibQsUCJJsNt1BM6pQ" hash="x-KXcg">Good choices both by the person training and the one being trained depend on some understanding of how the Lord prepares His priesthood servants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p10" guid="51611109-c4f4-429d-b392-31e9b1809111" pid="oQGzxLpSIUydpLVxQ8rpdQ" hash="g4KCUg">First, He calls people, young and old, who may appear to worldly eyes, and even to themselves, to be weak and simple. The Lord can turn those apparent shortcomings into strengths. That will change the way the wise leader chooses whom to train and how to train. And it can change how the priesthood holder responds to the development opportunities he is offered.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p11" guid="40d55118-52f5-422f-b10e-dea0b2e79a5c" pid="f5rFoU0uZUu9vQXjnPxdoQ" hash="FO2z3Q">Let’s consider some examples. I was an inexperienced priest in a large ward. My bishop called me on the phone one Sunday afternoon. When I answered, he said, “Do you have time to go with me? I need your help.” He explained only that he wanted me to go as his companion to visit a woman I did not know, who was without food and who needed to learn how to manage her finances better.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p12" guid="45bf5c4e-c783-4fb2-966e-6cee081c5be3" pid="5heK4SBWxEex91WYJV44rQ" hash="5S5Rfg">Now, I knew that he had two seasoned counselors in his bishopric. Both were mature men of great experience. One counselor was the owner of a large business, who later became a mission president and a General Authority. The other counselor was a prominent judge in the city.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p13" guid="efc1e47a-0092-46aa-b5a5-8d9f22f1dd4d" pid="tum8OcXkbEOnB8q3vsE-kw" hash="YIEb1A">I was the bishop’s newly called first assistant in the priests quorum. He knew that I understood little about welfare principles. I knew even less about financial management. I had not yet written a check; I had no bank account; I hadn’t even seen a personal budget. Yet, despite my inexperience, I sensed that he was deadly serious when he said, “I need your help.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p14" guid="f1580045-651b-4b4a-9216-c2a62567fb6a" pid="edOM41L9jkCinCKSQChlSg" hash="Scs-9A">I have come to understand what that inspired bishop meant. He saw in me a golden opportunity to prepare a priesthood holder. I am sure that he did not foresee in that untrained boy a future member of the Presiding Bishopric. But he treated me that day, and all the days I knew him over the years, as a preparation project of great promise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p15" guid="a7af9226-f28e-49b6-803c-ce31c1754b7e" pid="H9CNomQZXUqfM3uEBCeHUw" hash="Cv_PIw">He seemed to enjoy it, but it was work for him. On our return to my home after we visited the widow in need, he parked the car. He opened his well-worn and heavily marked scriptures. And he gave me kindly correction. He told me that I needed to study the scriptures and learn more. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="58"></span>But he must have seen that I was weak and simple enough to be teachable. To this day I remember what he taught that afternoon. But even more, I remember how confident he was that I could learn and be better—and that I would.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p16" guid="91dcc5b8-54cb-400e-872b-08c1c93b87c6" pid="HYlp6jO6RE2UG_sISr12NA" hash="jaqTeA">He saw beyond the reality of who I was to the possibilities that lie inside someone who feels weak and simple enough to want the Lord’s help and to believe that it will come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p17" guid="b2a740ff-2a84-46f4-aadb-b16e9696158d" pid="4gK1qa0J0k6E1kfFUdpmCg" hash="a4BjUA">Bishops, mission presidents, and fathers can choose to act on those possibilities. I saw it happen recently in a fast meeting as a deacons quorum president bore his testimony. He was about to become a teacher and leave his quorum members behind him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p18" guid="e404531c-59e2-48d0-93ec-c844aa23f964" pid="_vzJunm-b0WVocRxqPqZ8A" hash="j1PtGQ">He testified with great feeling in his voice of the growth in goodness and power in the members of his quorum. I’ve never heard a person praise an organization more wonderfully than he did. He praised their service. And then he said that he knew that he had been able to help the new deacons when they felt overwhelmed because he had felt overwhelmed when he came into the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p19" guid="343bdfb9-cf7d-42e8-993d-50ff272e2877" pid="MfG3pckz3kGlK1fBjwPKPg" hash="Wh-F2w">His feelings of weakness had made him more patient, more sympathetic, and therefore better able to strengthen and serve others. In those two years in the Aaronic Priesthood, it seemed to me, he had become seasoned and wise. He had learned that he was helped as a quorum president by a clear and vivid memory of his own needs when he was two years younger. His challenge in the future in his leadership and ours will come when such memories fade and grow dim through time and our success.</p>

He encouraged and instructed him in his own priesthood preparation and in helping the Lord prepare others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p21" guid="c747d128-0983-4f39-aa1d-5fd2d6581d16" pid="T-SxYPAjekq_uf2Z7I_abg" hash="lRubiA">Listen to what Paul said to Timothy, his younger companion:</p>

For instance, our muscles and our brains age as we do. Our capacity to learn and remember what we have read will diminish.

He got a phone call at his hotel from President Spencer W. Kimball. It was late at night after what was a hard day of work for my brother and surely for President Kimball, who began the conversation this way. He said, “I heard that you were in town. I know it’s late and that you may be in bed, but could you help me? I need you as my companion to see the condition of all our chapels in this city.” My brother went with him that night, lacking knowledge of chapel maintenance or anything about chapels and not knowing why President Kimball would be doing such a thing after his long day or why he needed any help.</p>

I was then the new commissioner of education for the Church. I knew that President Gordon B. Hinckley was staying somewhere in that same hotel on his separate assignment to Japan. I answered the ringing phone just after I had lain down on the bed to sleep, exhausted by having done all I thought I had the strength to do.</p>

But somehow he made me feel that he needed my help.</p>

Monson, at the end of almost every meeting, asks the secretary to the First Presidency, “Am I up to date on my work?” And he always smiles when the answer comes back: “Oh, yes, President, you are.” President Monson’s pleased smile sends me a message. It makes me think, “Is there something more I could do on my assignments?” And then I go back to my office to work.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p39" guid="39c84059-ec91-4ed6-a00f-6064623ddc85" pid="PLOp6vtmPkivwpG4FrUZGw" hash="UI9ZIQ">I saw evidence of that in a Church Board of Education meeting. President Spencer W. Kimball by then had given years of service while enduring a series of health challenges only Job would understand. He was chairing the meeting that morning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p40" guid="22d436f9-6d94-48a9-bd5b-b6b26999ca80" pid="gJcNaypOH0uiPmmTGkbl8A" hash="9vY1Jw">Suddenly, he stopped speaking. He slumped in his chair. His eyes closed. His head fell on his chest. I was seated near him. Elder Holland was next to us. The two of us rose to help him. Inexperienced as we were in emergencies, we decided to carry him, still seated in his chair, to his nearby office.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/preparation-in-the-priesthood-i-need-your-help.p41" guid="5e03ea1f-6b16-4036-be51-f671ebef9d98" pid="5kWCxcNoz0KXi42IDOBKOw" hash="zpGLJQ">He became our teacher in that moment of his extremity. With one of us lifting each side of his chair, we went out of the meeting room into the hallway of the Church Administration Building. He half opened his eyes, still dazed, and said, “Oh, please be careful. Don’t hurt your backs.” As we got near his office door, he said, “Oh, I feel terrible that I interrupted the meeting.” Minutes after we got him into his office, still not knowing what his problems were, he looked up at us and said, “Don’t you think you ought to go back to the meeting?”</p>

President Kimball had since his childhood pushed himself beyond his limits of endurance to serve and to love the Lord. It was a habit so ingrained that it was there when he needed it. He was prepared. And so he was able to teach and show us how to be prepared to keep the oath and covenant: by steady preparation over the years, through all our strength in what might appear to be little tasks with small consequences.</p>

I promise you if you do all that you can, God will magnify your strength and your wisdom. He will season you. I promise you that those whom you train and set an example for will praise your name as I have this day the great trainers I have known.</p>

He knows you. He and His resurrected and glorified Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to an inexperienced boy, Joseph Smith. They trusted him with the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel and of the true Church. They encouraged him when he needed it. They let him feel loving chastening when it would bring him down to lift him up. They prepared him and They are preparing us for the strength to keep working toward the celestial glory that is the aim and the reason of all priesthood service.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="68"></span>I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to you on this Sabbath in a general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Every member of the Church has the same sacred charge. We accepted it and promised to rise to it as we were baptized. We learn from the words of Alma, the great Book of Mormon prophet, what we promised God that we would become: “Willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p2" guid="7d6977f6-47f7-459e-85c9-e4383c74ea23" pid="dPNnsH7ovkmJP0uwgqlA7g" hash="lQiWNA">That is a lofty charge and a glorious promise from God. My message today is of encouragement. Just as the Book of Mormon makes the charge plain to us, it also directs us upward on the path to eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p3" guid="dae2ca77-736f-476b-84ca-81967d0a2b3b" pid="X3v84DLSY0u5qtfTU2_wHg" hash="SDIZ5A">First, we promised to become charitable. Second, we promised to become witnesses of God. And third, we promised to endure. The Book of Mormon is the best guide to learn how well we are doing and how to do better.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p4" guid="a122b3ae-885d-453a-8827-b6ee7d55a695" pid="6glYiuHMZk6iQ0EQzWLhcA" hash="txBjBQ">Let’s begin with becoming charitable. I will remind you of recent experiences. Many of you participated in a day of service. There were thousands of them organized across the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p5" guid="1a4eb79c-2886-4133-984e-f0b1b39b0af9" pid="Igqngk6p0UyhMarO-J8W7Q" hash="Zmzz-w">A council of your fellow Saints prayed to know what service to plan. They asked God to know whom we should serve, what service to give, and whom to invite to participate. They may even have prayed not to forget shovels or drinking water. Above all, they prayed that all who gave service and all who received it would feel the love of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p6" guid="038cfb77-9903-4183-84f3-a4c2a7f8c0b1" pid="cCsfIzNrn0So4V7cHSSitQ" hash="AGitVw">I know those prayers were answered in at least one ward. More than 120 members volunteered to help. In three hours they transformed the grounds of a church in our community. It was hard and happy work. The ministers of the church expressed gratitude. All who worked together that day felt unity and greater love. Some even said that they felt joy as they pulled weeds and trimmed shrubbery.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p7" guid="2020bc71-6019-45af-bf14-11c51f01c62a" pid="lo7KKO7DckKcjqyatE3EYQ" hash="F3zpgw">Words from the Book of Mormon helped them know why they felt that joy. It was King Benjamin who said to his people, “Learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are … in the service of your God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> And it was Mormon who taught in his words in the Book of Mormon, “Charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p8" guid="d7482635-8f7f-42d7-851a-e350f85b2286" pid="sJMvdsW_BkW8BDLbWEQ8xw" hash="EOEQqA">The Lord is keeping His promise to you as you keep yours. As you serve others for Him, He lets you feel His love. And in time, feelings of charity become part of your very nature. And you will receive the assurance of Mormon in your heart as you persist in serving others in life that all will be well with you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p9" guid="391a8400-7a4b-456c-a30e-5a1b7fe6a66e" pid="09a4uq2JKkmQK924OuROmA" hash="a1Etww">Just as you promised God to become charitable, you promised to be His witness wherever you may be throughout your life. Again, the Book of Mormon is the best guide I know to help us keep that promise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p10" guid="3195283a-2895-49d6-9143-c4a9b9ba5958" pid="qouSWV8BsECBwNmsxM7ctg" hash="lFnJ3Q">I was once invited to speak at graduation services at a university. The university president had wanted President Gordon B. Hinckley to be invited but found that he was unavailable. So by default I got the invitation. I was then a junior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p11" guid="10e1b705-c131-4478-82a9-504722ac40a8" pid="tReeQVSqSUOc1JhMQt9I_w" hash="SXlOIw">The person who invited me to speak became anxious as she learned more about my obligations as an Apostle. She called me on the phone and said that she now understood that my duty was to be a witness of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p12" guid="533d5708-b29d-41cb-9071-729f7e333b6d" pid="VWyJf_fOgk-rnU8uTqNopA" hash="GulMQA">In very firm tones she told me that I could not do that when I spoke there. She explained that the university respected people of all religious beliefs, including those who denied the existence of a God. She repeated, “You cannot fulfill your duty here.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p13" guid="7f5ef44a-08af-4daf-bcc8-e4e4bf1636b3" pid="sM5rF3l220G7EYgiGStvug" hash="YmDFYA">I hung up the phone with serious questions in my mind. Should I tell the university that I would not keep my agreement to speak? It was only two weeks before the event. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="69"></span>My appearance there had been announced. What effect would my failing to keep my agreement have on the good name of the Church?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p14" guid="60a96889-e030-437d-8820-317fdfbb7219" pid="UQu_z6ceSkKFtuaCC5eGRQ" hash="FOODEQ">I prayed to know what God would have me do. The answer came in a surprising way to me. I realized that the examples of Nephi, Abinadi, Alma, Amulek, and the sons of Mosiah applied to what I was. They were bold witnesses of Jesus Christ in the face of deadly peril.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p15" guid="89d1ba91-4a49-4840-9946-517f650cdd1f" pid="NJRBmbEuDEqeFPhi3iqAiw" hash="hkiCPQ">So the only choice to be made was how to prepare. I dug into everything I could learn about the university. As the day of the talk grew closer, my anxiety rose and my prayers intensified.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p16" guid="12d81d2d-2593-4a06-ac9a-59be409ef14c" pid="RE3XKwSDiEafGVJteS9VbA" hash="fnhdQA">In a miracle like the Red Sea parting, I found a news article. That university had been honored for doing what the Church has learned to do in our humanitarian efforts across the world. And so in my talk I described what we and they had done to lift people in great need. I said that I knew that Jesus Christ was the source of the blessings that had come into the lives of those we and they had served.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p17" guid="64b81254-3390-427c-a6ae-2e5bcb026336" pid="4Nw7V7Hv6kGLNEGNrepeGg" hash="XcaZUg">After the meeting the audience rose to applaud, which seemed a little unusual to me. I was amazed but still a little anxious. I remembered what happened to Abinadi. Only Alma had accepted his witness. But that night, at a large formal dinner, I heard the university president say that in my talk he heard the words of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p18" guid="4ef2ff86-b0e9-4e67-a534-30f7cb0e8752" pid="FVChMneLukCPCATyRkJe8Q" hash="JlBI3g">Now, such a miraculous deliverance is rare in my experience as a witness of Christ. But the effect of the Book of Mormon on your character, power, and courage to be a witness for God is certain. The doctrine and the valiant examples in that book will lift, guide, and embolden you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p19" guid="f81be900-971d-4866-8b17-3423b0afd902" pid="hwmyrz1Suk6aLhKIuPq4Hw" hash="571IaQ">Every missionary who is proclaiming the name and gospel of Jesus Christ will be blessed by daily feasting from the Book of Mormon. Parents who struggle to get a witness of the Savior into the heart of a child will be helped as they seek for a way to bring the words and the spirit of the Book of Mormon into the home and all the lives in their family. That has proven true for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p20" guid="83691191-ec2f-4252-a055-aa9b94633c22" pid="lt6uUqE29kG9jnlgxhbpbA" hash="YuubJA">I can see that miracle is happening in every sacrament meeting and every class I attend in the Church. Speakers and teachers show a love and mature understanding of the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon. And personal testimonies clearly come from deep within their hearts. They teach with increased conviction and bear witness with power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p21" guid="b154e1cb-5a0e-456a-8259-d519c27cc04e" pid="b23RqAwywEG2n2QvLODOug" hash="jwoLPQ">I see evidence as well that we are doing better in the third part of the promise we all made at baptism. We covenanted to endure, to keep the commandments of God as long as we live.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p22" guid="6e17e65c-6f68-4ffd-a3d1-372c3cda2c11" pid="5vhYkm1220yrACHHh37t1A" hash="ozzVUw">I visited the hospital room of an old friend who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. I took with me my two young daughters. I did not expect that she would even be able to recognize them. Her own family were gathered, standing around her bed as we entered.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p23" guid="0fece8c8-8ea3-4399-a12f-4d8af32036a0" pid="4pP3lA0ddEOrsf1VjcNU9A" hash="TDYgcw">She looked up and smiled. I will always remember her look as she saw that we had brought our daughters with us. She motioned them to come close to her on the bed. She sat up, held them, and introduced them to her family. She spoke of the greatness of those two little girls. It was as if she were presenting princesses to a royal court.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p24" guid="b0673e0c-acec-4cda-a327-ab942ac6c68e" pid="CEWwNpCzZkeZ4N1qd95igw" hash="MpE4XQ">I expected our visit to end quickly. Surely, I thought, she is tired. But as I watched, it was as if the years melted away. She was radiant and obviously filled with love for all of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p25" guid="425df22b-e585-4394-b3ce-3aabcd50e608" pid="n2SY44ZZkEyNvNEy5rsgqA" hash="qLcSUw">She seemed to savor the moment as if time had stopped. She had spent <span class="pageBreak" page-number="70"></span>most of her life succoring children for the Lord. She knew from the account in the Book of Mormon that the resurrected Savior had taken little children one by one, blessed them, and then wept for joy.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> She had experienced that joy long enough herself to be able to endure in His loving service to the end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p26" guid="7a82ac5c-a951-487a-9223-7fe421ffa170" pid="kfs2IUeA5UOdBzUCKhQoOg" hash="K_lt_g">I saw that same miracle in the bedroom of a man who had given sufficient faithful service to think that he had done enough to rest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p27" guid="1fb5cab6-bf84-4798-a631-6d9a3a8a5d42" pid="Zln75NhhWk-Hheu2wBn9Rw" hash="RU-U8Q">I knew that he had undergone lengthy and painful treatment for a disease and had been told by the doctors that it was terminal. They offered neither treatment nor hope.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p28" guid="12924676-784c-4185-b96a-84e87fa3733f" pid="hyMpoq0xDUWZUQOLTIODJA" hash="pk0ClA">His wife took me to his bedroom in their home. There he was, lying on his back on the top of the carefully made-up bed. He wore a freshly pressed white shirt, a tie, and new shoes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p29" guid="7cb69bb5-8b42-46ff-8463-1705edd49f23" pid="LR7mRERsw0GtXabjUPUQcA" hash="hpqLmA">He saw the look of surprise in my eyes, laughed quietly, and explained, “After you give me a blessing, I want to be ready to respond to the call to take up my bed and go to work.” As it turned out, he was ready for the interview he would soon have with the Master, for whom he had worked so faithfully.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p30" guid="bcc0c22b-4f9f-4d0e-af72-ea75926e7bf6" pid="nDAYTHhVyU66zfmxT-vrag" hash="gULbAQ">He was an example of the fully converted Latter-day Saints I meet often after they have given a life of dedicated service. They press on.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p31" guid="095d6cfa-3588-4f58-af05-7528d9ba9711" pid="pli9j00_OkmhzBaD5YvvXw" hash="CKib8g">President Marion G. Romney described it this way: “In one who is wholly converted, desire for things [contrary] to the gospel of Jesus Christ has actually died, and substituted therefor is a love of God with a fixed and controlling determination to keep his commandments.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p32" guid="8b52a487-7494-4ba4-a831-3504fb78f079" pid="AuMheGv-c0qs0FoOw2wWkw" hash="PfjJZQ">It is that fixed determination I see more and more often in the seasoned disciples of Jesus Christ. Like the sister greeting my daughters and the man in the new shoes ready to get up and march, they follow the Savior’s command to the end. All of you have seen it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p33" guid="4ee7b2b1-1eb6-4f1b-9bed-33936c13a051" pid="yvo-Fx_dyUiBqCBbGyfqoA" hash="k1J7BA">You can look at it again if you return to the Book of Mormon. I still feel admiration in my heart when I read these words of an aging and determined servant of God: “For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord … doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p34" guid="c0fa39d2-b2ac-43bd-9a78-3c2a0bb1fa99" pid="lj_a6og8Xk6IDf1mc11jow" hash="As48tw">You can take courage as I do from the example of endurance given us by Moroni. He was alone in his ministry. He knew the end of life was near for him. And yet listen to what he wrote for the sake of people not yet born and the descendants of his mortal enemies: “Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p35" guid="c1cf33d9-dc10-4b1a-b104-64e67bdd87a8" pid="jMUJsClCsUOKLRecljEZ_w" hash="Zvr5CQ">Moroni gave that witness as the valedictory to his life and ministry. He urged charity, as do the prophets throughout the Book of Mormon. He added his witness of the Savior when death loomed before him. He was a truly converted child of God, as we can be: filled with charity, constant and fearless as a witness of the Savior and His gospel, and determined to endure to the end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/a-witness.p36" guid="876d71af-52b3-4d2a-828f-f9d1c9a9903b" pid="jWZIdek4V0KzsOxqXqPQgA" hash="dqFSqw">Moroni taught us what that requires of us. He said that the first step to full conversion is faith. Prayerful study of the Book of Mormon will build faith in God the Father, in His Beloved Son, and in His gospel. It will build your faith in God’s prophets, ancient and modern.</p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="23"></span>I heard President Spencer W. Kimball, in a session of conference, ask that God would give him mountains to climb. He said: “There are great challenges ahead of us, giant opportunities to be met. I welcome that exciting prospect and feel to say to the Lord, humbly, ‘Give me this mountain,’ give me these challenges.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p6" pid="mU1xR7qg00KBtTWGO0Uilw" hash="lCBIhA">My heart was stirred, knowing, as I did, some of the challenges and adversity he had already faced. I felt a desire to be more like him, a valiant servant of God. So one night I prayed for a test to prove my courage. I can remember it vividly. In the evening I knelt in my bedroom with a faith that seemed almost to fill my heart to bursting.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p7" pid="_1XDOfVvaEyDks1b3AeQpw" hash="_hGl7A">Within a day or two my prayer was answered. The hardest trial of my life surprised and humbled me. It provided me a twofold lesson. First, I had clear proof that God heard and answered my prayer of faith. But second, I began a tutorial that still goes on to learn about why I felt with such confidence that night that a great blessing could come from adversity to more than compensate for any cost.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p8" pid="mCvApoOpd0ae6dIDgQd9Mw" hash="i70GvA">The adversity that hit me in that faraway day now seems tiny compared to what has come since—to me and to those I love. Many of you are now passing through physical, mental, and emotional trials that could cause you to cry out as did one great and faithful servant of God I knew well. His nurse heard him exclaim from his bed of pain, “When I have tried all my life to be good, why has this happened to me?”</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p9" pid="vs5pUMl2g0WofJ2TlRMUlw" hash="PxmUqg">You know how the Lord answered that question for the Prophet Joseph Smith in his prison cell:</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p10" pid="NQv8LlMv0Uqbe2nCI5ZJoA" hash="P_b0iw">“And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p11" pid="GdYooA25J0WKVMb1gStccQ" hash="hauWCw">“The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p12" pid="1RhzpqUxZEKjtH8CC1ozNA" hash="u86hEA">“Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p13" pid="8pQcP6CZ6ESjiFY9CpB0GA" hash="uK2GFw">There seems to me no better answer to the question of why trials come and what we are to do than the words of the Lord Himself, who passed through trials for us more terrible than we can imagine.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p14" pid="6hw0ZNQhpk6tqQ-FWvIWeQ" hash="I6h1cg">You remember His words when He counseled that we should, out of faith in Him, repent:</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p15" pid="7bEfaYE8vEmav1XS55lwww" hash="f58XPA">“Therefore I command you to repent—repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore—how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p16" pid="SH3TIQJoWUSEUgvUENC1KQ" hash="1zQS0w">“For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</p>

Monson has taught us to help us and those we serve in what seem lonely and overwhelming trials.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p21" pid="QSdahUE69EO68lMEdXNvow" hash="oVSIdw">But President Monson has also wisely taught that a foundation of faith in the reality of those promises takes time to build. You may have seen the need for that foundation, as I have, at the bedside of someone ready to give up the fight to endure to the end. If the foundation of faith is not embedded in our hearts, the power to endure will crumble.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p22" pid="ZvBRXCux5EqsNw9jDm65gA" hash="9Vt-0A">
      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="24"></span>My purpose today is to describe what I know of how we can lay that unshakable foundation. I do it with great humility for two reasons. First, what I say could discourage some who are struggling in the midst of great adversity and feel their foundation of faith is crumbling. And second, I know that ever-greater tests lie before me before the end of life. Therefore, the prescription I offer you has yet to be proven in my own life through enduring to the end.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p23" pid="Sg5eHV7QuE-pOCE_FM-KVg" hash="OgCnCQ">As a young man I worked with a contractor building footings and foundations for new houses. In the summer heat it was hard work to prepare the ground for the form into which we poured the cement for the footing. There were no machines. We used a pick and a shovel. Building lasting foundations for buildings was hard work in those days.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p24" pid="UIwC16Y5MEWsbssHtEPHQA" hash="6qMiNw">It also required patience. After we poured the footing, we waited for it to cure. Much as we wanted to keep the jobs moving, we also waited after the pour of the foundation before we took away the forms.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p25" pid="q9Y1XlW1skmsXzsVdf6oFA" hash="EAsQjA">And even more impressive to a novice builder was what seemed to be a tedious and time-consuming process to put metal bars carefully inside the forms to give the finished foundation strength.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p26" pid="k9CZ1LKRkUuLRMLEwgJbZg" hash="R1jRoQ">In a similar way, the ground must be carefully prepared for our foundation of faith to withstand the storms that will come into every life. That solid basis for a foundation of faith is personal integrity.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p27" pid="svuUVz9EvkWG32BeViZlwg" hash="UDr7GA">Our choosing the right consistently whenever the choice is placed before us creates the solid ground under our faith. It can begin in childhood since every soul is born with the free gift of the Spirit of Christ. With that Spirit we can know when we have done what is right before God and when we have done wrong in His sight.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p28" pid="M0buckw2BEyAERyf6yGi8w" hash="9wCB2Q">Those choices, hundreds in most days, prepare the solid ground on which our edifice of faith is built. The metal framework around which the substance of our faith is poured is the gospel of Jesus Christ, with all its covenants, ordinances, and principles.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p29" pid="7EBewnLLZEe5Ctf3M9IHNQ" hash="FbJncw">One of the keys to an enduring faith is to judge correctly the curing time required. That is why I was unwise to pray so soon in my life for higher mountains to climb and greater tests.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p30" pid="8hJkQX0SdkumbOHHSwtW6g" hash="IzvWvg">That curing does not come automatically through the passage of time, but it does take time. Getting older does not do it alone. It is serving God and others persistently with full heart and soul that turns testimony of truth into unbreakable spiritual strength.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p31" pid="WVKqJg60dkGL_GKwUZy-NQ" hash="q0uEIQ">Now, I wish to encourage those who are in the midst of hard trials, who feel their faith may be fading under the onslaught of troubles. Trouble itself can be your way to strengthen and finally gain unshakable faith. Moroni, the son of Mormon in the Book of Mormon, told us how that blessing could come to pass. He teaches the simple and sweet truth that acting on even a twig of faith allows God to grow it:</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p32" pid="H-AcwI3nm0ycmGdMJ9iVbQ" hash="13Fccw">“And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p33" pid="B0VnuCwFZEy5lQ5A5Eqlcw" hash="JE-3hQ">“For it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our fathers, after <span class="pageBreak" page-number="25"></span>he had risen from the dead; and he showed not himself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore, it must needs be that some had faith in him, for he showed himself not unto the world.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p34" pid="Nxm_J3tfuEeCOwPs75dnTg" hash="4FucgA">“But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might hope for those things which they have not seen.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p35" pid="gmD4GocfMku5y7qflcARmQ" hash="PpHnzQ">“Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye will but have faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p36" pid="6yQaQZyZJUGKeTkAfsLVmA" hash="U4ox8w">That particle of faith most precious and which you should protect and use to whatever extent you can is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Moroni taught the power of that faith this way: “And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p37" pid="YDurbnbHI0GLTE4wS0tcAg" hash="jExNDA">I have visited with a woman who received the miracle of sufficient strength to endure unimaginable losses with just the simple capacity to repeat endlessly the words “I know that my Redeemer lives.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> That faith and those words of testimony were still there in the mist that obscured but did not erase memories of her childhood.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p38" pid="xeCinZj7pkOTmz4BWnFm5w" hash="rWhRTg">I was stunned to learn that another woman had forgiven a person who had wronged her for years. I was surprised and asked her why she had chosen to forgive and forget so many years of spiteful abuse.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p39" pid="kGuq1y9a7k60XfDzXwZLhw" hash="B1tqIQ">She said quietly, “It was the hardest thing I have ever done, but I just knew I had to do it. So I did.” Her faith that the Savior would forgive her if she forgave others prepared her with a feeling of peace and hope as she faced death just months after she had forgiven her unrepentant adversary.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p40" pid="XOfvrgX-wEiVpgIb0yZL3w" hash="OfXNrA">She asked me, “When I get there, how will it be in heaven?”</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p41" pid="34hR4z0rwkqXFSrjMgRB2A" hash="OrGgZA">And I said, “I know just from what I have seen of your capacity to exercise faith and to forgive that it will be a wonderful homecoming for you.”</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p42" pid="t8hkEUAltU-k8Y7_sADvGQ" hash="rILkBA">I have another encouragement to those who now wonder if their faith in Jesus Christ will be sufficient for them to endure well to the end. I was blessed to have known others of you who are listening now when you were younger, vibrant, gifted beyond most of those around you, yet you chose to do what the Savior would have done. Out of your abundance you found ways to help and care for those you might have ignored or looked down upon from your place in life.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p43" pid="7cX701LJp0C5dh3XwabGrg" hash="olKRUQ">When hard trials come, the faith to endure them well will be there, built as you may now notice but may have not at the time that you acted on the pure love of Christ, serving and forgiving others as the Savior would have done. You built a foundation of faith from loving as the Savior loved and serving for Him. Your faith in Him led to acts of charity that will bring you hope.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p44" pid="oCdGwmIHh02eQ-GEkTrgVQ" hash="7uRlZw">It is never too late to strengthen the foundation of faith. There is always time. With faith in the Savior, you can repent and plead for forgiveness. There is someone you can forgive. There is someone you can thank. There is someone you can serve and lift. You can do it wherever you are and however alone and deserted you may feel.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p45" pid="JDwrzx6lOkKfmPJw2o5d9A" hash="koQL4Q">I cannot promise an end to your adversity in this life. I cannot assure you that your trials will seem to you to be only for a moment. One of the characteristics of trials in life is that they seem to make clocks slow down and then appear almost to stop.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/mountains-to-climb.p46" pid="OfovakZIY0-_AG_3JhtmIw" hash="mdjfrw">There are reasons for that. Knowing those reasons may not give much comfort, but it can give you a feeling <span class="pageBreak" page-number="26"></span>of patience. Those reasons come from this one fact: in Their perfect love for you, Heavenly Father and the Savior want you fitted to be with Them to live in families forever. Only those washed perfectly clean through the Atonement of Jesus Christ can be there.</p>

Among the tributes he paid, I remember one that went something like this: “Some of you may have thought that Mildred suffered so long and so much because of something she had done wrong that required the trials.” He then said, “No, it was that God just wanted her to be polished a little more.” I remember at the time thinking, “If a woman that good needed that much polishing, what is ahead for me?”</p>

In all conditions, we can choose the right with the guidance of the Spirit. We have the gospel of Jesus Christ to shape and guide our lives if we choose it. And with prophets revealing to us our place in the plan of salvation, we can live with perfect hope and a feeling of peace. We never need to feel that we are alone or unloved in the Lord’s service because we never are. We can feel the love of God.

He and his wife love their two small children, a boy and a girl.

Those keys belong to the President of the Church—to the prophet, seer, and revelator. That sacred sealing power is with the Church now. Nothing is regarded with more sacred contemplation by those who know the significance of this authority. Nothing is more closely held.

Ballard: “We may deceive men but we cannot deceive the Holy Ghost, and our blessings will not be eternal unless they are also sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise. The Holy Ghost is one who reads the thoughts <span class="pageBreak" page-number="64"></span>and hearts of men, and gives his sealing approval to the blessings pronounced upon their heads.

    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/families-under-covenant.p28" pid="1iGxgBInv0SMpQwEfXISlA" hash="Qg-i9g">That experience gave his words great power for me and my wife when, in a conference session on April 6, 1972, President Joseph Fielding Smith gave the following counsel: “It is the will of the Lord to strengthen and preserve the family unit.

    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/families-under-covenant.p30" pid="K-tD37gaZEmTTAvdsYkp4Q" hash="GbWI_w">First, gain and keep a sure witness that the keys of the priesthood are with us and held by the President of the Church. Pray for that every day. The answer will come with an increase in determination to lead your family, in your feelings of hope, and with greater happiness in your service. You will be more cheerful and optimistic, a great blessing for your wife and family.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/families-under-covenant.p31" pid="CjAU4KfdVkCb4UeMkcZ0IQ" hash="ZcuwSQ">The second imperative is to love your wife. It will take faith and humility to put her interests above your own in the struggles of life. You have the responsibility to provide for and to nurture the family with her while serving others. That can at times consume all the energy and strength you have. Age and illness may increase your wife’s needs. If you choose even then to put her happiness above your own, I promise you that your love for her will increase.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/families-under-covenant.p32" pid="vbwZFrYMK0mN9aZz7IWCSw" hash="BkG-LQ">Third, enlist the entire family to love each other. President Ezra Taft Benson taught:</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/families-under-covenant.p33" pid="RcoD3ZZ3ZU6iDVJNtNKYxw" hash="xhbIuA">“In an eternal sense, salvation is a family affair. …</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/families-under-covenant.p34" pid="ZbaaDEmQc0i0_boq8h5FCw" hash="Mt4w3A">“Above all else, children need to know and feel they are loved, wanted, and appreciated. They need to be assured of that often. Obviously, this is a role parents should fill, and most often the mother can do it best.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/families-under-covenant.p35" pid="aw_hwLNIU0yDrOsPrjhHfw" hash="uM9Few">But another crucial source for that feeling of being loved is love from other children in the family. Consistent care of brothers and sisters for each other will come only with persistent effort by parents and the help of God. You know that is true from experience in your own families. And it is confirmed each time you read of the family conflicts faced by righteous Lehi and his wife, Sariah, in the Book of Mormon record.</p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="65"></span>The successes they won provide a guide for us. They taught the gospel of Jesus Christ so well and so persistently that children and even some descendants over generations had hearts softened toward God and toward each other. For instance, Nephi and others wrote and reached out to family members who had been their enemies. The Spirit at times softened the hearts of thousands and replaced hatred with love.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/families-under-covenant.p37" pid="3Ps7oe_g-EGZEjmxoTyrew" hash="h-RrHQ">One way for you to reproduce the successes of Father Lehi is by the way you lead family prayers and family time, such as family home evenings. Give children opportunities to pray, when they can pray, for each other in the circle who need blessings. Discern quickly the beginnings of discord and recognize acts of unselfish service, especially to each other. When they pray for each other and serve each other, hearts will be softened and turned to each other and to their parents.</p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="60"></span>I’m so grateful for this opportunity to be in this great priesthood meeting, to have heard such wonderful teaching and testimony. It made me think of my own experience. Almost everything that I’ve been able to accomplish as a priesthood bearer is because individuals who knew me saw things in me that I couldn’t see.</p>

For the boys, I knew they could have priesthood opportunities. For the girls, I knew they would give service representing the Lord. All would be doing His work. I knew each was an individual, and therefore the Lord would have given them specific gifts for each to use in His service.</p>

But I can promise you that you will bless them to help them recognize the spiritual gifts with which they were born. Every person is different and has a different contribution to make. No one is destined to fail. As you seek revelation to see gifts God sees in those you lead in the priesthood—particularly the young—you will be blessed to lift their sights to the service they can perform. With your guidance, those you lead will be able to see, want, and believe they can achieve their full potential for service in God’s kingdom.</p>

And then I tried to help them visualize, hope, and work for this future. I carved a board for each son with a quotation from scripture that described his special gifts and an image that represented this gift. Beneath the picture and the legend, I carved the dates of each boy’s baptism and ordination into priesthood offices, with his height marked at the date of each milestone.</p>

We were living in Idaho near the base of the South Teton mountain, where we hiked together and watched the eagles <span class="pageBreak" page-number="61"></span>soar. That picture in my mind gave me the feeling of Isaiah’s words:</p>

In the challenges of the mission field, some of what he faced seemed to be above his reach. For the boy you lift, it may be, as it was for my son, that the Lord lifted him higher in preaching the gospel in a difficult language than I had thought possible. If you will try with any young man to sense his priesthood possibilities, I promise you the Lord will tell you as much as you need.

The legend I carved on each of those breadboards read, “J’aime et J’espere,” French for “I love and I hope.” The evidence of their unique spiritual gifts appeared not just on the boards I carved but more clearly as we distributed them to those who needed, in the midst of pain or loss, reassurance that the love of the Savior and His Atonement could produce a perfect brightness of hope.

I learned to carve only with the help of a kind and gifted mentor, then-Elder Boyd K. Packer. What little skill I achieved can be attributed to his great gift as a carver and his patience as a teacher. Only heaven can provide such a mentor as President Packer. But there are many ways you can shape children’s hearts without carving wooden boards or height boards for them.</p>

My wife helps me do this. We begin by talking by telephone with grandchildren or children we can reach. We ask them to share stories of their personal successes and their service rendered. We also invite them to send photos of those activities. We use those photos to illustrate a few paragraphs of text. We add one or two verses from the Book of Mormon. Perhaps Nephi and Mormon wouldn’t be very impressed by the spiritual quality of our content or the limited effort required to create what we call “The Family Journal: The Small Plates.” But Sister Eyring and I are blessed by the effort. We feel inspired in selecting the passages of scripture and the brief messages of testimony we write. And we see evidence in their lives of their hearts being turned toward us and to the Savior and upward.</p>

Your habits of family prayer and scripture reading will create more lasting memories and greater changes of heart than you may realize now. Even apparently temporal activities, such as attending an athletic event or watching a movie, can shape a child’s heart. What matters is not the activity but the feelings that come as you do it. I have discovered a good test for identifying activities with the potential to make a great difference in a young person’s life. It is that they suggest the activity out of an interest they feel has come to them as a gift from God. I know that is possible from my own experience.</p>

And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Many of us, in moments of personal anguish, feel that God is far from us. The pavilion that seems to intercept divine aid does not cover God but occasionally covers us. God is never hidden, yet sometimes we are, covered by a pavilion of motivations that draw us away from God and make Him seem distant and inaccessible. Our own desires, rather than a feeling of “Thy will be done,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> create the feeling of a pavilion blocking God. God is not unable to see us or communicate with us, but we may be unwilling to listen or submit to His will and His time.</p>

That is not easy in a world where the opinions of other human beings can have such an effect on our motives.

She went with her family to the open house of the Brigham City Temple in Utah. In one of the rooms of that beautiful building, she looked around and asked, “Mommy, where is Jesus?” Her mother explained that she would not see Jesus in the temple, but she would be able to feel His influence in her heart. Eliza carefully considered her mother’s response and then seemed satisfied and said, “Oh, Jesus is gone helping someone,” she concluded.</p>

And from what she knows of the Savior, she knew that He would be somewhere doing good for His Father’s children.

In the early years of my career, I worked hard to secure a tenured professorship at Stanford University. I thought I had made a good life for myself and for my family. We lived close to my wife’s parents in very comfortable surroundings. By the world’s standards, I had achieved success. But I was given by the Church the chance to leave California and go to Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho. My lifetime professional objectives might have been a pavilion dividing me from a loving Father who knew better than I did what my future could hold. But I was blessed to know that whatever success I had in my career and family life to that point was a gift from God. And so, like a child, I knelt in prayer to ask what I should do. I was able to hear a quiet voice in my mind that said, “It’s my school.” There was no pavilion shielding me from God. In faith and humility, I submitted my will to His and felt His care and closeness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/where-is-the-pavilion.p11" pid="0kxrcdGEb0WUiEDully2pg" hash="sKW53Q">My years at Ricks College, during which I tried to seek God’s will and do it, kept the pavilion from covering me or obscuring God’s active role in my life. As I sought to do His work, I felt close to Him and felt assurance that He knew of my affairs and cared deeply for my happiness. But as they had at Stanford, worldly motivations began to present themselves to me. One was an attractive job offer, extended just as I was finishing my fifth year as <span class="pageBreak" page-number="73"></span>president of Ricks College. I considered the offer and prayed about it and even discussed it with the First Presidency. They responded with warmth and a little humor but certainly not with any direction. President Spencer W. Kimball listened to me describe the offer I had received from a large corporation and said: “Well, Hal, that sounds like a wonderful opportunity! And if we ever needed you, we’d know where to find you.” They would have known where to find me, but my desires for professional success might have created a pavilion that would make it hard for me to find God and harder for me to listen to and follow His invitations.</p>

I said, “That’s good enough for me.” But she insisted, wisely, that I must get my own revelation. And so I prayed again. This time I did receive direction, in the form of a voice in my mind that said, “I’ll <span class="emphasis">let</span> you stay at Ricks College a little longer.” My personal ambitions might have clouded my view of reality and made it hard for me to receive revelation.</p>

God knew that dam would burst and that hundreds of people would need help. He let me seek counsel and gain His permission to stay at Ricks College. He knew all the reasons that my service might still be valuable at the college and in Rexburg. So I was there to ask Heavenly Father frequently in prayer that He would have me do those things that would help the people whose property and lives had been damaged. I spent hours working with other people to clear mud and water from homes. My desire to know and do His will gave me a soul-stretching opportunity.</p>

I thought I had spent enough time in my service in Rexburg and was in a hurry to move on. Sometimes our insistence on acting according to our own timetable can obscure His will for us.</p>

She was a young mother of three who longed for more children. After two miscarriages, her prayers of pleading grew anguished. As more barren years passed, she felt tempted to anger. When her youngest went off to school, the emptiness of her house seemed to mock her focus on motherhood—so did the unplanned and even unwanted pregnancies of acquaintances. She felt as committed and consecrated as Mary, who declared, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> But although she spoke these words in her heart, she could hear nothing in reply.</p>

While he attended meetings, she walked along the beautiful, empty beach. Her heart <span class="pageBreak" page-number="74"></span>ready to burst, she prayed aloud. For the first time, she asked not for another child but for a divine errand. “Heavenly Father,” she cried, “I will give you all of my time; please show me how to fill it.” She expressed her willingness to take her family wherever they might be required to go. That prayer produced an unexpected feeling of peace. It did not satisfy her mind’s craving for certainty, but for the first time in years, it calmed her heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/where-is-the-pavilion.p21" pid="rkhn8rm-SUek0_VNWmqrKQ" hash="hukQHQ">The prayer removed the pavilion and opened the windows of heaven. Within two weeks she learned that she was expecting a child. The new baby was just one year old when a mission call came to my son and my daughter-in-law. Having promised to go and do anything, anywhere, she put fear aside and took her children overseas. In the mission field she had another child—on a missionary transfer day.</p>

Heaven had other purposes to fulfill first. Those purposes included not only building Abraham and Sarah’s faith but also teaching them eternal truths that they shared with others on their long, circuitous route to the land prepared for them. The Lord’s delays often seem long; some last a lifetime. But they are always calculated to bless. They need never be times of loneliness or sorrow or impatience.</p>

For any of you who now feel that He is hard to reach, I testify that the day will come that we all will see Him face to face. Just as there is nothing now to obscure His view of us, there will be nothing to obscure our view of Him. We will all stand before Him, in person. Like my granddaughter, we want to see Jesus Christ now, but our certain reunion with Him at the judgment bar will be more pleasing if we first do the things that make Him as familiar to us as we are to Him. As we serve Him, we become like Him, and we feel closer to Him as we approach that day when nothing will hide our view.</p>

I promise you that as you do, you will feel the love of the Savior <span class="pageBreak" page-number="75"></span>for that person and His love for you, and it will not seem to come from a great distance.

This is His Church. We take His name upon us as we enter His kingdom. He is God, the Creator, and perfect. We are mortals subject to death and sin. Yet in His love for us and our families, He invites us to be close to Him. Here are His words: “Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

The Savior made that promise and told us how, in our service to Him, He comes to us. One example is in a revelation to Oliver Cowdery as he served the Lord with the Prophet Joseph Smith in the translation of the Book of Mormon: “Behold, thou art Oliver, and I have spoken unto thee because of thy desires; therefore treasure up these words in thy heart. Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/come-unto-me.p51" pid="uLiav6tDM0eeodQneM4Xng" hash="9Ewq0g">You remember the Lord’s promise to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon when they were away from their families on His errands: “My friends Sidney and Joseph, your families are well; they are in mine hands, and I will do with them as seemeth me good; for in me there is all power.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/come-unto-me.p52" pid="OPntjVsM4kyskdwQWJPmOA" hash="mOn-3g">Like Alma and King Mosiah, some faithful parents have served the Lord long and well yet have had children who wandered despite their parents’ sacrifice for the Lord. They have done all they could to no apparent avail, even with help from loving and faithful friends.</p>

An angel came. Your prayers and the prayers of those who exercise their faith will bring the Lord’s servants to help your family members. They will help them choose the way home to God, even as they are attacked by Satan and his followers, whose purpose it is to destroy families in this life and in eternity.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/come-unto-me.p54" pid="TZ4xAgyMnUq91Fcj3VUbQQ" hash="B3zalQ">You remember the words spoken by the angel to Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah in their rebellion: “And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

But I can promise you that the Savior will draw close to you and bless you and your family with what is best. You will have the comfort of His love and feel the answer of His drawing closer as you reach out your arms in giving service to others. As you bind up the wounds of those in need and offer the cleansing of His Atonement to those who sorrow in sin, the Lord’s power will sustain you. His arms are outstretched with yours to succor and bless the children of our Heavenly Father, including those in your family.</p>

What He said to the few priesthood holders in 1831 He says to the many now. Whatever our age, capacity, Church calling, or location, we are as one called to the work to help Him in His harvest of souls until He comes again. He said to those first laborers in the vineyard:</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p6" pid="UhVu8HK_JkmD7RwtbKu3pA" hash="WvUG5g">“And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment, that every man, both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with the labor of his hands, to prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded.</p>

Since you know that the Lord always prepares a way to keep His commandments, you can expect that He will do that for each of you.</p>
				<span class="story">
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p10" pid="ZY8fuDkMmkyfO6ZkDjHxEQ" hash="354hPQ">Let me tell you of how He did it for one boy who now holds the office of priest in the Aaronic Priesthood. He is 16 years old. He lives in a country where the missionaries first arrived just a year ago. They were assigned to two cities but not to the city where the boy lives.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p11" pid="S99Zb1acu0qrTnMZ5m6qeA" hash="QRk49g">When he was very young, his parents brought him to Utah for safety. The family was taught and baptized by the missionaries. He was not baptized into the Church because he was not yet eight years of age.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p12" pid="9qH52meFYk2QkY0hxDy3ew" hash="3zP_4A">His parents were killed in an accident. So his grandmother had him return to his home, across the ocean, back to the city where he had been born.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p13" pid="ALH4d_L2xUOFjPbQhch95A" hash="9FW27w">He was walking on the street in March just a year ago when he felt that he should speak to a woman he did not know. He spoke with her in the English he still remembered. She was a nurse sent by the mission president to his city to look for housing and medical care for the missionaries who would be assigned there soon. He and she became friends as they talked. When she got back to the mission headquarters, she told the missionaries about him.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p14" pid="GwzZhD_jf0SivD2uHCdYaA" hash="MGoBtA">The first two elders arrived in September of 2012. The orphan boy was their first baptism into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. By March of this year he had been a member for four months. He had been ordained a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood and so could baptize the second convert to the Church. He was the first priesthood pioneer to gather other children of Heavenly Father with him to establish the Church in a city of approximately 130,000 people.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p15" pid="Wdtx293YQEemmp7IKtlXUA" hash="ZizohQ">On Easter Sunday, March 31, 2013, the Church membership there had grown to the huge number of six members in that city. He was the only local member who attended the meeting that Sunday. His knee had been injured the day before, but he was determined to be there. He had prayed that he would be able to walk to church. And so he was there. He shared the sacrament with four young elders and a missionary couple—the total congregation.</p>
				</span>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p16" pid="35DB5SDKYES6IQX3Ox3T7Q" hash="kKolSA">That story does not seem remarkable unless you recognize in it the pattern of God’s hand in building His kingdom. I have seen it many times.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p17" pid="eTw_Ag_xf02PfMv-KovBXA" hash="jwg8Sg">I saw it in New Mexico as a young man. For generations the prophets have told us that we must help the missionaries find and teach the honest in heart and then love those who come into the kingdom.</p>
				<span class="story">
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p18" pid="Ak5C_e0TPkyiwOx-4BsnBQ" hash="mjJAFw">I have seen for myself what faithful priesthood leaders and members can do. In 1955 I became an officer in the United States Air Force. My bishop at home gave me a blessing just before I left for my first station, which was in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p19" pid="9A9TX8V3UUmKpg50_FIsKA" hash="1yWAfQ">In his blessing he said that my time in the air force would be missionary service. I arrived in church on my first Sunday at the Albuquerque First Branch. A man walked up to me, introduced himself as the district <span class="pageBreak" page-number="63"></span>president, and told me that he was going to call me to serve as a district missionary.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p20" pid="hRYuoG57sU644_Xfx-JT4w" hash="6AMojQ">I told him that I would be there for training for only a few weeks and then I would be assigned somewhere else in the world. He said, “I don’t know about that, but we are to call you to serve.” In the middle of my military training, by what appeared to be chance, I was chosen from hundreds of officers being trained to take the place in headquarters of an officer who had died suddenly.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p21" pid="wI4W2-67NUC0VVD8A95KYQ" hash="92GxRg">So, for the two years I was there, I worked in my office. On most evenings and every weekend, I taught the gospel of Jesus Christ to people the members brought to us.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p22" pid="UhV-y_7P_EaV907fSARkcg" hash="4_KQ4w">My companions and I averaged more than 40 hours a month in our missionary service without once having to knock on doors to find someone to teach. The members filled our plates so full that we often taught two families in an evening. I saw for myself the power and the blessing in the repeated call of prophets for every member to be a missionary.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p23" pid="uhcEQ57ARku-AQeJHq4v3w" hash="VsmblA">On the last Sunday before I left Albuquerque, the first stake was organized in that city. There is now a sacred temple there, a house of the Lord, in a city where we once met in a single chapel with Saints who brought friends to us to be taught and to feel the witness of the Spirit. Those friends felt a welcoming home in the Lord’s true Church.</p>
				</span>
				<span class="story">
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p24" pid="NAmXMUua3ESauiTxdF1KJw" hash="65Mf-g">I saw it next in New England as I went to school. I was called as the counselor to a great district president who had been brought from disinterest in the Church to a man of great spiritual power. His home teacher loved him enough to ignore his cigar and see what God could see in him. The district president and I drove over the hills and along the shores to visit tiny branches that dotted Massachusetts and Rhode Island to build and bless the kingdom of God.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p25" pid="Vp7aA8Gfdk6fMsk_h1hhpg" hash="PhIlyA">In the years I served with that great leader, we watched people draw friends to the Church by their example and by their invitation to listen to the missionaries. To me the growth of those branches seemed slow and faltering. But on the Sunday I left, five years later, two Apostles came to organize our district into a stake in the Longfellow Park chapel in Cambridge.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p26" pid="tYm6No7t9UKQGeGuKyKolA" hash="8Vsa8w">Years later I returned to conduct a stake conference there. The stake president took me to see a rocky hill in Belmont. He told me it would be a perfect place for a temple of God. One stands there now. When I gaze on it, I remember the humble members I sat with in tiny branches, the neighbors they invited, and the missionaries who were teaching them.</p>
				</span>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p27" pid="9T1xxnM6n0GRqAMtd4VSnA" hash="9_G9PQ">There is a new deacon in this meeting here tonight. I was with him <span class="pageBreak" page-number="64"></span>on the same Easter Sunday that the priest whom I spoke of previously walked to his one-member meeting. The deacon beamed as his father said that he would be in this priesthood meeting with him tonight. This father was a great missionary in the same mission where his father had been the president. I have seen the 1937 <span class="emphasis">Missionary Handbook</span> of his great-grandfather. His heritage in bringing people to the Church runs deep.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p28" pid="fx3XgEDRu0amNFx8ZPw32Q" hash="BHWU8w">So I spoke with that deacon’s bishop to learn what experiences the boy might expect in meeting the charge of the priesthood to work in the gathering of souls for the Lord. The bishop was enthusiastic as he described how the ward mission leader tracked the progress of investigators. He gets that information from regular contact with the missionaries.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p29" pid="igy3mJ-T5EmZ8kGoJuTHiA" hash="wS07qg">The bishop and his ward council discuss every progressing investigator. They decide what they can do for each person and their families to help them become friends before baptism, to include them in activities, and to nurture those who are baptized. He said the missionaries on occasion have enough appointments to teach that they take Aaronic Priesthood holders as companions.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p30" pid="EP4DtYL_TEqf7NE3hhtjyw" hash="X4ioWQ">The ward mission plan includes the goals of the quorums to invite those they know to meet with the missionaries. Even the deacons quorum presidency is invited to set goals and plan for their quorum members to help bring those they know into the kingdom of God.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p31" pid="bir25TOBVUeyTVgckTfthA" hash="VfpdHQ">Now, the deacon in the strong ward and the new priest—the convert—in the tiny member group may seem to have little in common with each other or with you. And you may not see much similarity with your experiences in building up the Church with what I saw as miracles in New Mexico and in New England.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p32" pid="fiwrrbX2sk-vflZR9SfpfQ" hash="C6BxSA">But there is one way in which we are one in our charge in the priesthood. We sanctify ourselves and fulfill our individual duties to the commandment to take the gospel to all of our Heavenly Father’s children.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p33" pid="fbtusDXPvUC6UpT5b1ANvg" hash="grhmog">We share experiences in the way in which the Lord builds His kingdom on earth. In His Church, with all the wonderful tools and organization we have been given, there is still a fundamental truth taught by prophets of how we are to fulfill our priesthood mandate of missionary work.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p34" pid="k5TvW6RQvk6uSw1YOZY4ug" hash="EbkXJg">In the 1959 April general conference, President David O. McKay taught this principle, as have the prophets since his day, including President Thomas S. Monson. President McKay related in his closing comments that in 1923 in the British Mission, there was a general instruction sent out to the members of the Church. They were told not to spend money on advertising to combat the bad feelings of the people against the Church. President McKay said the decision was: “Throw the responsibility upon every member of the Church that in the coming year of 1923 every member will be a missionary. Every member a missionary! You may bring your mother into the Church, or it may be your father; perhaps your fellow companion in the workshop. Somebody will hear the good message of the truth through you.”</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p35" pid="b65E2R5ns0Olh-vSRVfjgg" hash="9kX7Rw">And President McKay continued: “And that is the message today. <span class="emphasis">Every member</span>—a million and a half—<span class="emphasis">a missionary!</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p36" pid="l1oyAhJvOU-cec7li7aU7w" hash="pDAOdA">When it was announced in 2002 that missionary work would become the responsibility of the bishops, I <span class="pageBreak" page-number="65"></span>marveled. I’d been one. It seemed to me they were already carrying a load close to their limits in ministering to the members and directing the organizations in the ward.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p37" pid="Kfj525VonEynUdfE-QwukA" hash="SHSwBQ">One bishop I knew saw it not as an added duty but as an opportunity to draw the ward together in a great cause where every member became a missionary. He called a ward mission leader. He met with the missionaries himself every Saturday to learn about their work, to encourage them, and to learn about the progress of their investigators. The ward council found ways for organizations and quorums to use service experiences as missionary preparation. And as a judge in Israel, he helped young people feel the blessings of the Atonement to keep them pure.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p38" pid="WT0NbJlcRUSOVQukjHGO3w" hash="5JECRQ">Recently I asked how he explained the surge of convert baptisms in his ward and the increase in the number of young people ready and eager to take the gospel of Jesus Christ out to the world. He said it seemed to him that it was not so much the duty anyone performed but the way they all became one in their enthusiasm to bring people into the community of Saints that had brought them such happiness.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p39" pid="1I8tVaZw7EygrNL9PK28gg" hash="8j83gg">For some it was that and more. Like the sons of Mosiah, they had felt the effects of sin in their own lives and the marvelous healing of the Atonement within the Church of God. Out of love and gratitude for the Savior’s gift to them, they wanted to help everyone they could to escape the sadness of sin, feel the joy of forgiveness, and gather with them to safety in the kingdom of God.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p40" pid="4PA84QD6u0y-e61a8j9Erg" hash="X9C1Zg">It was the love of God and the love for their friends and neighbors that unified them to serve the people. They desired to take the gospel to everyone in their part of the world. And they prepared their children to be worthy to be called by the Lord to teach, to testify, and to serve in other parts of His vineyard.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p41" pid="JbKAhlgRXkGV-keSSpMpOw" hash="1l-MQQ">Whether it is in the large ward where the new deacon will perform his duty to share the gospel and build up the kingdom or in the tiny group far away where the new priest serves, they will be one in purpose. The deacon will be inspired by the love of God to reach out to a friend not yet a member. He will include his friend in some service or activity in the Church and then invite him and his family to be taught by the missionaries. To those who are baptized, he will be the friend they will need.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p42" pid="zpR5xGlvTU6i9jZ-2LVOFQ" hash="gZihwg">The priest will invite others to join with him in the tiny group of Saints where he has felt the love of God and the blessed peace of the Atonement.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p43" pid="759AXCQASESVKf_aBVO7tQ" hash="TOkSmA">If he continues faithful in his priesthood duty, he will see the group become a branch, and then a stake of Zion will come to his city. There will be a ward with a caring bishop. It could be one of his sons or grandsons who will someday take a servant of God to a nearby hill and say, “This would be a wonderful place for a temple.”</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-are-one.p44" pid="57keHwli8EajzNZJRMzo1Q" hash="c49aIQ">I pray that wherever we are and whatever duties we have in the priesthood of God, we will be united in the cause to bring the gospel to all the world and that we will encourage people we love to be cleansed from sin and to be happy with us in the kingdom of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, whose Church this is, amen.</p>

To hold the priesthood of God is to be held responsible by God for the eternal lives of His children. That is real, that is wonderful, and at times that can feel overwhelming.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p6" pid="g0hvyCzlKUG8rtfg5PZfAQ" hash="pWZePQ">There are elders quorum presidents listening tonight who know what I mean. Here is what happened to one of you. It has likely happened to many of you—and more than once. The details may vary, but the situation is the same.</p>
		<span class="story">
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p7" pid="QyUi9mFS2UGy-rRo2W5jww" hash="Fch9ew">An elder you do not know well asked for your help. He had just found out that he had to move his wife and young baby boy today from the apartment where they have been living to another one nearby.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p8" pid="bHDjG5tzMkaU7zV0Q9LXvw" hash="5ekk0Q">He and his wife had already asked a friend if they could borrow a truck for the day to move their household and personal belongings. The friend loaned them the truck. The young father began to load all they owned into the truck, but in the first few minutes, he hurt his back. The friend who loaned the truck was too busy to help. The young father felt desperate. He thought of you, his elders quorum president.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p9" pid="xH2-8s6cOUKXnQv4NU3LyQ" hash="3uNt5g">By the time he asked for help, it was early afternoon. It was the day of an evening Church meeting. You had already promised to help your wife with household projects that day. Your children had asked you to do something with them, but you hadn’t gotten to it yet.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p10" pid="Lnsm772qmUmFUeaE97-CZA" hash="GqiSew">You also knew that the members of your quorum, particularly the most faithful, the ones you usually called on to help, were likely to be in the same time bind that you were in.</p>
		</span>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p11" pid="7KQ8VfpqfEWjTTawCuF5qg" hash="7Bie3Q">The Lord knew you would have such days when He called you to this position, so He gave you a story to encourage you. It is a parable for overloaded priesthood holders. We sometimes call it the story of the good Samaritan. But it is really the story for a great priesthood bearer in these busy, difficult last days.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p12" pid="4OlLnL5NFESM0vKVrff6cA" hash="xBbhAg">The story is a perfect fit for the overtaxed priesthood servant. Just remember that you are the Samaritan and not the priest or the Levite who passed by the wounded man.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p13" pid="Rakkg4DNtEOJDfTgeyfutg" hash="gYBRIQ">You may not have thought of that story when you faced such challenges. But I pray you will when such days come again, as they surely will.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p14" pid="CXLQkNSzc0SJwKeVVKwYyA" hash="atJgBQ">We are not told in the scriptures why the Samaritan was traveling on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho. It is not likely that he was taking a stroll alone since he must have known that robbers waited for the unwary. He was on a serious journey, and as was customary, he had with him a beast of burden as well as oil and wine.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p15" pid="WBY0Th9Wp0acszTPclt1pw" hash="p1lw3w">In the Lord’s words the Samaritan, when he saw the wounded man, stopped because “he had compassion.”</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p16" pid="l0PqCp0GSEGEfO8-n1Fhzw" hash="o-vxcg">More than only feeling compassion, he acted. Always remember the specifics of the account:</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p17" pid="IMG_ijatfEi91LmHD6eTwg" hash="WxsMtw">“And [he] went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p18" pid="YuyDBeUHVk6amjFZBdcDBQ" hash="5y_2cA">“And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p19" pid="pHHkQdJ0MUyBV3YS00hduA" hash="zmZiLA">You and the priesthood bearers you are called to lead can have at least three assurances. First, the Lord will give you, if you ask, the feelings of compassion He feels for those in need. Second, He will provide others, like the innkeeper, to join with you in your service. And third, the Lord, like the good Samaritan, will more than recompense all who join in giving help to those in need.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p20" pid="6UqzDw3tYUiQHlUQFvSrHA" hash="OlOrVg">You quorum presidents likely have acted on those assurances more than once. You asked others of the Lord’s priesthood to help, with confidence that they would respond with compassion. You were not afraid to ask those who have responded most often in the past because you knew that they feel compassion easily. You asked them, knowing that in the past they have felt the Lord’s generosity when they chose to help. You asked some already heavily burdened, knowing that the greater the sacrifice, the greater the compensation they will receive from the Lord. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="59"></span>Those who have helped in the past have felt the overflowing gratitude of the Savior.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p21" pid="X4tCnYMc606wn-pQ96VCYw" hash="VubWRg">You may well have been inspired not to ask someone to help load and then unload that truck. As a leader you know your quorum members and their families well. The Lord knows them perfectly.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p22" pid="8bpez3QJQ0WfbjLTFngEtA" hash="fCsolQ">He knows whose wife was near the breaking point because her husband was unable to find time to do what she needed done to care for her needs. He knows which children would be blessed by seeing their father go one more time to help others or if the children needed the feeling that they matter to their father enough for him to spend time with them that day. But He also knows who needs the invitation to serve but might not appear to be a likely or willing candidate.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p23" pid="982JPKfeqEWAt3Z0PKIYMA" hash="RmxEuQ">You cannot know all your quorum members perfectly well, but God does. So, as you have done so many times, you prayed to know whom to ask to help serve others. The Lord knows who will be blessed by being asked to help and whose family will be blessed by not being asked. That is the revelation you can expect to come to you as you lead in the priesthood.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p24" pid="07INU501oke-cW-mMY7C6A" hash="wGOQcg">I saw that happen when I was a young man. I was the first assistant in a priests quorum. The bishop called me one day at my home. He said that he wanted me to go with him to visit a widow in great need. He said he needed me.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p25" pid="nz3ocjAhfkWZtp9yMrqZRQ" hash="9SMQeg">As I waited for him to pick me up at my home, I was troubled. I knew the bishop had strong and wise counselors. One was a famous judge. The other ran a large company and would later become a General Authority. The bishop himself would someday serve as a General Authority. Why was the bishop saying to an inexperienced priest, “I need your help”?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p26" pid="Drq1l6w90kKxy0Ff6vqJjA" hash="8_qvtg">Well, I know better now what he might have said to me: “The Lord needs to bless you.” At the home of the widow, I saw him, to my amazement, tell the woman that she could get no help from the Church until she filled out the budget form he had left with her earlier. On the way home, as he saw how shocked I was, he chuckled at my surprise and said, “Hal, when she gets control of her spending, she will be able to help others.”</p>
		</span>
		<span class="story">
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p27" pid="yp627fmY0kaTjnLDCniCjQ" hash="yBNOOg">On another occasion my bishop took me with him to the home of alcoholic parents who sent two frightened little girls to meet us at the door. After he visited with the two little girls, we turned away and he said to me, “We can’t change the tragedy in their lives yet, but they can feel that the Lord loves them.”</p>
		</span>
		<span class="story">
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p28" pid="bnd9DpRB4E2nZuL6pkWMlg" hash="P9CBcA">On another evening he took me to the home of a man who hadn’t come to church in years. The bishop told him how much he loved him and how much the ward needed him. It didn’t seem to have much effect on the man. But that time, and every time the bishop took me with him, it had a great effect on me.</p>
		</span>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p29" pid="_iVT3pLCzUiLWYR_81qoDw" hash="J-cpzw">There is no way that I can find out whether the bishop prayed to know which priest would be blessed by going with him on those visits. He may well have taken other priests with him many times. But the Lord knew I would someday be a bishop inviting those whose faith had grown cold to come back to the warmth of the gospel. The Lord knew I would someday be charged with the priesthood responsibility for hundreds and even thousands of Heavenly Father’s children who were in desperate temporal need.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p30" pid="XyqfCH6GA0u3YtMajrWIUg" hash="Vqb3mQ">You young men cannot know what acts of priesthood service the Lord is preparing you to give. But the greater challenge for every priesthood holder is to give spiritual help. All of us have that charge. It comes with being a member of a quorum. It comes with being a member of a <span class="pageBreak" page-number="60"></span>family. If the faith of anyone in your quorum or your family is attacked by Satan, you will feel compassion. Much like the service and mercy given by the Samaritan, you will also minister to them with healing balm for their wounds in their time of need.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p31" pid="za6d6b1eUUCLSqWPD2g9Ig" hash="0wtang">In your service as a full-time missionary, you will go to thousands of people in great spiritual need. Many, until you teach them, will not even know that they have spiritual wounds that, left untreated, will bring endless misery. You will go on the Lord’s errand to rescue them. Only the Lord can bind up their spiritual wounds as they accept the ordinances that lead to eternal life.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p32" pid="AuCyMe1OmE24AbngTRzQfQ" hash="1TIxfg">As a quorum member, as a home teacher, and as a missionary, you cannot help people repair spiritual damage unless your own faith is vibrant. That means far more than reading the scriptures regularly and praying over them. The prayer in the moment and quick glances in the scriptures are not preparation enough. The reassurance of what you will need comes with this counsel from the <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.85" class="scriptureRef">84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants</a>: “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p33" pid="AIqPIC-EyUm3lr1W2Hzg3A" hash="3v7zUw">That promise can be claimed only if we “treasure up” the words of life and do it continually. The treasuring part of that scripture has meant for me a matter of feeling something about the words. For instance, when I have gone to try to help someone wavering in his or her faith about the Prophet Joseph Smith’s divine calling, feelings come back to me.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p34" pid="NLeavBHGGUSeZ_tAWhattQ" hash="ifVkaA">It is not only the words from the Book of Mormon. It is a feeling of assurance of truth that comes whenever I read even a few lines from the Book of Mormon. I cannot promise that it will come to every person infected with doubt about the Prophet Joseph or the Book of Mormon. But I know Joseph Smith is the Prophet of the Restoration. I know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God because I have treasured it.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p35" pid="cG-aARJtIk-wyX4CTRXgnw" hash="ygR7_A">I know from experience that you can get the assurance of truth from the Spirit because it has come to me. You and I must have that assurance before the Lord puts us in the way of a traveler we love who has been wounded by the enemies of truth.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p36" pid="VTd-t9cmWE-YSWUUfHgx-A" hash="jRJKew">There is another preparation we must make. It is a human characteristic to become hardened to the pains of others. That is one of the reasons why the Savior went to such lengths to tell of His Atonement and of His taking upon Himself the pains and sorrows of all of our Heavenly Father’s children that He might know how to succor them.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p37" pid="YDw0PBvCYEedYOeIgPaimg" hash="TycbgA">Even the best of Heavenly Father’s mortal priesthood holders do not rise to that standard of compassion easily. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="61"></span>Our human tendency is to be impatient with the person who cannot see the truth that is so plain to us. We must be careful that our impatience is not interpreted as condemnation or rejection.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p38" pid="0a7SJa_kCke0wc8kzcA71A" hash="AIk1_A">As we prepare to give succor for the Lord as His priesthood servants, there is a scripture to guide us. It contains a gift we will need for our journey, wherever the Lord will send us. The good Samaritan had that gift. We will need it, and the Lord has told us how we can find it:</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p39" pid="D0N4sEetD0WfwjViHZpQjg" hash="N5T3iA">“Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail—</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p40" pid="XW2XrZdBzUuiu9YZHs498A" hash="37zyeA">“But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p41" pid="6nQWyB1n3UiVQJK8EUBwhA" hash="iK0zlQ">“Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/bind-up-their-wounds.p42" pid="26gk88bfZkS8EtQifYtXYQ" hash="AL9MfA">I pray that we may prepare ourselves to give whatever priesthood service the Lord may set before us on our mortal journey. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Within a few years as many as 10 of their cousins are likely to reach a point in their lives where they will follow into the wonderful world of family creation.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p6" pid="lQTJzQBHTESnBenfqDt12Q" hash="2HANiA">That happy prospect has caused me deep contemplation as they have asked me for advice. Essentially they have asked, “What choices could I make that will lead me to happiness?” And on the other hand, “What choices are likely to lead me to <span class="emphasis">un</span>happiness?”</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p7" pid="mpGECZv5cUqXQmnx34JfuQ" hash="shNQ6Q">Heavenly Father has made each of us unique. No two of us have exactly the same experiences. No two families are alike. So it is not surprising that advice about how to choose happiness in family life is hard to give. Yet a loving Heavenly Father has set the same path to happiness for all of His children. Whatever our personal characteristics or whatever will be our experiences, there is but one plan of happiness. That plan is to follow all the commandments of God.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p8" pid="OY6KNR_6FkGdiQ2xgTC4Wg" hash="lTPY-A">For all of us, including my grandchildren contemplating marriage, there is one overarching commandment that will help us to meet the challenges and lead to the heart of a happy family life. It applies to all relationships regardless of circumstances. It is repeated throughout the scriptures and in the teachings of the prophets in our day. Here is the Bible wording of the Lord’s advice to all who want to live together forever in loving happiness:</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p9" pid="B6darc2yd0ezX9boFu4Jwg" hash="jd-otg">“Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</p>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p11" pid="AKvFU48mO0epNLLIrSop6g" hash="4zjMZQ">“Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p12" pid="Ec6JfGwjXUGcHzz2x1w_pw" hash="pLnaTg">“This is the first and great commandment.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p13" pid="_zuZ44FtC0CX_cIAdFupvA" hash="9pnSeg">“And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p14" pid="V262PQIIukOx-wLbf0S14g" hash="IPPOhA">“On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p15" pid="KHWlDjrI0UaJEyfTEzcVrA" hash="ha1ilg">From that simple statement it is not hard to summarize all I have learned about what choices lead to happiness in families. I start with the question, “What choices have led me toward loving the Lord with all my heart and soul and with all my mind?” For me it has been to choose to put myself where I felt the joy of forgiveness through the Lord’s Atonement.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p16" pid="55qzzxenD0qyIFODOjCnjA" hash="fG79NA">Years ago I baptized a young man in Albuquerque, New Mexico, whom my missionary companion and I had taught. I put the young man down into the water and brought him up. He must have been nearly as tall as me because he spoke directly into my ear. With water from the font and tears running down his face and with joy in his voice, he said, “I’m clean, I’m clean.”</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p17" pid="QhsJYiV4_UClb3L_8Dq_Fg" hash="8HCzAg">I have seen those same tears of happiness in the eyes of someone who recounted the words of an Apostle of God. He had said to her, after a searching and tender interview, “I forgive you in the name of the Lord. He will give you the assurance of His forgiveness in His own time and in His own way.” And He did.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p18" pid="cZTnbQVeV0WklT_5mn9Jbw" hash="Ax9Tbw">I have seen why the Lord can say that when sins are forgiven, He can remember them no more. By the power of the Atonement, people I know well and love became new, and the effects of sin were wiped away. My heart has been filled with love for the Savior and the loving Father who sent Him.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p19" pid="K2INoNHZY0may6IJX3pK7g" hash="QEPElA">That great blessing has come by encouraging people I care for to go to the Savior for relief from pain, a relief only He can give. That is why I urge those I love to accept and to magnify every calling offered them in the Church. That choice is one of the great keys to family happiness.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/to-my-grandchildren.p20" pid="8MESFjD2lEW3twUq3r3sag" hash="elJ3JQ">The pressures at every stage of life can tempt us to reject or neglect calls to serve the Savior. That can put us in spiritual peril for ourselves, our spouse, and our families. Some of those calls may seem unimportant, but <span class="emphasis">my</span> life, and my family, was changed for the better by my accepting a call to teach a deacons quorum. I felt the love of those deacons for the Savior and His love for them.</p>

I know of another who has been a bishop and then an Area Seventy who was used by the Lord to succor a boy in a teachers quorum who was hurt in an accident. The miracles from that service touched many lives, including mine, and increased their love for the Savior.</p>

Success in the Lord’s service always produces miracles beyond our own powers. The parent facing a child in serious rebellion knows that is true, as does the visiting teacher approached by a woman seeking comfort when her husband told her he was leaving her. Both servants are grateful they prayed that morning for the Lord to send the Holy Ghost as a companion.</p>

I have seen how that companionship is crucial for felicity in a marriage. The miracle of becoming one requires the help of heaven, and it takes time. Our goal is to live together forever in the presence of Heavenly Father and our Savior.</p>

My mother was a singer and an artist. My father loved chemistry. Once at a symphony concert, my mother was surprised when my father stood up and began to leave before the applause began. My mother asked him where he was going. His response was, in all innocence: “Well, it’s over, isn’t it?” Only the gentle influence of the Holy Ghost got him there with her in the first place and brought him back to concerts time and time again.</p>

There is not one of us that He has not given His angels charge concerning. We may be insignificant and contemptible in our own eyes, and in the eyes of others, but the truth remains that we are the children of God, and that He has actually given His angels—invisible beings of power and might—charge concerning us, and they watch over us and have us in their keeping.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

With God’s help we can all feel that hope and that joy again. I pray that may be so for all of us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

			<span class="pageBreak" page-number="125"></span>We have been taught with spiritual power tonight. I pray that the words spoken by these great sister leaders will go down into your heart as they have into mine.</p>

All the women of the Church eight years of age and older have been invited to join with us tonight. Many of us have prayed that the Holy Ghost would be with us. That blessing was granted as we heard these sisters speak and listened to the uplifting music. I pray that the Spirit will continue to be with us as I offer some words of encouragement and testimony in addition to what has already been said—and particularly to testify that what we have been told is what the Lord would have us hear.</p>

That path is marked by sacred covenants with God. I will talk with you about the joy of making and keeping those covenants and helping others keep them.</p>

To you that memory is fresh. Others were baptized long ago, so the memory of your feelings of that covenant experience may be less clear, but some of those feelings come back whenever you listen to the sacramental prayers.</p>

I hope that those of you who came into the kingdom recently are blessed to be sitting near your mother. If you are, you might send her a smile of thanks right now. I can remember the feeling of joy and gratitude as I sat behind my mother on the drive home from my baptism in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

I can say “surely” because those feelings are placed deep in the hearts of all of Heavenly Father’s daughters. That is part of your divine heritage from Him.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/daughters-in-the-covenant.p21" pid="hIFY2r-Q3EWmShCvLxRM-A" hash="jSbupg">You were tutored by Him before you came into this life. He helped you understand and accept that you would have trials, tests, and opportunities perfectly chosen just for you. You learned that our Father had a plan of happiness to get you safely through those trials and that you would help bring others safely through theirs. This plan is marked by covenants with God.</p>

She was the wife of Elder David B. Haight, who was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. As a young man he served as the president of the Palo Alto stake in California. He prayed over, and worried about, the girls in the Mia Maid class in his own ward.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/daughters-in-the-covenant.p27" pid="Ao-AiDx7AUK80r5GUIL5aw" hash="eJ7iLg">So President Haight was inspired to ask the bishop to call Ruby Haight to teach those young girls.

Yet 40 years after she taught them, each time she would meet my wife, who had been one of the girls in her class, she would put out her hand, smile, and say to Kathy, “Oh! My Mia Maid.” I saw more than her smile. I felt her deep love for a sister she still cared for as if she were her own daughter. Her smile and warm greeting came <span class="pageBreak" page-number="127"></span>from seeing that a sister and daughter of God was still on the covenant path home.</p>

And whenever you move upward on that path toward your potential, it brings Him happiness. And you can feel His approval.</p>

Now, that puts a great responsibility on each of you. He expects you to treat every person you meet as a child of God. That is the reason He commands us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves and to forgive them. Your feelings of kindness and forgiveness toward others come as your divine inheritance from Him as His daughter. Each person you meet is His loved spiritual child.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/daughters-in-the-covenant.p33" pid="wQJjjC0maku6U55IFA0cMA" hash="kH4gMQ">As you feel of that great sisterhood, what we thought divides us falls away.

I owe much of my happiness in life to a man I never met in mortal life. He was an orphan who became one of my great-grandparents. He left me a priceless heritage of hope. Let me tell you some of the part he played in creating that inheritance for me.</p>

His father, Edward, had a large estate in Coburg, in what is now Germany. His mother was Viscountess Charlotte Von Blomberg. Her father was the keeper of the lands of the king of Prussia.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p11" pid="zvrHLqX0rUeMpCEQbveyjA" hash="FxCl7Q">Heinrich was Charlotte and Edward’s first son. Charlotte died at the age of 31, after the birth of her third child. Edward died soon thereafter, having lost all his property and wealth in a failed investment. He was only 40 years of age. He left three orphaned children.</p>

He was penniless. He recorded in his history that he felt his best hope lay in going to America. Although he had neither family nor friends there, he had a feeling of hope about going to America. He first went to New York City. Later he moved to St. Louis, Missouri.</p>

From him he obtained a copy of a pamphlet written by Elder Parley P. Pratt. He read it and then studied every word he could obtain about the Latter-day Saints. He prayed to know if there really were angels that appeared to men, whether there was a living prophet, and whether he had found a true and revealed religion.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p14" pid="0mqs6HXxtkuk-YoEmxGQoA" hash="_Pi8Vg">After two months of careful study and prayer, Heinrich had a dream in which he was told he was to be baptized. A man whose name and priesthood I hold in sacred memory, Elder William Brown, was to perform the ordinance. Heinrich was baptized in a pool of rainwater on March 11, 1855, at 7:30 in the morning.</p>

He knew that the happiness of eternal life comes through family bonds which continue forever. Even when he had so recently found the Lord’s plan of happiness, he knew that his hope for eternal joy depended on the free choices of others to follow his example. His hope of eternal happiness depended on people not yet born.</p>

In his words I feel his hope that his descendants might choose to follow him on the path back to our heavenly home. He knew it would not be one <span class="pageBreak" page-number="23"></span>great choice to make to do so but many small choices. I quote from his history:</p>

He left as his heritage his example of staying faithful to his mission for six years in what was then called the Indian Territories. To receive his release from his mission, he walked and joined a wagon train from Oklahoma to Salt Lake City, a distance of approximately 1,100 miles (1,770 km).</p>

From there he answered another call to serve a mission in his native Germany. He then accepted the invitation of an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ to help build up the Latter-day Saint colonies in northern Mexico. From there he was called to Mexico City as a full-time missionary again. He honored those calls. He lies buried in a small cemetery in Colonia Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico.</p>

He accepted them because he had faith that the priesthood keys in the Lord’s Church had been restored with the power to seal families forever, if only they had sufficient faith to keep their covenants.</p>

Each covenant brings with it duties and promises. For all of us, as they were for Heinrich, those duties are sometimes simple but are often difficult. But remember, the duties must sometimes be difficult because their purpose is to move us along the path to live forever with Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, in families.</p>

Because of the Fall, we all need the cleansing effects of baptism and the laying on of hands to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. These ordinances must be performed by those who possess the proper priesthood authority. Then, with the help of the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost, we can keep all the covenants we make with God, especially those offered in His temples. Only in that way, and with that help, can anyone claim his or her rightful inheritance as a child of God in a family forever.</p>

He has made promises to us as we keep trying to gather people to Him, even when they resist His invitation to do so. Their resistance saddens Him, but He does not quit, nor should we. He sets the perfect example for us with His persistent love: “And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span>

Every faithful parent, grandparent, and great-grandparent shares in that desire. Heavenly Father and the Savior are our perfect examples of what we can and must do. They never force righteousness because righteousness must be chosen. They make righteousness discernible to us, and They let us see that its fruits are delicious.</p>

God has sent mortal servants who can, by the Holy Ghost, help us recognize what He would have us do and what He forbids. God makes it attractive to choose the right by letting us feel the effects of our choices. If we choose the right, we <span class="pageBreak" page-number="25"></span>will find happiness—in time. If we choose evil, there comes sorrow and regret—in time. Those effects are sure. Yet they are often delayed for a purpose. If the blessings were immediate, choosing the right would not build faith. And since sorrow is also sometimes greatly delayed, it takes faith to feel the need to seek forgiveness for sin early rather than after we feel its sorrowful and painful effects.</p>

He was a great and good man—a prophet of God. He often testified of our Savior, Jesus Christ, to them. He was an example of obedience and service when the Lord called him to leave all his worldly possessions to spare his family from destruction. At the very end of his life, he was still testifying to his children. Like the Savior—and despite his power to discern their hearts and to see the future both sad and wonderful—Lehi kept his arms outstretched to draw his family toward salvation.</p>

In the short run, there will be troubles and Satan will roar. And there are things to wait for patiently, in faith, knowing that the Lord acts in His own time and in His own way.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p44" pid="LDQiq5BXTUefPMEE0nF4nw" hash="kI9dQA">There are things you can do early, when those you love are young. Remember that daily family prayer, family scripture study, and sharing our testimony in sacrament meeting are easier and more effective when children are young. Young children are often more sensitive to the Spirit than we realize.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p45" pid="hQzn8nlHC0abuTyDeVAjfA" hash="hwnWuQ">When they are older, they will remember the hymns they sang with you. Even more than recalling music, they will remember the words of scripture and testimony. The Holy Ghost can bring all things to their remembrance, but the words of scriptures and hymns will last the longest. Those memories will exert a pull that may bring them back when they wander for a time, possibly for years, from the pathway home to eternal life.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p46" pid="oP-foJRdr0ydkr5o_W--Vw" hash="3KYigQ">We will need the long view when those we love feel the pull of the world and the cloud of doubt seems to overwhelm their faith. We have faith, hope, and charity to guide us and to strengthen them.</p>

They are individuals with unique personalities. Yet they seem to share a consistent optimism. When someone raises an alarm about something in the Church, their most frequent response is “Oh, things will work out.” They generally know more about the problem than the people sounding the alarm.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p48" pid="AvhQTBvJ_0OT9HO_waUUsw" hash="qE7tBw">They also know the way of the Lord, and so they are always hopeful about His kingdom. They know He is at its head. He is all-powerful and He cares. If you let Him be the leader of your family, things will work out.</p>

But many of his great-great-grandchildren go to temples of God at 6:00 in the morning to perform ordinances for ancestors they have never met. They go out of the heritage of hope he left. He left an inheritance that is being claimed by many of his descendants.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/a-priceless-heritage-of-hope.p50" pid="wVBGVOY0JkGVuqIqtyEzVg" hash="u7p0JQ">After all we can do in faith, the Lord will justify our hopes for greater blessings for our families than we can imagine. He wants the best for them and for us, as His children.</p>

Jesus of Nazareth is His Beloved Son and our resurrected Savior. This is His Church. In it are the keys of the priesthood, and so families can be forever. This is our priceless heritage of hope.

I was born and grew up in Princeton, New Jersey, in the United States. The most famous sports teams near where we lived were headquartered in New York City. It was the home of three professional baseball teams in those faraway days: the Brooklyn Dodgers, the New York Giants, and the New York Yankees. Philadelphia was even closer to our home and was the home of the Athletics and the Phillies baseball teams. There were many potential baseball heroes for me on those teams.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p6" pid="4pQL35xhbE64GzKJsVJZvw" hash="YZClLw">Joe DiMaggio, who played for the New York Yankees, became my baseball hero. When my brothers and my friends played baseball on the school grounds next to our house, I tried to swing the bat the way I thought Joe DiMaggio did it. That was before the days of television (this is ancient history), so I only had pictures from newspapers to use to copy his swing.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p7" pid="2hdJBWCTBEOwqgsycJXI2Q" hash="btb1Hw">When I was growing up, my father drove me to Yankee Stadium. That was the only time I saw Joe DiMaggio play. As if I am still there, in my mind I can see him swing the bat and see the white baseball fly straight into the stands at center field.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p8" pid="b1_qXyFEWkO24B3r5AM-6g" hash="fdmjNQ">Now, my baseball skills never came close to those of my childhood hero. But the few times I hit a baseball well, I copied the level of his powerful swing as closely as I could.</p>

			<span class="pageBreak" page-number="63"></span>When we choose heroes, we begin to copy, consciously or unconsciously, what we admire most in them.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p10" pid="8I89506nO0G03k_HZ90ZBQ" hash="EzzTfw">Happily, my wise parents put great heroes in my path as a boy. My dad took me to Yankee Stadium only once to observe my baseball hero play, but every Sunday he let me observe a priesthood man who became a hero. That hero shaped my life. My father was the branch president of the little branch which met in our home. By the way, if you came down to the first floor on Sunday morning, you were in church. Our branch never had more than 30 people in attendance.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p11" pid="QVI9d67-qEGFv8T2dQ0G1g" hash="CNa9Cw">There was a young man who drove his mother to our house for meetings, but he never came into the house. He was not a member. It was my father who succeeded by going out to him where he parked the car and inviting him into our home. He was baptized and became my first and only Aaronic Priesthood leader. He became my priesthood hero. I still remember the wooden statue he gave me as a reward after we had completed a project to cut firewood for a widow. I have tried to be like him whenever I give justified praise to a servant of God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p12" pid="XSQhNQ8gAUmMJCeH1qUIZw" hash="S-kyLQ">I chose another hero in that little branch of the Church. He was a United States Marine who came to our meetings wearing his green marine uniform. It was wartime, so that alone made him my hero. He had been sent to Princeton University by the marines to further his education. But far more than admiring his military uniform, I watched him play in Palmer Stadium as captain of the Princeton University football team. I saw him play on the university basketball team and also watched him play as the star catcher on their baseball team.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p13" pid="sQ8CAnI8WEyhuZcEmeBShw" hash="zI8vuw">But even more, he came to my home during the week to show me how to shoot a basketball with both my left and my right hand. He told me that I would need that skill because I would someday play basketball on good teams. I did not realize it then, but for years he was, for me, a model of a true priesthood man.</p>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p14" pid="0j_f79TWfUeXJxz_loXxWQ" hash="WCx5GQ">Each of you will be a model of a priesthood man whether you want to be or not. You became a lighted candle when you accepted the priesthood. The Lord put you on the candlestick to light the way for everyone who surrounds you. That is especially true for those in your priesthood quorum. You can be a great model, an average one, or a bad model. You may think it doesn’t matter to you, but it does to the Lord. He said it this way:</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p15" pid="8p1BgZtKCE-3iUeBKuvdjQ" hash="UUOWCg">“Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</p>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p18" pid="UeFI1iI0s0K5bwS9WzpEkg" hash="mLGjbQ">I have been blessed by examples of great priesthood holders in quorums where I was fortunate to serve. You can do what they have done for me by being an example for others to follow.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p19" pid="3Oteap1hOUSufttCD2vlAA" hash="3p4BAg">I have observed three common characteristics of the priesthood holders who are my heroes. One is a pattern of prayer, the second is a habit of service, and the third is a rock-hard decision to be honest.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p20" pid="7n3-Dl5wn0CjHPWB0QisPA" hash="SiAIlw">We all pray, but the priesthood holder you want to be prays often and with real intent. In the evening you will get on your knees and thank God for the blessings of the day. You will thank Him for parents, for teachers, and for great examples to follow. You will describe in your prayers specifically who has blessed your life and <span class="pageBreak" page-number="64"></span>how, during that day. That will take more than a few minutes and more than a little thought. It will surprise you and change you.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p21" pid="WXI2j7rRD0axTlojksEjhw" hash="DOY3EA">As you pray for forgiveness, you will find yourself forgiving others. As you thank God for His kindness, you will think of others, by name, who need your kindness. Again, that experience will surprise you every day, and over time it will change you.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p22" pid="TabGamN_C0usKqFZc9cbLQ" hash="2kxuaQ">One way you will be changed by such fervent prayer is, I promise you, that you will feel truly that you are a child of God. When you know that you are a child of God, you will also know that He expects much of you. Because you are His child, He will expect you to follow His teachings and the teachings of His dear Son, Jesus Christ. He will expect you to be generous and kind to others. He will be disappointed if you are proud and self-centered. He will bless you to have the desire to put the interests of others above your own.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p23" pid="Panhe0FRYUGeEBsxrswpMA" hash="k3Pe1A">Some of you are already models of unselfish priesthood service. In temples across the world, priesthood holders arrive before sunrise. And some serve long after sunset. There is no recognition or public acclaim in this world for that sacrifice of time and effort. I have gone with young people as they serve those in the spirit world, who are not able to claim temple blessings for themselves.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p24" pid="uX4KOvANQU2jBNK6aWaveg" hash="_eE7pg">As I see happiness rather than fatigue in the faces of those who serve there early and late, I know there are great rewards in this life for that type of unselfish priesthood service, but it is only a token of the joy they will share with those whom they served in the spirit world.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p25" pid="QKeDQt4ugUSdvkQNwGbcJw" hash="n6BqTA">I have seen that same happiness in the faces of those who speak to others about the blessings which come from belonging to the kingdom of God. I know of a branch president who almost every day brings people to the missionaries for them to teach. Just a few months ago he was not yet a member of the Church. Now there are missionaries teaching and a branch growing in numbers and strength because of him. But more than that, he is a light to others who will open their mouths and so hasten the Lord’s gathering of the children of Heavenly Father.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p26" pid="QFx6QDVqQUGiH4uSs26ItA" hash="q8zmeg">As you pray and serve others, your knowledge that you are a child of God and your feelings about Him will grow. You will become more aware that He is saddened if you are dishonest in any way. You will be more determined to keep your word to God and to others. You will be more aware of taking anything that does not belong to you. You will be more honest with your employers. You will be more determined to be on time and to complete every task you are given by the Lord that you have accepted to do.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p27" pid="GCzIBpppBkOZKAETG4nVPA" hash="ptXjvQ">Rather than wondering if their home teachers will come, children in the families you are called to teach will look forward with anticipation to your visit. My children have received that blessing. As they grew, they had priesthood heroes help them set their own courses in serving the Lord. That blessed example is now passing into the third generation.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p28" pid="pNXcFNllW0iA1fFKhjvqPQ" hash="97XWvA">My message is also one of thanks.</p>

I thank you for getting on your knees in recognition of the fact that you don’t have all the answers. You pray to the God of heaven to express your gratitude and to invoke His blessings upon your lives and your families. I thank you for your service to others and for the times you felt no need for acknowledgment of your service.</p>

In fact, they seem to have difficulty seeing those things that I so much admire in them. I mentioned my father was a faithful president of a tiny branch of the Church in New Jersey. He later was a member of the Sunday School general board for the Church. Yet I am careful today to speak modestly about his priesthood service, because he was modest.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/the-priesthood-man.p36" pid="VZolmSoh-0aymbRNn48xeA" hash="-M6OcQ">The same is true for the marine who was my childhood hero. He never spoke to me of his priesthood service or of his accomplishments. He just gave service. I learned about his faithfulness from others.

On the way home he stopped his car, opened his scriptures, and told me why he had treated that widow as if she had the power not only to care for herself but would, at some time in the future, be able to help others.</p>

My father was once asked by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to write a short paper on science and religion. My father was a famous scientist and a faithful priesthood holder. But I can still remember the moment he handed me the paper he had written and said, “Here, before I send this to the Twelve, I want you to read it. You will know if it is right.” He was 32 years older than me and immeasurably more wise and intelligent.</p>

I knew that his trust was not in me but that God could and would tell me what was true. You seasoned companions can bless a young priesthood holder in preparation whenever you can show him that kind of trust. It will help him trust the gentle feeling of inspiration for himself when it comes as he someday places his hands to seal the blessing to heal a child the doctors say will die. That trust has helped me more than once.</p>

That will be especially true when we must correct them. Think of the moment when an Aaronic Priesthood holder, perhaps at the sacrament table, makes a mistake in performing an ordinance. That is a serious matter. Sometimes the error requires public correction with a possibility of resentment, a feeling of humiliation or even of being rejected.</p>

The word suggests an increase of a love that was already there. The “showing forth” is about the increase. Those of you who are preparing priesthood holders will certainly see them make mistakes. Before they receive your correction, they must have felt of your love early and steadily. They must have felt your genuine praise before they will accept your correction.</p>

Hundreds of stake presidents and bishops are praying today to know how to help the Lord rescue a lost sheep. And for a prophet, it will be to know what the Lord would have him speak to the Church and to a world in turmoil.</p>

Young Joseph Smith knew that he could not of himself know which church to join. So he asked of God, as the book of James told him he could. God the Father and His Beloved Son appeared in a grove of trees. They answered the question that was beyond Joseph’s power to resolve.</p>

Let’s take the great Nephi, son of Lehi, as our example. His father had a dream. Others in Nephi’s family viewed Lehi’s dream as evidence of mental confusion. The dream included a command from God for Lehi’s sons to run the terrible risk of returning to Jerusalem for the plates which contained the word of God so that they could take them on their journey to the promised land.</p>

Nephi did not say, “I will go and do what my father told me to do.” Rather he said, “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded.”</p>

But think of the joy when the parent learns, as one did just a few weeks ago, that a child who had recently left home not only set a curfew for herself but also kept the Sabbath just as she had been taught at home. The revelation of a parent has its lasting effect in the personal revelation that continues in the child.</p>

As a young man, I would close the back door very quietly when I came home late in the evening. I had to pass my mother’s bedroom on the way to mine. However quietly I tiptoed, just as I got to her half-opened door, I would hear my name, ever so quietly, “Hal, come in for a moment.”</p>

I suppose it would have been in part for my safety. But I am sure that she prayed as a patriarch does before he gives a blessing. He prays that his words will come to the recipient as the words of God, not his. My mother’s prayers for that blessing were answered on my head. She is in the spirit world and has been for more than 40 years. I am sure she has been exceedingly glad that I was blessed, as she asked, to hear in her counsel the commands of God. And I have tried to go and do as she hoped I would.</p>

Directing the relief efforts fell to a local stake president, a farmer. I was in a classroom at Ricks College just a few days after the disaster. A leader from the federal disaster agency had arrived. He and his chief assistants came to the large room where the stake president had assembled bishops and even some ministers of other local religions. I was there because many of the survivors were being cared for and housed on the campus of the college where I was the president.</p>

They described what direction they had received and followed from their leaders. They talked as well about what they had been inspired to do as they carried out the instructions to find families and to help them. It was late that day. They were all too tired to show much emotion except their love of the people.</p>

President Packer was right. Continuing revelation comes to stake presidents to lift them above their own wisdom and capacities.

Don’t take lightly the feeling you get of love for the prophet of God.

In the Church today we are offered the opportunity to fast once a month and give a generous fast offering through our bishop or branch president for the benefit of the poor and the needy. Some of what you give will be used to help those around you, perhaps someone in your own family. The Lord’s servants will pray and fast for the revelation to know whom to help and what help to give. That which is not needed to help people in your local Church unit will become available to bless other Church members across the world who are in need.</p>

To omit to do this righteous act of fasting would deprive us of these blessings.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

It has already come for us all—wherever you are in your calling in the priesthood. I grew up in the mission field in the eastern United States during World War II. The members of the Church lived far apart, and there was strict gas rationing. I was the only deacon in the branch. The members gave their fast-offering envelopes to the branch president when they came to fast and testimony meeting in our home.</p>

I remember my first assignment to walk to homes to collect fast offerings. I looked at the name on one of the envelopes I was given and noticed the last name was the same as one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon. So I knocked on the door with confidence. The man opened the door, looked at me, scowled, and then barked at me to go away. I went away with my head down.</p>

If only I had prayed in faith as I went out that day, I might have been inspired to stand a moment longer on that doorstep, smile, and say something like: “It is good to meet you. Thank you for what you and your family have given in the past. I look forward to seeing you next month.”</p>

But I know now how I might have felt. Rather than feeling sadness or failure as I walked away, I might have felt the soft commendation in my mind and heart: “Well done.”</p>

Those moments can come upon us when there is not time to make preparation. That has happened to me often. It did many years ago in a hospital when a father told me and my companion that the doctors had told him that his critically injured three-year-old daughter would die within minutes. As I placed my hands on the one spot on her head not covered with bandages, I had to know, as God’s servant, what He would do and say.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p12" pid="KBi4_Tj0j02YP-kwHFD75Q" hash="IvgElg">The words came to my mind and my lips that she would live. The doctor standing by me snorted in disgust and asked me to get out of the way. I walked out of that hospital room with a feeling of peace and love. The little girl lived and walked down the aisle into a sacrament meeting on my last day in that city. I still remember the joy and satisfaction I felt from what I had said and done in the Lord’s service for that little girl and her family.</p>

As a deacon, I had not yet learned that the power to speak and act in God’s name requires revelation and that to have it when we need it requires praying and working in faith for the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>

But for weeks and months before that phone call came from the hospital, I had followed a pattern of prayer and made the effort that President Joseph F. Smith taught will allow God to give us the inspiration necessary for us to have power in the priesthood. He put it simply:</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/priesthood-and-personal-prayer.p15" pid="jfRymvjvOU-52W_TFErk8Q" hash="ZelZPA">“We do not have to cry unto him with many words. We do not have to weary him with long prayers. What we do need, and what we should do as Latter-day Saints, for our own good, is to go before him often, to witness unto him that we remember him and that we are willing to take upon us his name, keep his commandments, work righteousness; and that we desire his Spirit to help us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

It is an approach to your Heavenly Father with the intent to be recognized by Him personally. He is the God above all, the Father of all, and yet willing to give undivided attention to one of His children. That may be why the Savior used the words “Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

There will be noise and people around you most of your waking day. God hears your silent prayers, but you may have to learn to shut out the distractions because the moment you need the connection with God may not come in quiet times.</p>

He had been treated for cancer for years. During those years of treatment and of terrible pain and difficulty, he accepted a call to hold meetings with and be responsible for members in his ward whose children were gone from their homes; some were widows. His calling was to help them find comfort in sociality and gospel learning.</p>

Two days later, he sent a message to his bishop through his high priests group leader. He said this about his assignment: “I understand the bishop is out of town, so I’m in action. I’m thinking of a meeting for our group next Monday. Two members can take us for a tour of the Conference Center. We could use some members to drive them and some Scouts to push wheelchairs. Depending upon who signs up, we may have enough oldsters to do it ourselves, but it would be good to know we have backup if needed. It could also be a good family night for the helpers to bring their families as well. Anyway let me know before I post the plan. … Thanks.”</p>

Without reference to his own condition or his valiant efforts in his assignment, he asked, “Bishop, is there anything I could do for you?” Only the Holy Ghost could have allowed him to feel the bishop’s load when his own load was so crushing. And only the Spirit could have made it possible for him to create a plan to serve his brothers and sisters with the same precision he used in planning Scouting events when he was young.</p>

He said, “There he is. Most of these men have been brought back because of that elders quorum president.” He was on the back row, dressed casually, his legs stretched out with his battered boots crossed in front of him.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p19" pid="jVKAU8qIjUulu0MmKNadrA" hash="tZyKrQ">I asked the stake president to introduce me to him after the meeting. When we met, I told the young man I was surprised by what he had done and asked him how he did it. He shrugged his shoulders. He obviously didn’t think he deserved any credit.</p>

Most of them have pickup trucks. I have a truck too. I wash my pickup where they wash theirs. In time, they become my friends.</p>

It always does. They tell me about it. I listen and I don’t find fault. Then, when they say, ‘There is something wrong in my life. There just <span class="emphasis">has</span> to be something better than this,’ I tell them what is missing and where they can find it. Sometimes they believe me, and when they do, I take them with me.”</p>

It was because he knew he had done his small part and the Lord was doing the rest. It was the Lord who had touched the hearts of those men in their troubles. It was the Lord who had given them the feeling that there must be something better for them and a hope that they could find it.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/you-are-not-alone-in-the-work.p23" pid="eNzNklKkAkCytzyworWZnA" hash="RWgAbw">The young man, who—like you—was a servant of the Lord, simply believed that if he did his small part, the Lord would help those men along the path to home and to the happiness only He could give them. This man also knew the Lord had called him as elders quorum president because he would do his part.</p>

That is the time when you will need to be confident that the Lord, knowing you would do your part in the work, called you through His authorized servants. Having faith in the call from the Lord’s servants was crucial in the missionary service of my great-grandfather Henry Eyring.</p>

The only reason he could have had the courage to go was that he knew in his heart that God had called him through His authorized servants. It was the source of his courage. That must be the source of our courage to persevere, whatever our callings in the priesthood.</p>

He was surprised and as shocked as a new deacon would be. He wrote, “It was quite unexpected to me to be called to that responsible office but as it was the will of the brethren I cheerfully accepted, feeling at the same time my great weakness and lack of experience.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

I said to him: ‘[President] Young I have left my mission, have come of my own accord, but if there is anything wrong in this, I am willing to return and finish my mission.’ [In the dream the prophet] replied: ‘You have stayed long enough, it is all right.’”</p>

He learned what is true for all of us—that the Lord’s servants are inspired to know the Lord’s will. And Henry Eyring had confirmed what I know as well: that the prophet, as the president of the priesthood, is inspired of God to watch over and care for the Lord’s servants and to call them.</p>

During our confirmation we heard these words: “Receive the Holy Ghost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> From that moment, our lives changed forever.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p7" pid="lq2JrPLMl0-s2R0rqQ09WQ" hash="VmF4SA">We can, if we live worthy of it, have the blessing of the Spirit to be with us, not only now and then, as in such remarkable experiences as we’ve had today, but always. You know from the words of the sacrament prayer how that promise is fulfilled: “O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them.”</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p9" pid="qJzDEpO6Tk6jFgHQUF3M2Q" hash="5hDDxA">To always have the Spirit with us is to have the guidance and direction of the Holy Ghost in our daily lives. We can, for instance, be warned by the Spirit to resist the temptation to do evil.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p10" pid="feYgLg2jzUGJe43oHm4Abw" hash="zE-Qzw">For that reason alone, it is easy to see why the Lord’s servants have tried to increase our desire to worship God in our sacrament meetings. If we partake of the sacrament in faith, the Holy Ghost will then be able to protect us and those we love from the temptations that come with increasing intensity and frequency.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p11" pid="IPtS2XQFDEOv-1g_WonoYQ" hash="bjJBjA">The companionship of the Holy Ghost makes what is good more attractive and temptation less compelling. That alone should be enough to make us determined to qualify for the Spirit to be with us always.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p12" pid="JlvmRUtW3UebJdfljUUmdg" hash="lyaebw">Just as the Holy Ghost strengthens us against evil, He also gives us the power to discern truth from falsehood. The truth that matters most is verified only by revelation from God. Our human reason and the use of our physical senses will not be enough. We live in a time when even the wisest will be hard-pressed to distinguish truth from clever deception.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p13" pid="9F0AV8SSW0yloyVdWlJDZg" hash="KfvmSQ">The Lord taught His Apostle Thomas, who wanted physical evidence of the Savior’s Resurrection by touching His wounds, that revelation is safer evidence: “Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.29" class="scriptureRef">John 20:29</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p14" pid="CxfOQRwaF0OXnmy2prd-wg" hash="uMhjaQ">The truths that mark the way home to God are verified by the Holy Ghost. We cannot go to the grove and see the Father and the Son speak to the young Joseph Smith. No physical evidence or any logical argument can establish that Elijah came as promised to confer the priesthood keys now held and exercised by a living prophet, Thomas S. Monson.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p15" pid="FVquME3cjEKnUjht9PPiVA" hash="pP72Hw">Confirmation of truth comes to a son or daughter of God who has claimed the right to receive the Holy Ghost. Since falsehoods and lies may be presented to us at any time, we need a constant influence of the Spirit of Truth to spare us moments of doubt.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p16" pid="uW4FGpv7W0GLBEK77Rv7HQ" hash="3BB22w">While a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, George Q. Cannon urged that we make a constant quest for the Spirit to be with us. He promised, and I promise it as well, that if we pursue that course, we “will never lack for knowledge” of the truth, “never be in doubt or in darkness,” and our “faith will be strong, [our] joy … full.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p17" pid="W7K8o6OOT0iVa2RzCQHJkw" hash="jIUWtQ">We need that constant help from the companionship of the Holy Ghost for yet another reason. The death of a loved one may come unexpectedly. It is the witness from the Holy Ghost of the reality of a loving Heavenly Father and a resurrected Savior that gives us hope and comfort at the loss of a loved one. That testimony must be fresh when death occurs.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p18" pid="IvBHQK1N10WGuZLLnqkwag" hash="GU4nqw">So, for many reasons, we need the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. We desire it, yet we know from experience that it is not easy to maintain. We each think, say, and do things in our daily lives that can offend the Spirit. The Lord taught us that the Holy Ghost will be our constant companion when our hearts are full of charity and when virtue garnishes our thoughts unceasingly (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>).</p>

You have had times when you have felt the influence of the Holy Ghost. It may have happened for you today.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p20" pid="GPEM2PVryEK0PhVvKLtrdg" hash="gECRcg">You can treat those moments of inspiration like the seed of faith that Alma described (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:28</a>). Plant each one. You can do that by acting on the prompting you felt. The most valuable inspiration will be for you to know what God would have you do. If it is to pay tithing or to visit a grieving friend, you should do it. Whatever it is, do it. When you demonstrate your willingness to obey, the Spirit will send you more impressions of what God would have you do for Him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p21" pid="y2LLMk092kGKRrgmQUrQXg" hash="5j5IGQ">As you obey, the impressions from the Spirit will come more frequently, becoming closer and closer to constant companionship. Your power to choose the right will increase.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p22" pid="Gir2bo9MMEeU-lJLSPYaDA" hash="eo1icg">You can know when these impressions to act for Him are from the Spirit rather than from your own desires. When the impressions square with what the Savior and His living prophets and apostles have said, you can choose to obey with confidence. Then the Lord will send His Spirit to attend you.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/the-holy-ghost-as-your-companion.p23" pid="SB-hcmOa6ki4L0Oy5raZQA" hash="uFSKbg">For example, if you receive a spiritual impression to honor the Sabbath day, especially when it seems difficult, God will send His Spirit to help.</p>

He was alone on a Sunday, and he wanted to take the sacrament. He could find no information about Latter-day Saint meetings. So he started walking. He prayed at each intersection to know which way to turn. After walking and making turns for an hour, he stopped to pray again. He felt an impression to turn down a particular street. Soon he began to hear singing coming from the ground floor of an apartment building close by. He looked in at the window and saw a few people seated near a table covered with a white cloth and sacrament trays.</p>

He knew the promise of the sacrament prayer had been fulfilled: “Always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>).</p>

He kept at it over the years, as you and I will. He never talked about his spirituality. He just kept on doing little things for the Lord that he was prompted to do.</p>

It didn’t matter if it was 10 people or 50 or how tired he was. He bore his testimony of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost and of the prophets whenever the Spirit urged him to do it.</p>

Over the years, when he needed it, the Holy Ghost was there as his companion.</p>

My mother, his wife of 41 years, lay on the bed. We had watched her for hours. We began to see the lines of pain disappear from her face. The fingers of her hands, which had been clenched into fists, relaxed. Her arms came to rest at her sides.</p>

That was because the Holy Ghost had long before given him a clear picture of who she was, where she came from, what she had become, and where she was going. The Spirit had testified to him many times of a loving Heavenly Father, of a Savior who had broken the power of death, and of the reality of the temple sealing he shared with his wife and family.</p>

He used the tools of science well enough to be honored by his peers across the world. Much of what he did in chemistry came from seeing in his mind’s eye molecules moving about and then confirming his vision by experiments in a laboratory.</p>

He was used to getting answers that came to his heart to give comfort and direction. In addition to having a habit of prayer, he knew the scriptures and the words of living prophets. So he recognized the familiar whisperings of the Spirit, which you may have felt today.</p>

It changed him through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

We have prayed together. Our loving Heavenly Father has heard us. We have remembered our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, as we have been touched by hymns of praise to Him. We have been inspired to do more to help our Master in His work to lift up and to succor the children of our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;

That is why our hearts swell when we hear the words sung “Because I have been given much, I too must give.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; King Benjamin, in his great sermon recorded in the Book of Mormon, promised that feeling of gratitude would come (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17-19" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Mosiah 2:17–19&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

King Benjamin taught that forgiveness is not accomplished in a single moment.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/trust-in-that-spirit-which-leadeth-to-do-good.p8" pid="cdoYzfBvhESoSX4HPSw25Q" hash="cKeGOg"&gt;He said it this way: “And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you—that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God—I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.26" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Mosiah 4:26&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

There are 31 women and girls in our family, beginning with my wife and progressing to include our three newest great-granddaughters. Some are here with us this evening. Five are under the age of 12. This may be their first meeting in the Conference Center with their sisters in the Savior’s Church. Each will take a different set of memories and make her own commitments from this experience tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/trust-in-that-spirit-which-leadeth-to-do-good.p11" pid="4Mk4nlGEEUK-9Bwx7yfHmQ" hash="p7yFoA"&gt;There are three memories and three commitments that I pray will stay with them over a lifetime and even beyond. The memories are of feelings. And the commitments are of things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/trust-in-that-spirit-which-leadeth-to-do-good.p12" pid="3MxtsLrZ-06DScG8t0DyHA" hash="gF8QEQ"&gt;The feeling of greatest importance is love. You have felt the love of the great sister leaders who have spoken. And you have felt by the Spirit that they loved you without even knowing you because they felt Heavenly Father’s and the Savior’s love for you. That is why they want so much to serve you and to have you receive the blessings God wants for you.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/trust-in-that-spirit-which-leadeth-to-do-good.p13" pid="KHKwCxIqy0KXVfDv5h8SZQ" hash="pdQbHw"&gt;You have felt love for others tonight—for friends, schoolmates, neighbors, and even someone who just came into your life, a stranger. That feeling of love is a gift from God. The scriptures call it “charity” and “the pure love of Christ” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Moroni 7:47&lt;/a&gt;). You have felt that love tonight, and you can receive it often if you seek it.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/trust-in-that-spirit-which-leadeth-to-do-good.p14" pid="XX3idHKSXEexUN9yu3mZoA" hash="z3twyg"&gt;A second feeling you have had tonight was the influence of the Holy Ghost. Sisters have promised you this day that the Holy Ghost will guide you to find the service the Lord would have you give to others for Him. You have felt by the Spirit that their promise was from the Lord and that it is true.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/trust-in-that-spirit-which-leadeth-to-do-good.p15" pid="zfdk6ksZeEuKUAUhPMHRJg" hash="vsq1KA"&gt;The Lord said, “And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good—yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.12" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 11:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, a name or a face of someone in need may have come to your mind during this meeting. It could have been only a fleeting thought, but because of what you heard tonight, you will pray about it, trusting that God will lead you to do the good He wants for them. As such prayers become a pattern in your life, you and others will be changed for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/trust-in-that-spirit-which-leadeth-to-do-good.p17" pid="gBmZFK32OU-sh9kxJ4BYwA" hash="NGU78A"&gt;The third feeling you have had tonight is that you want to be closer to the Savior. Even the youngest girl here will have felt the reality of the invitation in the song: “‘Come, follow me,’ the Savior said. Then let us in his footsteps tread.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/trust-in-that-spirit-which-leadeth-to-do-good.p18" pid="UUzpdzde8USCYMTrCA-wYA" hash="p0jbjg"&gt;So, with those feelings, the first thing you must commit to do is to go and serve, knowing that you do not go alone. When you go to comfort and serve anyone for the Savior, He prepares the way before you. Now, as the returned missionaries here tonight will tell you, that doesn’t mean that every person behind every door is prepared to welcome you or that every person you try to serve will thank you. But the Lord will go before your face to prepare the way.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/trust-in-that-spirit-which-leadeth-to-do-good.p19" pid="0dCq7BoGgkun75e7-7FW5g" hash="rpoMDw"&gt;Time and again President Thomas S. Monson has said he knows the reality of the Lord’s promise: “And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 84:88&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/trust-in-that-spirit-which-leadeth-to-do-good.p20" pid="tTE8mB_qFkarFmwk4oeRcg" hash="dQWkSQ"&gt;One of the ways He goes before your face is to prepare the heart of a person He has asked you to serve. He will prepare your heart as well.&lt;/p&gt;

The Lord arranged “a cloud of witnesses” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.1" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Hebrews 12:1&lt;/a&gt;), both in words and music, to combine and multiply the power of what He wanted me to say. I just had to be sure that I could fit my part into His composition. I hope and pray that you will feel gratitude and joy as the Lord puts you together with others to serve for Him.&lt;/p&gt;

To them, and to all of Heavenly Father’s daughters, I repeat the wise counsel of Sister Linda K. Burton.&lt;/p&gt;

You will pray to know whom the Father would have you serve out of love for Him and for our Savior.

Yet I will pray that they will accept the counsel of the Lord, when He said—which I am confident we all need to hear:&lt;/p&gt;

He is risen. He paid the price for all of our sins. I know that because of Him we will be resurrected and can have eternal life. President Thomas S. Monson is His living prophet. Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers. I witness that we grow closer to the Savior as we, out of pure love, serve others for Him. I so leave you that sure witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;

By the miracle of modern technology, the separation of time and of vast distances vanishes. We meet as if we are all together in one great hall.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/where-two-or-three-are-gathered.p8" pid="XDP3nC9RQk-FyrnwDIDOdw" hash="FsKWKA"&gt;But even more important than our gathering together is in whose name we do so. The Lord promised that even with the great number of His disciples on the earth today, He would be close to each of us. He said to His little band of disciples in 1829, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, … where two or three are gathered together in my name, … behold, there will I be in the midst of them—even so am I in the midst of you” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.32" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 6:32&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Because He is a resurrected and glorified being, He is not physically everyplace where Saints gather. But, by the power of the Spirit, we can feel that He is here with us today.&lt;/p&gt;

They will try earnestly to draw nearer to the Lord during this conference. They each wrote to me—their letters arriving at my office in the same week—pleading for the same kind of help.&lt;/p&gt;

They knew that the Prophet Joseph Smith organized the Church by direct revelation from God and that the keys of the holy priesthood were restored. Each felt a witness that keys are in place in the Church today. They bore to me their solemn testimony in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

They both wanted, with full heart, for me to help them regain the joy and the feeling of being loved that was theirs as they came into the kingdom of God. Both expressed a fear that if they could not regain in full those feelings of love for the Savior and His Church, the trials and tests they faced would finally overcome their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

During His mortal ministry, the Savior gave us the parable of the seed and the sower. The seed was the word of God. The sower was the Lord. The survival of the seed and its growth depended on the condition of the soil. You remember His words:&lt;/p&gt;

We all have had seeds, or the word of God, planted in our hearts at one time. For some, it was in childhood when our parents invited us to be baptized and confirmed by those in authority. Others of us were taught by called servants of God. Each felt that the seed was good, even felt the swelling in our hearts, and experienced joy as our hearts and minds seemed to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

The seed is the word of God, and it will be poured out on all of us who listen, watch, and read the proceedings of this conference. The music, the talks, and the testimonies have been prepared by servants of God who have sought diligently for the Holy Ghost to guide them in their preparation. They have prayed longer and more humbly as the days of the conference have approached.&lt;/p&gt;

At the start of this session, you more than listened to the prayer; you added your faith to the petition that we will enjoy the blessing of having the Holy Ghost poured out upon us. As you added your silent pleading in the name of Jesus Christ, you drew closer to Him. This is His conference. Only the Holy Ghost can bring the blessings the Lord desires for us.

They will perform for the Lord as if they were before Him, and they will know that our Heavenly Father hears them as surely as He hears their personal prayers. Together they have labored with love to make the promise of the Savior to Emma Smith come true: “For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.12" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 25:12&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

More than once, someone has said to me after my testimony, “How did you know what I so needed to hear?” I have learned not to be surprised when I cannot remember saying the words. I spoke the words of testimony, but the Lord was there, giving them to me in the moment. The promise that the Lord will give us words in the very moment applies especially to testimony (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24.6" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 24:6&lt;/a&gt;). Listen carefully to the testimonies borne in this conference—you will feel closer to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

Under His direction, His Son, Jehovah, was the Creator. I testify that Jesus of Nazareth was born the Son of God. He healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, and raised the dead. He paid the price of all the sins of each of Heavenly Father’s children born into mortality. He broke the bands of death for all as He rose from the tomb that first Easter Sunday. He lives today, a God—resurrected and glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

Thomas S. Monson is His prophet to all the world. The prophets and apostles you will hear in this conference speak for the Lord. They are His servants, authorized to act for Him. He goes before His servants in the world. This I know. And I so witness in His name, even the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p5" pid="9kpWWTH6YU6oAq-EuxqB-w" hash="OG9E_A"&gt;I am grateful to be with you this evening in the general priesthood session of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This is a grand moment in the history of the Church. One hundred eighty-two years ago, in 1834, in Kirtland, Ohio, all of the priesthood holders were called to meet together in a 14-by-14-foot (4.2 by 4.2 m) log schoolhouse. In that meeting the Prophet Joseph Smith is reported to have said: “You know no more concerning the destinies of this Church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother’s lap. You don’t comprehend it. … It is only a little handful of Priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America—it will fill the world.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p6" pid="arzUzLzdokygBiH8qFCMeg" hash="csfOzw"&gt;Millions of priesthood holders, in more than 110 countries, are gathered in this session. Perhaps the Prophet Joseph foresaw this time and the glorious future yet ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p7" pid="r9lJGhOICkuCcmyklk9D2A" hash="erNdWA"&gt;My message tonight is an attempt to describe that future and what we must do to be a part of the plan of happiness our Heavenly Father has prepared for us. Before we were born, we lived in a family with our exalted and eternal Heavenly Father. He ordained a plan that enables us to advance and progress to become like Him. He did it out of love for us. The purpose of the plan was to allow us the privilege of living forever as our Heavenly Father lives. This gospel plan offered us a life of mortality in which we would be tested. A promise was given that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, if we obeyed the laws and priesthood ordinances of the gospel, we would have eternal life, the greatest of all His gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p8" pid="HOQ9l5LulEqB9NqfyfsWUA" hash="g9MtEg"&gt;Eternal life is that kind of life which God our Eternal Father lives. God has said that His purpose is “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Moses 1:39&lt;/a&gt;). The great purpose of every priesthood holder, therefore, is to assist in the work of helping people rise to eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p9" pid="k_Vuw7WVMUy9qYWlbju3CQ" hash="bn-6hg"&gt;Every priesthood effort and every priesthood ordinance is intended to help Heavenly Father’s children be changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ to become members of perfected family units. It follows that “the great work of every man is to believe the gospel, to keep the commandments, and to create and perfect an eternal family unit,”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; and to help others do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p10" pid="GwcWgZ_1w0eoiR5lfB7VtA" hash="2q1UfA"&gt;Since that is true, everything we do should have celestial marriage as its focus and purpose. That means we must strive to be sealed to an eternal companion in the temple of God. We must also encourage others to make and keep the covenants that bind a husband and wife together, with their family, in this life and in the world to come.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p11" pid="TXzcBPM6ekKZKVwJbyJJ_A" hash="R-j0iA"&gt;Why should this matter so much to each of us—young or old, deacon or high priest, son or father? It is because our priesthood obligation is to put our families and the families of those around us at the center of our concern. Every major decision should be based on the effect it will have on a family to qualify for life with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. There is nothing in our priesthood service as important as this.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p12" pid="wb0Gop55SUGG2Z0AwZXejQ" hash="wWQ0Bw"&gt;Let me tell you what this could mean to a deacon listening tonight as a member of a family unit and as a quorum member.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p13" pid="bUNYebqtPE2j-31hIK5rIA" hash="W_7WEQ"&gt;In his family, there may or may not be regular family prayer or frequent family home evening. If his father, sensing these obligations, calls the family together for prayer or scripture reading, the deacon can rush to take part with a smile. He can encourage his brothers and sisters to participate and praise them when they do. He can ask his father for a blessing when school begins or in another moment of need.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p14" pid="s7nzsSxwkEWeTUoLptKMPg" hash="c6YuWg"&gt;He may not have such a faithful father. But the very desire of his heart for those experiences will bring the powers of heaven to those around him because of his faith. They will seek for the family life that deacon wants with all his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p15" pid="-xBs72nu0UmLrdt8RfYJtA" hash="ctszTQ"&gt;The teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood can see in his home teaching assignment an opportunity to help the Lord change the lives of a family. The Lord suggested that in the Doctrine and Covenants:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p16" pid="QBPkebbx8U23uiMMcFtVDQ" hash="vGsECA"&gt;“The teacher’s duty is to watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p17" pid="jOV4J8RPUEG4zJShSfcf_g" hash="aWXn2Q"&gt;“And see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.53-54" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 20:53–54&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p18" pid="HPW_akja90OH5O9AI2fXmw" hash="QJOeqw"&gt;Similarly, the priest in the Aaronic Priesthood is given this charge:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p19" pid="psxrlfat9U-XVbJPxYYNjg" hash="Dbvi4w"&gt;“The priest’s duty is to preach, teach, expound, exhort, and baptize, and administer the sacrament,&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p20" pid="gNCF-kFarU6aNjTdbLuX9w" hash="q-49Gw"&gt;“And visit the house of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.46-47" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 20:46–47&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p21" pid="dkuktB0iU0GHZCLrfnkVAQ" hash="Y9XETQ"&gt;You may wonder, as I did when I was a young teacher and priest, how in the world I could rise to those challenges. I was never sure how I could exhort in a way that would move a family toward eternal life without offending or seeming to criticize. I have learned that the only exhortation that changes hearts comes from the Holy Ghost. That occurs most often as we bear testimony of the Savior, who was and is the perfect family member. As we focus on our love for Him, harmony and peace will grow in the homes we visit. The Holy Ghost will attend us in our service to families.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p22" pid="Y_zR9f8ocki0XmfTplc1YA" hash="dczOAA"&gt;The young priesthood holder may, by the way he prays, by the way he speaks, and by the way he encourages the members of the family, bring the influence and example of the Savior to their minds and hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p23" pid="SF-Tpl4XiUGCDV25wD5hEA" hash="tJZpUw"&gt;One wise priesthood leader showed me he understood that. He asked my young son to take the lead in a home teaching visit. He said that the family might resist his exhortations, but he thought the simple teaching and testimony of a boy might more likely penetrate their hardened hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p24" pid="L7StelMPikeET2m8_cZLcA" hash="YJhOug"&gt;What can the young elder do to help in the creation of eternal families? He may be about to go into the mission field. He can pray with all his heart that he will be able to find, teach, and baptize families. I still remember a handsome young man with his lovely bride and their two beautiful little girls sitting with me and my missionary companion one day. The Holy Ghost came and testified to them that the gospel of Jesus Christ had been restored. They believed enough that they even asked if we could give their two little girls a blessing, as they had seen done in one of our sacrament meetings. They already had a desire for their children to be blessed, but they did not yet understand that the higher blessings would be possible only in the temples of God after they had made covenants.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p25" pid="iM4kWHkJU06PydR7zKt8mA" hash="PGGm7w"&gt;I still feel pain to think of that couple and those little girls, probably now grown old, without the promise of an eternal family. Their parents had at least an inkling of the blessings that could be made available to them. My hope is that they somehow, somewhere may yet have the opportunity to qualify to be an eternal family.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p26" pid="shyHAqT210SRXGNYfD9e_w" hash="swsKEA"&gt;Other elders going into the field will have the happier experience my son Matthew had. He and his companion found a widow with 11 children living in humble circumstances. He wanted for them what you want—to have an eternal family. To my son, it looked impossible or at least unlikely at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p27" pid="UP0EJkwcM0qUYbBQoXHkIA" hash="k4DjVA"&gt;I visited that little city years after my son had baptized the widow, and she invited me to meet her family at church. I had to wait a while because most of her children, with her many grandchildren, came from several different chapels in the area. One son was faithfully serving in a bishopric, many of her children have been blessed by temple covenants, and she is sealed in an eternal family. As I parted from this dear sister, she put her arms around my waist (she was very short, so she could just barely get to my waist) and said, “Please, tell Mateo to come back to Chile before I die.” She had been given, because of those faithful elders, the happy anticipation of the greatest of all the gifts of God.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p28" pid="OQb4p9GEK0iR55y7z7cNyw" hash="lv0gog"&gt;There are things an elder, as he returns from his mission, must do to be true to his commitment to seek eternal life for himself and for those he loves. There is no more important commitment in time or in eternity than marriage. You have heard wise counsel to make marriage a priority in early post-mission plans. The faithful priesthood servant will do it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/eternal-families.p29" pid="mGf9Lq3WhE23Tzw781AEyQ" hash="nkhKew"&gt;In considering marriage, he will see that he is choosing the parents of his children and the heritage they will have. He will make the choice with earnest searching and prayerful consideration. He will ensure that the person he marries shares his ideals for family and his convictions of the Lord’s purpose for marriage and that she is a person to whom he would be willing to trust his children’s happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

You shouldn’t be resting while I’m working.” And then he used almost the same words my father had years before: “Hal, you are the one who should read this.

The Lord instructed the Saints in Jackson County, Missouri, in 1831 that their prayers and thanks should be directed heavenward. The early Saints were given a revelation about how to keep the Sabbath day and how to fast and pray.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Some are close to feeling that, at least for them, all is lost. I hope and pray that what I say about being grateful on the Sabbath will be helpful to make doubts fly and for singing to start in your hearts.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/gratitude-on-the-sabbath-day.p28" pid="qhe4b8WnGE-iBXO9SO4Dkw" hash="hMU0fg">One blessing for which we can be grateful is that we are there in that sacrament meeting at all, gathered with more than one or two of His disciples in His name. There are some at home unable to rise from their beds. There are some who would like to be where we are but are instead serving in hospitals and providing public safety or are defending us at the risk of their own lives in some desert or jungle. The fact that we are able to gather with even one other Saint and partake of the sacrament will help us begin to feel gratitude and love for God’s kindness.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/gratitude-on-the-sabbath-day.p29" pid="hSPJAKLn2kSFOuJoY55jtQ" hash="x-2rsA">Because of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the restored gospel, another blessing we can count is that we have the opportunity to take the sacrament each week—prepared, blessed, and passed by authorized servants of God. We can be grateful when the Holy Spirit confirms to us that the words of the sacrament prayers, offered by those authorized priesthood holders, are honored by our Heavenly Father.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/gratitude-on-the-sabbath-day.p30" pid="Q-MVGmqueEqYJcnvtEqNCw" hash="5mgzlA">Of all the blessings we can count, the greatest by far is the feeling of forgiveness that comes as we partake of the sacrament. We will feel greater love and appreciation for the Savior, whose infinite sacrifice made possible our being cleansed from sin. As we partake of the bread and water, we remember that He suffered for us. And when we feel gratitude for what He has done for us, we will feel His love for us and our love for Him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/gratitude-on-the-sabbath-day.p31" pid="NRWiYFYWTEqIXe5HBMaC8w" hash="LF7dOA">The blessing of love we receive will make it easier for us to keep the commandment to “always remember him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> You may even feel love and gratitude, as I do, for the Holy Ghost, who Heavenly Father has promised will always be with us as we remain faithful to the covenants we have made. We can count all those blessings every Sunday and feel grateful.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/gratitude-on-the-sabbath-day.p32" pid="Xng4aUjsykOWmFNsTvugwQ" hash="U0L0dA">The Sabbath is also a perfect time to remember the covenant we made at the waters of baptism to love and serve Heavenly Father’s children. Fulfilling that promise on the Sabbath will include participating in a class or quorum with full purpose of heart to build faith and love among our brothers and sisters who are there with us. That promise will include cheerfully fulfilling our callings.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/gratitude-on-the-sabbath-day.p33" pid="YF4Tc5VkEEebV-mGzhmGWw" hash="lYYQkw">I am grateful for the many Sundays I taught a deacons quorum in Bountiful, Utah, as well as a Sunday School class in Idaho. And I even remember the times I served as an assistant to my wife in the nursery, where my main task was to hand out toys and pick them up.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/gratitude-on-the-sabbath-day.p34" pid="ALECO6_VDUqQOdrSTHynlQ" hash="iUbz3w">It was years before I recognized through the Spirit that my simple service for the Lord mattered in the lives of Heavenly Father’s children. To my surprise, some of them have remembered and thanked me for my fledgling attempts to serve them for the Master on those Sabbath days.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/gratitude-on-the-sabbath-day.p35" pid="HnY5JqOXOkSRadA1xBNcgQ" hash="qPW-7A">Just as we sometimes cannot see the results of our own service given on the Sabbath, we may not be able to see the cumulative effects of other servants of the Lord. But the Lord is building His kingdom quietly through His faithful and humble servants, with little fanfare, toward its glorious millennial future. It takes the Holy Spirit to see the growing grandeur.</p>

Seventy-five years ago, I was baptized in Philadelphia in the only Church-built chapel we could get to in Pennsylvania or New Jersey. Yet where there was one little branch in Princeton, New Jersey, there are now two large wards. And just days ago, thousands of young people performed in a celebration preceding the dedication of the Philadelphia Pennsylvania Temple.</p>

There was one chapel and a district that stretched across much of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. I drove the hills of that beautiful country to sacrament meetings in tiny branches, most in small rented facilities or little remodeled homes. Now there is a sacred temple of God in Belmont, Massachusetts, and stakes that spread across the countryside.</p>

I could feel it, but I could not see the extent and the timing of the Lord’s intentions to build and glorify His kingdom. A prophet, by revelation, saw and recorded what we can now see ourselves. Nephi said that our total numbers would not be great but that the cumulative light would be a sight to see:</p>

The inspired messages from the powerful sister leaders and the music have fortified our faith and increased our desire to keep the sacred covenants we have made with our loving Heavenly Father. We have felt an increase in our love for the Lord Jesus Christ and an appreciation for the marvelous gift of His atoning sacrifice.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p6" pid="KMhfJOeiv0KHrA0zccj_Dw" hash="wmayOQ">My message tonight is a simple one. We have all felt peace tonight. All of us would like to feel such peace often within ourselves, in our families, and with the people around us. The Lord promised peace to His disciples as He was about to leave them. He has made the same promise to us. But He said that He would give peace in His way, not in the world’s way. He described His way of sending peace:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p7" pid="AJeoIStav0CIem2sL2V2PA" hash="Vp4WyQ">“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p8" pid="fw1S6yHdWE-AQ7686zTABg" hash="JeESnw">“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26-27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26–27</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p9" pid="pn0FhZuN_EGjeaQUbkolbw" hash="Q22H7A">The sons of Mosiah needed that gift of peace as they embarked on their mission to the Lamanites. With more than a little anxiety as they sensed the greatness of their task, they prayed for reassurance. And “the Lord did visit them with his Spirit, and said unto them: Be comforted. And they were comforted” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 17:10</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:27</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p10" pid="GPpeX2edFESQEocltyoVtw" hash="--japg">At times, you may long for peace as you face uncertainty and what seem to you to be looming challenges. The sons of Mosiah learned the lesson that the Lord taught to Moroni. It is a guide for us all: “If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all [who] humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:27</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p11" pid="V6ELowDrI06TlK2VehbUQg" hash="p32NlA">Moroni said that when he “heard these words,” he “was comforted” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.29" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:29</a>). They can be a comfort to all of us. Those who do not see their weaknesses do not progress. Your awareness of your weakness is a blessing as it helps you remain humble and keeps you turning to the Savior. The Spirit not only comforts you, but He is also the agent by which the Atonement works a change in your very nature. Then weak things become strong.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p12" pid="JBSse9VWJkm8ynWz7FjdnA" hash="FUJonw">You will at times have your faith challenged by Satan; it happens to all disciples of Jesus Christ. Your defense against these attacks is to keep the Holy Ghost as your companion. The Spirit will speak peace to your soul. He will urge you forward in faith. And He will bring back the memory of those times when you felt the light and the love of Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p13" pid="rARDIRe4Skantr_2DXR91w" hash="mmipGg">Remembering may be one of the most precious gifts the Spirit can give you. He will “bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever [the Lord has] said unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>). The memory may be of an answered prayer, of a priesthood ordinance received, of a confirmation of your testimony, or of a moment when you saw God’s guiding hand in your life. Perhaps in a future day when you need strength, the Spirit may bring to your memory the feelings you are having during this meeting. I pray that this may be so.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p14" pid="8gySbUrwaEaJussDbXyCtw" hash="M0tWuA">One memory that the Spirit often brings to my mind is of an evening sacrament meeting held many years ago in a metal shed in Innsbruck, Austria. The shed was under a railroad track. There were only about a dozen people present, sitting on wooden chairs. Most of them were women, some younger and some older. I saw tears of gratitude as the sacrament was passed among the small congregation. I felt the love of the Savior for those Saints, and so did they. But the miracle I remember most clearly was the light that seemed to fill that metal shed, bringing with it a feeling of peace. It was nighttime and there were no windows, and yet the room was lit as if by noonday sunshine.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p15" pid="NxAvugJscEuocBPBa-A0EA" hash="OFdtOQ">The light of the Holy Spirit was bright and abundant that evening. And the windows that let in the light were the humble hearts of those Saints, who had come before the Lord seeking forgiveness of their sins and committing to always remember Him. It was not hard to remember Him then, and my memory of that sacred experience has made it easier for me to remember Him and His Atonement in the years that have followed. That day the promise in the sacrament prayer that the Spirit will be with us was fulfilled and so brought feelings of light and peace.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p16" pid="J_WB5Joh80m09zaAh21Bew" hash="ruMDTw">Like you, I have been thankful for the many ways the Lord has visited me with the Comforter when I needed peace. Yet our Father in Heaven is concerned not just about our comfort but even more about our upward progress. “Comforter” is only one of the ways the Holy Ghost is described in the scriptures. Here is another: “And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 11:12</a>). Most often, the good He will lead you to do will involve helping someone else receive comfort from God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p17" pid="jYQMiPsByUuKj0Q4z1o4BA" hash="Yf9zMQ">In His wisdom, the Lord has brought you together in organizations and classes in His Church. He has done so to increase your power to do good. Within these organizations, you have specific charges to serve others for Him. For example, if you are a young woman, you might be asked by your bishop or your Young Women leader to reach out to a Laurel who has become what we sometimes call “less active.” You may know her better than does the bishop or the Young Women leader. You may know that she is feeling troubled at home or at school or perhaps both. Your leaders may not know why they felt impressed to ask you to reach out to her, but the Lord does, and He directs this work through the inspiration of His Spirit.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p18" pid="qoV49-_FoUihcQ9L3p3xkA" hash="YNmsYg">Success in your efforts will take a miracle of change both in your heart and in the heart of the young woman you were sent to rescue—and that requires the companionship of the Holy Ghost. The Spirit can allow you to see the less-active Laurel as the Lord sees her. The Lord knows her heart and your heart, and He knows the possibilities of hearts being changed. He can visit you both with His Spirit to inspire humility, forgiveness, and love.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p19" pid="vaYZocpIbk2ABgYtlPFkXg" hash="sOgXMQ">That Spirit can inspire the words, the deeds, and the patience necessary for you to invite a lamb back to the flock. And He can touch the hearts of the flock in the Laurel class to love and welcome the lost sheep so that when she returns, she will feel she has come home.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p20" pid="UeBK9pN2QE-newvUFObjpg" hash="yA1mpg">Your power to do good as a group of God’s daughters will depend, to a great degree, on the unity and love that exist among you. This is another gift of peace that comes through the Holy Ghost.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p21" pid="u7DKVvSAyEGVfLnNMFx68w" hash="O6xnlA">Alma understood this. That is why he pleaded with his people “that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.21" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:21</a>).</p>

But you know from experience, as I do, that such loving unity is hard to maintain. It takes having the Holy Ghost as a companion to open our eyes and temper our feelings.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p23" pid="lfiXrUcPFEGOFaL4pJgfRg" hash="AUqV1w">I remember once a seven- or eight-year-old son of ours jumping on his bed hard enough that I thought it might break. I felt a flash of frustration, and I moved quickly to set my house in order. I grabbed my son by his little shoulders and lifted him up to where our eyes met.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p24" pid="WzmEXKJtU0KA1_8Q-xrDog" hash="UifizA">The Spirit put words into my mind. It seemed a quiet voice, but it pierced to my heart: “You are holding a great person.” I gently set him back on the bed and apologized.</p>

The Spirit sees with the pure love of Christ. Listen to the words Mormon used to describe charity. Think of times you have felt it:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you.p27" pid="LGIbBtR6RUKda6IiE2yksQ" hash="y8SwZQ">“Charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>

It may seem to you like a distant goal, but from His perspective, you’re not that far away. So He visits you with His Spirit to comfort you, encourage you, and inspire you to keep going.</p>

You will then feel the peace the Savior promised to leave with His disciples. With that peace will come a bright hope and a feeling of light and love from the Father and His Beloved Son, who leads His kingdom on earth through revelation to His living prophet. I so testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p6" pid="5Dp7wsHADESDQ-hTdI_bRw" hash="o9rmug">General conference has always been a time of gathering for the Latter-day Saints. We have long since outgrown the ability to gather physically in one place, but the Lord has provided ways for the blessings of general conference to reach out to you no matter where you are. While it is impressive to see the gathering of Saints in this large Conference Center, we who stand at this pulpit always have in our mind’s eye the millions of people who are gathered with us around the world to watch and listen to the conference. Many of you are gathered with your families; some may be gathered with friends or fellow Church members.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p7" pid="z5MfmoQ3skis-dK66h2Wew" hash="076Q5w">Wherever you are and however you are hearing my voice, please know that even though you are not with us in person, we feel that you are with us in spirit. We hope all of you will feel one with us—that you will feel the spiritual power that comes whenever a body of believers gathers in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p8" pid="JmrjISC8lEqBkfP2aPYe-Q" hash="7ovEmA">I have felt impressed to speak to you today about another kind of gathering. This kind does not happen only every six months, as general conference does. Instead, it has been going on continuously since the early days of the Restoration of the Church, and it has been hastening in recent years. I refer to the gathering of the family of God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p9" pid="EYkHALrfS0qurImQ4INTkQ" hash="qV-b0w">To describe this gathering, it may be best to begin before we were born, before what the Bible calls “the beginning” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.1" class="scriptureRef">Genesis 1:1</a>). At that time, we lived with Heavenly Father as His spirit children. This is true of every person who has ever lived on earth.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p10" pid="ajx2Ehm8Z0GrWZi7aZ83wQ" hash="ZxqWUA">You see, the names “brother” and “sister” are not just friendly greetings or terms of endearment for us. They are an expression of an eternal truth: God is the literal Father of all mankind; we are each part of His eternal family. Because He loves us with the love of a perfect Father, He wants us to progress and advance and become like Him. He ordained a plan by which we would come to earth, in families, and have experiences that would prepare us to return to Him and live as He lives.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p11" pid="MKW3UGMDSki_a1Xwukfl8Q" hash="gOR9Hg">The central element of this plan was the promise that Jesus Christ would offer Himself as a sacrifice, to rescue us from sin and death. Our task in that plan is to accept the Savior’s sacrifice by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel. You and I accepted this plan. In fact, we rejoiced in it, even though it would mean that we would leave the presence of our Father and forget what we had experienced there with Him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p12" pid="J5HPvVvt9ki6eYGyHb5MAw" hash="HcEKNw">But we were not sent here completely in the dark. Each of us was given a portion of God’s light, called the “Light of Christ,” to help us distinguish between good and evil, right and wrong. This is why even those who live with little or no knowledge of the Father’s plan can still sense, in their hearts, that certain actions are just and moral while others are not.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p13" pid="ODdueVvN9Uykoz0ciFDUmQ" hash="IOqoPw">Our sense of right and wrong seems especially keen when we are raising our children. Innate in almost every parent is the desire to teach his or her children moral virtues. This is part of the miracle of Heavenly Father’s plan. He wants His children to come to earth, following the eternal pattern of families that exists in heaven. Families are the basic organizational unit of the eternal realms, and so He intends for them also to be the basic unit on earth. Though earthly families are far from perfect, they give God’s children the best chance to be welcomed to the world with the only love on earth that comes close to what we felt in heaven—parental love. Families are also the best way to preserve and pass on moral virtues and true principles that are most likely to lead us back to God’s presence.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p14" pid="dLfoyg7C0U-WRiP3OeSjtA" hash="BJas5Q">Only a very small minority of God’s children obtain during this life a complete understanding of God’s plan, along with access to the priesthood ordinances and covenants that make the Savior’s atoning power fully operative in our lives. Even those with the best of parents may live faithfully according to the light they have but never hear about Jesus Christ and His Atonement or be invited to be baptized in His name. This has been true for countless millions of our brothers and sisters throughout the world’s history.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p15" pid="TyKPz80GqUCghHkb_EwjFg" hash="sLf4jw">Some may consider this unfair. They may even take it as evidence that there is no plan, no specific requirements for salvation—feeling that a just, loving God would not create a plan that is available to such a small proportion of His children. Others might conclude that God must have determined in advance which of His children He would save and made the gospel available to them, while those who never heard the gospel simply were not “chosen.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p16" pid="rIYaj_0BskyDoOlJLvvCSQ" hash="__9Xgw">But you and I know, because of the truths restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, that God’s plan is much more loving and just than that. Our Heavenly Father is anxious to gather and bless all of His family. While He knows that not all of them will choose to be gathered, His plan gives each of His children the opportunity to accept or reject His invitation. And families are at the heart of this plan.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p17" pid="1cRX1g2MpUC-V4YwgaBr2A" hash="hytRnQ">Centuries ago, the prophet Malachi said that in a coming day, God would send Elijah to “turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Malachi 4:6</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p18" pid="-7VDBmqr6UKz3pxd5RAFYQ" hash="SrWFXQ">This prophecy was so important the Savior quoted it when He visited the Americas after His Resurrection (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/25.5-6" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 25:5–6</a>). And when the angel Moroni visited the Prophet Joseph Smith, he too quoted the prophecy about Elijah and hearts, fathers, and children (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.36-39" class="scriptureRef">Joseph Smith—History 1:36–39</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p19" pid="GVROH-3_pEWym_As1KVjcg" hash="GowJow">Today is April 1. Two days from now, April 3, marks 181 years from the day when Malachi’s prophecy was fulfilled. On that day, Elijah did come, and he gave to Joseph Smith the priesthood power to seal families eternally (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.13-16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 110:13–16</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p20" pid="xksEeV6QP0mpp9vkPs7Eiw" hash="Tr-uhA">From that day to this, interest in exploring one’s family history has grown exponentially. At ever-increasing rates, people seem drawn to their ancestry with more than just casual curiosity. Genealogical libraries, associations, and technologies have emerged around the world to support this interest. The internet’s power to enhance communications has enabled families to work together to do family history research with a speed and thoroughness never before possible.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p21" pid="QPUEP1crDUGVgdcyxXMmhw" hash="2n5aJg">Why is all of this happening? For lack of a better term, we call it the “spirit of Elijah.” We could also equally call it “fulfillment of prophecy.” I bear testimony that Elijah did come. The hearts of the children—of you and me—have turned to our fathers, our ancestors. The affection you feel for your ancestors is part of the fulfillment of that prophecy. It is deeply seated in your sense of who you are. But it has to do with more than just inherited DNA.</p>

This could be very interesting and even insightful. But if your work stops there, you will sense that something is missing. This is because to gather and unite God’s family requires more than just warm feelings. It requires sacred covenants made in connection with priesthood ordinances.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p23" pid="CQm686DGakWnM2EkG-X7AA" hash="cAdcfg">Many of your ancestors did not receive those ordinances. But in the providence of God, you did. And God knew that you would feel drawn to your ancestors in love and that you would have the technology necessary to identify them. He also knew that you would live in a time when access to holy temples, where the ordinances can be performed, would be greater than ever in history. And He knew that He could trust you to accomplish this work in behalf of your ancestors.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p24" pid="P69HgAUMiE2dVGyxus3S-w" hash="9E5EeQ">Of course, all of us have many pressing and important responsibilities that need our attention and time. All of us find parts of what the Lord expects us to do beyond our abilities. Fortunately, the Lord provides a way for each of us to gain confidence and satisfaction in all our service, including family history service. We gain strength to do what He asks through our faith that the Savior gives no commandment “save he shall prepare a way for [us] that [we] may accomplish the thing which he commandeth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 3:7</a>).</p>

Many years ago, as a university student, I met a man who worked for one of the largest computer companies in the world. This was in the early days of computing, and it just so happened that his company had sent him to sell computers to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p26" pid="wBChPSzaWkKqQtTnL4G7yg" hash="xmN-jQ">As far as I could tell, this salesman had no religious faith. Yet he said with wonder and exasperation, “In this church they were doing what they called ‘genealogy,’ searching for names of people who are dead, trying to identify their ancestors. People, mostly women, were running around between filing cabinets, searching through little cards for information.” If I remember right, he said the ladies were wearing tennis shoes so they could run a little faster. The man went on, “As I saw the magnitude of what they were trying to do, I realized that I had discovered the reason for the invention of computers.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p27" pid="t7ZZ8IrFq0KDbUNM36yqYA" hash="DQwbgg">Well, he was partially right. Computers would be an important part of the future of family history work—just not the computers he was selling. An inspired leader of the Church chose not to buy his computers. The Church was to wait for technology that at that time had not yet even been imagined. But I have learned in the many years since that even the best technology can never be a substitute for revelation from heaven, like the kind that Church leader received. This is a spiritual work, and the Lord directs it through His Holy Spirit.</p>

On the computer screen before me was a problem beyond my mortal power to solve. I saw two names, sent to me by the wonders of technology, of people who might be waiting for a temple ordinance. But the trouble was that the names were different, but there was a reason to believe they might be the same person. My task was to determine what was true.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p29" pid="0lshn3oakE-Cld0viaC_Rw" hash="-7fpnA">I asked my consultants to tell me. They said, “No, you must choose.” And they were completely sure I would discover the truth. The computer, with all its power and information, had left me the blessing of staring at those names on a screen, evaluating the available information, seeking other research, praying silently, and discovering what was true. As I prayed, I knew with surety what to do—just as I have in other situations when I needed to rely on heaven’s help to solve a problem.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p30" pid="2R-1mRmcnE2b4jpdEhtOIg" hash="yxspMw">We do not know what marvels God will inspire people to create to help in His work of gathering His family. But whatever marvelous inventions may come, their use will require the Spirit working in people like you and me. This should not surprise us. After all, these are beloved sons and daughters of God. He will send whatever inspiration is needed to give them the opportunity to return to Him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p31" pid="nF4qCGx6MkiFhvaUNbo2ig" hash="W5-t8g">In recent years, the youth of the Church have responded to the spirit of Elijah in an inspiring way. Many now hold their own limited-use temple recommend and use it often. Temple baptistries are busier than ever; some temples have even had to adjust their schedules to accommodate the increase in the number of young people attending the temple.</p>

Now this is the norm, and very often it is the young people themselves who found those ancestors.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p33" pid="Tre0ER_CdESEWF2Y8Qf1pQ" hash="qdhdvg">In addition, many youth have discovered that giving of their time to do family history research and temple work has deepened their testimony of the plan of salvation. It has increased the influence of the Spirit in their lives and decreased the influence of the adversary. It has helped them feel closer to their families and closer to the Lord Jesus Christ. They have learned that this work saves not just the dead; it saves all of us (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 128:18</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p34" pid="oulgJNz_rEmzuYiYGVoRBw" hash="1rvXIg">The youth have caught the vision admirably; now their parents need to catch up. There are now many people who have accepted baptism in the spirit world because of the work done by the youth, and they are waiting for other ordinances that only adults can perform in temples in this world. The work of gathering Heavenly Father’s family is not just for young people, and it is not just for grandparents. It is for everyone. We are all gatherers.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p35" pid="zSM8pvt_C0mYZcAUPtrjfQ" hash="vB5czQ">This is the work of our generation, what the Apostle Paul called “the dispensation of the fulness of times,” when he said God would “gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Ephesians 1:10</a>). This is made possible through the atoning work of God’s Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Because of Him, our family members, “who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.13-14" class="scriptureRef">Ephesians 2:13–14</a>). You have felt this, as I have, when you have experienced an increase of love as you looked at the picture of an ancestor. You have felt it in the temple when the name on a card seemed like more than a name, and you couldn’t help but sense that this person was aware of you and felt your love.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god.p36" pid="gTQAOYmqSEm5EuFmmoJjNA" hash="_ctx1g">I testify that God the Father wants His children home again, in families and in glory. The Savior lives. He directs and blesses this work, and He watches over and guides us.

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p5" pid="n1Qg1pfERUenOBzDYedPDg" hash="dlauaQ">My beloved brethren of the priesthood, my purpose today is both to reassure you and to invigorate you in your priesthood service. In some ways, it is similar to the purpose I imagine the Savior had when He met a rich young man who asked, “What good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.16" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 19:16</a>). Perhaps you have come to this conference, as this young man went to the Savior, wondering whether your service has been acceptable. And at the same time, you may sense that there is more to do—perhaps much more! I pray that I may be able to convey the Lord’s loving approval for what you have already done, while also offering an encouraging glimpse of what you may, with His help, yet achieve as a holder of His holy priesthood.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p6" pid="1zkD5EQOXUGll5GBBigDxg" hash="6qPPRQ">The rich young man was asked to sell everything he had and give to the poor and follow the Savior; your future progress may not require that, but it will require a measure of sacrifice. Either way, I hope my message does not cause you to “[go] away sorrowful,” as the young man did. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.20-22" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 19:20–22</a>.) Rather, I trust that you will “go on your way rejoicing” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.105" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:105</a>) because you want to improve and you think you can.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p7" pid="J6_sxQe3e0KREm0f3rjELA" hash="-RThQw">Even so, it’s natural to feel some inadequacy when we consider what the Lord has called us to do. In fact, if you told me that you feel perfectly capable of fulfilling your priesthood duties, I might worry that you do not understand them. On the other hand, if you told me that you feel like giving up because the task is too far beyond your abilities, then I would want to help you understand how the Lord magnifies and strengthens the holders of His priesthood to do things they never could have done alone.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p8" pid="V2NRG8WjlEuCzTC2UHvjMA" hash="GLgCbQ">This is just as true for me in my calling as it is for you in yours. None of us can do the work of the priesthood, and do it well, relying solely on our own wisdom and talents. That is because this is not our work—it is the Lord’s. So the only way to succeed is to rely on Him, whether you are a newly called deacon trusted with the task to bring a measure of spiritual power to the ordinance of the sacrament; or a young home teacher assigned by the Lord to love and minister to a family you don’t know and who seems not to want your love or your ministering; or a father who knows you are to preside over your home in righteousness, but perhaps you’re unsure how to do it, and time seems to be running out, because those children are growing up quickly and the world seems so harsh and hostile.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p9" pid="XHzysta-z0OcgrV86XWpVQ" hash="0MqO4g">So if you feel a little overwhelmed, take that as a good sign. It indicates that you can sense the magnitude of the trust God has placed in you. It means that you have some small understanding of what the priesthood really is.</p>

Even those who can recite a reasonable definition may not truly understand it. There are some scriptures that, through the power of the Spirit they carry, can deepen our sense of awe regarding the holy priesthood. Here are some of those scriptures:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p11" pid="YlOeIaUUIkC2rnoEFkWrKg" hash="7om0VA">“The power and authority of the … Melchizedek Priesthood, is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church—</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p19" pid="uX9PeBIgz0W07SS3Wmjn3Q" hash="oh7ogQ">One way to respond to such awe-inspiring descriptions of the power of the priesthood is to assume that they do not apply to us. Another way to respond is with soul-searching questions, asked in our own hearts, such as these: Have I ever felt that the heavens have been opened to me? Would anyone use the phrase “ministering of angels” to describe my priesthood service? Do I bring the “power of godliness” into the lives of those I serve? Have I ever broken a mountain, defied an army, broken someone’s bands, or subdued worldly powers—even if only figuratively—in order to accomplish God’s will?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p20" pid="OFxO-6ktXkKTayJxBKpsOw" hash="Dwooig">Such introspection always brings a feeling that we could be doing more in the service of the Lord. I hope it also brings you a feeling that you <span class="emphasis">want </span>to do more—a longing to participate more fully in the Lord’s miraculous work. Such feelings are the first step toward becoming the kind of men that priesthood service is meant to produce.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p21" pid="ABuG2G80RU2XrTs7b9a4uQ" hash="3JErVQ">The next step is described in an interaction between Jehovah and Enoch. We know Enoch as a mighty prophet who established Zion in the midst of great wickedness. But before he was a mighty prophet, Enoch saw himself as “but a lad, … slow of speech,” and hated by all the people (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.31" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:31</a>). Listen to the words the Lord used to encourage Enoch. They are also His words to you who are called to minister to others as a priesthood holder:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p22" pid="IxGsVeFeCUu8HfMH2-Qvjw" hash="azMv2w">“And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee.

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p24" pid="xu561GFjJ0GkPYjz-2DqlQ" hash="sBfV-Q">Brethren, our ordination to the priesthood is an invitation from the Lord to walk with Him. And what does it mean to walk with the Lord? It means to do what He does, to serve the way He serves. He sacrificed His own comforts to bless those in need, so that’s what we try to do. He seemed to take particular notice of people who were overlooked and even shunned by society, so we should try to do that too. He testified boldly yet lovingly of the true doctrine He received from His Father, even if it was unpopular, and so must we. He said to all, “Come unto me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 11:28</a>), and we say to all, “Come unto Him.” As priesthood holders, we are His representatives. We act not for ourselves but for Him. We speak not our words but His. The people we serve come to know Him better because of our service.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p25" pid="gpL7OL_6_UyX0zcb-p0JTA" hash="Hz3rcA">As soon as we accept the Lord’s invitation “Walk with me,” the nature of our priesthood service changes. It becomes all at once higher and nobler but also more achievable, because we know that we are not alone. I felt this most powerfully when President Thomas S. Monson laid his hands on my head nine years ago and blessed me as I began my service in my current calling. In that blessing, he recited these words of the Savior: “And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:88</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p26" pid="orXkr7q09EiEZUPpci7drA" hash="wLDBxA">I have relied upon that promise many times, and I have seen it fulfilled in many ways throughout my 72 years of priesthood service. It happened when I was a new Aaronic Priesthood holder with an assignment to pass the sacrament. Terrified that I would make a mistake, I went outside the chapel before the meeting started and prayed in desperation that God would help me. An answer came. I felt that the Lord was with me. I felt His confidence in me, and so I felt confidence in my part in His work.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p27" pid="QGIK8RlQjEeAnZhuONevyw" hash="zw88Xg">It happened again while I was serving as a bishop. I received a phone call from a woman who had made a serious mistake and now faced a difficult, life-changing decision. As I visited with her, I felt I knew the answer to her problem, but I also felt strongly that <span class="emphasis">I</span> should not give her that answer—she needed to obtain it for herself. My words to her were “I believe God will tell you what to do if you would ask Him.” She later reported that she did ask Him and He did tell her.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p28" pid="D1IbPbl9_Uyx9pyFMoHTTA" hash="qhzH8g">On another occasion a phone call came when I was a bishop—this time from the police. I was told that a drunk driver had crashed his car through the glass into the lobby of a bank. When the bewildered driver saw the security guard with his weapon brandished, he cried, “Don’t shoot! I’m a Mormon!”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p29" pid="JRkg8Fm8XE-An3sdrtCTcA" hash="se1c8g">The inebriated driver was discovered to be a member of my ward, baptized only recently. As I waited to speak to him in the bishop’s office, I planned what I would say to make him feel remorseful for the way he had broken his covenants and embarrassed the Church. But as I sat looking at him, I heard a voice in my mind say, just as clearly as if someone were speaking to me, “I’m going to let you see him as I see him.” And then, for a brief moment, his whole appearance changed to me. I saw not a dazed young man but a bright, noble son of God. I suddenly felt the Lord’s love for him. That vision changed our conversation. It also changed me.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p30" pid="pZCI7B62p0iDkJRU_350Gg" hash="_DIOsQ">I learned important lessons from these experiences walking with the Lord in doing His work. I would like to share with you three of them. The first is that God notices and will support even the newest and youngest deacon. You need never feel that you are too small or too insignificant for Him to take notice of you and the service you are giving in His name.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p31" pid="DxCkbgROlky_gt8gx15b4Q" hash="lpd1Yg">The second lesson is that the Lord’s work is not just to solve problems; it is to build people. So as you walk with Him in priesthood service, you may find that sometimes what seems like the most efficient solution is not the Lord’s preferred solution because it does not allow people to grow. If you listen, He will teach you His ways. Remember that God’s work and glory is not simply to run an effective organization; it is “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>). This is, after all, why He gives His priesthood authority to flawed mortals like you and me and invites us to participate in His work. Our progress <span class="emphasis">is</span> His work!</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p32" pid="UcA2Pgj5EUazUVL35hx_Ew" hash="xccnJQ">Now the third lesson: Walking with the Savior in priesthood service will change the way you look at others. He will teach you to see them through His eyes, which means seeing past an outward appearance and into the heart (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). This is how the Savior was able to see Simon not as an impulsive fisherman but as Peter, the rock-solid future leader of His Church (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/5.1-11" class="scriptureRef">Luke 5:1–11</a>). This is how He was able to see Zacchaeus not as the corrupt tax collector others saw but as an honest, upright son of Abraham (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/19.1-9" class="scriptureRef">Luke 19:1–9</a>). If you walk with the Savior long enough, you will learn to see everyone as a child of God with limitless potential, regardless of what his or her past may have been. And if you continue walking with the Savior, you will develop another gift He has—the ability to help people see that potential in themselves and so repent.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p33" pid="fUq6T-fv3U6KWsWztFBFyg" hash="IiTRlA">My dear brethren of the priesthood, in many ways, we are like the two disciples who walked the road to Emmaus on that first Easter Sunday. It was Resurrection morning, but they were not yet sure there was a resurrection or what resurrection even meant. They had “trusted that [Jesus of Nazareth] should have redeemed Israel,” but they were “slow of heart to believe” everything the scriptures taught about resurrection. As they walked along and tried to reason it out together, “Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.13-32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:13–32</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p34" pid="nQBRWjBePESoDAHFCiUA4w" hash="G8yUpw">I testify that when we walk the path of priesthood service, the Savior Jesus Christ goes with us, for it is His path, His way. His light goes before us, and His angels are round about us. We may lack a full understanding of what the priesthood is or how to exercise it as He does. But if we pay close attention to those moments when our hearts “burn within us” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:32</a>), our eyes can be opened and we will see His hand in our lives and in our service. I testify that we come to know Him best by working with Him and serving Him in the great work of bringing salvation to God’s children. “For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:13</a>). Jesus Christ is our Master. This is His Church. It is His priesthood which we hold. May we each choose to walk with Him and to recognize how He walks with us.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me.p35" pid="i1YtinJ8pkagaRMgZicFxw" hash="6eNhMA">I give you my solemn witness that Jesus is the Christ, our resurrected Lord. I bear you my testimony that the priesthood He has trusted us with is the power to speak and to act in His name. We are children of a loving Heavenly Father who answers our prayers and sends the Holy Ghost to strengthen us in every priesthood responsibility we are blessed to receive. Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son. He received the keys of the priesthood, which have been passed on to President Thomas S. Monson, who exercises them today. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p10" pid="GMQ7Bd-z20OQg4e5-EM5xw" hash="7-yoJA">From those fundamentals, we recognize that the Lord’s leadership of His Church requires great and steady faith from all who serve Him on earth.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p11" pid="dhLcbHmB5k2LDQU8EFLqlQ" hash="bvkyjQ">For instance, it takes faith to believe that the resurrected Lord is watching over the daily details of His kingdom. It takes faith to believe that He calls imperfect people into positions of trust. It takes faith to believe that He knows the people He calls perfectly, both their capacities and their potential, and so makes no mistakes in His calls.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p12" pid="1VXKLdLcrEKYtgicJZM1Lw" hash="munQ9w">That may bring a smile or a shake of the head to some in this audience—both those who think their own call to serve might have been a mistake as well as those who picture some they know who seem poorly suited to their place in the Lord’s kingdom. My counsel to both groups is to delay such judgments until you can better see what the Lord sees. The judgment you need to make, instead, is that <span class="emphasis">you</span> have the capacity to receive revelation and to act on it fearlessly.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p13" pid="ZnAlNKPiq0Kk1nrk3Xbipw" hash="FCVKkw">It takes faith to do so. It takes even greater faith to believe that the Lord has called imperfect human servants to lead you. My purpose tonight is to build your faith that God directs you in your service to Him. And even more importantly, my hope is to build your faith that the Lord is inspiring the imperfect persons He has called as your leaders.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p14" pid="0R4iVVtxBEa9SSk5IAkWfg" hash="eLkEeA">You may think, at first, that such faith is not important to the success of the Lord’s Church and kingdom. However, you may discover—no matter where you are in the chain of priesthood service, from the Lord’s prophet to a new Aaronic Priesthood holder—that faith is essential.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p15" pid="tzNSHqoz2kSWMZ1Fn27FSA" hash="lgkAOg">Let’s start with what faith means for a teachers or a deacons quorum president. It is important for him to have faith that the Lord called him personally, knowing that teacher’s weaknesses and strengths. He has to have faith that the man who issued the call received revelation by the Spirit of God. His counselors and members of his quorum need the same faith to follow him with fearless confidence.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p16" pid="3CEsRIU0kEGdI0nvvITdAQ" hash="oMtMTA">I saw such confidence when a boy sat with his deacons quorum presidency one Sunday morning. He was their newly called secretary. That young presidency counseled together. They talked about several ways they could fulfill the bishop’s request to bring a less-active boy back to church. After prayer and discussion, they appointed the secretary to go to the home of a boy who had never come to a meeting and to invite him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p17" pid="GEW8IO8dU0OAoZjAVQCd8A" hash="t2jbuw">The secretary didn’t know the boy, but he knew that one of the boy’s parents was less active and the other was not a member and not friendly. The secretary felt anxiety but not fear. He knew that the prophet of God had asked priesthood holders to bring back the lost sheep. And he had heard the prayer of his presidency. He heard them come to agreement on the name of the boy to be rescued and on his own name.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p18" pid="j6WZlEMQiEq4bLIblSLPMQ" hash="IWEINg">I was watching when the secretary walked up the street toward the less-active boy’s house. He walked slowly as if he were going into great danger. But within a half hour he came back down the road with the boy, smiling happily. I’m not sure he knew it then, but he had gone with faith that he was on the Lord’s errand. That faith has stayed with him and has grown over his years as a missionary, a father, a leader of young men, and a bishop.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p19" pid="ZZ0kAd9YxU-dV_26NL_WKQ" hash="RIaiRQ">Let’s talk about what such faith means for a bishop. A bishop is sometimes called to serve people who know him well. Ward members know something of his human weaknesses and his spiritual strengths, and they know that others in the ward could have been called—others who seem better educated, more seasoned, more pleasant, or even better looking.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p20" pid="MFI26q1O0k-X3Mw_RGQ0ZQ" hash="A-QMrQ">These members have to know the call to serve as a bishop came from the Lord, by revelation. Without their faith, the bishop, who was called of God, will find it harder to get the revelation he needs to help them. He will not succeed without the faith of the members to sustain him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p21" pid="TSrWwUm6C0mnSduS9YCGdw" hash="h2GjnQ">Happily, the reverse is also true. Think of the Lord’s servant King Benjamin, who led his people to repentance. The people’s hearts were softened by their faith that he was called of God, despite his human weaknesses, and that his words came from God. You remember what the people said: “Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; … we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p22" pid="qFYGWrRDO0uGkDkQ_ICN8A" hash="fMejqQ">For a leader to succeed in the Lord’s work, the people’s trust that he is called of God must override their view of his infirmities and mortal weaknesses. You remember how King Benjamin explained his own leadership role:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p23" pid="Yd6y47fqgUSGa8qgtOvL0A" hash="4I5MYQ">“I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p24" pid="wWs4vzZQ40uMH7lOhFu5wA" hash="v19HKg">“But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.10-11" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:10–11</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p25" pid="m-YGisZY4EWKN92FkpHhPg" hash="BuosgA">Your leader in the Lord’s Church may seem to you weak and human or may appear to you strong and inspired. The fact is that every leader is a mixture of those traits and more. What helps servants of the Lord who are called to lead us is when we can see them as the Lord did when He called them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p26" pid="3S2d_nKk60a8IxRkGhlMfQ" hash="S1Whjw">The Lord sees His servants perfectly. He sees their potential and their future. And He knows how their very nature can be changed. He also knows how they can be changed by their experiences with the people they will lead.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p27" pid="qem-AygnoU2T2ZELGL2GgQ" hash="eqyT5g">You may have had the experience of being made stronger by the people you were called to serve. I was once called as a bishop of young single adults. I am not sure whether the Lord’s purposes were more for what changes I could help Him make in them or the changes He knew they would make in me.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p28" pid="4pojBmnDBE6E4LYp-9ouBQ" hash="7aF-OA">To a degree I do not understand, most of those young people in that ward acted as if I was called of God especially for them. They saw my weaknesses but looked past them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p29" pid="dg-6GbGbiUy9Hflnjam_Sw" hash="wtlOiw">I remember one young man who asked for counsel about his educational choices. He was a freshman at a very good university. A week after I had given the advice, he scheduled an appointment with me.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p30" pid="qcVL_rLNI0ux15LCecqBoQ" hash="bZojAQ">When he came into the office, he surprised me by asking, “Bishop, could we pray before we talk? And could we kneel? And may I pray?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p31" pid="5iMMWqXVx022zmCKrXG_kQ" hash="48ZbJg">His requests surprised me. But his prayer surprised me even more. It went something like this: “Heavenly Father, You know that Bishop Eyring gave me advice last week, and it didn’t work. Please inspire him to know what I am to do now.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p32" pid="kMenT7c6Pk-LpdesAWl_xg" hash="94ZYuA">Now you might smile at that, but I didn’t. He already knew what the Lord wanted him to do. But he honored the office of a bishop in the Lord’s Church and perhaps wanted me to have the chance to gain greater confidence to receive revelation in that calling.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p33" pid="jmcHIdjKC0WVIr7zI5x4WQ" hash="5j_MyA">It worked. As soon as we stood up and then sat down, the revelation came to me. I told him what I felt the Lord would have him do. He was only 18 years old then, but he was mature in spiritual years.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p34" pid="yt6-9_jhykOxLhCnVzZfMw" hash="jGe1Cw">He already knew he didn’t need to go to a bishop on such a problem. But he had learned to sustain the Lord’s servant even in his mortal weaknesses. He eventually became a stake president. He carried with him the lesson we learned together: if you have faith that the Lord leads His Church through revelation to those imperfect servants He calls, the Lord will open the windows of heaven to them, as He will to you.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p35" pid="a4FEfOG5IEWD3t_FSBO8Hw" hash="TrnDUA">From that experience, I carried away the lesson that the faith of the people we serve, sometimes more than our own faith, brings us revelation in the Lord’s service.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p36" pid="t67KjHC_ekiwOQQG55n3_w" hash="s-CMlA">There was another lesson for me. If that boy had judged me for my failure to give him good advice the first time, he never would have come back to ask again. And so, by choosing not to judge me, he received the confirmation he desired.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-lord-leads-his-church.p37" pid="mzSXQXREYEWO4QJ9pJFE1g" hash="8W14Og">Yet another lesson from that experience has served me well. As far as I know, he never told anyone in the ward that I had not given good counsel at first. Had he done that, it might have reduced the faith of others in the ward to trust the bishop’s inspiration.</p>

My heart is full of gratitude to the Lord, whose Church this is, for the inspiration we have felt in fervent prayers, inspired sermons, and angelic singing in this conference.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p6" pid="iRa5GHQn4kmxt56hyQpsxg" hash="HDQOVQ">Last April, President Thomas S. Monson gave a message that stirred hearts across the world, including mine. He spoke of the power of the Book of Mormon. He urged us to study, ponder, and apply its teachings. He promised that if we dedicated time each day to studying and pondering and kept the commandments the Book of Mormon contains, we would have a vital testimony of its truth, and the resultant testimony of the living Christ would see us through to safety in times of trouble. (See “<a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/04/the-power-of-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng">The Power of the Book of Mormon</a>,”<span class="emphasis"> Ensign</span> or<span class="emphasis"> Liahona,</span> May 2017, 86–87.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p7" pid="43lhOSj50Eq82lRa_hBI6Q" hash="U0uO_w">Like many of you, I heard the prophet’s words as the voice of the Lord to me. And, also like many of you, I decided to obey those words. Now, since I was a young boy, I have felt the witness that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, that the Father and the Son appeared and spoke with Joseph Smith, and that ancient Apostles came to the Prophet Joseph to restore priesthood keys to the Lord’s Church.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p8" pid="Nt3uP-x0bEqSc-NAYTkoNw" hash="hBuvFA">With that testimony, I have read the Book of Mormon every day for more than 50 years. So perhaps I could have reasonably thought that President Monson’s words were for someone else. Yet, like many of you, I felt the prophet’s encouragement and his promise invite me to make a greater effort. Many of you have done what I did: prayed with increased intent, pondered scripture more intently, and tried harder to serve the Lord and others for Him.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p9" pid="TVO0-bzYbUi9uJxzg2g5bw" hash="gajsjQ">The happy result for me, and for many of you, has been what the prophet promised. Those of us who took his inspired counsel to heart have heard the Spirit more distinctly. We have found a greater power to resist temptation and have felt greater faith in a resurrected Jesus Christ, in His gospel, and in His living Church.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p10" pid="Cc0Pqy8CaUKLdllldJ6HUQ" hash="DIK78A">In a season of increasing tumult in the world, those increases in testimony have driven out doubt and fear and have brought us feelings of peace. Heeding President Monson’s counsel has had two other wonderful effects on me: First, the Spirit he promised has produced a sense of optimism about what lies ahead, even as the commotion in the world seems to increase. And, second, the Lord has given me—and you—an even greater feeling of His love for those in distress. We have felt an increase in the desire to go to the rescue of others. That desire has been at the heart of President Monson’s ministry and teaching.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p11" pid="vf2jRFZAeESUpSStuETGdg" hash="CanM6Q">The Lord promised love for others and courage to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery when the tasks ahead of them could have seemed overwhelming. The Lord said that needed courage would come from their faith in Him as their rock:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p12" pid="wcCzwED52kO7HkfsIkcuXw" hash="ts8o1A">“Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p17" pid="PIVho830RUebh9fUW3r0-A" hash="zHgW5g">The Lord told His leaders of the Restoration, and He tells us, that when we stand with faith upon His rock, doubt and fear are diminished; the desire to do good increases. As we accept President Monson’s invitation to plant in our hearts a testimony of Jesus Christ, we gain the power, the desire, and the courage to go to the rescue of others without concern for our own needs.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p18" pid="YfCa_dU0ZUCIvbfgzvuw_Q" hash="K-8qjA">I have seen that faith and courage many times when believing Latter-day Saints have faced fearsome trials. For one example, I was in Idaho when the Teton Dam broke on June 5, 1976. A wall of water came down. Thousands fled from their homes. Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed. Miraculously, fewer than 15 people were killed.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p19" pid="I_D-8gWtIkW9UHNzXVFbOQ" hash="zfRuTg">What I saw there, I have seen whenever Latter-day Saints stand firmly on the rock of a testimony of Jesus Christ. Because they have no doubt He watches over them, they become fearless. They ignore their own trials to go to the relief of others. And they do so out of love for the Lord, asking no recompense.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p20" pid="AGOLlyZ4FUyTKEOZ3ltWEQ" hash="ZbKKJw">For example, when the Teton Dam broke, a Latter-day Saint couple was traveling, miles away from their home. As soon as they heard the news on the radio, they hurried back to Rexburg. Rather than going to their own home to see if it was destroyed, they went looking for their bishop. He was in a building that was being used as the recovery center. He was helping to direct the thousands of volunteers who were arriving in yellow school buses.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p21" pid="GYCaMrNEkEOdeVl846JbYg" hash="vhZkbg">The couple walked up to the bishop and said, “We just got back. Bishop, where can we go to help?” He gave them the names of a family. That couple stayed mucking out mud and water in one home after another. They worked from dawn to dark for days. They finally took a break to go see about their own home. It was gone in the flood, leaving nothing to clean up. So they turned around quickly to go back to their bishop. They asked, “Bishop, do you have someone for us to help?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p22" pid="Z8EFFJITlE2PuAsdC4Y7aw" hash="0cpkpQ">That miracle of quiet courage and charity—the pure love of Christ—has been repeated over the years and across the world. It happened in the terrible days of the persecutions and trials at the time of the Prophet Joseph Smith in Missouri. It happened as Brigham Young led the exodus from Nauvoo and then called Saints to desert places all over the western United States, to help each other create Zion for the Lord.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p23" pid="RYwzDwX6s0uPYOhVNIkabA" hash="24TCoQ">If you read the journal entries of those pioneers, you see the miracle of faith driving out doubt and fear. And you read of Saints leaving their own interests to help someone else for the Lord, before getting back to their own sheep or to their own unplowed fields.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p24" pid="J2L7BcnbmkiofljpaCfyvQ" hash="2gBPCA">I saw that same miracle a few short days ago in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Puerto Rico, Saint Thomas, and Florida, where Latter-day Saints partnered with other churches, local community groups, and national organizations to begin cleanup efforts.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p25" pid="BHeVX2jkJEyweH_cSwcIDg" hash="11eSuw">Like my friends in Rexburg, one nonmember couple in Florida focused on helping the community rather than laboring on their own property. When some Latter-day Saint neighbors offered help with the two large trees blocking their driveway, the couple explained that they had been overwhelmed and so had turned to helping others, having faith that the Lord would provide the aid they needed at their own home. The husband then shared that before our Church members arrived with offers of assistance, the couple had been praying. They had received an answer that help would come. It came within hours of that assurance.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p26" pid="44_jBEyqJUWH8gAt20ThIg" hash="SX2w5A">I have heard a report that some have started calling the Latter-day Saints who are wearing yellow Helping Hands T-shirts “The Yellow Angels.” One Latter-day Saint took her car in for service, and the man helping her described the “spiritual experience” he had when people in yellow shirts removed trees from his yard and then, he said, they “sang some song to me about being a child of God.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p27" pid="wcf6XUee5EOEsfzCLckFuw" hash="OSdt2Q">Another Florida resident—also not of our faith—related that Latter-day Saints came to her home when she was working in her devastated yard and feeling overwhelmed, overheated, and close to tears. The volunteers created, in her words, “a pure miracle.” They served not only with diligence but also with laughter and smiles, accepting nothing in return.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p28" pid="2TRueg4jOEaG3z1BgMq5_A" hash="zHoSyg">I saw that diligence and heard that laughter when, late on a Saturday, I visited with a group of Latter-day Saints in Florida. The volunteers stopped their cleanup labor long enough to let me shake some hands. They said that 90 members of their stake in Georgia had created a plan to join in the rescue in Florida just the night before.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p29" pid="ikFkD5Wuiku85m5sIg0GKQ" hash="71NDDw">They left Georgia at 4:00 in the morning, drove for hours, worked through the day and into the night, and planned to labor again the next day.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p30" pid="HTwuMtIJAkuG3HbQtbfH4g" hash="oosxfw">They described it to me all with smiles and good humor. The only stress I sensed was that they wanted to stop being thanked so they could get back to work. The stake president had restarted his chain saw and was working on a downed tree and a bishop was moving tree limbs as we got into our vehicle to go to the next rescue team.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p31" pid="n9wK7_kICUe9QDDgNejW4g" hash="VCexGw">Earlier that day, as we pulled away from another site, a man had walked up to the car, taken off his hat, and thanked us for the volunteers. He said, “I’m not a member of your church. I can’t believe what you have done for us. God bless you.” The LDS volunteer standing next to him in his yellow shirt smiled and shrugged his shoulders as if he deserved no praise.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p32" pid="_yOUVOZNn0CmFpJT9ceCLA" hash="7VrwgQ">While the volunteers from Georgia had come to help this man who couldn’t believe it, hundreds of Latter-day Saints from that very devastated part of Florida had gone hundreds of miles south to another place in Florida where they had heard the people were harder hit.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p33" pid="JM-QeF9U1EGFwsnMxPWVow" hash="EgK0RA">That day I remembered and understood better the prophetic words of the Prophet Joseph Smith: “A man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race” (<span class="emphasis"><a href="http://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-37?lang=eng">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</a></span> [2007], 426).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p34" pid="gePeUj2UdUy_5JPcfTWpuA" hash="LKwimQ">We see such love in the lives of Latter-day Saints everywhere. Each time there is a tragic event anywhere in the world, Latter-day Saints donate and volunteer to the Church’s humanitarian efforts. An appeal is seldom needed. In fact, on some occasions, we have had to ask would-be volunteers to wait to travel to the recovery site until those directing the work are prepared to receive them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p35" pid="dqGnXF2_A0GRx1obKFsS8A" hash="vbjrEg">That desire to bless is the fruit of people gaining a testimony of Jesus Christ, His gospel, His restored Church, and His prophet. That is why the Lord’s people doubt not and fear not. That is why missionaries volunteer for service in every corner of the world. That is why parents pray with their children for others. That is why leaders challenge their youth to take President Monson’s request to immerse themselves in the Book of Mormon to heart. The fruit comes not by being urged by leaders but by the youth and members acting on faith. That faith, put into action, which requires selfless sacrifice, brings the change of heart that allows them to feel the love of God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p36" pid="GQ6pjXY8w0mNhp5uJktPng" hash="pER9ug">Our hearts, however, remain changed only as long as we continue to follow the prophet’s counsel. If we stop trying after one burst of effort, the change will fade.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p37" pid="7CkH8eIG6kC5SmZ4oXM8ug" hash="2nn3Aw">Faithful Latter-day Saints have increased their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Book of Mormon as the word of God, and in the restoration of priesthood keys in His true Church. That increased testimony has given us greater courage and concern for others of God’s children. But the challenges and the opportunities ahead will require even more.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p38" pid="8xPkq0mbrUOvPM-kJKKy4A" hash="F-HhGQ">We cannot foresee the details, but we know the larger picture. We know that in the last days, the world will be in commotion. We know that in the midst of whatever trouble comes, the Lord will lead faithful Latter-day Saints to take the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. And we know that the Lord’s true disciples will be worthy and prepared to receive Him when He comes again. We need not fear.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p39" pid="s69B8G_W9EiQPnBXjfzBLg" hash="4MW_rw">So, as much as we have already built faith and courage in our hearts, the Lord expects more from us—and from the generations after us. They will need to be stronger and braver because they will do even greater and harder things than we have done. And they will face increasing opposition from the enemy of our souls.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p40" pid="yyD2m3ezakWCNalKWdUVJQ" hash="bTQ0lw">The way to optimism as we go forward was given by the Lord: “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:36</a>). President Monson told us how to do that. We are to ponder and apply the Book of Mormon and the words of prophets. Pray always. Be believing. Serve the Lord with all our heart, might, mind, and strength. We are to pray with all the energy of our hearts for the gift of charity, the pure love of Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47-48" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 7:47–48</a>). And above all, we are to be consistent and persistent in following prophetic counsel.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p41" pid="SYM3kTUvSkirOc31LB4EzQ" hash="ZC5l7w">When the way is difficult, we can rely on the Lord’s promise—the promise President Monson has reminded us of when he has often quoted these words of the Savior: “Whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:88</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p42" pid="DgHb57hgk02LDCbkkDWaPA" hash="cTjNiw">I testify that the Lord goes before your face whenever you are on His errand. Sometimes you will be the angel the Lord sends to bear others up. Sometimes you will be the one surrounded by angels who bear you up. But always you will have His Spirit to be in your heart, as you have been promised in every sacrament service. You have only to keep His commandments.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p43" pid="ZXq9DvP5n0S6_kfCn-fEGQ" hash="0FnecA">The best days are ahead for the kingdom of God on the earth. Opposition will strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ, as it has since the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Faith always defeats fear. Standing together produces unity. And your prayers for those in need are heard and answered by a loving God. He neither slumbers nor does He sleep.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p44" pid="u2Ruz5GPHUuHD5o8O-yAiQ" hash="WuJTqw">I bear my witness that God the Father lives and wants you to come home to Him. This is the true Church of the Lord Jesus Christ. He knows you; He loves you; He watches over you. He atoned for your sins and mine and the sins of all of Heavenly Father’s children. Following Him in your life and in your service to others is the only way to eternal life.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/fear-not-to-do-good.p45" pid="GLAyPJ8CaEKKeGorpaYHJA" hash="bg3JRA">I so testify and leave you my blessing and my love. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
