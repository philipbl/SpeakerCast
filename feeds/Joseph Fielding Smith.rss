We welcome you to the sessions of the 141st Annual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/out-of-the-darkness.p4" guid="fbaf4178-265c-441a-a5f4-7235f25dd15f" pid="CSd5PcOSRkWaoY56iDuhkw" hash="6DXNYw">I sincerely hope that all who attend and all those whose lives are touched in any way by the proceedings of this conference will put themselves in tune with the Spirit so they will be built up in faith and in testimony and in the desire to keep the commandments and do those things which please the Lord.</p>

No person in or out of the Church should believe any doctrine, advocate any practice, or support any cause that is not in harmony with the divine will. Our sole objective where the truths of salvation are concerned should be to find out what the Lord has revealed and then to believe and act accordingly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/out-of-the-darkness.p6" guid="d578f0a6-78d7-4000-b808-5f74d4533644" pid="Kr7uCbWHEUKBrLNOYlx9Ww" hash="FZsb2Q">Since the Lord has revealed his everlasting gospel anew to us in this day and has made The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the custodian and dispenser of its saving truths, I desire now to restate for the Church and for the world a few of those eternal principles which must be accepted by mankind if they will save themselves. Our knowledge of these simple and yet profound doctrines has come to us by revelation in this dispensation.</p>

We testify that he, through his Only Begotten Son, is the Creator of this earth and of worlds without number, all of which are peopled by his spirit children.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/out-of-the-darkness.p13" guid="09db601b-3b14-4aff-bf8b-3b420b76ea0b" pid="GTPx1cu-eECyuOiqryO3dw" hash="2GHqZQ">We proclaim that to gain salvation men must believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, repent of their sins, be baptized by immersion by one who has authority, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and then press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, keeping the commandments and enduring to the end.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/out-of-the-darkness.p15" guid="3f15d4d5-9fe8-4634-8876-4b1c88a32400" pid="Z-tjgVuVFk22edqXxQdm2A" hash="Lj7hmQ">And further—and this is exceedingly important where all men now living are concerned—we believe that following a long night of darkness, unbelief, and departure from the truths of pure and perfect Christianity, the Lord in his infinite wisdom has again restored to earth the fullness of the everlasting gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/out-of-the-darkness.p16" guid="3e97e11c-dc8a-4084-b067-4f8f9fd071dc" pid="3KYSsNtIw0qSbgQDlT5RZw" hash="qprxTw">We know Joseph Smith is a prophet; that the Father and the Son appeared to him in the spring of 1820 to usher in this final gospel dispensation; that he translated the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God; that he received keys and authority from angels sent for this very purpose; and that the Lord revealed to him the doctrines of salvation.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/out-of-the-darkness.p20" guid="a739359e-48f5-4048-8b41-9226a5dded42" pid="odasGwR4hE6_dd_iY8enJw" hash="zI4yWQ">Peter said: “… God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted” by him (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.34-35" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:34–35</a>), which means that the Lord will pour out his Spirit upon the faithful so they will know of themselves of the truths of this religion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/out-of-the-darkness.p21" guid="194cc2c4-96d4-4cc8-88fb-ab3bb685e302" pid="qcX6m9129USatVXTFKi0vQ" hash="AAMuWQ">Now, as one among you who has come to know, by the power of the Holy Ghost, that the Lord has restored his gospel and set up his kingdom again on the earth for the last time, I bear my testimony to the truth of these things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/out-of-the-darkness.p22" guid="3356cdc0-6845-4be0-a022-4954f47b3b0d" pid="jPs83H8pQUWV02ZNSmlvXQ" hash="PMTpuA">I know that God lives; I know that Jesus Christ is the Only Begotten of the Father; and I know that Joseph Smith and his successors have been the instruments in the Lord’s hands of making the blessings of heaven available to men on earth in this present day.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/our-responsibilities-as-priesthood-holders.p3" guid="65b1d011-6847-4de9-82a0-e0a471c16b1d" pid="uQsoa_9-sUCpEuoKejArsA" hash="6ky8SA">We are the Lord’s agents; we represent him; he has given us authority which empowers us to do all that is necessary to save and exalt ourselves as well as his other children in the world.</p>

Our commission is to represent him. We are directed to preach his gospel, to perform the ordinances of salvation, to bless mankind, to heal the sick and perhaps perform miracles, to do what he would do if he were personally present—and all this because we hold the holy priesthood.</p>

Of ourselves we have no message of salvation, no doctrine that must be accepted, no power to baptize or ordain or marry for eternity. All these things come from the Lord, and anything we do with reference to them is the result of delegated authority.</p>

We are no longer to dress or speak or act or even think as others too often do. Many in the world use tea, coffee, tobacco, and liquor, and are involved in the use of drugs. Many profane and are vulgar and indecent, immoral and unclean in their lives, but all these things should be foreign to us. We are the saints of the Most High. We hold the holy priesthood.</p>

If we will walk in paths of virtue and holiness, the Lord will pour out his blessings upon us to a degree we have never supposed possible. We shall be in very deed, as Peter expressed it, “a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 2:9</a>.) And we will be peculiar because we will not be like other people who do not live up to these standards.</p>

We must shun unchastity and every form of immorality as we would a plague. We must not dam up the wellsprings of life by preventing childbirth. We must not be guilty of unrighteous and evil acts of abortion.</p>

We cannot be in rebellion against the law and be in harmony with the Lord, for he has commanded us to “be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right it is to reign. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:22</a>.) And one of these days he is going to come.</p>

We have received light and truth and revelation from him. He has commanded us to proclaim his truths and live his laws.

Our hope for peace, for temporal and spiritual prosperity, and for an eventual inheritance in the kingdom of God is found only in and through the restored gospel.

Walk in the light. Endure to the end. Be true to every covenant and obligation, and the Lord will bless you beyond your fondest dreams.

There is nothing that will ever come into your family life that is as important as the sealing blessings of the temple and then keeping the covenants made in connection with this order of celestial marriage.</p>

God has laid upon men and women very sacred obligations with respect to motherhood, and they are obligations that cannot be disregarded without invoking divine displeasure.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine </span>[Deseret Book, 1939], p. 288.) Also, “To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman.” (Ibid., p. 285.)</p>

Remember the words of Alma: “Wickedness never was happiness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>.) Remember also that our hope for the future and the destiny of the Church and the cause of righteousness rest in your hands.</p>

Each of them has been assigned important responsibilities in connection with his new calling. And as you also know, the Lord has called Victor L.
