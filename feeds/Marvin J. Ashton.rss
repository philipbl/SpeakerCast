      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p1" guid="64980c5d-24d6-4c72-a3fd-3e1f23ce95d1" pid="oPeOfxbvCUCbqI05R5jndA" hash="lZM2ZQ">The past few days my thoughts have turned repeatedly to that great message of strength, “… for I, the Lord, love him [Hyrum Smith] because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:15</a>.) What a blessing it is to be one who loves that which is right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p2" guid="7a91745d-1101-4d23-95a3-425aa619e23d" pid="2WJP3VfjXkqmjGxiGY3WgQ" hash="ubx0Tg">There seems to be a tendency among many of us in our society today to live by compromise, rationalization, comparison, and self-justification. Love of right has been replaced by love of acceptance and convenience. Some mistakenly think the pathway of safety is somewhere between the path of righteousness and the road to destruction. Others seem to have convinced themselves that the way to perfection is reached by traveling the highway of compromise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p3" guid="f864527d-18b9-4cb4-bc8b-85d532c81b8d" pid="SUgWMH1r9kmm-Y1zLVhVrw" hash="-baUCA">The other day a mother referred to the conduct of her college-age son with a mild tone of satisfaction when she said, “He may not do any studying, but at least he isn’t participating in campus riots.” An inmate of a prison, being confined because of a burglary sentence, seemed to have a ring of status in his voice when he pointed to another prisoner and said, “At least I’m not as bad as that guy. He’s in here for second degree murder.” A shoplifter seemed to feel she was only mildly dishonest because she was caught taking a hat while others have been convicted of stealing dresses. What kind of thinking is exhibited when someone is heard to say, “I may burn up a couple of packages of cigarettes a day, but I’m not on drugs”?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p4" guid="c7c0fe0c-a486-4804-bd28-769938a17f76" pid="aCuYK7xgSEeixB3YfwIRLg" hash="e68fbA">The pressures of the world upon the young and old alike to conform and experiment are real and mounting. Many of us are startled today when we are made aware of the fact that there are drug users even among the twelve- to thirteen-year-old group. What should be more shocking are the tactics being used to talk our youth into trying drugs. I have learned from youth who are entangled in this vicious pastime that approaches such as the following are being widely used: “Drugs are a fun escape from the lousy world in which you must live,” “Drugs are a friend to the lonely,” “Drugs will give you that mature and self-sufficient image so much desired,” “Drugs are a people substitute.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p5" guid="bc1d229b-5011-4eea-b49f-a8081010d74d" pid="RE0d79zM502i3DetDWCJ-Q" hash="hKczKQ">I wish to declare, with all the forcefulness I possess, that these damaging approaches are of the evil one. Young people are being led to believe that the “trips” drugs take them on are the safe, “in” way to travel between pious righteousness and destruction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p6" guid="24693eac-f23a-4335-9741-d1f6b74aec06" pid="VwTOTh_YQ0qYrJ6PScSsPQ" hash="oTuPLw">Drugs are causing many of our young people to drop out before they start. Drugs rob an individual of his sense of values. Drug-tampering youth are playing copycat in a subculture element.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p7" guid="3e30c9d8-37db-41ff-abe8-9f4919f7578a" pid="ksAgA39YJ0ii6aYBeKH6dA" hash="Q7G-nQ">May I recommend, as we look at drug abuse or other social problems, that we focus on the cause rather than the symptoms.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p8" guid="310569b4-473f-4810-a46f-48c979e0df49" pid="uNDm2y1RF0-2mPcnpThTWg" hash="kZfM1A">When a youth asks the question of himself or a friend, “Why shouldn’t I take drugs?” he is very possibly asking the wrong question. What he may really want to know and need to know is “Why should I want to take <span class="emphasis">any </span>kind of a stimulant or depressant at all? What is there in my life that I am unhappy enough about to want to escape into a diabolic world of illusion?” If we as parents and friends advise our youth that drugs are bad, evil, and immoral, and yet we do not try to understand why our youth turn to this evil substitute for reality, then the drugs themselves become the issue and not the symptom of the greater issue of unhappiness. We need to know why our loved ones want to run from their present life to the unknown yet dangerous life of addiction. What causes a strong, lovely, vibrant young person to allow a chemical to control his or her behavior? What is there at home, school, work, or church that is so uncomfortable that an escape seems necessary?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p9" guid="fdfa1917-95d2-4565-977f-077b5b902523" pid="ekakVVVhB0arBpKI8kJiyA" hash="X-h8MQ">If we were not faced with the evils of marijuana, LSD, speed, and heroin, we would be faced with some other type of escape mechanism, because some of us as brothers, sisters, parents, friends, and teachers have not yet been able to reach our youth in such a way as to give them the confidence and love they seek. Some of us are not providing the stability in the home, the respect, and the care that every person needs. They need more than Church upbringing—they need a loving home life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p10" guid="dcb42006-1c8d-4cdb-8943-b1ce6e318ad1" pid="HesE7Xic3kKAwwQ_Uapi6g" hash="f9sbKw">Where better can we teach our young people a love for the right than in a happy home situation? Our young people will not want a “people substitute” if we provide a home atmosphere with loving personal relationships, where a mother, father, sisters, and brothers really care.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p11" guid="faab8279-ae91-4e8a-8176-da3fdc884abb" pid="MycvaNHg-EKjWngbxDlK7w" hash="5w1RQQ">Parents, let’s make certain our youth are not continually exposed to the idea that the stresses of daily life require chemical relief. Factual information about drugs should be constantly stressed rather than attempts to frighten or shame. We must try to rear our children so that they are neither deprived of affection nor spoiled. We must give our children responsibilities according to their capabilities and never overprotect them from the difficulties they will encounter. As sure as some adults—mothers and fathers—continue to sow the wind, they will reap the tornado. Let us more firmly entrench ourselves in the true purposes of family life and sow oneness and reap joy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p12" guid="e3c0e334-86f5-4fa4-a758-4ea0f5eabd2c" pid="eOEzv33HHkSz3_M4BsjX7g" hash="iVS9lg">When temptations and challenges come there will be painful, trying times not only for our youth but also for their parents. Yet then, more than ever, it is imperative that there be love, understanding, and acceptance in the home so our youth can learn that only steadfast pursuit of God’s ways will bring a rich, happy life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p13" guid="5f8d05d5-0292-48d2-8641-e8435acda1c6" pid="-GqnKBc-WUW91tQIGoQNmQ" hash="MmAG9g">It is time for us to reaffirm the great truth that God’s paths are straight. They not only provide safety, but they also lead to happiness and eternal progression.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p14" guid="764aed6e-47a6-41a7-be2b-01a434ac5ba7" pid="3ZUO4y4fSEy_VrpEGHCC1g" hash="cqg5dg">Speaking of staying on the straight paths, I will never forget an experience I had with a friend in central Utah a few years ago. He had for his hobby mountain lion hunting. With other associates, dependable horses, guns, and well-trained dogs, he would seek to track the lions down, or tree them for capture. One day when I visited his place of business, he had a full-grown hunting dog tied to one of his sheds. “Isn’t he a beauty!” I commented. He responded with “He’s got to go. I can’t be bothered with him.” “What’s the problem?” I continued.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p15" guid="4fb8cce2-18ca-47c2-8a49-a86b7095dd73" pid="OnM5y1eMq06SoYlfSV3HVQ" hash="ueTDow">“Since he was a pup, I have trained him to track lions. He knows what I expect. The last time we were out on a three-day hunt, he took off after a deer, then a coyote, and finally some rabbits, and was gone the best part of a full day. He knows he must stay on the trail of the lion to be one of mine. Our business is mountain lions. Yep, he’s for sale pretty cheap.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p16" guid="98d58396-200f-4c53-9eb4-e06efeda0632" pid="5uwmAu6CrUKfeMVSGBvXQQ" hash="ZiykTQ">How often are we led from the right track by distractions like drugs that cross our paths? Do we sometimes seek the available “rabbit” when the big game is available up the path?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p17" guid="1401a107-ca65-451e-be8f-03734bf22f79" pid="oND4T5yKRUSaIqRuzQzLmw" hash="7I9s4w">The drug problem is severe today, and the Church is deeply concerned. Families, parents, and Church officers should do all possible to prevent or treat these evils. The rise of drug use is almost a subsociety within the larger worldwide society. People, young and old, who are part of the drug scene tend to adopt unusual dress, hair styles, and other mannerisms which set them apart. But unless they become offensive or unacceptable by reason of extreme behavior, we do only harm by rejecting them from our meetings and general fellowship. It is hoped that we will avoid the pitfall of giving excessive publicity to wrongdoers at the expense of the majority who live virtuous lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p18" guid="98c24a49-619d-44a3-8a81-36c18b3ca45e" pid="jlKD7RNphEGM-VzWe3FHwg" hash="fTs7Cw">At the same time, we must not react with panic to what is a symptom of greater illness. In fact, there are indications that we have saturated the youth in and out of the Church with information on drugs. We have unintentionally taught them how and where to obtain drugs by our massive campaigns.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p19" guid="ea0bd932-34cb-4a4e-bfd3-9ab7fe77397f" pid="ae3XrM-Kn0ah2cKfLDTD9Q" hash="0StY3A">The Church recognizes and supports the efforts of reputable people and organizations who are attempting to combat and treat drug problems. Bishops and other priesthood leaders should help drug users find resources of cure and rehabilitation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p20" guid="1906da7a-042a-4657-b751-c3058def0a67" pid="ue5taDylnkWhIDAaw5YZcg" hash="-lqaHg">When people are curious and tampering with drugs, we should help to strengthen their homes and personal lives through warm, loving reeducation around basic gospel principles. Our youth are looking for purposeful leadership. We need to lead the lost back from where they are. We must teach the others to continue to choose the right and stay on His paths.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p21" guid="98e636f8-3817-4892-94c9-0e4f64b6cea2" pid="8uA95javZUCmgAo2XiPL3A" hash="xQTKmw">May I reiterate that while drugs are a most serious problem, and while the Church is a flexible instrument in the Lord’s hands, we must not be diverted from our eternal and most effective course by problems that, though serious, are only symptoms of greater ills.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p22" guid="ac43feb3-ef4f-4e61-b3cb-9a413cac5f77" pid="2Wp92K-_SEW1Fmqy6njviw" hash="mqYd5w">Lofty standards of behavior will always be based upon a love for the right. Wickedness in any form will never lead to happiness. We must be aware of those who would have us believe there is no heaven, there is no hell, and that the only road to happiness is marked with compromise and convenience. Satan is real and he is effective. Drug abuse is one of his tools. He would throw men down, and by his cunning he would have all mankind strangers to God. Let us not be deceived. God lives, and through him and with him we can accomplish all things. We must not permit ourselves to become entangled in the sin of drugs or the sin of compromising our standards, but rather we must learn to avoid all the ways of Satan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p23" guid="ae24da1a-c009-4318-9e5c-2d0ff73b9c6e" pid="1S3433JXZECmYs8uqjHuFg" hash="36F-oA">Our Heavenly Father is so concerned that we do right that he will bless each of us with a sign, if we will ask his counsel. Do we realize that the Lord has promised us a physical manifestation if we but ask him to direct us in the right? In the ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 8, we have this commitment from the Lord:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p24" guid="50f39cb3-df81-4e90-a062-941629e77491" pid="AlQrJ6BJfk6tEYr8NajQmg" hash="oFCrQw">“But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p25" guid="616bbbe1-02e8-4c14-94df-1aadb9bf91bb" pid="WfaQOW30X0GMbMXknoNz9g" hash="FDHqpQ">Brothers and sisters, we compromise our blessings, we rationalize ourselves out of the sure and safe way, when we do not ask our God to guide us in the decisions that are part of our daily lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p26" guid="4883b2b2-891f-47e1-8e8e-ed774ba0de1d" pid="ZHmd_--5SkaWqss68rJ_WQ" hash="NvRwHg">The Lord has promised that he will help us in our pursuit of happiness if we will trust in him and follow his path. The abundant life will be ours if we rely on his strength. If we will magnify the priesthood we hold and share our talents every day, Satan will have no power over us, and our Heavenly Father’s strength will make all righteous things possible. Ammon, in his comments to his brother Aaron in the twenty-sixth chapter of Alma, verse 12, points to a way of life that brings security: “Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; … for which we will praise his name forever.” All we need to do to enjoy eternal, happy lives is to live the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p27" guid="60b42185-4a1b-46a0-88ce-0b29161596bb" pid="JssLGEvdf0KExdPQZRfg0w" hash="ozHfvA">Following one of our recent general conference sessions, a troubled mother approached me and said, “I need to know what is meant by the statement, ‘No success can compensate for failure in the home.’” Knowing a little of the burdens this friend of mine carries in her mind and heart because of a rebellious, wayward daughter, I shared this meaning with her: I believe we start to fail in the home when we give up on each other. We have not failed until we have quit trying. As long as we are working diligently with love, patience, and long-suffering, despite the odds or the apparent lack of progress, we are not classified as failures in the home. We only start to fail when we give up on a son, daughter, mother, or father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p28" guid="f452aebf-73e0-4dd5-8281-d9da7ee41513" pid="uF4WALjB3UeRtY2gt9Vvaw" hash="rh8T_g">A few days ago, I had the pleasurable assignment of visiting some of our Lamanite friends in Supai, at the base of the Grand Canyon, in Arizona. While on the canyon trails, I had the opportunity of visiting with some hippie-type young people who had traveled to that secluded area in their search for escape. Drugs and a basic desire to get away from everyone and everything, according to their own admissions, prodded them on to this area and yet other areas when this one becomes routine. “No one cares about us, and frankly, we don’t care about the establishment” is the message they left with me; however, I assure you these were not the exact words they used. As I told one young man, and I share this same thought with our other young friends who are at present involved in the drug habit, “As surely as you can walk out of this Grand Canyon in three to four hours with all of your worldly possessions strapped to your back, you can walk out on this drug habit. There are a lot of us who care about you and would like to help you back up the trail to the main highway.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p29" guid="991374d9-12be-4df0-b10d-84825b182317" pid="pGSvrIt6JEaeQVVWyV4-MA" hash="YCEiHg">To our young friends and bewildered parents caught in the vicious grip of drug abuse and its heartaches, we declare to you that there is a way back. You can make it. There is hope.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p30" guid="0dde72fc-dce6-4f8a-b04c-31f912a70d54" pid="y4MyHDgEc0Gq2B24KgU1lA" hash="d_GkxQ">I bear witness to you this day that a love for that which is right will bring us our Heavenly Father’s strength and protection. In his paths we will find security. My prayer is that we will have the desire in our hearts to earnestly seek the pathways of safety from evils such as drugs by honestly keeping all of his commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/love-of-the-right.p31" guid="88a60fba-113b-407a-98ff-a57714c7f78f" pid="9u13Oe24AEONkf0VOsR_bA" hash="pEwhGw">As we unitedly work to help our youth in combatting and avoiding all of the temptations of the day, may we be reminded, “… let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.19-20" class="scriptureRef">James 1:19–20</a>.) I pray for our Heavenly Father to help us teach and love that which is right, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

In desperation he stopped a man on the sidewalk and said, “How do I get to such-and-such a destination from here?” After considerable thought, with the skyscrapers, dense traffic, confusing streets, winding rivers, freeways, bridges, tunnels, and so on in mind, the man said, “You can’t get there from here.”</p>

Some are lost, bewildered, confused, scared, sick, insecure, and discouraged. What a tragedy to be in these straits and to be told, in answer to the questions “How can I get back to where I was?” or “How can I get to where I want to go?”—“You can’t get there from where you are.”</p>

That is, it is easy for me to get in, but difficult for me to get out. The difficulty comes when I am stopped by prisoners who want to talk. During my last visit, a young man stopped me, and we talked for about fifteen minutes, time I didn’t think I had to spare. As I was leaving him he said, and I will never forget it, “Thank you for talking to me.” As I drove home that night, I recalled that in fifteen minutes I may have said twenty-four or twenty-five words; however, I believe that is the kind of talking and listening we need to have more of. But that is another subject. Let’s get back to Roger. He said:</p>

I am involved in the family home evening program at the prison. Without the parents who have been assigned to me through this social services program, many times I would have given up. These people love me as if I were their own son. I have never had that, even when I was a small boy. Now, with their help and that of others, I believe I can now make it back a day at a time. I am not proud of being in prison, but I am proud of my recent experiences while being there. We have a tendency to blame others. We don’t want to blame our parents for not loving us, because we know they do, but maybe they didn’t have the guidance and direction in their lives to apply when they were bringing us up.”</p>

As I was waiting to participate with them and others in the services, they seemed to be involved in serious conversation. “What could they be talking about?” I wondered to myself. My curiosity prompted me to step closer to them for a chance to catch a few of their words. I was moved when I heard one of the girls raise this question to her friends: “I wonder if someone will come today who will want to take me home. It would be fun to live with someone who wants me.”</p>

I’m only three semesters away from getting my teaching certificate.” This girl is making it back. Someone believes in her. Someone has convinced her she can get there from here.

Apparently he has been announcing this to his passengers for years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/what-is-your-destination.p6" guid="f518ec7e-2803-413d-b897-99ebd99aa132" pid="Nx8Zxa1av0exfVWN_c_g2A" hash="_tL_-Q">However, I knew, despite his comments, that I needed to be in Leicester for two days for quarterly stake conference sessions but that it was not my destination. Stops in other English cities were not my destinations either. They were all assignments along the way. I had not arrived when I reached any of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/what-is-your-destination.p7" guid="9a54232b-f338-4946-acf9-e03b9e3fb971" pid="hlfI9Q5aT0WRSJIPTgpYHQ" hash="GadqZQ">As a result of this experience on the train, and having given this thought some consideration over the years, I am concerned that many of us are confused in our life’s travels with destinations, arrivals, stops, calls, stations, and assignments. It appears to me that some of us may be lost today because we think we have arrived.</p>

Is temple marriage your destination? Over the years, I have heard hundreds of my young associates say, “I want to make the temple. A temple marriage is my goal.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/what-is-your-destination.p10" guid="70df4155-bfd6-4c15-9bba-5d5cdfd05122" pid="1f0xALWbUkS2LVsRlmI97g" hash="vWmGBQ">To qualify one’s self to go to the temple is a lofty ambition, a worthy achievement. We need to remind ourselves of its eternal purposes. However, we have not arrived when we share the blessings of the temple. Oftentimes there are real dangers in our lives when we allow lofty ideals and goals, such as temple marriage, to become an end instead of a means. All of our priorities must be properly placed within the framework of eternity if we are to avoid the stagnations of arriving.</p>

Halle who said, “To snatch the passing moment and examine it for signs of eternity is the noblest of occupations.” To gain exaltation after celestial marriage, continued devotion and righteousness are required. It is a continuing process, not a state of arrival.</p>

Have you reached your destination when you have completed an honorable mission? May we emphatically state that a worthily completed mission is a signal accomplishment along life’s journey. It should be fortification for greater personal service and strength. It should more firmly entrench the feet of the missionary in the paths that continue onward and upward to eternal happiness. It should prepare him for the enjoyment of pure religion.</p>

He had been assigned to labor in a district as a senior companion after having been an assistant to the mission president. In his own words, “I reached my goal when I held that high position of assistant to the president.” He had lost his effectiveness temporarily because he had allowed himself to think he had arrived.</p>

To our fellow missionaries, past and present, we humbly pray that you will never allow yourselves the dangerous luxury of self-declaring, “I have given my two years to the Church.” If a returned missionary will set his sights high for life, he will generally take the proper steps to get there. A mission can be the happiest two years in a missionary’s life if he not only serves his God and fellowmen selflessly but if he is also walking in truth and preparing himself for eternal progress, which I declare is underway today.</p>

We are sorry to observe that some, having received a testimony, feel and respond as if they had arrived. What a sad day in the life of any individual when he fails to use this knowledge and conviction of a testimony for dedicated and continued service. A testimony grows as it is shared. With the possession of a testimony comes the obligation to bear witness to the world of this, the Lord’s work. A testimony is not a destination; it is a possession for performance.</p>

In these days of needed performance and service it is hoped all of us will emphatically respond to this question with a resounding <small>NO</small>!</p>

He is cunning. He is successful. One of the most subtle and effective tools he is using among us today is the convincing of some that they have arrived, they have reached their destination, they have earned a rest, they aren’t needed anymore, they are out of danger, they are beyond temptation, and they can take pride in their accomplishments.</p>

You have not reached your destination. Your great test lies ahead of you. Strive to live worthy of the great trust placed in you.’”</p>

I was visiting in the mission field when Elder Dennis Dean reached the Arizona Mission. His arrival in one of our first meetings created an electrifying influence on all present when he guided himself in his wheelchair down the aisle of the chapel. An expression of humble confidence covered his face.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/what-is-your-destination.p26" guid="4176bfa1-531a-42b1-bbdd-8f3db87fa587" pid="giqP_LT5OkyzsBVdYiSAig" hash="Sx3ihQ">His associates soon learned why he had been found worthy and able to serve a full-time mission. I recall his testimony that day when he let us all know that this was part of his life’s hopes and ambitions. He said, “I will do my best to make myself worthy of your trust and confidence. Don’t feel sorry for me. Just help me to do what I know I can do with the Lord’s help.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/what-is-your-destination.p27" guid="11f0c663-31dc-40f8-961a-47e7b5032d36" pid="rh-c9-yHI0mbUEgCL6-DWg" hash="Utuiqg">His message carried. Later on in the day, his newly assigned companion warmly approached me and asked, “What do you do to be a good companion to a wheelchair-restricted elder?” My response after having spent part of the day with Elder Dean was, “You will do well to keep up with him. The real test in the weeks ahead is for you—not him.”</p>

Today Dennis enthusiastically carries on his studies and learning at Brigham Young University. He presently serves in the BYU 38th Ward as a home teacher and a Sunday School teacher. He has recently been to my office, where we had a good visit, and I was again impressed with this unusual example of a good man on the move.</p>

Some of my friends are unusual. They come from unusual places. Last Tuesday evening, as I was clearing my desk prior to leaving for home, the telephone rang: “Brother Ashton, I have permission from the prison authorities to come and visit with you. Will you wait until I get there?”</p>

In response to the questions, “Now that you are going to be released from the prison in one week, what are your plans? What are you going to do? What are your goals?” he answered, “I have an apartment. I have a full-time job. I have a wonderful sweetheart. I am going to continue my education. I have a church assignment. I have a lot of things I need to do. I am thirty-two years old and I am only a teacher in the priesthood. I want to be an elder before too long.”</p>

I spoke to him during a visit some months ago. As I think back, I selected him to talk to because no one else was speaking to him.</p>

All he wants is out, and I am afraid from his attitude he doesn’t care how he accomplishes it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/what-is-your-destination.p34" guid="d019f483-1eae-4e8d-8add-0c607763d62a" pid="ypA30W943kaFS0ECF13WQg" hash="dQ-JHQ">I humbly bear witness to you today that an honorably completed mission, a celestial marriage, a valued testimony, a position of major responsibility in the Church are not destinations in the lives of true Latter-day Saints. They can be important aids in eternal progression. They will not save you and me in the kingdom of God. Only living the life of a faithful Latter-day Saint will make that possible.</p>

Wise is the individual who follows in his, the Savior’s, paths. Safety and joy belong to those who will come and follow him. I bear witness to you today that God is eternal. We are eternal, and God never intended for us to travel alone.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/what-is-a-friend.p3" guid="a4e73f1d-67ad-4000-ad09-3284a6ce7f14" pid="ChSsZNS-Nki80iclEHB4zQ" hash="E2KOeA">There seems to be a misunderstanding on the part of some men today as to what it means to be a friend. Acts of a friend should result in self-improvement, better attitudes, self-reliance, comfort, consolation, self-respect, and better welfare. Certainly the word <span class="emphasis">friend </span>is misused if it is identified with a person who contributes to our delinquency, misery, and heartaches. When we make a man feel he is wanted, his whole attitude changes. Our friendship will be recognizable if our actions and attitudes result in improvement and independence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/what-is-a-friend.p4" guid="964e8387-e76c-42d6-81f5-71e1d45aff9f" pid="4yhl5kXWmUS1SNqHVgoHBQ" hash="B7K1IA">It takes courage to be a real friend. Some of us endanger the valued classification of friend because of our unwillingness to be one under all circumstances. Fear can deprive us of friendship. Some of us identify our closest friends as those with the courage to remain and share themselves with us under all circumstances. A friend is a person who will suggest and render the best for us regardless of the immediate consequences. Sir Winston Churchill became Great Britain’s greatest friend in his country’s darkest hour because he was courageous enough to call for “blood, toil, tears, and sweat” when some would have accepted him more readily as a friend had he advocated peaceful surrender.</p>

President Lee is our friend; I bear witness he is, in the fullest and most noble sense of the word, and he will lead us by inspiration and by his courageous character.</p>

His condition was grave because of the six-to seven-hour delay in getting medical attention. The mission president gave immediate instructions by telephone, getting the best physician possible, leading sixty missionaries assembled in zone conference in united prayer. He and his wife were at the elder’s bedside the following morning. Prayers continued, medical attention increased, companions took turns sitting at his bedside around the clock.

Often this is done for self-convenience and an unwillingness to listen. Countless numbers today reject Joseph Smith and his message because they will not accept a 14-year-old “nobody.” Others turn away from eternal restored truths available today because they will not accept a 19-year-old elder or a 21-year-old lady missionary or a neighbor down the street because they are “nobody,” so they may suppose.</p>

God through the centuries has often chosen what the world would classify as a “nobody” to bear his truths. Listen to Joseph Smith’s thoughts and self-analysis in this area:</p>

His responsibility is to write, and that is just what he is doing with enthusiasm.

In my mind one of the highlights of this conference came in sharing the heartwarming statement and spirit of a beautiful young adult Latter-day Saint lady.</p>

Her eyes were still dropping meaningful tears following the soul-stirring closing Sunday afternoon session. In her best limited English—and incidently I don’t know now and I didn’t know then from which country she came, and it made no difference then, it makes no difference now except to say that she was one of us as she shook my hand she said, “President Lee has lifted my soul to new heights. I feel I can now walk in strength beyond my own.”</p>

Yes, we also need to lift the dishonest, the self-condemning, and those who have chosen expediency over correct principles. Countless numbers today will be able to take their first steps in the right direction when we are willing to provide the lift of confidence and encouragement and give them back that self-respect spoken of by President Lee in the opening session of this conference and to help others retain that self-respect.</p>

How beautiful in the eyes of the Lord are those who take the time to lift the needy hand. Peace of mind only comes to us when we are spiritually healed. True joy comes from within. Freedom from a troubled soul is a worthy goal of all.</p>

People may be healed but not lifted. Happiness does not come from physical, social, or economic success. “… a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/12.15" class="scriptureRef">Luke 12:15</a>.)</p>

Evidence teaches us many were healed physically but remained undisciplined and spiritually ill. “… return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.13" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 9:13</a>), the Savior said.</p>

Rather, healings should be used to lift self and others to greater heights and service. May we not appropriately conclude the lift can be more important than the healing.</p>

Spiritual strength is a priceless possession available to those who will endure in righteousness. The healing of the troubled soul gives health and strength to those dead in things righteous. Purity, faith, hope, and charity are restored, making the once spiritually sick whole.</p>

We have the scriptural promise that Christ “shall rise from the dead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God. …” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:13</a>.)</p>

(He lost both his legs when he stepped on a mine in Vietnam.) The mother said her daughter was beautiful and could just as easily have married ‘a whole man.’ I am sure many people think my husband could have married ‘a whole woman’ instead of me. You see, when I was three I was shot with a .22 rifle. Thank God I am still alive, although my left side is paralyzed. I can walk and do most things other women can do. But best of all, a wonderful man thought I was ‘whole’ enough to marry. He is handsome, kind, and faithful, and he treats me like a queen. We’ve been happily married for ten years. I still can’t believe my good luck. Sign me, Freddy’s wife.”</p>

This scripture is used for many purposes, to put over many points, but this morning I would just like to say that this man did not know he could walk until Peter took him by the hand and lifted him. He didn’t realize or believe he could now walk and go forth on his own. This initial lift started him on his way. Peter was able to lift him because he stood on high ground in God’s service.</p>

They are still family, a great source of strength, a refuge, a delight, and an eternal unit. Wise parents, whose children have left to start their own families, realize their family role still continues, not in a realm of domination, control, regulation, supervision, or imposition, but in love, concern, and encouragement.</p>

What a blessing. What a sacred obligation.</p>

He on many occasions fervently prayed for the improved health of his ailing father so “that I might be blessed with his company and advice, esteeming it one of the greatest earthly blessings to be blessed with the society of parents, whose mature years and experience render them capable of administering the most wholesome advice.” (<span class="emphasis">Documentary History of the Church, </span>vol. 2, p. 289.) Can we not appropriately say this morning and remind ourselves that though he were a prophet, yet learned he from the wisdom and love of a good family?</p>

Thought I to myself, Brother Hyrum, what a faithful heart you have got! Oh may the Eternal Jehovah crown eternal blessings upon your head, as a reward for the care you have had for my soul!” (<span class="emphasis">DHC, </span>vol. 5, pp. 107–108.) “I could pray in my heart that all my brethren were like unto my beloved brother Hyrum, who possesses the mildness of a lamb, and the integrity of a Job, and in short, the meekness and humility of Christ; and I love him with that love that is stronger than death, for I never had occasion to rebuke him, nor he me.” (<span class="emphasis">DHC, </span>vol. 2, p. 338.)</p>

Sometimes the hands needed most are those closest to us. Often the hands closest to us are the strongest. When we begin to realize this relationship, one family member to another, we begin to understand the basics of our great welfare services programs which are the gospel of Jesus Christ in action. God has decreed family members are to help family members. God has decreed family members are to be a blessing to family members. When some of us in a discouraged frame of mind identify a family member as not worth a hand or a lift, may I remind us that when we continue to lift, regardless of the apparent results, added strength is ours. The more we lift, the more we are able to lift.</p>

The family lift will be available to us. We must take family members by the hand and show our love is real and continuing. When we take someone by the hand, both hands are left stronger. No one ever lifted someone else without stepping toward higher ground. We must make our home ties strong and available to all family members. Our homes should be places our children will want to come.</p>

Faithful members of the Church do not have to walk alone. The troubled soul need not find its way back alone. God’s hand is available to all if we will but reach out and up.</p>

This is the Church of Jesus Christ, restored in these latter days for the benefit of all mankind. President Harold B. Lee is a prophet of God. He, as witnessed by that beautiful young woman in Munich and thousands of others, has the God-given capacity to take us all by the hand and lift us to new heights if we will keep the commandments and follow his counsel. To this I declare and testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

We have been through a few inconveniences. Fortunately the crisis has been relieved somewhat. But today my thoughts are with a crisis that has not been relieved, one that is with us, one that I feel needs our attention.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p2" pid="WkrO3omCLkehM-8doqYjsQ" hash="l2Uwsg">Picture with me in your mind’s eye, if you will, a church building with a recently-placed sign reading, “Spiritual Fuel Available—No Rationing—No Stamps—No Quotas—Come and Prepare.” Picture with me further a home with a welcome mat bearing the inscription, “Welcome Neighbor—Spiritual Oil Available—Come In As You Are.” Picture with me still further an individual whose very countenance radiates, “I know God lives—my cup runneth over.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p3" pid="UkxbH45EDkStnRdqunyRqA" hash="rokJYw">Brethren and sisters, we are living in a time of urgency. We are living in a time of spiritual crisis. We are living in a time close to midnight. There is an urgency to meet the worldwide spiritual crisis through action now. It can only be accomplished by performance. Procrastination is a deadly weapon of human progress. Thank God there is no need of a shortage in the oil of preparedness. It is accumulated at will, drop by drop, in righteous living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p4" pid="WBuCtsHFkUGVcUTupriv5g" hash="ns2O1g">Jesus, our Redeemer, has given to us for our use in this day a powerful parable to stress the importance of constant personal preparedness. It is known as the parable of the Ten Virgins, a warning to all mankind everywhere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p5" pid="urnob-3w2E2d5H_pFJDOOw" hash="d0V4PA">“Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>

The wise and foolish virgins, all of them, had been invited to the wedding supper; they had knowledge of the importance of the occasion. They were not pagans, heathens, or gentiles, nor were they known as corrupt or lost, but rather they were informed people who had the saving, exalting gospel in their possession, but had not made it the center of their lives. They knew the way, but were foolishly unprepared for the coming of the bridegroom. All, even the foolish ones, trimmed their lamps at his coming, but their oil was used up. In the most needed moment there was none available to refill their lamps. All had been warned their entire lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p19" pid="2GhKnJvV30eYz-kq2cHtbw" hash="wcaq-g">Today thousands of us are in a similar position. Through lack of patience and confidence, preparation has ceased. Others have lulled themselves to sleep to a complacency with the rationalization that midnight will never come. The responsibility for having oil in our personal lamps is an individual requirement and opportunity. The oil of spiritual preparedness cannot be shared. The wise were not unkind or selfish when they refused oil to the foolish in the moment of truth. The kind of oil needed by all of us to light up the darkness and illuminate the way is not shareable. The oil could have been purchased at the market in the parable, but in our lives it is accumulated by righteous living, a drop at a time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p20" pid="lDl3lg79kES3T1oxRMLwPg" hash="8A7pPQ">How can one share the blessings that come through visiting the sick? How can one share in the blessings that come from assisting the widow or the fatherless? How can one share a personal testimony? How can one share the blessings of conference attendance? How can one share the lesson of obedience learned in living the principle of tithing? Certainly each must accumulate this kind of oil for himself. Let us not procrastinate. Midnight is so far and yet so close to those who have procrastinated. “But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure. …” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.38" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 13:38</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p21" pid="i84K4ytfxUeRdu6gOLf_Tw" hash="qdmVYg">There is an urgency in this day for us to prepare for the coming of the Lord. For you who have heeded the warning and continue in your preparations to accumulate the oil of righteousness in your lamps, great blessings are yours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p22" pid="TdYHNEOVs0iIzlxeQ07KEw" hash="0eEuBA">Now go back again with me in your thoughts to the church building about which we spoke earlier with its sign of “Spiritual Fuel Available—No Rationing—No Stamps—No Quotas—Come and Prepare.” Each one of us undoubtedly has a different building in mind. Perhaps yours is the one you attend most frequently—your own ward or branch.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p23" pid="TRzOUDPSxEOw1RiL3yCRsw" hash="HoShJg">The one I have in mind today is the Masterton Ward in the Wellington New Zealand Stake. We had the opportunity of dedicating this choice house of worship in February. Never have I been in a building so immaculately clean. It looked new. It smelled new. It was beautiful in its appropriate simplicity. It was worthy in appearance to be dedicated to the Lord. It was built by our people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p24" pid="OKZq10wtQUexG7cZxco_Yw" hash="rmv1zg">It was paid for by our people. It was polished to a fine finish by hands that took pride. It was tastefully landscaped and structurally sound. According to the town mayor, a nonmember, it was built by people who are happy. Three weeks before our arrival it was predicted by some that it couldn’t possibly be ready for dedication. Those so inclined to doubt didn’t know this good bishop and his ward family—people of humble circumstances but powerfully committed. Walls were painted, floors waxed, and so on by parents when their children had been put to sleep for the night. Young boys, appropriately encouraged, carried buckets of water to make the lawns green and the flowers bloom around the chapel, because New Zealand had been long without rain. It was not only completed, it was shining! Here was a group of people accumulating oil for their lamps a drop at a time through sacrifice, preparation, cooperation, faith, and works. As these ward members worked together to meet the midnight hour, their love for each other was nurtured. They, too, shined in their triumph.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p25" pid="REv1xQzfV06I9rrrIvXtqA" hash="gHgHQA">In all of our ward and stake buildings spiritual oil is available. Come and prepare. Join the ward members. Be involved. Don’t simply give—give of yourself. Don’t take without taking part. One who is thinking of others and serving others is filling his lamp with oil. While our worldwide fuel energy crisis is relieved by conservation, quite to the contrary, the spiritual crisis is corrected through use and preparation. I declare to you today that the more you give, the more drops of spiritual oil you will accumulate for yourself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p26" pid="CJmnACThJUW6TUKnhp4U-A" hash="MDXR9A">I am thinking now of a certain home, the home of a neighbor—your friend and mine. He certainly is one whose home is appropriately identified as one carrying the greeting, “Welcome Neighbor—Spiritual Oil Available—Come In As You Are.” I refer to the home of our beloved President Spencer W. Kimball. Wherever you are, wherever you have been, he is your friend. His is a home of prayer. When he prays, we feel the Lord’s power near. Faith precedes his prayers. Those of us who have the great blessing of daily, intimate association with President Kimball have heard him observe in the very recent past that with each passing day, prayer in his life has a new dimension. Prayer is a learning experience. Prayer is a power experience. Prayer is a humbling experience. Prayer is a resource for spiritual fuel. To pray with President Kimball is a spiritual refreshment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p27" pid="V9YbXdeNK0qCU70M6h2yVw" hash="y4pj3A">May we not appropriately conclude that though he, Spencer W. Kimball, is a prophet of God, yet learns he to pray by praying. He has wisely told us, “Attendance at sacrament meetings adds oil to our lamps, drop by drop over the years. Fasting, family prayer, home teaching, control of bodily appetites, preaching the gospel, studying the scriptures—each act of dedication and obedience is a drop added to our store. Deeds of kindness, payments of offerings and tithes, chaste thoughts and actions, marriage in the covenant for eternity—these, too, contribute importantly to the oil with which we can at midnight refuel our exhausted lamps.” (Spencer W. Kimball, <span class="emphasis">Faith Precedes the Miracle,</span> Deseret Book Co., 1972, p. 256.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p28" pid="dpT-noIfI0us-c3CyunxuA" hash="c-_ZCg">I bear witness to you that God listens to humble prayer. If he didn’t, he wouldn’t ask us to pray. Part of our worthwhile, urgency prayers today can be a reverent, quiet, listening period. Can we not appropriately say that he that goes to the well of prayer with faith unwavering is daily drawing oil for his lamp? It is also possible to help accumulate our supply in meaningful meditation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p29" pid="Zw4AdS73s0yQlwsJAM4lZQ" hash="mjhzag">Once more, think with me of those individuals of your acquaintance who radiate active dedication in God’s kingdom. It is a thrill to associate with them. It is a lift to feel of their enthusiasm and preparation in being about His business. I am thinking now of a beautiful 22-year-old young lady, a convert of two years, Sister Ashton and I met recently in California. She is so excited about her recently discovered, priceless possession—the gospel of Jesus Christ—it is thrilling to be around her. There is a sincere urgency on her part to share the gospel with her associates, particularly her wonderful parents and family. As she prepares and performs, she accumulates oil for her lamp. There is no doubt in our minds she knows that God lives and Jesus is the Christ. Her cup truly runneth over with the blessed knowledge and conviction that she has.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p30" pid="NJ3j8uLByEyZwCpWr0zeKg" hash="0GF3Ng">When she so sweetly and yet so earnestly asked us if we couldn’t find a few moments to come and visit with her parents in their lovely home, we felt an urgency at once to be there. There was good fellowship in the home. There was peace, unity, and love within its walls. “How wonderful my 22 years have been,” she said, “so challenging and rewarding. My blessings have been countless and I am very thankful to my Heavenly Father. He blessed me with parents I love dearly and opportunities that I have received with them. The Church and the gospel inspire me to work very hard in everything I do—especially in living a good life and sharing my many blessings with others.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p31" pid="0VqADhZbAUSVNwslngj5kQ" hash="4-H52Q">Here is one of God’s choicest daughters aware of the importance now, right now, and the truths as recorded in <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.32" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:32</a>, “For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p32" pid="-CvRLv4EgkK9TN6ra8lCGQ" hash="4hspUQ">Brothers and sisters, we are living in a time of urgency. We are living in a time of spiritual crisis. We are living in a time close to midnight. “Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 87:8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p33" pid="gOIVE3tCLE6mVJRKqnhV7g" hash="ikHrBQ">I pray our Heavenly Father to daily assist us in our preparations that we may accumulate the oil of spirituality drop by drop, thought by thought, and act by act as we walk forward. The signs are available to us if we will but look. Thanks to the mercy and kindness of God we can say, “Spiritual Fuel Available—No Rationing—No Stamps—No Quotas—Come and Prepare.” Through proper preparing and performing from within the walls of our homes, we can appropriately indicate, “Welcome Neighbor—Spiritual Oil Available—Come In As You Are.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p34" pid="RTEv1EKrNk6XUzZI6uWGgA" hash="BxASPw">Finally, I leave with you my witness: your lamp too can runneth over with spiritual fuel if you will but let it accumulate day by day, drop by drop, in righteous service to God and man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency.p35" pid="OfeYVDBReEKYQEIjIVfb4w" hash="c40lMw">God lives. Jesus is the Christ. He is our Redeemer, and this is His kingdom here on the earth. To this I bear humble testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

During the early part of the competition our attention was diverted from the action by a late arriver. As he walked by, he spotted me and asked, “Who’s losing?” I responded with, “Neither one.” Following my answer, I noticed that he glanced at the right-field scoreboard, saw the game wasn’t tied, and walked on, undoubtedly wondering about me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p2" pid="qEWIOoCeL0mwrjotVDsl_g" hash="A-GAeQ">Seconds after he made his way to a distant seat, Sister Ashton said, “He doesn’t know you very well, does he?” “What makes you say that?” I replied. She responded with, “If he did, he would know you don’t believe anyone is losing. Some are ahead and some are behind, but no one is losing. Isn’t that right?” I smiled in approval with a warm feeling inside.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p3" pid="rS58StveHEKjjqi76kAvzQ" hash="qPE05Q">All of us, young and old, will do well to realize that attitude is more important than the score. Desire is more important than the score. Momentum is more important than the score. The direction in which we are moving is more important than position or place.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p4" pid="BRvt3mfS7UuH6PRLRQhAJQ" hash="kYSf3A">The truth “For as [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/23.7" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 23:7</a>) is as applicable today as any time in history. I remember years ago meeting a young man who had tattooed on his body the words “A BORN LOSER.” I don’t think you will be surprised to learn that I met him in a state prison.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p5" pid="U5KHlTvR6E6MpyG8pvgIUg" hash="oqjUqw">I also remember once asking two young boys if they could swim. One said, “No.” The other, “I don’t know. I’ve never tried.” Unknowingly, perhaps, their attitudes were showing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p6" pid="mh7BI3o08UqGvy2Kxd3hIg" hash="CuIHxw">Proper attitude in this crisis-dominated world is a priceless possession. Never before is it more important for all of us to move forward with conviction. We may be behind, but we are not losing if we are moving in the right direction. God will not score our performances until the end of the journey. He who made us expects us to be victorious. He stands by anxious to answer our call for help. Sad but true, many today are behind in their contacts with God and encouraging destructive attitudes toward self and fellowmen. We need to lead with good cheer, optimism, and courage if we are to move onward and upward.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p7" pid="aSd79c-3dkaPDgkuHmKQDw" hash="UdZj7g">The truths “And in everything give thanks” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 98:1</a>) and “Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:7</a>) and “He who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:19</a>) are not only recommended tools of appreciation, but are powerful attitude guidelines prescribing rewarding patterns. Think of the personal challenge to thank God in all things. If we thank God in all things, we will not permit ourselves to get behind. We must work each day to beat yesterday’s record, not someone else’s. With His help we can accomplish all things and be winners indeed in the processes of eternity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p8" pid="gL9czFbSIUaigGqIdnZrJQ" hash="ZozMdw">We must strive for an ingrained attitude of self-confidence that will make us believers in self. How important it is in all our lives to develop an appropriate balance of confidence and humility. Proper self-confidence lets every man know there is a spark of divinity within waiting to be nurtured in meaningful growth. Proper attitude enables us to live in harmony with our potentials.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p9" pid="IjLwW4Gw30-MF93zopuEwg" hash="aLEeHg">We must beware of pride. An egotist will never get anywhere in this world because he thinks he’s already there. Someone has said egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity. Egotism can be cancerous to the soul.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p10" pid="IsE7b7YScUSVAr6s3xhYxQ" hash="VWQzPA">The attitude with which we approach each day controls the outcome. We must be more concerned with what we do with what happens to us than what happens to us. Proper attitude toward self is an eternal pursuit. Positive personal attitude will insist that we deliver our best, even though less might seem adequate for the moment. Proper attitude demands we be realistic—even tough with ourselves and self-disciplining.</p>

We need men with the courage to put proper attitudes into action. We need more men today with patience and purposeful endurance. We need more men with the fearless conviction of a Joseph Smith, a Harold B. Lee, a Spencer W. Kimball, as he so courageously and fearlessly declared and exhibited in his keynote address. Joseph Smith—we may thrill in his attitude as I share these lines with you. His majesty and his attitude ring through.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p13" pid="de8nqBJpl0Cp0QlKKGVp-w" hash="A8U7Gg">“So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.25" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:25</a>.)</p>

Adaptability cushions the impact of change or disappointment. Love can be a great shock absorber as we adjust in trials and tragedy.</p>

We need to personally make dark days bright ones. Isn’t it a joy, a lift, a light to see someone with heavy challenges and burdens moving forward to victory in the only contest that really matters. Hope makes it possible for us to know that even in temporary failure or setback there is always a next time, even a tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p16" pid="3hUN3YMFaUG0AQqFezln6g" hash="PWR80Q">One of the greatest tragedies of our time is children of God—you and I—living and performing below our capabilities. Strength and courage come when we realize “come and follow me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 19:21</a>) was given by a loving Savior of hope and trust who extended the invitation to us without regard as to where we are or have been. His was the perfect example. His was the perfect attitude. His was the perfect life. He would be true to his calling at whatever the cost. His labors, his life, and his teachings are cherished possessions. Our pathways are clearly marked, thanks to his steps. His experiences are our strengths. I have said many times to our missionaries, “It is not so important whether a young man has been through the experience of a mission as it is whether the mission experience has been through him.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p17" pid="So8uRcp3vE-R1LO-cQ-Gmw" hash="MFukrQ">Though he, Jesus, were a Son busily engaged in his Father’s business, he was never too busy to assist a troubled mother, a sick man, a friend, a little child. These attitudes, these services were but outward evidence of inward greatness. As we too learn to serve as did he, we learn to live abundantly. A proper attitude helps us find God through service to his children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p18" pid="yaW7HPh1ZEK10zDgqRnLog" hash="WKm9zg">Nazareth was little and looked down upon. It bore the brunt of ridicule. It had not been the scene of historic achievement. It had produced no winners: “Can any good come out of Nazareth?” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.46" class="scriptureRef">John 1:46</a>.) His attitude, his works, his life had lifted the little village out of obscurity. “Jesus of Nazareth” the world later called him, bringing honor to a once-despised town.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p19" pid="f7BC5mfHo0G32oNueJJFwQ" hash="bjrrWA">Once rejected by his own, the will, the way, and the work would yet identify him as King of kings and Lord of lords. He experienced scorn, ridicule, and abuse, but victory and triumph were his because he was busily engaged in good works. To those who would destroy, defeat, discourage, he taught truth shall triumph. To those who would desecrate his temples, he fearlessly declared, “It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/21.13" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 21:13</a>.) His words and actions in this circumstance were yet but another evidence of character, conviction, courage, and proper attitude.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p20" pid="HLDPbCr3LEG5qUQifCtIIg" hash="akeE1g">Every person in the world who loves courageous performance and appreciates proper attitude should read and reread the final chapters of his life. He lived, this Prince of Peace, in true majesty. His home town scorned his achievements. Some of his disciples had turned away. His enemies were about to triumph (so they supposed). What was his attitude? Was it complaint, faultfinding, retaliation, defeat? Never! His majestic words were, “Let not your heart be troubled” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.1" class="scriptureRef">John 14:1</a>); “I have overcome the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.33" class="scriptureRef">John 16:33</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/whos-losing.p21" pid="XIFpRb1DrEOlPhoSYcAbZw" hash="dra2Lg">In the final week of his life cries turned from “Hosanna” to “Crucify.” Unwavering courage carried him onward and upward triumphantly. The honest in heart would yet know what he stood for and why he must die. Final scenes from the last week of his earthly life unfold before us lessons in attitude greatness. Learn with me more of his courage and divinity as we see him continue faithfully to the end in those trying days. Recall with me the Last Supper with his disciples, a visit to the Garden for high communion with his Father (“Let this cup pass, nevertheless thy will be done” [see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:39</a>]), a victory signal following the battle, and the crucifixion sight with soldiers appearing on the scene. When they boldly confronted him, prepared for resistance and rebellion, they were greeted with, “Whom seek ye? … I am he” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/18.4,5" class="scriptureRef">John 18:4, 5</a>), he answered proudly. On a barren hill not far beyond the city wall he was nailed to a cross. As he suffered his cruel crucifixion, no doubt there were witnesses and spectators who observed with their limited perspective, “He is losing. He is confined. He is defeated.” How wrong they were and how wrong they are. Jesus of Nazareth a loser? Never! He is our Savior, our Redeemer, a winner, a Son of God.</p>

I have never heard him express any pleasure or satisfaction in now or today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-time-is-now.p2" pid="K-e8DwYZ6E6VrtvJVoirng" hash="-asR3A">This brief association brought to mind a notion commonly shared by many that the best of life is just ahead, over the next hill, a few years away, retirement, tomorrow, next month, when I turn 16, or next summer. We become actively engaged in the pastime of conditioning ourselves to believe that happiness and achievement are always somewhere in the future. There is an attitude of tolerating today, even looking past today in anticipation of a better tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-time-is-now.p3" pid="b4YymnftKkSUclZL0gxn6A" hash="0oPKEQ">To people so inclined, the better future may never come. The pleasant future belongs to those who properly use today. We need to find the abundant life as we go along. How can we be happy tomorrow if our “nows” are filled with self-inflicted unhappinesses and unwise delays? Generally speaking, those inclined to count their daily blessings have more to count because they help make more possible as they learn gratitude. A constant waiting for a brighter future may cause us to lose the beautiful today. Some spend so much time getting ready to live for an unknown future, too late they discover there is no time to live. Very often in our anxiousness for the joys of the future we run away from the very things we are wanting and needing today. An appropriate examination of the passing moment will prove it leads to eternity. We need to constantly remind ourselves eternity is in process now.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-time-is-now.p4" pid="MEGX1EdwSEafhjxAaF11Vw" hash="Ay9YqA">When the wise counsel “men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27</a>) was said, the time structure referred only to now, today, and without delay. How unwise are those who want to delay repentance until tomorrow. With each passing day the process becomes more difficult to pursue. Most of our hurts and misunderstandings could be cleared away if treated today instead of waiting for them to go away tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-time-is-now.p5" pid="KGiYJKD__0uezWkSWEvzfw" hash="zrQWJA">To live more fully each hour and to glean the most from each day is wisdom. How unwise we are to waste our todays when they determine the significance of our tomorrows. We should wisely live a day at a time because that is all we have. While our families are available to us we should take time to develop oneness, unity, and character. Girls of today are the women of tomorrow. Boys of today are the men of tomorrow. The kind of men and women we produce for the future depends on how they are taught to use today. How fortunate a child is to be raised in a home where love, respect, honor, integrity, and commitment are appropriately displayed each day. Mothers and fathers, we invite you to enjoy the fruits of improved parent-child relationships beginning now. Mothers and fathers classified as truly wonderful by appreciative children earn that rating by daily performance rather than by threat, procrastination, or purchase. We never give our children a lift when we give them a free ride.</p>

If we do not have good health, we should begin now to anxiously try to improve it. What a thrill it is to see people all around achieving, conquering, and overcoming through proper daily action, self-discipline, and total commitment. Progression and achievement belong to those who have learned to use the opportunity of now. Our strides of today will determine our locations tomorrow. Let me share with you an example of the results of daily determination and performance.</p>

There on the winner’s platform in the spotlight one day stood a beautiful, tall, blonde American girl. She was being presented a gold medal, symbolic of first place in worldwide competition. As she stood there, some boys whistled and others were heard to say, “There’s a gal who has everything.”</p>

Many thought she was touched by the victory ceremony. The thing most of the audience did not know was the story of her determination, self-discipline, and daily action. At the age of five she had polo. When the disease left her body, she couldn’t use her arms or legs. Her parents took her daily to a swimming pool where they hoped the water would help hold her arms up as she tried to use them again. When she could lift her arm out of the water with her own power, she cried for joy. Then her goal was to swim the width of the pool, then the length, then several lengths. She kept on trying, swimming, enduring, day after day after day, until she won the gold medal for the butterfly stroke—one of the most difficult of all swimming strokes—in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

Today is the time to let them know we care and that the Lord loves them. He stands anxious to forgive and welcome in the processes of repentance. God give us the courage to act now.</p>

It was provided by his young son. Upon returning home from his day’s work, this father greeted his boy with a pat on the head and said, “Son, I want you to know I love you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p2" pid="d6b88aplyEuwv5TUP88EWw" hash="q3jVUA">The son responded with, “Oh Dad, I don’t want you to love me, I want you to play football with me.” Here was a boy conveying a much-needed message.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p3" pid="JyjnPxp3uE6kihmHE1c1cQ" hash="aVc50Q">The world is filled with too many of us who are inclined to indicate our love with an announcement or declaration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p4" pid="y9eapNebP0mC3lojNLkhSQ" hash="OnQqnA">True love is a process. True love requires personal action. Love must be continuing to be real. Love takes time. Too often expediency, infatuation, stimulation, persuasion, or lust are mistaken for love. How hollow, how empty if our love is no deeper than the arousal of momentary feeling or the expression in words of what is no more lasting than the time it takes to speak them. A group of college students recently indicated to me their least favorite expression to come from us as the older set is, “If there is ever anything I can do to help you, please let me know.” They, as do others, much prefer actions over conversation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p5" pid="y0ljMf9Mk0GJqt4FRXLJHw" hash="Dax0Tg">We must at regular and appropriate intervals speak and reassure others of our love and the long time it takes to prove it by our actions. Real love does take time. The Great Shepherd had the same thoughts in mind when he taught, “If ye love me, <span class="emphasis">keep</span> my commandments” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.15" class="scriptureRef">John 14:15</a>; italics added) and “If ye love me <span class="emphasis">feed</span> my sheep” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.16" class="scriptureRef">John 21:16</a>; italics added). Love demands action if it is to be continuing. Love is a process. Love is not a declaration. Love is not an announcement. Love is not a passing fancy. Love is not an expediency. Love is not a convenience. “If ye love me, keep my commandments” and “If ye love me feed my sheep” are God-given proclamations that should remind us we can often best show our love through the processes of <span class="emphasis">feeding</span> and <span class="emphasis">keeping.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p6" pid="K0-NjEAMD0qWOAWN4EPKWg" hash="3ZRCbQ">From another boy a few years older, old enough to be confined in a state penitentiary a few hundred miles from here, we can learn more about the process of love. In his moving letter, just received within the past few days, he makes an effort to analyze what led to his present situation and all of the accompanying agonies. He writes, “My dad never seemed to love me and yet he made big deals of saying ‘I love you’ and kissing and all, but I learned that ‘I love you’ meant you didn’t have to do anything. I mean we were never forced to do chores regularly, given no morals, spiritual training at all. To this very day I don’t know what principles my parents stand for.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p7" pid="6wIy4mm3vUqpG__j1PL95w" hash="NyV7YA">From this friend, whom I have never met, may I share again the one phrase, “‘I love you’ meant you didn’t have to do anything.” I refer to him as a friend because he has given me his helpful thoughts and I share these comments with you on this occasion hoping they might be helpful to you too.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p8" pid="NSNTLM6JcUWRA4HmiobM_w" hash="5zlZng">From the father’s viewpoint can’t he be credited with <span class="emphasis">feeding</span> and <span class="emphasis">keeping?</span> Perhaps he had kept the family adequately stocked with food supplies. Also, hadn’t his son been the beneficiary of having a roof over his head, protected from the elements day and night over the years? In responding, I would point out to this mother and father and others that <span class="emphasis">feeding</span> is more than providing food. No man can effectively live by bread alone. Feeding is the providing by love adequate nourishment for the entire man, physically, mentally, morally, and spiritually. <span class="emphasis">Keeping</span> is a process of care, consideration, and kindness appropriately blended with discipline, example, and concern. Keeping is more than providing four walls and a roof. All of us need to be constantly reminded it takes a heap of living and loving to make a house a home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p9" pid="cumLHwSSWEqN_xIrSaWuIQ" hash="DTJ67w">How do we best show our love? How do we prove our love? Peter was effectively taught by the master teacher how he could best prove his love. “This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p10" pid="jPEbBvWojUSAsRa0yWoH_w" hash="77y7nA">“So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p11" pid="sI5GaUQghUmDGVie6rS-3w" hash="05zZXA">“He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</p>

Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.14-17" class="scriptureRef">John 21:14–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p13" pid="ykPV1L7oVEydsgI1B_rubA" hash="Ok7aRg">When were you last fed by a family member or friend? When were you last given nourishment for growth and ideas, plans, sorting of the day, sharing of fun, recreation, sorrow, anxiety, concern, and meditation? These ingredients can only be shared by someone who loves and cares. Have you ever gone to extend sympathy and comfort in moments of death and trial, only to come away fed by the faith and trust of the loving bereaved? Certainly the best way for us to show our love in keeping and feeding is by taking the time to prove it hour by hour and day by day. Our expressions of love and comfort are empty if our actions don’t match. God loves us to continue. Our neighbors and families love us if we will but follow through with sustaining support and self-sharing. True love is as eternal as life itself. Who is to say the joys of eternity are not wrapped up in continuous feeding, keeping, and caring? We need not weary in well-doing when we understand God’s purposes and his children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p14" pid="VeLfl-5V5kKTZweMsJcTOw" hash="gxBO7A">Undoubtedly our Heavenly Father tires of expressions of love in words only. He has made it clear through his prophets and his word that his ways are ways of commitment, and not conversation. He prefers performance over lip service. We show our true love for him in proportion to our keeping his words and the processes of feeding.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p15" pid="5byneITR702pPBB5N7R65w" hash="YDHaLQ">Let me share with you two examples, not too uncommon, of people who, hour by hour, day by day, and month by month, have taken the time to love one another. I say these examples are not too uncommon because, gratefully, all around on a daily and continuing basis, we see true love in action. I’m thinking first of a mother who, through death, suddenly was left without a husband. With her were three sons ranging in age from early teens to almost missionary age. Through the years by example and hard work she has independently provided finances, encouragement, and unity. The feeding and keeping processes have resulted in the development of three great missionaries, students, husbands, and fathers. One recently remarked, “Mother has always taken the time to show her love.” This mother continues the true processes of love today as her sons pursue higher education and the opportunities of their own families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p16" pid="HIvabWgB106O8sDujTqzcQ" hash="Byg0_w">Some time ago we were attracted to the skills and attitude of a local building contractor. His desire for perfection and his pride in his work led me to ask questions and get acquainted. As a young man he was left as the sole supporter of several younger brothers and sisters. Formal education was of necessity terminated at the eighth grade. Shortly after his brothers and sisters were able to make their own ways, he married. One year after marriage his wife was afflicted with what was to become a long pattern of serious illness. For twenty-five years as her health steadily worsened, he cared for her and their two sons. Operations were performed and expenses ran high, but he worked, cared, and loved without reservation. After the visit I knew I had met a man. Yes, love does take time. Love is enduring, and here was a “not so ordinary” man whose conduct demonstrated to me that he knows the true processes of love in keeping, feeding, and sharing under all conditions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p17" pid="7c614dkXVE69EPTXfVCjjQ" hash="W59lEw">What a pleasure it is also to witness all along life’s paths others—people not driven by tragedy, crisis, or loss—practicing the basic principle of true love. In the usual routines of life often courtesy, consideration, and kindness are best exhibited in the little day-to-day meaningful expressions that denote real love. I’m now thinking of a father I know who takes every appropriate occasion to give his time to his son, often just taking walks and discovering nature’s secrets and giving the boy a chance to have his dad all to himself. Think of the mothers you know who have fun teaching their daughters how to bake and cook. There are other mothers who teach their sons to love to read by reading to them and with them. An older brother teaching his younger brother how to start a stamp collection, a sister helping a brother prepare a talk are additional evidences of love in action. I know we may think “how insignificant, how ordinary,” but these and others represent the basics in feeding and as a result, fun and happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p18" pid="x2jiCDC8cEGVtnXUyWXXHg" hash="rTsFNw">Let me share others—a coach wanting more than a win for his boys; a mother or father willing to stay up until after date time to talk to a daughter or son when they are in the mood to visit and discuss; a big sister helping a younger sister with her campaign plans; a family helping each other get off on a trip. Another evidence of the routine love we appreciate can be found in a college-age girl writing letters regularly of encouragement to a missionary and keeping herself “special” for marriage to the right young man at the right time in the right place. We also commend the example of fathers who daily teach their children the lesson of true love as they constantly love their mothers. Very often a helping hand with mundane things, such as doing the dishes or even taking a turn at putting the children to bed, exhibits more true love than the sweet expressions made to sound hollow because of inadequate follow-up. Those who truly understand love know it must be basically simple, continuing, and sincere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p19" pid="D1UWvISubEiSILhTi_BLLQ" hash="-PjqPQ">The opportunities for showing love for God through the home, neighborhood, mission field, community, and family are never-ending. Some of us are inclined to terminate our love processes in the family when a member disappoints, rebels, or becomes lost. Sometimes when family members least deserve love, they need it most. Love is not appropriately expressed in threats, accusations, expressions of disappointment, or retaliation. Real love takes time, patience, help, and continuing performances. I’m thinking of a prospective elder, for more than thirty-five years completely inactive, now feeding me as my home teacher. “What brought you back, John?” I asked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p20" pid="7uHlXaQtNk-URb1HRg_tsA" hash="mUjebQ">“My wife just wouldn’t give up on me and my home teaching companion seated here with me tonight just kept ‘nudging’ me in the right way.” John is happy and anxiously engaged in the work today because two people in particular know what love is all about.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p21" pid="vwqL52b-c0KMJiHNuWO5JQ" hash="CRe7_g">Love of God takes time. Love of family takes time. Love of country takes time. Love of neighbor takes time. Love of companion takes time. Love in courtship takes time. Love of self takes time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p22" pid="L7kinX9ai0eJX2CiUrn6_A" hash="U-QTmA">Whether we are a young son, not wanting to hear of love, but preferring to see it in action, a prisoner, a student, a mother, a father, daughter, or the stranger, we need and deserve more than the declaration, “I love you.” Let us resolve to take the time to give of ourselves in putting love into appropriate action and performance. God, too, needs more than words. He is made happy by our feeding, keeping, and continuing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p23" pid="i6C3lASRtU2_ls6UUNPy3g" hash="6rrSlQ">I pray our Heavenly Father will help us to learn the truth that meaningful love is a continuing process that will bring joy and happiness to all participating parties. May we take the time to show our families, our friends, the stranger, our prophet, and our God that our declarations of love are backed up by performance by our daily lives, that we know for love to be acceptable to God and man it must be continuing and originate from within.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/love-takes-time.p24" pid="poX5Yd-92UGdp5hKY9_rHQ" hash="TFD-Gw">I pray our Heavenly Father to help us to remember that true love does take time.

It has been restored and preserved through the eternal love of a living Heavenly Father and our Savior Jesus. This I say in the worthy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-communications.p2" pid="xq6aihnY3k-LYR6nVGvxlw" hash="CjKT1A">I responded with, “What do you mean you can’t communicate with your son?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-communications.p3" pid="89Z3oCvgv0CHf0GeGRVJQA" hash="PvOEAw">“It’s just that whenever I try to tell him anything, he tunes me out,” he replied.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-communications.p4" pid="culyFP_Q6EG8-VlaelhzcQ" hash="9vIeqw">During our private discussion which followed, and very often since, I have concluded that perhaps one of the principal reasons we fail to relate appropriately with family members is because we fail to apply some basics of personal communications. In <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/13.16" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 13:16</a> we read, “But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” Communications in the family will often be a sacrifice because we are expected to use our time, our means, our talent, and our patience to impart, share, and understand. Too often we use communication periods as occasions to tell, dictate, plead, or threaten. Nowhere in the broadest sense should communication in the family be used to impose, command, or embarrass.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-communications.p5" pid="IL3Wpv4YbUyB8nC3ylKvnw" hash="Oi2d1w">To be effective, family communication must be an exchange of feelings and information. Doors of communication will swing open in the home if members will realize time and participation on the part of all are necessary ingredients. In family discussions, differences should not be ignored, but should be weighed and evaluated calmly. One’s point or opinion usually is not as important as a healthy, continuing relationship. Courtesy and respect in listening and responding during discussions are basic in proper dialogue. As we learn to participate together in meaningful associations, we are able to convey our thoughts of love, dependence, and interest. When we are inclined to give up in despair in our efforts to communicate because other family members have failed to respond, perhaps we would do well not to give up, but rather to give and take in our conversations. How important it is to know how to disagree with another’s point of view without being disagreeable. How important it is to have discussion periods ahead of decisions. Jones Stephens wrote, “I have learned that the head does not hear anything until the heart has listened, and that what the heart knows today the head will understand tomorrow.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-communications.p6" pid="pu60eoZsUUmtciJR9qBFmA" hash="nv9jPQ">Let me share with you seven basic suggestions for more effective family communication.</p>
      <div class="figure" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-communications.f2">
	<ol class="number">
	  <li pid="5YMVxlw1r0Wa2FZT5nqFYQ" hash="fE8adg">
          <span class="label">1.</span>
          <p pid="DzdF_7E7KUapZarnO_p7wg" hash="afZTKA">
            <span class="emphasis">A willingness to sacrifice.</span> Be the kind of a family member who is willing to take time to be available. Develop the ability and self-discipline to think of other family members and their communication needs ahead of your own—a willingness to prepare for the moment—the sharing moment, the teaching moment. Shed the very appearance of preoccupation in self, and learn the skill of penetrating a family member’s shield of preoccupation. Sad is the day when a daughter is heard to say, “My mother gives me everything except herself.”</p>
          <p pid="DZ-4Pnb9LEO8XxzVf_hAjw" hash="9OUB6w">Too early and too often we sow the seeds of “Can’t you see I’m busy? Don’t bother me now.” When we convey the attitude of “Go away, don’t bother me now,” family members are apt to go elsewhere or isolate themselves in silence. All family members on some occasion or other must be taken on their own terms so they will be willing to come, share, and ask.</p>
          <p pid="XbfskZw2-UmDHqNRYj5dRw" hash="lqtIHw">It takes personal sacrifice to communicate when conditions are right for the other person—during the meal preparation, after a date, a hurt, a victory, a disappointment, or when someone wants to share a confidence. One must be willing to forego personal convenience to invest time in establishing a firm foundation for family communication. When communication in the family seems to be bogging down, each individual should look to himself for the remedy.</p>
          <p pid="Avb0w11Vek252gSPcUC9_A" hash="15JAIg">If we would know true love and understanding one for another, we must realize that communication is more than a sharing of words. It is the <span class="emphasis">wise</span> sharing of emotions, feelings, and concerns. It is the sharing of oneself totally. “Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/3.13" class="scriptureRef">James 3:13</a>.)</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="6hwjteRnaE-7SmV2ULw8kA" hash="tmUvLQ">
          <span class="label">2.</span>
          <p pid="kyngfhLM-k6_DHlen2StnA" hash="i6SmQA">
            <span class="emphasis">A willingness to set the stage.</span> The location, setting, or circumstances should be comfortable, private, and conversation-conducive. Effective communications have been shared in a grove of trees, on the mount, by the sea, in family home evening, during a walk, in a car, during a vacation, a hospital visit, on the way to school, during the game. When the stage is set, we must be willing to let the other family member be front and center as we appropriately respond.</p>
          <p pid="o39Zc-Im3EuNwft8Dwr0Qw" hash="dntyDg">Months and years after the score of a baseball game is long forgotten, the memory of having been there all alone with Dad will never dim. I’ll not soon forget a ten-year-old girl excitedly telling me she had just ridden in the car with her daddy all the way from Salt Lake to Provo and back. “Was the radio on?” I asked. “Oh, no,” she responded, “all Daddy did was listen and talk to me.” She had her daddy all to herself in a setting she’ll not soon forget. Let the stage be set whenever the need is there. Let the stage be set whenever the other person is ready.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="WR-uYnZ8NkGKX5oS_TZEYQ" hash="CAEzMA">
          <span class="label">3.</span>
          <p pid="LqMEWW-oq0aWvpwD0akZaQ" hash="Tapt9A">
            <span class="emphasis">A willingness to listen.</span> Listening is more than being quiet. Listening is much more than silence. Listening requires undivided attention. The time to listen is when someone needs to be heard. The time to deal with a person with a problem is when he has the problem. The time to listen is the time when our interest and love are vital to the one who seeks our ear, our heart, our help, and our empathy.</p>
          <p pid="yfQ_Bu1vVEC9IryKbpVO5g" hash="fRpnaA">We should all increase our ability to ask comfortable questions, and then listen—intently, naturally. Listening is a tied-in part of loving. How powerful are the words, “Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
          <p pid="2Zyf2QNPeECzZNF2o7YBMA" hash="X6MK7g">“For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.19-20" class="scriptureRef">James 1:19–20</a>.)</p>

          <p pid="OiuUJG3CPkenaV_tT74kTQ" hash="h3Avzg">
            <span class="emphasis">A willingness to vocalize feelings.</span> How important it is to be willing to voice one’s thoughts and feelings. Yes, how important it is to be able to converse on the level of each family member. Too often we are inclined to let family members assume how we feel toward them. Often wrong conclusions are reached. Very often we could have performed better had we known how family members felt about us and what they expected.</p>
          <p pid="DTncOpoa6021I3ht7LQq6A" hash="RPXhVQ">John Powell shares this touching experience: “It was the day my father died. … In the small hospital room, I was supporting him in my arms, when … my father slumped back, and I lowered his head gently onto the pillow. I … told my mother … :</p>
          <p pid="IxdE7yQSyEGfcj0i00wjlg" hash="StwyBA">“‘It’s all over, Mom. Dad is dead.’</p>
          <p pid="DhjjvJP7ZU2FbomAdLRlSg" hash="t25C0g">“She startled me. I will never know why these were her first words to me after his death. My mother said: ‘Oh, he was so proud of you. He loved you so much.’</p>
          <p pid="9A8zXqxAbEew_Yr-imDVZw" hash="ieZxIQ">“Somehow I knew … that these words were saying something very important to me. They were like a sudden shaft of light, like a startling thought I had never before absorbed. Yet there was a definite edge of pain, as though I were going to know my father better in death than I had ever known him in life.</p>
          <p pid="9l_fiEaSIkG5w908J_eadA" hash="bunVKw">“Later, while a doctor was verifying death, I was leaning against the wall in the far corner of the room, crying softly. A nurse came over to me and put a comforting arm around me. I couldn’t talk through my tears. I wanted to tell her:</p>
          <p pid="ONyxRkprk0KR80_BfyhJgw" hash="rnimYg">“‘I’m not crying because my father is dead. I’m crying because my father never told me that he was proud of me. He never told me that he loved me. Of course, I was expected to know these things. I was expected to know the great part I played in his life and the great part I occupied of his heart, but he never told me.’” (<span class="emphasis">The Secret of Staying in Love,</span> Niles, Ill.: Argus, 1974, p. 68.)</p>
          <p pid="v8KX6pXXfUWc8E15yHJK8A" hash="JMiCAA">How significant are God’s words when he took the time to vocalize his feelings with, “This is my beloved Son,” yes, even the powerful communication, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 3:17</a>.)</p>
          <p pid="pEUnM1hhGE2Ww0BKkdCcPQ" hash="33TvGQ">Often parents communicate most effectively with their children by the way they listen to and address each other. Their conversations showing gentleness and love are heard by our ever-alert, impressionable children. We must learn to communicate effectively not only by voice, but by tone, feeling, glances, mannerisms, and total personality. Too often when we are not able to converse with a daughter or wife we wonder, “What is wrong with her?” when we should be wondering, “What is wrong with our methods?” A meaningful smile, an appropriate pat on the shoulder, and a warm handshake are all-important. Silence isolates. Strained silent periods cause wonderment, hurt, and, most often, wrong conclusions.</p>
          <p pid="JO6qm_M7ek2JnuFFUj9fWA" hash="k6efTQ">God knows the full impact of continuing communication as he admonishes us to pray constantly. He, too, has promised to respond as we relate to him effectively.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="oZBLgp5MSE6AidocRBYbAw" hash="38zPVw">
          <span class="label">5.</span>
          <p pid="AzxsAPVbAk6oT3_9-n3-bg" hash="eTBY6A">
            <span class="emphasis">A willingness to avoid judgment.</span> Try to be understanding and not critical. Don’t display shock, alarm, or disgust with others’ comments or observations. Don’t react violently. Work within the framework of a person’s free agency. Convey the bright and optimistic approach. There is hope. There is a way back. There is a possibility for better understanding.</p>
          <p pid="blTAQB1SqEyxzrtYO9hs7A" hash="erFt7w">Let a common ground for personal decision be developed. “Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.11" class="scriptureRef">John 8:11</a>) are words that are just as gentle and effective today as when they were first uttered.</p>
          <p pid="XfRmXxHhbU-iZ_zwcGky2w" hash="WUvghA">Avoid imposing your values on others. When we can learn to deal with issues without involving personalities and at the same time avoid bias and emotions, we are on our way to effective family communications. When a family member makes a decision which may be inadequate or improper, do we have the ability and patience to convey the attitude that we don’t agree with his decision but he has the right of choice and is still a loved member of the family?</p>
          <p pid="s5ujkZj28E6DrWHNdrUruQ" hash="4SEigg">It is easy to point out mistakes and pass judgment. Sincere compliments and praise come much harder from most of us. It takes real maturity for a parent to apologize to a child for an error. An honest apology often makes the son or daughter feel surprisingly warm toward the mother or father or brother or sister. “For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/3.2" class="scriptureRef">James 3:2</a>.)</p>
        </li>

          <span class="label">6.</span>
          <p pid="nubvfo88H0eJwfh4sD2HLw" hash="F-ZJmw">
            <span class="emphasis">A willingness to maintain confidences.</span> Be worthy of trust even in trivial questions and observations. Weighty questions and observations will only follow if we have been trustworthy with the trivial. Treat innermost trusts and concerns with respect. Build on deserved trust. Individuals who are blessed to have a relationship with someone to whom they can confidently talk and trust are fortunate indeed. Who is to say a family trust is not greater than a community trust?</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="OrE7DfO4YkWa3eMxbfVqiQ" hash="6ls31g">
          <span class="label">7.</span>
          <p pid="5IUVrBZ16kCBkwR_LmQOBQ" hash="91im5w">
            <span class="emphasis">A willingness to practice patience.</span> Patience in communication is that certain ingredient of conduct we hope others will exhibit toward us when we fail to measure up. Our own patience is developed when we are patient with others.</p>
          <p pid="XVJA1PY2vU6T0iXUE5LMJw" hash="HIxh-g">“Be patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience, faith, hope and charity.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:19</a>.)</p>
          <p pid="YJFdVMUVVE2nBfrmjDpyqQ" hash="88tR-g">“I get sick and tired of listening to your complaints” and “I have told you a thousand times” are but two of many often-repeated family quotations that indicate patience is gone and channels of communication are plugged.</p>
          <p pid="I28Sr83Mr0OVf8KYBaF0gw" hash="K5Yp2A">It takes courage to communicate patiently. We constantly need to express pride, hope, and love on a most sincere basis. Each of us needs to avoid coming through as one who has given up and has become totally weary in trying.</p>
          <p pid="6OgAg93jy0e-FPkn6mu-Fg" hash="BLisEA">The correction of family members in front of others is to be avoided. Much more notice is taken in quiet, private conversation. Calm endurance is a priceless virtue in one’s relationship with all family members.</p>
        </li>
	</ol>
      </div>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-communications.p7" pid="SlwQciiVFkGoLnMxpqAggw" hash="wVI71w">When family members tune each other out, communication is not taking place. Words spoken are unheard, unwanted, and resisted when we fail to understand the basics for proper interchange. Each must be willing to do his part to improve, since the family unit is the basic foundation of the Church. Proper communication will always be a main ingredient for building family solidarity and permanence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-communications.p8" pid="PeM4Vsz_L0-6soV9WsR24A" hash="uuLnSw">I pray our Heavenly Father will help us to communicate more effectively in the home through a willingness to sacrifice, a willingness to listen, a willingness to vocalize feelings, a willingness to avoid judgment, a willingness to maintain confidences, and a willingness to practice patience. “How forcible are right words!” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/6.25" class="scriptureRef">Job 6:25</a>.) Yes, how forcible are right words shared at the right moment with the right person.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-communications.p9" pid="S7yiKqTUlEuZxoiIYpdQLQ" hash="L9LOvQ">May our gracious and kind Heavenly Father help us in our needs and desires for more effective family communication. Communication can help build family unity if we will work at it and sacrifice for it. For this goal, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Besides being a great team man, I was told he performs well for himself. He possesses all of the necessary physical and mental ingredients for success. He has personal pride and a good self-image. He has the bearing and self-conduct patterns that prompt his fellow team members and friends to say, “He’s well balanced. He knows where he is going and how to get there.”</p>

Personal pride is a great motivator. It is a virtue to understand who we are and to conduct ourselves accordingly. To be created in God’s image is a tremendous blessing with accompanying choice responsibilities.</p>

Proper self-image is a basic ingredient of pride in one’s self. It is necessary if individual discipline is to be purposeful and effective. May I suggest a few thoughts for our consideration in the basic areas of self-management?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p6" pid="IQRinOIs_UaZ8EkhH8Dv3w" hash="_FJZUA">Generally the cover or jacket of a book is designed to sell what is inside. We will not have to die to be judged by the cover of the book of life. To those who would say, “It’s what you really are inside that counts, not the length of the hair or beard,” I would say, “If this is true, and I agree it is, why run the risk of looking like something you’re not?” In working with others in regard to personal appearance, change can usually be brought about more quickly by courteously appealing to pride, impression, and image.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p7" pid="HmH5_-sfN0-F7NnkB8LEAA" hash="dZxu6w">Self-image is often enhanced by the clothing worn. Appropriate, modest, flattering, and comfortable apparel helps a person feel good about himself. To be over-dressed or immodestly dressed may create wrong impressions and improper identification. Improper clothing may also lead to wrong actions. I have always had a special amount of admiration and respect for blind friends who, even though they were unable to see themselves or others, yet appeared neat, well dressed, and well groomed. The individual or someone in that person’s life is trying to help the blind person feel good about himself. We do ourselves and others a great injustice when we appear to be what we are not.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p8" pid="ikN3Bqj1zkqSl3bYuXqnUg" hash="vHqmCQ">Reasonable questions to ask oneself could well be, “Can I be proud of my appearance? Do my clothes properly introduce me?” What better example of proper personal appearance can we have than that glorious introduction shared with us by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he declared, “I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a></p>

I am reminded of the mother who said, “It began to annoy me that the children would say, ‘Where are you going, Mom?’ whenever I took time out to tend to my hair, apply a little lipstick, or slip into a clean dress. Didn’t I have the right to dress up at home? Then I started to realize how seldom I actually did dress up just to stay home and do housework. In fact, I rarely changed from my working clothes except when I ran to shop or visit. I had made myself too busy to bother with good grooming except for special occasions, for visiting, for going to church. No wonder the children got confused at the rare times I made myself more presentable for no apparent reason at all.”</p>

Dr. Thomas Harris shares this worthy thought with us: “Most people never fulfill their human promise and potential because they remain perpetually helpless children overwhelmed by a sense of inferiority. The feeling of being okay does not imply that the person has risen above all his faults and emotional problems. It merely implies that he refuses to be paralyzed by them. He is determined to accept himself as he is but also to assume more and more control of his life.”</p>

We need to be constantly aware of the fact that we are children of God. He knows us. He hears us. He loves us. Proper self-image will help us keep our habits, lives, and souls directed in happy paths. How proud we should be in the knowledge we have godlike attributes. It was Abraham Lincoln who said, “It is difficult to make a man miserable when he feels he is worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great God who made him.” (Address on colonization to a Negro deputation at Washington, Aug. 14, 1862.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p14" pid="cvnZ-kdchU-BRWbhaSrgDw" hash="02zb0Q">Our obligation is to avoid self-pity, self-judgment, and self-indulgence. If we properly understand our relationship to God and His to us, we will not have moments, days, or lives spent in wondering, “What have I done to deserve this?” “What does God have against me?” or, “Why wasn’t I born with the talents of my friends?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p15" pid="4QliI1h1lES4FvAvAqaOiA" hash="32o4gg">There needs to be a willingness and ability on the part of all of us to properly relate to others in families, neighborhoods, and organizations. Courtesy and self-respect are necessary ingredients. We need the humble approach in dealing with others. Proper self-management will permit us to be a team member first, a coach, captain, or superstar second. In this relationship and way of life, the truth “If ye are not one ye are not mine” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:27</a>) takes on new significance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p16" pid="KPynmJImo0G1cF3r4UdnRQ" hash="sZL2Cw">Another important part of meaningful self-management is self-discipline, and the only discipline that really works is self-discipline. What can give greater satisfaction in life than mastery in self-conduct? Good health habits, integrity, bearing, mannerisms, conversation, and self-control can be powerful assets in one’s personal balance sheet. These traits outwardly reflect the views of the management. Integrity within oneself makes it possible for honesty with God, family, and all other daily associates. A person who has integrity within himself will also have it in his relationship with all others. A person walks uprightly only when he is moving in the right direction. He needs to know where he is going at all times and under all conditions. One avoids the appearance of evil as he treads paths that lead up and on rather than down and out. Being anxiously engaged in worthy causes and seeking first the kingdom of God are external evidences of proper self-management and a proper application of personal resources.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p17" pid="d-sslQQIvkeG4FRKS-5jzA" hash="RU7WHw">To teach self-discipline, the emphasis should be on self-respect and esteem rather than the use of ridicule, embarrassment, and tears for conduct-improvement tools. One of the great tragedies that can come in a human’s life is the destruction of self-respect. This destruction is often self-inflicted. Elevated expressions of human feelings, example, and courtesy build self-respect. People are lifted when they are treated as if they already were what they could be. It is my experience that most thinking people respond better to friendly persuasion than to threats or abuse.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p18" pid="ysPHfcU2dUS9q3N95a__jg" hash="NG5Knw">Even personal health habits are generally improved by proper emphasis on temporal and eternal values rather than on condemnation and disgust. Overweight people should be encouraged concerning appearance and health advantages of appropriate diet and trimness. Most will respond to honest appreciation expressed for what has been done or honestly attempted rather than caustic slurs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p19" pid="eP4EpzfjJEiAcvxcD3iMHg" hash="j7fXyQ">Often self-discipline in personal health is weak or missing because we allow ourselves to become lost in revenge or spiteful attitudes. Recently I was talking to a young man on drugs. To the question, “Why do you use drugs?” he responded with, “To get even with my mom.” From an attractive wife and young mother presently caught up in the habit of drinking cocktails: to my query, “Why are you involved in the use of alcohol?” she said, “That father-in-law of mine isn’t going to tell me what to do!” If there are good reasons to be on drugs and alcohol, and at the present I don’t know of any, there must be better reasons than those offered by these two friends. God and men glory in intelligent self-management.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p20" pid="9O4im_vUBUS_bUAjGawHug" hash="0m9utw">As important to our self-image and general conduct as appropriate dress, grooming, and hair standards are moderation of voice, use of worthy language, good manners, respect for others’ rights, and courtesy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p21" pid="CveEDXcWL0qpDOENwZyVPg" hash="D3b8kQ">In any community or personal situation, it is refreshing and uplifting to see men and women who think, speak, and act with propriety. Good manners are necessary for the decency and peace of community living and should be a matter of grave concern to all, yet we hear and read less about their cultivation than we do about dieting and “daily dozens” to enhance our personal acceptance and development. Courtesy is at its best when it is least obvious. Courtesy is not the invention of a past generation; rather, it is but a long-standing manner of life. We need to be reminded of the fact that Moses did more than bring down the Ten Commandments from the Mount, he in unmistakable terms prescribed the conduct of a gentleman—civility to friends and strangers; respect for the blind, the deaf, the aged, the weary, the unsuspecting; and the abstention from tale-bearing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p22" pid="ZLFKvuDhy0qg7IVDsDF-MA" hash="ne5CmQ">Courtesy is not unusual conduct to be reserved for a special circle of friends or circumstances. It is not a veneer to be put on for special social occasions or people. It is a way of life of tremendous significance whether it be in the home, in the office, or on the highway. It cushions the unexpected and eases our jolts wonderfully. We cannot justify or condone discourtesy regardless of friendship or situation. Our best manners learned and used in the home will appropriately surface in our association with all men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p23" pid="BX_ERgzSQ0mXkqDTK3CPrg" hash="bB6vjA">Being on time to appointments and meetings is a phase of self-discipline and an evidence of self-respect. Punctuality is a courteous compliment the intelligent person pays to his associates. Punctuality or the lack thereof oftentimes is the only introduction one will ever have to new groups and friends. Serenity and poise are not the companions of those who lack the courtesy and judgment to be on time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p24" pid="00_jXnOkfUCoNO6buTmWJA" hash="9jruXg">He is well disciplined who develops patience in his dealings with his fellowmen. In conversation he is considerate and knows how to listen. A courteous conversationalist is not a boaster, a babbler, or a boor. Wise is the man who says what needs to be said, but not all that could be said.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p25" pid="OLOuiU80vku8gWuB5WkSUg" hash="PtCiow">My hope and prayer today is that we will look to ourselves with new responsibility, new self-appreciation, higher self-image, and greater self-respect. We are children of God. We do possess God-given attributes. We do have the opportunity and obligation to learn to be leaders. Let us so live that it may be said of us, “He’s well balanced. He knows where he is going and how to get there. He’s a good manager of himself.” By doing this it will be possible to better serve in the kingdom and have a greater appreciation for Lorenzo Snow’s thrilling declaration, “As man now is, God once was. As God now is, man may be.” (See <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> June 1919, p. 656.) This is what proper self-management is all about.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/proper-self-management.p26" pid="cJRDAUBr402rnVUHlKyGTA" hash="0r3WUQ">I leave you these thoughts and my testimony in the name of Him, the perfect example, even Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Hear Him!’” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-power-of-plainness.p2" pid="d2orrlDcF0K_DX43R0UW0w" hash="09e9uQ">We went on to talk about the powers of this celestial conversation and of the plainness of the setting, the greeting, the introduction, and the invitation. Here in a grove of trees were two heavenly personages appearing to a fourteen-year-old boy in response to his earnest pleas and unwavering faith. Here in a setting of simple beauty an obscure boy was called by name by God, was introduced to the Savior Jesus Christ, and was invited to listen to words of understandable plainness that he might begin to learn the most important facts taught in this world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-power-of-plainness.p3" pid="wqdgbtGFnkCOMBP57rdt2Q" hash="MQf-SA">The reality of this vision gives Nephi’s declarations concerning plainness new significance. “For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:3</a>.) “I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.6" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 33:6</a>.) “My soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may learn.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.4" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:4</a>.) Through this great prophet Nephi, along with other leaders and wise teachers, we come to realize that we learn more readily if principles are taught and explained in plainness. Brigham Young once said that if he could do but one thing to bless the Saints, he believed it would be to give them “eyes with which to see things as they are.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 3:221.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-power-of-plainness.p4" pid="gkuqrCCMQkS5wiT2HgHuMg" hash="qdG0Ng">Plainness is best comprehended by the humble, the teachable, the intelligent, the wise, and the obedient. Often plain truths are perverted by the pretentious, the crude, the low, the critical, the contentious, the haughty, and the unrighteous. More so than in any other time in our history, there is an urgency in today’s society for men and women to step forward and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ in the power of plainness. God delights when His truths are taught clearly and understandably with no conspicuous ornamentation. Plainness in life, word, and conduct are eternal virtues. When the plainness of Christian teaching and living is lost, apostasy and suffering result. People walk in darkness when the light of plainness is taken from their lives. “They have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away.</p>

The lives of the worthy are plain, precious, and powerful. May I share with you a few lessons taught in plainness for which I will eternally be grateful. Some of them come from young children who are humble and accepting in their pure faith. The Savior taught that all mankind should become as little children if they would be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Now, an example of the power of plainness in prayer:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-power-of-plainness.p7" pid="HtVIh9daW06YqdK1LUQvrg" hash="KT7hQw">Some weeks ago when the First Presidency asked the Church members to observe a week of prayer so that “the ravages of hunger, illness, cold, and drought might be alleviated (now and in the days to come at home and abroad),” it was reported that, at the end of the week in a family home evening, in her prayers an eight-year-old girl pled for more snow so “there would be enough water next summer so the whole family could go swimming together.” In the eyes of an eight-year-old, top priority was enough water for a family summer swim. Who is to say her prayer given with plain, childlike faith wasn’t most acceptable as she asked for the possibility of family fun together?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-power-of-plainness.p8" pid="BUDXEKL9kEm1BFOk3_8rGA" hash="ZomhGA">The power of a plain, unadorned testimony is always impressive to me. I recall a twelve-year-old boy standing in front of a large congregation to share his testimony. As he stood trembling in fear and emotion, his voice failed him. He stood speechless; our hearts went out to him. The creeping seconds dragged on, making the silence of the moment intense. Prayerfully we hoped that he might gain composure and the ability to express his testimony. After great uneasiness and anxiety peculiar to a young person in such a circumstance, he raised his bowed head and softly said, “Brothers and sisters, my testimony is too small.” He cleared his voice and sat down. His message had been given. I thought then, as I think now, what a timely observation. Whose testimony isn’t too small? Whose testimony doesn’t need to be added upon? After this one-sentence sermon, I acknowledged before the congregation that my testimony was too small also and I was going to give it a chance to grow by more frequent sharing. I had been taught by a plain, simple statement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-power-of-plainness.p9" pid="F-L87Ok80kCkZLjRctlxzA" hash="VPcEDw">Testimonies grow and lessons are taught in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by plain and simple acts. On Sunday morning a young girl just barely out of Junior Sunday School, with her face shining, her hair carefully combed, dressed in her best, hesitatingly walks to the pulpit. Her little hand reaches up and pulls the microphone down to her level, and with a furtive look at her mother for courage, leads the congregation in the sacrament gem. As time goes by, these plain acts become stepping-stones to poise, to testimony, and to a knowledge of the scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-power-of-plainness.p10" pid="wQDhIThv_k-MwZm3JSmwiA" hash="9BQoPg">Each Sunday at the sacrament tables all over the world, priests dressed neatly, but not in robes or ornamentation, have the honor of blessing the sacrament. Deacons, with pride and reverence, in an orderly but simple routine way, pass the sacred emblems. These Aaronic Priesthood members are taught to watch and plan so no member is deprived of participation in this sacred ordinance. These same young men may be watching and caring for all ward members in all ways as, in the years to come, they serve as bishopric members.</p>

Never before has she stood before a group of women. With support and encouragement from her understanding associates, she is able to fill one plain and simple assignment that could well lead her on her way to family and personal greatness and added opportunities for executive and teaching positions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-power-of-plainness.p14" pid="Vchmm_YYCE-Zb9K-qbcd-w" hash="UtCXLQ">The power of plainness in discipline in the gospel of Jesus Christ is not always appreciated and understood, but to the repentant and remorseful, it is a great blessing. Discipline in the Church is plain, and repentance and forgiveness are available by following simple steps. Not long ago a wise member was stopped in the hall of one of our ward buildings and asked in a hushed voice if she had heard that brother so-and-so had been excommunicated from the Church. When the sister indicated that she already knew of the situation, the talebearer said, “Isn’t that awful!”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-power-of-plainness.p30" pid="MKlR1GZZJkCXxqIJd3IbRA" hash="o7KyTQ">To men and women worldwide we declare in sobriety and plainness that God the Father and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ did appear to Joseph Smith: “One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This Is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>.)</p>

Even though it caused great ridicule and abuse to the Prophet Joseph in the days that followed and ultimately contributed to his martyrdom, I humbly thank God that he had the courage to declare in unmistakable plainness, “However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.24" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:24</a>.) To the truthfulness of these glorious but plain words, I leave you my humble witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Marvin, I sustain you.” How do I know President Kimball’s feelings? Because he takes the time to tell me. When was the last time, you might ask? Only yesterday.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p2" pid="bONMLANPiUy3Upy3E5hZAA" hash="8yZOog">One of life’s more common experiences is to be rated or graded. Youngsters learn quickly whether or not their actions are acceptable to parents. Rewards or punishments can be quickly administered in the home, and such grading or rating by parents has a lot to do with the formation of ideals in living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p3" pid="D9BY_R1GNkqmMckjinSJAw" hash="gpSL5g">Those who enter school embark on a long struggle to achieve the kinds of grades that will make them acceptable to those among whom they must live and work. Those who become involved in military activities are soon caught up in a myriad of inspections and ratings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p4" pid="plwdUdMNeE6VNq5p44GiQg" hash="NUdP2w">When we accept employment we quickly realize that we are graded by the responsibilities given and the wages paid. Superior work is rewarded with higher pay and greater opportunities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p5" pid="U7mY2AXtw0iTK9IJAoAGLA" hash="NWCvaw">Those who manufacture goods or merchandise or produce food are rated by a variety of consumer organizations. “Grade A” products bring higher prices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p6" pid="Ykt3_IZ040arX6uljuvLDw" hash="ShyfLQ">As part of a free government, we see the grading of leaders at each election.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p7" pid="snGUSBWWrEKENiaENNe9ig" hash="FM37sQ">In the media, subscriptions to newspapers and magazines provide an immediate public rating of their effectiveness. Television is particularly vulnerable to the ratings and gradings of professional organizations. Programs with poor ratings are usually doomed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p8" pid="q0lOvYDPQkuagnl4TBZT5A" hash="JeMWzg">And so it goes on and on in almost everything we do in life. We have a tendency to rate or grade others, and they do the same to us. If our perspective is proper, we use these ratings or gradings to motivate us to reach high levels of achievement and self-discipline. The whole concept of ratings enables us to set high goals and provides the challenge to us to achieve them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p9" pid="tzu6QxaeyEmbN5W6rTgwjw" hash="gPIueA">In spite of this inborn desire to achieve, there remains an area where the attainment of high or good ratings seems to be ignored. I speak of the growing numbers of movies, books, magazines, theatrical productions, and television programs where efforts to glorify immorality or violence have become predominant. “Rated R” or “Rated X” has replaced the idealism of being “Rated A.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p10" pid="la55bKVnT0e8ldeolXeoHA" hash="--FWdw">I know that free expression is a vital part of the eternal principle of free agency and must be preserved and protected. I also know how certain forces use the freedom of speech to degrade or debase, and this constitutes perversion and enslavement. Because I recognize that there will always be opposition in all things, I suspect that we will not soon see the day when obscenity in its various forms will be entirely eliminated. But I have faith that it can be fully eliminated in the lives of quality individuals. I firmly believe that most thinking people can be inspired to strive for the <span class="emphasis">A</span> rating by choosing wholesome, worthwhile literature, art, and habits.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p11" pid="qDoDlOqU1UOiaOWIg_4QgA" hash="QV1Whw">As each of us uses our free agency to choose the material that enters our lives, we ought to recognize that the battle between “Rated A” and “Rated X” is part of the war that began in heaven and is still being fought today. The enemy seeks any strategic or tactical foothold he can gain, and any bridgehead he attains becomes the launching point for the next encounter. The number of victories we allow him can seriously affect the final outcome of the struggle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p12" pid="BN7LolLNp0yyMGX0TaXb0A" hash="kzF8LQ">How does the adversary wage this battle? What are his tactics? Those who are fighting pornography and obscenity have helped us recognize some of his battle plans. They tell us that a person who becomes involved in obscenity soon acquires distorted views of personal conduct. He becomes unable to relate to others in a normal, healthy way. Like most other habits, an addictive effect begins to take hold of him. A diet of violence or pornography dulls the senses, and future exposures need to be rougher and more extreme. Soon the person is desensitized and is unable to react in a sensitive, caring, responsible manner, especially to those in his own home and family. Good people can become infested with this material and it can have terrifying, destructive consequences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p13" pid="cx4SXoz5z06QuceaKGQ_mg" hash="hi8HuA">One such young man who became a casualty of this conflict was a respected husband and community member. Someone with whom he worked brought lurid bits of pornography and passed them around the office. At first it was treated as a joke, and those who viewed them kidded each other about such things of the world. This young man, however, mainly out of curiosity, thought he should study them carefully in case he might have occasion to help others combat such evils of the world. As he looked at the items more and more frequently, he was overcome by a spirit of the adversary that he did not recognize. Soon he sought more pornographic materials from his fellow employee, and the two of them began to spend more time discussing these evil things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p14" pid="N8JYSR4gCEq-v4GTfqr_9g" hash="5zC8UQ">Still thinking he was becoming enlightened as to the ways of the world so that he could be a stronger influence for good among his friends, this young man became trapped by his own ignorance of the enemy’s ways. His associate convinced him that he should experiment with the actions portrayed in the materials he was viewing. With his spiritual sensitivity dulled, he agreed, and he approached his wife with the idea. She was surprised and shocked by his suggestions, and when he continued his insensitive pleas, she finally refused to have anything to do with him. In his distorted condition he sought gratification elsewhere, and in the end he lost her, his family, and his self-respect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p15" pid="_1q3uNnIMEuETGILw9LdDw" hash="WStAWQ">The scriptures help us understand the strategy and tactics of the enemy. Nephi in the Book of Mormon saw the conflict of our day and tells us plainly:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p16" pid="9BmvRO2a5UuZe6un40Thww" hash="8IhWDw">“For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p17" pid="Z1SmJGWfxUSPNQekkM02yg" hash="_nwhuw">“And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p18" pid="GjLeh2lkF0mnQ8r_t5siYw" hash="MlpRkA">“And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none—and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.20-22" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:20–22</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p19" pid="mDCBB9HTJkCDfBEEOFoAJA" hash="P8FE0A">The great prophet Mormon, viewing his own fallen people, wrote his son Moroni a very telling indictment when he said that because of wickedness his people were “past feeling.” (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.20" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 9:20</a>.) How tragic to reach the point where the Spirit must withdraw, and we become unable to sense or feel right from wrong.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p20" pid="wgAhfAC60UWauvAydzfTFw" hash="tmMpsA">If we continue to lose skirmishes in the battle with Satan, the ultimate chains with which he grasps us will be as awful as the scriptures indicate. How awful this state is might be indicated by the words a dictionary uses to describe the word <span class="emphasis">obscenity.</span> Obscenity, it indicates, defiles, nauseates, offends, perverts, impairs, corrupts, distorts, infects, misleads, poisons, warps, weakens, and spoils. When I think of these words and then remember that the Prophet Joseph Smith admonished us to seek for things that are “virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:13</a>), I shudder at the blindness of so many.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p21" pid="kJrFv-z1yUaTPiQOTp-Ggw" hash="dmiFpw">In olden times the call to battle was the sure sound of a trumpet. The call to battle that I sound is a call to find so much that is wholesome or “Rated A” that there is no time or inclination for the carnal. It is a call to strive for a rating that can be remembered with joy forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p22" pid="5ok3x3_2pkC2ZCmGuJ6pmA" hash="POkaiA">First I challenge parents to be concerned about what your children read or view. Good reading begins at the bedside of your little ones. Never be too busy to read wholesome bedtime stories at the close of the day. Select from the classics of children’s literature uplifting stories that can build noble ideals in your youngsters. I shall never forget the impact of a simple child’s story about a little engine that thought he could, and then he did. How often I have said to myself, “I think I can, I think I can, I think I can,” and then found growing within myself the personal power to do something good. Consider the difference in children who are cuddled and snuggled by parents at bedtime as they listen to stories from good books, and then kneel at their bedside in prayer, as compared to those who go to bed after having viewed a violent television program.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p23" pid="fh-LfyzSp0GUtTiVUyLe_w" hash="QG1iTg">Next, I challenge grandparents to foster reading programs with your grandchildren. If you are close enough to be with them, read the books to them that will help develop character and ideals. If you’re a distance away, send them books, old or new, with a personal invitation to read them and report how they like them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p24" pid="YPcJ_gbnfU6r_sv4HR_nJQ" hash="QMlhGA">Next, I challenge youth to cooperate with parents who are concerned about your reading and your viewing. Be concerned yourself about what you take into your mind. Young people, you would never eat a meal of spoiled or contaminated food if you could help it, would you? Select your reading and your viewing carefully and in good taste.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p25" pid="e3sPdY1m_02_Nk8kDR4EAg" hash="StS75Q">Next, I challenge families to foster movie viewing that is wholesome. Parents should know the movies their children attend, and children should attend only the movies they have parental permission to view. If movie viewing is an important part of your family life, and good ones are not available in commercial movie houses, wise parents will rent full-length movies that entertain and edify.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p26" pid="0SAPO-rpmUmvOJKB7UgDiQ" hash="Vlfl3w">Next, I challenge every Latter-day Saint to come to a knowledge and an understanding of the scriptures. These sacred books are our bulwark of defense against a cunning adversary. Each person should own and use his personal copies of the scriptures. Take them to meetings and classes. Read them in leisure moments. Develop a careful plan of study and meditation. Take them on trips as well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p27" pid="1dvBoSCMAkWZgiQ5Ep81fg" hash="PEt06g">A friend of mine told me recently of his family vacation this past summer. A long distance was being driven, and the children, who ranged from preschoolers to high school age, grew restless. The parents had wisely taken along the scriptures, and when these restless times came, family members read chapters and then everyone talked about what had been read. The teenagers who did most of the reading quit teasing the little ones, and the little ones seemed very interested in what the older ones had to say. This family read a sizable part of the New Testament while traveling on their vacation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p28" pid="lTeF-AIn1Ey1cAXC-5iBXA" hash="IDRB-w">The battle to be “Rated A” is a battle we can win. We do so many things in life that bring success that it seems incredible how easily we let the adversary weaken us by impure materials read or viewed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p29" pid="Ke_8JH7DbkuGMf76-SfwhQ" hash="3CsgOQ">My plea is that we will strive to be “Rated A” in all we do in life. We want good grades in school. We want to eat the best food we can get. I hope we will also strive to feed our minds with things that are lovely, wholesome, and praiseworthy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p30" pid="M0tJ7Tckg0muvyUoHCywNQ" hash="afOjRw">The desire to achieve has been placed in us by a loving Creator who honors our free agency but nonetheless beckons to us to do well. He it is who will grade our eternal report card. The adversary would weaken and dull our senses so we lose sight of the final time of rating or judging. We are in a battle with evil powers who are cunning and crafty. They can lull us and pacify us through carnal things if we are not careful. But if we take the offense in the contest and seek those things which are praiseworthy, we can build an armor that will not be pierced.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p31" pid="DJcA4-seB0OzYbsb1Kq9pQ" hash="2lj-5A">So now, in the midst of this battle, let us sound our trumpets for that which is “Rated A”: <span class="emphasis">A</span> for pure actions, <span class="emphasis">A</span> for achievement, and <span class="emphasis">A</span> for approbation, even that approbation from Him whose voice can say to you: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant … enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/rated-a.p32" pid="aFE2EssAJk22r0Aelib-sg" hash="RTUxTQ">For this I humbly pray in the worthy name of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. Amen.</p>

When I arrived, the missionaries were waiting anxiously to share with me some anti-Mormon literature that was being circulated in their area. They were disturbed by the accusations and were eager to plan retaliation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/no-time-for-contention.p2" pid="Rga5wuLWUUGUBFTZNNk2jQ" hash="7Y9-mQ">The elders sat on the edge of their chairs as I read the slander and false declarations issued by a minister who apparently felt threatened by their presence and successes. As I read the pamphlet containing the malicious and ridiculous statements, I actually smiled, much to the surprise of my young associates. When I finished, they asked, “What do we do now? How can we best counteract such lies?”</p>

We must not be manipulated or enraged by those who subtly foster contention over issues of the day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/no-time-for-contention.p6" pid="wsdQQPnsak22FLPXuZaRYg" hash="9a91hg">When issues are in contradiction to the laws of God, the Church must take a stand and state its position. We have done this in the past and will continue to do so in the future when basic moral principles are attacked. There are those in our society who would promote misconduct and immoral programs for financial gain and popularity. When others disagree with our stand we should not argue, retaliate in kind, or contend with them. We can maintain proper relationships and avoid the frustrations of strife if we wisely apply our time and energies.</p>

How unwise we are in today’s society to allow ourselves to become irritated, dismayed, or offended because others seem to enjoy the role of misstating our position or involvement. Our principles or standards will not be less than they are because of the statements of the contentious. Ours is to explain our position through reason, friendly persuasion, and accurate facts. Ours is to stand firm and unyielding on the moral issues of the day and the eternal principles of the gospel, but to contend with no man or organization. Contention builds walls and puts up barriers. Love opens doors. Ours is to be heard and teach. Ours is not only to avoid contention, but to see that such things are done away.</p>

It is to struggle, fight, battle, quarrel, or dispute. Contention never was and never will be an ally of progress. Our loyalty will never be measured by our participation in controversy. Some misunderstand the realm, scope, and dangers of contention. Too many of us are inclined to declare, “Who, me? I am not contentious, and I’ll fight anyone who says I am.” There are still those among us who would rather lose a friend than an argument. How important it is to know how to disagree without being disagreeable. It behooves all of us to be in the position to involve ourselves in factual discussions and meaningful study, but never in bitter arguments and contention.</p>

It is sad when children are raised in a contentious home. It is just as sad when an organization has contention as one of the planks of its platform, declared or unannounced. Generally speaking, people who come from noncontentious households find themselves repulsed by those who would make it part of their daily diet.</p>

Conflicts within the family are critical and often damaging. Contention puts heavy strain on stability, strength, peace, and unity in the home. There is certainly not time for contention in building a strong family.</p>

I recall receiving a written question from a fifteen-year-old girl during a fireside discussion. She wrote, “Is there anything I can do to improve the feelings among members of my family? I am fifteen years old and hardly ever look forward to being home. Everyone just seems to be waiting for me to say the wrong thing so they can cut me down.”</p>

She replied, “Because of the hassle back home. I have had all that I can stand.” She continued, “There is always fighting. I can never remember when it was different. Everyone in the house, especially my parents, takes delight in bad-mouthing each other.” A few family expressions which cause hurts and lead to contention are: “You don’t know what you’re talking about!” “Why did you do that stupid thing?” “Your room is a mess.” “Why don’t you do as I tell you?”</p>

While we remember him most today for such paintings as the Mona Lisa, he was also a fascinating debater, a polished orator, and a storyteller of great imagination. One of his fables, simply titled “The Wolf,” I would like to share with you.</p>

With slow steps he drew near to the sheepfold, placing his feet with the utmost caution so as not to make the slightest sound which might disturb the sleeping dog.</p>

The plights of these young ladies bring it to mind. Like the careless paw of the wolf, it is causing untold suffering and depriving many of spiritual growth and family oneness. I speak of arguing, careless words spoken in anger, disgust, and intolerance, often without thought. How sad it is when family members are driven from home by contentious tongues.</p>

Some families have been forced to move because of bitter controversy. Going the extra mile, turning the other cheek, swallowing one’s pride, and apologizing are often the only ways in which contention among neighbors can be erased.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/no-time-for-contention.p21" pid="0JnbJGUZo0-DLIvtc3jZhg" hash="XFzwrw">From the Savior’s words we learn the source of contention, whether it be in the home, in the community, among the leaders, or in the classroom. “For verily, verily, I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.29" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:29</a>.) This means that Satan has power over us only when we let him in. We have agency. We can choose our behavior. The Prophet Joseph Smith said on one occasion, “The devil has no power over us only as we permit him. The moment we revolt at anything which comes from God, the devil takes power.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> p. 181.)</p>

It gives me a chance to get even.” “I am unhappy and I want others to be miserable too.” “I can feel self-righteous. In this way I get my ego built up.” “I don’t want others to forget how much I know!”</p>

A contentious spirit can affect almost any phase of our lives. An angry letter written in haste can haunt us—sometimes for years. A few ill-advised words spoken in hate can destroy a marriage or a personal friendship, or impede community progress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/no-time-for-contention.p25" pid="Zlyn0CTsuECb3o6uW2Vl9w" hash="vPjSeA">As we take a stand against the evils of the day, such as abortion, homosexuality, immorality, alcohol, drugs, dishonesty, intolerance, etc., can we express our beliefs without clenching our fists, raising our voices, and promoting contention? Can we talk about the beneficial principles of the gospel such as the Word of Wisdom, keeping the Sabbath day holy, maintaining personal purity, and the other truths found in the scriptures without making our listeners defensive? This is not easy, but it can be done. Ours is, if you please, to plow our own furrow, plant our own seeds, tend our crops, and reap the harvest. This can best be accomplished not only by plowshares rather than by swords, but by appropriate commitment rather than contention.</p>

Besides being an appropriate time for all of us to give thanks, harvest time should be a time of personal contemplation, evaluation, and planning.

Later the opportunity came to serve on a general board. I shudder to think what I would have missed if I had declined the change in assignments.”</p>

I recently learned of a man who raised his family and pursued his professional life in a small country town. He was not without his problems but was a good man with a great heart who loved the Lord and the gospel. Mistakes, even small ones, are not soon forgotten in some neighborhoods, however; and he never seemed to be “allowed” to grow, blossom, develop, and change into what he could become.</p>

A friend of mine went to school with a boy who did not have much home life and for whom the gospel did not mean as much as it later would. He drank a little and caroused a little; but later, after moving away from his home town, he became very active in the Church. His one dream was to return to his home town and start a business, which he tried to do. But unfortunately, as with the other man, the people in the community insisted on treating him as he had been, not as what he had become. He finally moved away and is doing remarkably well in business and in the Church. He recently expressed to my friend how deeply disappointed he was that his former friends and townspeople had not let him “come home,” even in a gospel sense.</p>

I have lived in the same apartment now for more than four months and not one person has come to call on us.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/roadblocks-to-progress.p" pid="kH5CcMYsEEWebVvgCHqp3w" hash="wnbhHw">Many of us set up roadblocks to progress and contribute to our own unhappiness while we wait for others to seek us out and offer help. Negative attitudes lived with today cause stagnation, misery, and bitterness tomorrow. It is unproductive for those who should be anxiously engaged in seeking the abundant life to nurse personal hurts. We are all God’s children. If we love Him, we will feed His sheep wherever they may be found, without regard as to our own personal plight or situation. Often we can best feed others when we are hungry ourselves or not completely comfortable in the fold that we presently occupy. Very often those who are hungry, helpless, and cold can best be rescued by those who have been through the same exposures. Marking time or stalling should not be indulged in by the weak, weary, uncertain, and unrecognized. Instead, there is a healing power as we use our energy in action, in service, and in lifting others.</p>

Bradley and others, Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Company, 1969, p. 698.) Victories in life come through our ability to work around and over the obstacles that cross our path. We grow stronger as we climb our own mountains.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">The constant nursing of personal hurts.</span> Each of us should daily resolve that with God’s help we will not allow careless words from others to shape our destiny or control our daily course. How tragic it is to see, on occasion, a life of usefulness lost because we have allowed an unkind comment to cause a wound or hurt. We let the injury become an open sore and fester rather than treat it with prompt skill and maturity. Some try to get even with their offenders by dropping out of life’s race. How weak, how damaging, how self-restricting is the often used statement, “I’ll never go back as long as<span class="emphasis">that person</span> is there!” On occasion some of us seem to stand on the sidelines waiting to be hurt, offended, or ignored. We listen for careless words from others and remember the unsaid <span class="emphasis">hellos</span> and read into the said or unsaid words a totally unintended message.</p>

He simply said, “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.34" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:34</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/roadblocks-to-progress.p" pid="CW7n-S9Sh0uP45OiP0KmjA" hash="Niilug">During his earthly mission Jesus made every confrontation a learning experience, including those that would be destructive or cause hurt and dissatisfaction. He was never rebellious, never ashamed; always long-suffering, patient, kingly; and never deterred in being about His Father’s business. He, too, proved His greatness when His personal pain and suffering were the most intense. Hurting words and unkind deeds never kept Him from reaching His goals. No one can meet life in all its fulness without experiencing hurt, pain, and suffering.</p>

He will constantly pursue the Savior’s paths without stopping at this roadblock caused by apparent or real injustices. It is up to us to go forward and not confuse or confound ourselves. Those of us who cannot forgive and forget break the bridges over which we must pass. Too often we allow incidents to contribute to our stagnation when we permit ourselves to feel ignored, unwanted, or unworthy. How damaging sympathy is when it is self-administered. How refreshing it is to meet people who don’t have time to be offended. Certainly what we are is more important than what we have or what is said of us.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Yielding to the sorrow of tragedy and grief.</span> Too often the tragic loss of a child, husband, wife, mother, father, or other loved ones becomes a turning point in life. Some yield to the damaging thought that if there be an all-wise and loving Eternal Father, how could He allow this to happen to me and mine? We allow the heartache to break the band and strengthening tie to Him who has promised to see us successfully through our Gethsemanes. Some of us in our moments of greatest despair turn away in bitterness from the arm of strength, comfort, and peace. Sometimes in our darkest hours we lose sight of the light as we dwell upon the unanswerable questions: “Why does God permit this to happen to me or to our family? What have we done to deserve this?”</p>

I was able to see things I had never seen. My husband, my children, each person took on a beauty you can’t believe.

        <span class="emphasis">Being fettered with habits and mistakes of misconduct.</span> A friend of mine who only in recent months has made giant steps toward purposeful living and complete activity in the Church shared the following: “I can tell you as one who has had many years of experience and practice that it is much easier to criticize individuals and knock the establishment than it is to change oneself and recognize the real causes for one’s own inactivity and negativism.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/roadblocks-to-progress.p" pid="rs9R5UAzb0WfWg-wvNG82Q" hash="k-_hYw">Change is hard. Rather than going through the struggle to overcome a bad habit or rectify a mistake, some of us choose to make excuses for inactivity. Progress comes as we are able to give up something for something we want more. Honesty with oneself and setting of desirable but attainable goals day by day can determine the paths we follow. One might make a list of goals and then a price list for each goal. One day at a time the price of change can be paid. The cost will then not be overwhelming.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/roadblocks-to-progress.p" pid="i3BDtbbZVEqpJ3L7gLgRfw" hash="eAWFrg">The Lord has promised that he will forgive and remember no more when the process of repentance is complete. If the Lord will do that for us, why should we not so do for ourselves? Mistakes can be forgiven. Habits can be changed. One more roadblock to progress can be removed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/roadblocks-to-progress.p" pid="vPSEgU8P8ESNFJrOmaqqtQ" hash="h9QGRA">In contrast to this process, how discouraging it is to witness someone who lives with damaging habits and who resists taking personal steps toward better self-management. William James said, “That which holds the attention determines the action” (<span class="emphasis">Vital Quotations,</span> Emerson Roy West, comp. Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1968, p. 5). The truly repentant will put their mistakes behind, learn from them, and turn their attention from them to actions that bring progress and growth. How comforting it is to know that God will take us by the hand and lift us to new levels of attitude and achievement if we will but let Him. What a sweet, personal victory it is to recognize misdirection in one’s own life and to pay the price that then lets us walk in His paths.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Letting fears inhibit progress.</span> Fear is another roadblock which may stop our eternal progress.

What a tragedy it is in our lives when we are afraid to try, afraid to make decisions, afraid to trust the Lord, or even afraid to make an error in judgment. Oh, that we could remember the great teaching of the Savior to Peter when fear caused him to fail to walk and to even sink.</p>

Yielding to the pains of tragedy and grief deters self-development and takes away the opportunity for triumph over trying obstacles. Being fettered with habits and mistakes of misconduct relegates a person to being a victim of his errors. Letting fears inhibit progress is but another evidence of one’s unwillingness to try because of the fear of failure. Roadblocks to eternal progress are cast aside when resolves are made that no man needs to walk alone. It is a happy day when we come to know that with God’s help nothing is impossible for us.</p>

Carefully he lifted the greenery from its small pot and put it into its larger home, trying to disturb the roots and soil as little as possible. The novice gardener watched and waited. To his dismay, the plant still struggled. Our friend expressed his frustration to an experienced gardener who offered his services. When the plant was placed in the gardener’s hands, he turned the pot upside down, pulled out the plant, shook the soil from the roots, and clipped and pulled all the stragglers from the root system. Replacing the plant into the pot, he vigorously pushed the soil tightly around the plant. Soon the plant took on new life and grew.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p2" pid="Vs1clDlXm0OkSU0OHJHrKw" hash="LzTW4w">How often in life do we set our own roots into the soil of life and become root bound? We may treat ourselves too gently and defy anyone to disturb the soil or trim back our root system. Under these conditions we too must struggle to make progress. Oh, change is hard! Change can be rough.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p3" pid="41r50nXHvUCfhU-F1ZRe7Q" hash="XwrG4Q">The Lord does not want His church to become root bound and stagnant. Constant revelation through the prophets is needed for the growth of His kingdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p4" pid="jkAyL1B3c0uPzoeutFBnIg" hash="DtLNtg">There is nothing so unchanging, so inevitable as change itself. The things we see, touch, and feel are always changing. Relationships between friends, husband and wife, father and son, brother and sister are all dynamic, changing relationships. There is a constant that allows us to use change for our own good, and that constant is the revealed eternal truths of our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p5" pid="MqhfN15tSk-x642yAFq3-g" hash="wOtYrQ">We need not feel that we must forever be what we presently are. There is a tendency to think of change as the enemy. Many of us are suspect of change and will often fight and resist it before we have even discovered what the actual effects will be. When change is thought through carefully, it can produce the most rewarding and profound experiences in life. The changes we make must fit the Lord’s purposes and patterns.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p6" pid="M6pPggNJPkiRehOjmPzSqw" hash="1Vc0eA">As opportunity for change reaches into our lives, as it always will, we must ask, “Where do I need development? What do I want out of life? Where do I want to go? How can I get there?” Weighing alternatives very carefully is a much needed prerequisite as one plans changes. In God’s plan we are usually free to choose the changes we make in our lives and we are always free to choose how we will respond to the changes that come. We need not surrender our freedoms. But just as a compass is valuable to guide us out of the dense forest, so the gospel points the way as we walk the paths of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p7" pid="cWNlqcMMYkmfUDSm45kItg" hash="Kg4Vyg">C. S. Lewis indicated there is often pain in change when he wrote of God’s expectations for His children: “Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of—throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace” (C. S. Lewis, <span class="emphasis">Mere Christianity,</span> New York: MacMillan Co., 1960, p. 160).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p8" pid="2XoMHMrYEkeD46v6T1795w" hash="NmmwSQ">Yes, there is pain in change, but there is also great satisfaction in recognizing that progress is being achieved. Life is a series of hills and valleys and often the best growth comes in the valleys. Change is a meaningful part of repentance. Some are unable to repent because they are unwilling to change.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p9" pid="jwJkKfG1wEu9B5eMc8AOHw" hash="pCH6ww">Recently I was participating in a groundbreaking ceremony for a chapel at the Utah State Prison. After the ceremonies, Warden Morris invited Governor Scott Matheson and me to take a tour of the facilities. We had noticed the extra care that had been taken to make the grounds around the maximum-security building pleasing and beautiful. When we asked the warden who had done the work, he indicated that two inmates had been given time outside of their cells to improve the landscape. We asked if we could meet the two men. The warden took us into the maximum facility to see them. As Marvel and Brown shuffled toward us from their restricted confinements on death row, we felt that the look on their faces reflected, “What have we done wrong now?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p10" pid="zcTYCiVnL0yN3JqtOcoMLw" hash="_yQl7w">“We want to compliment you men on the work you have done on the grounds,” we said. “The flower beds and vegetable gardens look beautiful and well kept.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p11" pid="-uEwTGDSOEuWm27Pgewibw" hash="e2iz5A">The change that came over their expressions was marvelous. The unexpected words of praise had given them reason for self-esteem. Someone had noticed that their efforts had changed a rocky, weed-filled yard into a beautiful garden. Sadly, they had failed earlier to make productive gardens out of the rocky, weed-covered fields of their own lives. But we hold hope for men like these who could see a need for change in one area and had accomplished such good. Perhaps their part in changing the gardens will lead to improvement in their own lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p12" pid="RHDBtgOsiUSiEo8AEO94rA" hash="SQf8EA">William James once said, “The greatest discovery of my generation is that [we] <span class="emphasis">can</span> change [our] circumstances by changing [our] attitudes of mind” (cited in <span class="emphasis">Vital Quotations,</span> comp. Emerson Roy West, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1968, p. 19). Jesus Christ helped people from all walks of life reach heights they had never dreamed of by teaching them to walk in new, secure paths.</p>

His family moved from one state to another until he was eight years of age. He was often beaten by his father who was either too strict or not strict enough, according to his mood at the time. The boy spent many of his early years sleeping in buses, train stations, and cheap hotels. At the age of fourteen he was arrested as a runaway. Both family and friends classified him as untrustworthy, often violent, and a loner.</p>

Throughout his childhood he had a tendency toward infection. His frail body seemed unable to hold his oversized head. His father worried that people considered his son “addled,” and on one occasion he beat the boy publicly. After his mother had lost three previous children, she wrapped herself in black and withdrew.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p16" pid="XyCGCsJJyUShr5aQ_Ne1_g" hash="0c2kBg">In the third instance, a young man came from circumstances of near poverty. His family was forced to move more than once because of financial difficulties. He had little, if any, formal schooling. “His mother reported that he was less inclined to read and study than any of the other children” (Francis M. Gibbons, <span class="emphasis">Joseph Smith: Martyr, Prophet of God,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1977, p. 26). Because neighbors considered many of his ways and ideas strange, he was ostracized by his peers. All of his life he was hounded by the law and found himself constantly in difficulty.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p17" pid="LvLCoVuLV0uuJKpmY7mBYw" hash="fv5vxA">Certain steps <span class="emphasis">can</span> help one make constructive, worthwhile changes in life. “When you climb up a ladder, you must begin at the bottom, and ascend step by step, until you arrive at the top; and so it is with the principles of the gospel” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 6:306–7). In order to make significant changes in our lives, we must accept our Father in Heaven and His truths. The prophet Alma in the Book of Mormon said, “Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p18" pid="vzoIgd0ee0uNOqgO1Q_rWQ" hash="7Q9MhA">Let me suggest four important steps in making change a valuable tool in our lives:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p19" pid="kt7UdOnIOECHcwC7UFlYAw" hash="HMvQ_w">First, we must understand the need for change. An unexamined life is not worth living. A new bishop shared with me an experience that frustrated him. He had a young lady in his ward who was not living the way she should. When he counseled her, she would bristle and say that he should be willing to accept her the way she was. She would not accept the fact that “the way she was” was just not good enough for her bishop, for her Heavenly Father, and most important, for herself. Being aware of the fault and the need to change is a most important step. <span class="emphasis">The recognition of the need to change has to be a greater force than the luxury of staying the same.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p20" pid="RC2oqAHiekG5oJbZLbDS9A" hash="dEghSA">Second, the facts must be authentic. We need to know how, what, where, and why to change. The gospel of Jesus Christ can help us set short-term, intermediate, and long-term goals by teaching us who we are, where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going. With this knowledge, a person will have greater strength to improve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p21" pid="e5MVtmIydEG7YcQYhc5IgQ" hash="c8lFlg">Third, a system for change must be established. It was Emerson who said, A man who sits “on the cushion of advantages, goes to sleep. When he is pushed, tormented, defeated, he has been put on his wits, … [learns] moderation and real skill” (“Compensation,” <span class="emphasis">The Complete Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson,</span> New York: Wm. H. Wise &amp; Co., 1929, p. 161).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p22" pid="9t-63ioUQUWDdc_rIGFI1g" hash="WJns0w">Our change must be planned and orderly. After our system for change is established, it must be followed through to completion, even though it may disturb our very root system.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p23" pid="pLzrZas3A0-kXkML8uhiaA" hash="-vURLg">Fourth, we must be totally committed to our plan for change. A Chinese proverb says, “Great souls have wills; feeble souls have only wishes.” Unless we have the will to improve, all the other steps to change will be wasted. This last step separates the winners from the losers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p24" pid="sz4Bvn_pFEiQ-7x3s4HKxg" hash="pVxROA">Earlier I mentioned three examples of people living in the most dire circumstances. The first young man’s life was a series of continuing arrests for everything from vagrancy to armed robbery and murder. Never recognizing the need to change, he was one day convicted of murder.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p25" pid="ADHfvi_RuUu_yMrsXTVufA" hash="t__T4Q">The second was a description of the early years of Thomas A. Edison. From a beginning that seemed almost to much to overcome, he was able to change and build. Though he was once judged retarded, he proved himself to be one of the greatest inventors of all time. His personal commitment changed the whole world for the better.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p26" pid="06lmaseFhU-IMlOSV7LhsA" hash="h2Nq4w">The third tells the story of a young man and his early days in the northeastern part of this country. He was born in 1805 during a hard and cold Vermont winter. His name—Joseph Smith. His beginnings were difficult. Life was a series of struggles—not only physically, but also emotionally and spiritually. But here was a young man who recognized the need for improvement through change and submitted to an authority greater than himself. From tremendously difficult beginnings he sought change and ushered in the last dispensation. His faith, prayers, and works brought to the earth the greatest, most profound changes in the latter days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p27" pid="NdJOXuGd0kaUcqDVO7RPvQ" hash="YiWGng">It has been said by Bruce Barton that, “When we’re through changing, we’re through.” There is no age when we are too old or too young or just too middle-aged to change. Perhaps old age really comes when a person finally gives up the right, challenge, and joy of changing. We should remain teachable. How easy it is to become set. We must be willing to establish goals whether we are sixty, seventy, fifty, or fifteen. Maintain a zest for life. Never should there be a time when we are unwilling to improve ourselves through meaningful change.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p28" pid="fPAXOV6vvUiT0IJIG2TCsg" hash="BO_bLw">For many Church members it is often difficult to accept change in leadership. On ward and stake levels leadership changes are necessary and, often times, too frequent for our convenience and comfort. Some of us are inclined to resent and resist personnel changes. “Why can’t they leave him in?” or “Why do we have to have her?” or “Why do they have to divide our ward?” Our vision may be limited. Seldom are changes made that do not bring needed progress to a person or a situation. How often in retrospect have we thought, “I didn’t understand why that change was made in the program or why that person was given such a calling, but now I can see that it was just what was needed for the time.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p29" pid="bhsoploSsE6aNixhhY3DBQ" hash="xwbFJA">During transitional times—and there are always transitional times in our Church—patience, love, and long-suffering are needed. A permanent part of our philosophy should be, <span class="emphasis">“Never allow yourself to be offended by someone who is learning his job.”</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p30" pid="15egiOvnykusn47FYuvLaA" hash="cbUzQw">Change in our own church assignments may be even more disturbing. Often when we express a wish to never have <span class="emphasis">that</span> assignment, the bishop or stake president offers us the blessings of that self-same calling. At those times it is good to remember the words of Paul when he, troubled by many ailments, said, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 4:13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p31" pid="ji9NQQJ3KEepAjvz-OaX6Q" hash="huj3lA">As a Church with lay leadership, the blessings of change come often. Very few of us feel adequate to meet those changes with our <span class="emphasis">own</span> talents. How grateful we can be for the strength of Jesus Christ which helps us with the changes brought by new callings and increased responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/progress-through-change.p32" pid="BfefgtRUMUKlCMsT2F1T4Q" hash="olekZw">The change from this life to a life with Him who is our Eternal Father is the ultimate goal to which meaningful change can bring us. I pray we will all seek and accept wholesome, orderly changes for the betterment of our personal lives. This I humbly ask in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Kimball, and I walked through the admittance door of the Utah State Prison a few days ago, the sound of sliding, electronically controlled cell doors could be heard clanging in the background. The grating sounds of the steel bars against the concrete floor and walls let me know where I was again. The total situation was familiar to me. I had been in prison many times before (as a visitor).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p2" pid="FgRgWUgf8kewzLAbpCiwQg" hash="_oRv5Q">It was President Kimball’s first visit. Once past the heavily guarded door, we were escorted to Warden Lawrence Morris’s office, located near the front of the medium security area. Even after we were safely seated in his office, I was still filled with real anxieties. I hoped conditions would be completely under control with no disturbances possible. There must not be any interference or interruption during the visit of the prophet. I was responsible for this trip, and as we sat there together, this total situation weighed heavily upon me. Past experience had taught me that the behavior of some inmates is unpredictable. Fortunately the able warden had prepared well, and conditions in and around his office were ideally calm and quiet. To my great relief it appeared that the “grapevine” means of communication inside the prison had not learned of the President’s coming.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p3" pid="m8b8nklsd0-AwfrVhLcvIA" hash="7lNMSw">What had attracted President Kimball to the prison? Why was he there? What was his special interest? What was on his mind? Was there a certain inmate he wanted to see? Why should he expose himself to this dangerous environment, when he had mountains of responsibilities needing his attention in his own office?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p4" pid="v65ISDYFf0mbSCOBsAlqzg" hash="GHyh0w">With this latest prison visit over and having had a few days to reflect on and ponder the situation, I now know that President Spencer W. Kimball went there for many reasons and people. Being at his side and seeing him share himself with these special people will always be one of the choicest experiences of my life. I learned much. I was with a prophet in an unstable environment. My senior companion, if you please, taught me well. As we traveled together to the prison, visited there, and returned in the car, the warmth and wisdom of this mighty man renewed in me a thrilling appreciation for his greatness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p5" pid="CzqT6XJsM0aFluuufEA-gA" hash="844wUg">Let me share with you, especially you members of the Aaronic Priesthood, some of the leadership traits I witnessed during this tour with President Kimball. As we review and think together, I hope that we can apply these same traits in our lives. We can accomplish more and become stronger individually by following his example.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p6" pid="8sUavnczeUKZ4RnLhVcB5A" hash="LvJEIw">After a short visit in his office, the warden invited two inmates to come in and meet President Kimball. As they hesitatingly came in, President Kimball stood up, shook their hands, and gave them a warm welcome. Here was a prophet with two prisoners. I watched with keen interest. What would President Kimball say following the greeting? “What are your special jobs out here? Where is your home? Tell me about your family. Are you working on the construction of the new chapel?” These were some of his questions—all of which were free of criticism and embarrassment. Perhaps others would have been inclined to say under these circumstances, “How long is your prison sentence? What was your crime? How long have you been here? Your family can’t be very proud of you. You ought to be ashamed wasting your life in jail. Why don’t you shape up?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p7" pid="gTAysDIbpUywLCMpMwYauw" hash="K-TByQ">President Kimball set the example for me and for all of us as he conducted this personal interview, if you please, with skill and sincerity. In a very few minutes, with few, but appropriate, words, he let the two prisoners know he was with them because he cares.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p8" pid="tv0Qfe-RP0G1wrXCy7Zhhg" hash="UAXVzA">When this short visit with the two prisoners was over, we were to make our way to the prison chapel. When we were outside again, it was about 10:30 <small>A.M.</small>, with the temperature near 40 degrees Fahrenheit. “Would you like to ride or walk the two-block distance?” President Kimball was asked. He responded with, “I would like to walk.” Since President Kimball was without a top coat, his personal secretary, D. Arthur Haycock, started to take his off to share with the President. President Kimball said, “No, thank you. You keep it on. If I walk, I won’t need it.” Just a routine appreciation gesture? Perhaps, some would say. But to me it was evidence of President Kimball’s courteous way of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p9" pid="4vUUvhzkH0iUc4AMS4Azsg" hash="97r91A">As President Kimball walked the distance to the new chapel site with the wardens, prisoners, and a few others of us, I was close enough at hand to hear his constant questions and concerns. He listened intently as answers were given and situations of interest pointed out. I was impressed again with his concern for people, their confinement and treatment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p10" pid="bA4eKpHfVkqMmUUVm81qWw" hash="VYuPew">Once within the walls of the chapel under construction, he took time to shake hands with workers, some of whom were prisoners, and with other visitors who were now aware of his presence. He seemed to take time for everyone. People never seemed to be a bother. I saw a number of workers jump down from scaffolds to shake his hand. In some cases I saw his arm go out to them before they could clean mortar and dirt from their fingers. They and leaders from other churches heard him say, “This interdenominational worship facility will help prisoners find their way back.” He also added, “The Church and our people are happy to be participants in any and all community projects that are worthy.” Once again I was impressed with his wholesome relationship with all people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p11" pid="nXlLcYfs0Eudc9fQFT2nqg" hash="5Olc9g">The highlight of the chapel inspection tour and the prison visit in general, it seemed to me, came when two inmates were invited to stand at the side of the prophet in the minimum security reception area for picture taking. As the President welcomed them forward and later put his arms around them, he said, “It is an honor for me to have my picture taken with you.” The two prisoners were obviously touched by his comment. Others of us again saw the greatness and stature of the one we love so much. Respect and human dignity were witnessed. Again he taught well that all people are entitled to be treated as human beings, wherever they are found and regardless of where they have been. President Kimball, it was obvious, is a foe of sin but a friend of the sinner. The scripture found in <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:26</a> came forcefully to my mind: “He that is ordained of God and sent forth, the same is appointed to be the greatest, notwithstanding he is the least and the servant of all.”</p>

Would you please tell him I love him?” Another prisoner responded with, “I’m not a Mormon, but he’s got to be a special guy.” Some day I hope that prisoner finds out what a special guy President Kimball really is.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p13" pid="lt6OCr-l_Uis7U2Lo469Qw" hash="vnlNnA">As we walked back to the car to return to Salt Lake City, this choice experience with the prophet brought to mind the story of Parley P. Pratt when he and the Prophet Joseph Smith were together in a prison in Richmond, Missouri. The situation was much different, but the same witness of true dignity and majesty was enjoyed. (See Parley P. Pratt, Jr., ed., <span class="emphasis">The Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1938, pp. 193–200, 210–215, 230–240.) I, too, saw true majesty when a prison visitor performed and spoke under God’s authority and shared himself fearlessly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p14" pid="0muiVc1AnUidNOz4-kp1nA" hash="P_xjpg">Before we drove away from the prison compound, President Kimball viewed the maximum security area. When he looked at the extra fences, towers, guards, and isolated location, he commented on how unfortunate it is when men can’t be given freedom, responsibilities, and the joys of work. “All men are basically good. Some just lose their way and need to be led back into proper paths and habits,” he said.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p15" pid="jEJNgx5uy0KC84QRwsy5qw" hash="JfdGDQ">President Kimball asked the warden how the Church’s family home evening program was doing at the prison. (President Kimball had been instrumental in its implementation years ago.) When told it was most successful, he was very pleased. The warden informed him that each week dozens of families continue to go to the prison on Monday evenings to provide family experiences for those qualified to be involved. These good people serve as families for inmates who don’t have them. Their relationship, which very often goes on after prisoners are released, provides an excellent anchor in rehabilitation. The strength of the family is available on a regular basis. President Kimball has long been a believer that every person is entitled to family relationships, and when told that some inmates have their first real family experiences through this program, he was delighted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p16" pid="MBLzPO1EfUaVbHNmrKJtCw" hash="eV2Amw">During the tour of the new chapel and the walk between the buildings, there were always a number of young and old nearby to assist and respond to President Kimball’s questions. After hearing President Kimball refer to me a number of times as “Marv” as we walked together, one of the younger set was impressed to say, “Isn’t it kind of neat to have President Kimball call you ‘Marv’?” I responded with, “Yes, it is, and it is especially neat to know that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God.” I had again seen him in action.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p17" pid="fxei7aoxykOfY_F_KO2MdQ" hash="7_rf7w">In the car returning to Salt Lake City, President Kimball thanked us time and again for taking him to the prison. He felt good about the response of those with whom he had associated. “I hope you will make it possible for me to go back again,” he suggested. “Those people need our love and constant encouragement.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-prophet-and-the-prison.p18" pid="v_HKOlrm0kiGHs3_qlWiAg" hash="LhApNA">What can we as priesthood members and leaders learn from President Kimball’s trip to the prison? Much, I hope. Could I just quickly mention ten major points I observed? I think they can help us all be and do better if we will but follow his example.</p>

          <p pid="-LAUPHHilUGVr0H6SBF6nQ" hash="W-gK5w">“And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.” In this case perhaps we are within our rights to paraphrase this quotation a little and say, “After a few minutes they found him in the prison, sitting in the midst of the prisoners, both hearing them and asking them questions.</p>

One prisoner who stood by his side for the picture is serving time for theft and burglary; the other is there for manslaughter. One was a member, one a nonmember. His greetings to them, “It is an honor for me to have my picture taken with you,” continues to ring in my ears. “I was in prison, and ye came unto me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.36" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:36</a>).

How we prepare for it, how we meet it, makes the difference. We can be broken by adversity, or we can become stronger. The final result is up to the individual.

I was excited to attend a seminar that morning. It was an agricultural seminar at the Brigham Young University, where I had been attending school. I had been home from my Honolulu Hawaii Mission six months and was going through all the adjustments of a returned missionary. The challenge of family, girls, school, and the fact that there were twenty-five thousand other students who were bright and aggressive—some with plenty of money; others, like myself, who were pinching every nickel—didn’t make things easier.</p>

We made seals for hydraulic equipment. Following the seminar that morning, I went to work. Kimball, my roommate and former missionary companion who had gone to work earlier that morning, instructed me in how to make a new seal. After approximately twenty minutes, one of the smallest seals stuck on the face of the plate. I struggled to get it off with my left hand. As I turned back to give it my full attention and use my right hand, the machine closed on my left hand, causing a horrible noise as it crushed my hand just below the wrist. After what seemed an eternity, the huge press finally opened. My first thought when looking at my hand was ‘What a mess!’ Then that inner voice which I had come to know, love, and appreciate, whispered, ‘Jerry, you won’t have your hand.’</p>

He faced physical, emotional, and spiritual trial upon trial. How I marveled at his well-won victories. At this difficult time I promised the Lord I would try to accept all of my challenges as the Prophet Joseph Smith had accepted his.</p>

Was it something in my past? What have I done to deserve this?’ Then I thought, ‘No more rodeo, football, or skiing,’ and I wondered what type of a woman would want a one-handed husband. I hadn’t developed a good self-image or a great deal of self-esteem, so these thoughts magnified my concerns.</p>

So many questions were answered during his blessing. He told me this accident was not punishment for anything I had done but, rather, an opportunity to help me become a better person and to amplify those particular traits which needed to be developed. He shared the thought that this challenge could make me more understanding of people, problems, and life.

When I awoke the day following the operation in the hospital, she was there with other friends. I asked everyone else to leave the room, and I then proceeded to give her what I thought was the perfect speech. I told her that they had to take my hand off. If she felt embarrassed or ashamed to be with me or be seen with me on future dates, she need not feel obligated to continue in any future courtship. At that moment I could see fire in her eyes. She let me know in no uncertain terms that she was not there out of pity or duty, but only because she cared for me. She indicated she would help me but never feel sorry for me. Six months later we were married in the Salt Lake Temple.</p>

There is an important step beyond avoiding contention and strife; and that is to live with dignity. There is something sacred about living with dignity. We need not quarrel or compete with those who promote and encourage controversy. We need not spend our time in retaliation. They who would deceive, destroy, or belittle reap their own rewards. Their works are neither praiseworthy nor of good report. How disarming it must be to the enemies to see the valiant moving forward with poise and dignity under all challenging circumstances. Scorn and ridicule are two of the greatest forms of adversity we are required to face in today’s world. Doing the will of God on a daily basis leaves no time for contention or confrontation.</p>

Irritations get into his shell. He does not like them. But when he cannot get rid of them, he uses the irritation to do the loveliest thing an oyster ever has a chance to do. If there are irritations in our lives today, there is only one prescription: make a pearl. It may have to be a pearl of patience, but, anyhow, make a pearl. And it takes faith and love to do it.” (In <span class="emphasis">The Treasure Chest,</span> ed. Charles L. Wallis, New York: Harper &amp; Row).</p>

Our driver, who had been on duty since 3:00 <small>A.M.</small>, was anxious to talk with us, his first passengers of the day. We learned his parents were born just outside of Mexico City. They moved to Chicago, where he was born, and then moved to New Mexico. Twenty years earlier our friend had come for a short visit to San Francisco and had never left. During our trip to the airport, this man related a few incidents from which some great truths were reemphasized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p2" pid="5TAh7fZBmkGEEU0GtAsC4A" hash="dYBDbg">His parents, he told us, had remained in New Mexico, but liked to visit him and his brother whenever they could afford it because they loved being with their children and grandchildren. In New Mexico his mother’s health was rather poor, but whenever she was in San Francisco, she seemed to feel much better. This discerning son had said to his brother, “I know just exactly what mother needs.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p3" pid="W24NngHfXkSo0tJPirnwCQ" hash="MDbxzg">He said, “I found a large truck. My brother and I drove to New Mexico, loaded our parents and all their possessions into the truck, and brought them to live near those who loved them most. Mother’s health improved noticeably.” Then he added, “You know, love is very important if it is done right.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p4" pid="c4ezJktXHkim7nrb5IaMpQ" hash="jbVQOA">The second incident related by this humble but wise man was also significant. He said, “I teach all my children to work. I want them to have schooling, but they must learn to work to get it. I just finished helping my sixteen-year-old son get a part-time job at a bank. While he is going to school, he only works two hours a day, but he is learning to work. He knows I love him because I do my part, too. Due to the uncertainty of my driving hours, I can’t always take him to work, but I’m always there to bring him home. He looks forward to our ride together, and so do I.”</p>

He told us that some of his unmarried friends who are also taxi drivers are often out of money. They come to him to borrow. He indicated that he is generally able to help them over tight money spots. When his companions asked how he is able to support his family on his salary when they can’t even keep themselves, he said, “I tell them I don’t waste money at the races or on liquor or tobacco. My wife fixes our meals at home, and we don’t have to pay for expensive restaurant food.” He smiled when he added, “We do our partying with our family.” This man’s objectives are family-oriented, and he has learned the folly of serving the gambling, drinking, and momentary expensive habits.</p>

He knows that nurturing love is healing; it is teaching. It requires sacrifice, and that which we love will be that to which we give our allegiance. He had shared some basic principles of love in action that were potent. Frankly, we were enjoying his comments so much we could have wished the airport terminal were another half an hour away.</p>

We, too, must choose carefully the areas in which we serve, because where we serve, there will be our love. During our lifetime, areas of love must be put in proper perspective.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p8" pid="V0o39ANLM0Kap0HHXq8HLg" hash="_-Vhuw">In childhood we anxiously strive to ride that bicycle, to skate, to ski, to learn the laws of balance. Then our love of wheels and speed and balance may become one of the joys of life. As we mature and serve and sacrifice for other interests, new loves develop. A farmer grows to love his land; a scholar his books; a businessman his company. We have all witnessed the love of parents for their children, the love of a bishop for members of his ward, the love of a young man for his new car, the love an engaged young lady has for a ring just received from someone very special.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p9" pid="aePq74BY7kmgdvmGdWZiSQ" hash="TrgRSg">Equally apparent in the world today is the love of that which is evil. We may jeopardize our future by loving and sacrificing for that which is not conducive to our health or our progress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p10" pid="dpqLdoHplkqrUkz8eqomew" hash="VYu4qg">Many today are caught up in their love for worldly goods which they think will bring them fame, fortune, and popularity. They, too, reap the rewards of loving incorrectly. In these cases also, that which they serve they will learn to love. What we learn to love can make or break our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p11" pid="CRYUU3dlmEKqhHJkLu7nLw" hash="YcgF0A">Love of money, drugs, and alcohol can turn men into thieves, murderers, and derelicts. First they love the effects of those evil things; then they sacrifice all—life, health, and liberty—for that which they thought were treasures. Love of the sensual, drugs, and lies grows as we serve in these appealing areas offered by Satan. Love bonds become strong and intense in proportion to our continuing service. A man who learns to love a lie serves dishonesty all his life. In fact, a drug addict can usually be cured more quickly than a liar.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p12" pid="8YmfQq4UwkeRGGDYqA_4xQ" hash="VV0-CQ">One of the greatest accomplishments of Satan in these last days is his success in turning men’s affection towards the destructive, the fleeting, or the worldly. Rather than planning for that which is best for all, the world is becoming increasingly “me-centered.” On every hand we have many group leaders saying, “We have a right.” “We demand.” Many young people believe that love has “rights” one can demand of a loved one. For example, a young man often says, “If you love me, you will let me …” He would take what he supposes are his rights rather than serving the higher standards of morality. Such a request does not bespeak love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p13" pid="ZjcSzHtbokqltLJunDq4qw" hash="AR4Ssg">Day-to-day acts of service, whether for good or evil, may not seem important, but they are building cords of love that become so strong they can seldom be broken. Ours is to place our areas of love in proper perspective. Meaningful love always works for our eternal progress and not against it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p14" pid="TO7Re4LKE0-SkABjQwrTjQ" hash="REYDOg">One who loves has and feels responsibility. Paul in 1 Corinthians says love thinketh no evil, is not self-seeking, is long-suffering, and is kind. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.4-5" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13:4–5</a>.) If we look at love between two who are preparing for temple marriage, we see the elements of sacrifice and of serving each other’s best interests, not a shortsighted “me” interest. True love and happiness in courtship and marriage are based upon honesty, self-respect, sacrifice, consideration, courtesy, kindness, and placing “we” ahead of “me.” Those who would have us forfeit virtue and chastity to prove our love in sexual participation out of wedlock are neither friends nor eternally family-oriented. To classify them as selfish and unwise is not too severe. Those who serve the flesh will never know the love and fruits of purity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p15" pid="DlTmlIEYuE6D3lgvRh9WYA" hash="O86tVQ">A new convert to the Church recently shared this story. “I was in and out of enforced confinement most of my teen years. It wasn’t so bad being there because the food was pretty good, and we were treated all right. But it did get boring, so when anyone had any reading material, funny books, magazines, or anything, we would trade our food for a chance to borrow those items. One day I saw a fellow with a nice, thick book. I knew it would take a long time to read, so I offered him my pork chops, my potatoes, and all my main course food items for a week. He accepted my offer and loaned me the book. As I read it, I knew I was reading something very special and very true. The book for which I had sacrificed my food was titled the Book of Mormon. When I had a chance, I found the missionaries, changed my habits, and am now finding a new way of life. I love that book for which I traded my food.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/we-serve-that-which-we-love.p16" pid="7y6Poyr0EkCoIIvmVFPnYw" hash="B8xsrw">Here was an unusual but worthwhile sacrifice with rewarding results. This convert indicated that the more time he spends with this book, the greater his love becomes for the truths he is finding between its covers.</p>

Think back about the practical sermon of our taxi driver. “I teach my children to work, but I let them know I care. I do my part, too.” Giving our time, the listening ear, the understanding heart, and the unconditional love, even opening doors of opportunity at times are some ways to serve those we love. But if we deprive family members of opportunities to learn to work, if we teach them to avoid or escape the responsibilities for their own actions, if we use them to further our own ambitions, then we do not serve them well or love them prudently.</p>

As he is encouraged to give time and sacrifice to develop his talents—whether they be academic, music, drama, sports, leadership, or whatever—he will develop a love for that which brings him success. Children will love those talents or possessions to which we encourage them to give time and effort.</p>

The purchase of a larger house or a nicer car or a more expensive boat may cause us to sacrifice our resources and develop an unwise love for these symbols of success and pleasure. We learn to love that which we serve, and we serve that which we love.</p>

We must examine our lives, see what services we are rendering and what sacrifices are being made, and then stop the expenditure of time and effort in these directions. If this can be managed, then that love will wither and die. Our love should be channeled into sources that are eternally oriented. Our neighbors and families will respond to our love if we will but follow through with sustaining support and self-sharing. True love is as eternal as life itself. Some callings and assignments in the Church may seem insignificant and unimportant at the time, but with each willingly fulfilled assignment, love of the Lord will grow. We learn to love God as we serve and know Him.</p>

By finding ways for him to serve and sacrifice. We must constantly emphasize the truth that we love that to which we give time, whether it be the gospel, God, or gold. Often we hear expressions of love for the scriptures, including Jesus’ teachings. Those who study, practice, and apply the truths not only know them best, but are fortified to use them for guidance all along life’s paths. The man who most appreciated the opportunity of tithe payment is he who experiences the joys and blessings that come through sacrifice, and obedience to that law. Our appreciation and love of the gospel and its teachings will always be in proportion to our service and commitment to the gospel.</p>

By the greatest of all acts of love and by this supreme sacrifice, God set the pattern. He demonstrated to us that His love was unconditional and sufficient to encircle every person.</p>

We recall the situation when the scribes and Pharisees brought before the Savior a woman taken in adultery. Their purpose was not to show love for either the woman or the Savior, but to embarrass and trick Jesus. They quoted the Law of Moses which said, “Such should be stoned,” and asked of the Master, “What sayest thou?” The accusers walked away one by one when Jesus encouraged the one without sin to cast the first stone. We recall that Jesus asked of the woman, “Where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?” She answered “No man, Lord.” And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.1-11" class="scriptureRef">John 8:1–11</a>.)</p>

It showed a bright-eyed boy with unkempt hair and folded arms, deep in thought.

To be truly effective, welfare services must be concerned with the betterment of the total individual. A person’s image of himself is nothing more or less than what he has learned through his experiences and his interactions with others. It is rewarding to note that someone has helped a typical boy develop his personal identity. Someone, perhaps a mother, a Primary teacher, a neighbor, or even a song like “I Am a Child of God,” has made this little boy realize he is someone. He knew he wasn’t junk. He knew he wasn’t impossible. He knew he was a human being loved by his Heavenly Father.</p>

Welfare services offers us the opportunity to serve and learn on a continuing basis. Through it we can learn the lessons of never giving up on ourselves or others, or never being defeated by our situations.</p>

As I held my hand out and greeted the boy, I became aware that perhaps the only meaningful thing this child could do was carry the teacher’s books to class. What did this empathetic teacher have the boy doing? Carrying the books. Thank God for leaders who know how to teach self-reliance on a level commensurate with the capabilities of those they lead.</p>

Our Savior said it this way, “As my Father hath sent me, even so I send you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.21" class="scriptureRef">John 20:21</a>.) Each one has something special to live for. Some can find their special niche by themselves, but many need added help. All of us are a part of this inspired welfare activity as we assist each other in fulfilling our purposes here on earth.</p>

Through trying times we would do well to remember and repeat the famous words of Sir Winston Churchill, England’s Lion of Courage, during some of his country’s darkest days. With character and strength peculiar to himself, he said, “Never give in, never give in, <span class="emphasis">never, never, never, never.</span>” (Robert Rhodes James, ed., <span class="emphasis">Winston S. Churchill: His Complete Speeches, 1897–1963,</span> 8 vols., New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1974, 6:6,499.)

To them we would declare it is easier for some skeptics to give up than to learn. It is no doubt easier to be a critic than a servant. In the uncertain days of the present and of the future, Welfare Services will remain a beacon for the world to see. Its very foundation continues to be built on the rock of helping people to help themselves. Properly implemented, most human needs can be met through this important program of the Church.</p>

We must have this belief and trust if we are to properly involve ourselves. Besides materials, commodities, money, supplies, labor, and skills, there must be faith—faith to help, lead, and obey in God’s way. For guidance and strength may we refer to that great, oft-repeated scripture found in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 104, verses 14 and 16: “I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine.</p>

The Lord’s way always involves the individual, the family, and the Church working together. A close tie between welfare services and the home is a necessity. Human understanding, wise preparation, and guidance through prayer are essential ingredients. For order and effectiveness, all action should be taken through proper channels.</p>

Can you consider your own options for self-help as problems arise? Or do you toss your arms in the air and say, “Oh, no!” or “Why me?” Can you quietly sit down, review the facts, and list all the possible courses of action? Can you identify causes and determine remedies? Quiet contemplation can solve problems more quickly than frantic force.</p>

Furthermore, a man not only has the responsibility to care for himself; he also has the responsibility to care for his family.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>May 1981, p. 88.)

By working as a team, they may see problems from different points of view. When family councils can be held without destructive arguments, new and better solutions to challenging situations may become evident. Pooling of efforts and resources gives family members a chance to reap the rewards of confidence and security as they help each other solve problems and make progress toward self-reliance and accountability.</p>

What a comfort it is to know such resources are available when the needs cannot be met by the individual or his family. Here, too, action is to be taken through proper channels which are well defined. Emotion or panic do not determine the path to follow. All things are to be done in the Lord’s own way as specified by our modern-day prophets.</p>

Debt in itself is neither good nor bad. It is a financial tool with the potential of being either. Debt in business may be used to increase productivity or aid in expansion. However, most individuals in debt are usually average people, but they are temporarily out of financial control. They are the victims of poor monetary habits and often have no idea of the importance of proper money management. They misuse credit, especially credit cards, and don’t live within budgets or wise operational guidelines. For many of us, credit is like a magic carpet on which we can fly to places we couldn’t ordinarily get to. We ride free at first, but forget that a little later we will have to pay for the magic carpet. Bondage-producing interest rates added to the original amount will turn out to be staggering.</p>

This requires gaining the confidence of the person; listening with eyes, ears, and heart; trying to comprehend how this person feels; and then letting him know by your personal performance that you really understand. One who really understands and practices empathy doesn’t solve another’s problems, doesn’t argue, doesn’t top his story, make accusations, or take away free agency. He merely helps the person build his self-reliance and self-image so he can try to find his own solutions.</p>

Some of His sheep are young, lonely, and lost. Some are weary, afflicted, and worn with age. Some are in our own family, in our own neighborhood, or in the far corners of the world where we can help with fast offerings. Some are starving for food. Some are starving for love and concern.</p>

No one can teach or help with sarcasm or ridicule. Dictatorship or “I’m right and you are wrong” will negate all efforts to feed a wandering sheep. A wall of resistance will be built, and no one will benefit.</p>

May we also bear in mind that we never give one of God’s children a lift when we give him a free ride. Every person in the Church should possess a self-sustaining spirit of independence that insists he work for what he receives. The best foods with which to feed His sheep are charity and the restoration of dignity.</p>

Expressions of affection are empty if actions don’t match.

Many are looking for ways to show sincere gratitude to him for his service and selfless love. From a priceless, intimate association with President Kimball, I think I can give you some guidelines. Learn to love, unconditionally, all of God’s children, regardless of race, creed, or color, and try to serve as he serves. This principle is the foundation of Welfare Services. Each of us could do well to remember Doctrine and Covenants 50:26<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:26</a>: “He that is ordained of God and sent forth, the same is appointed to be the greatest, notwithstanding he is the least and the servant of all.”</p>

His principles are consistent and never changing. Practices may be altered as situations warrant, but the Lord’s principles are ever stable. The success of welfare services depends on obedience to the basic gospel laws upon which it is built. There is room for innovation and use of free agency when we look for wise ways to serve as long as we stay within the framework of the gospel.</p>

Yet 50 years later some former students recall with lasting appreciation the words one teacher had her class repeat at the beginning of each day. Every school morning this rather unpretentious, plain, wise lady implanted the meaning of honesty into our minds by having us recite “A lie is <span class="emphasis">any</span> communication given to another with the intent to deceive.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p2" pid="x491fkD3p0y8PHTp33cgCg" hash="MFMbag">When I compare this definition with that found in the dictionary, which states, “A lie is an untrue statement made with the intent of deceiving,” I greatly appreciate her definition. A lie can be effectively communicated without words ever being spoken. Sometimes a nod of the head or silence can deceive. Recommending a questionable business investment, making a false entry in a ledger, devious use of flattery, or failure to divulge all pertinent facts are a few other ways to communicate the lie.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p3" pid="SBJ_8tzloUy5xjThXClIzg" hash="Vft_8Q">After having us go through this daily ritual, this wonderful lady, who never married but who had such a motherly influence over many of us, would teach with few words the importance of communicating truth under all circumstances. Often she simply said, “Don’t tell lies. Don’t share lies. Don’t participate in lies.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p4" pid="s4xZHiAJXEib3HeK9hFJhQ" hash="EyHfOA">How serious is lying? We have a clue when we read all through the scriptures that Satan is the father of lies. His method of teaching this evil practice is illustrated in the tenth section of the Doctrine and Covenants: “Yea, he [Satan] saith unto them: Deceive and lie … ; behold, this is no harm. And thus he … telleth them that it is no sin to lie. … And thus he … causeth them to catch themselves in their own snare.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.25-26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 10:25–26</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p5" pid="gagosz-lpkWsy1RvV-NE0A" hash="X7cbfA">Yet we can’t hide behind the father of lies and say, “Satan made me do it.” All he does is tell us, “This is no harm,” and then he lets us catch ourselves in our own snare.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p6" pid="RdhM7j-7BEmkoJ1YYOe3VA" hash="IvFopQ">It is a sin to lie. It is a tragedy to be the victim of lies. Being trapped in the snares of dishonesty and misrepresentation does not happen instantaneously. One little lie or dishonest act leads to another until the perpetrator is caught in the web of deceit. As Samuel Johnson wrote, “The chains of habit are generally too small to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.” (<span class="emphasis">The International Dictionary of Thoughts,</span> comp. John P. Bradley, Leo F. Daniels, Thomas C. Jones, Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969, p. 348.) Those who become victims of this entrapment often struggle through life bearing their heavy burden because they are unwilling to acknowledge their problem and make the effort to change. Many are unwilling to pay the price to be free from the chains of lies. Some individuals may be very aware of the value of honesty and yet be unable to come up with the down payment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p7" pid="KCwEjASl4kO0_fZintCy8w" hash="ojVlsA">Perhaps if we analyze some of the reasons people lie, we can avoid or overcome this vicious snare.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p8" pid="hE3c16NRWUC-B3qGBkQPPg" hash="28ioQQ">Sometimes we deceive and lie to avoid personal embarrassment. I recently heard of a young woman who had been released from her employment because of dishonesty. When she applied for another job, she told the prospective employer that her former boss had a family member he wanted to put in her place. She probably told her friends and family members the same story to avoid mortification.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p9" pid="6kPhNqtVX06tzWjXFayBzA" hash="YeDE_A">Financial setbacks may be explained to others with untruths. Or have you ever heard someone say, “I was just too busy to get the job done,” when, in truth, he had forgotten? Others use dishonesty to delay, to gain advantage, to impress, to flatter, or to destroy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p10" pid="JMbe7VF90UGI2yXBxoUwYw" hash="JAZFGQ">Consciously or unconsciously some people lie to destroy others. Jealousy or feelings of inferiority may cause us to degrade another’s habits or character. Have you watched an overly ambitious person turn on false flattery for his own gain?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p11" pid="jLj9koPpxUKcq_39PfyKHQ" hash="2eWtIQ">Lies are often excuses for lack of courage. Sometimes lies are nothing more than excuses for poor performance. Usually one lie or deception has to be covered by another. Lies cannot stand alone. Each one must continually be supported by more and more of its own kind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p12" pid="SFd2tdxjEk2waHcnOEBLtA" hash="xUrZuA">There are some who would have us believe there is no right or wrong—that everything is relative. We must never allow ourselves to think proper conduct and decision making are found in a convenient path somewhere between right and wrong.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p13" pid="lpx5upehyEiQSCsnOd622w" hash="4nE5hg">In today’s world, where deceitfulness is so widely practiced in advertising, promoting, and marketing, a worthy prayer could well be, “Help me, O Lord, to be free not only of personal deceit, but grant me also the wisdom to avoid those who would damage me or mine through devious means.”</p>

Greed can make a person both dishonest and gullible. Such are spoken of in Doctrine and Covenants 68:31–32: “Their eyes are full of greediness. These things ought not to be, and must be done away from among them.” [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.31-32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:31–32</a>] Good advice for those who would avoid deceitful propositions is found in Doctrine and Covenants 9:13: “Be faithful, and yield to no temptation.” [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 9:13</a>]</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p16" pid="0huNjxVniECXbjqJcY0jbQ" hash="m_4Zpw">A friend recently confided that he had lost heavily in a get-rich-quick scheme because he couldn’t turn off his greed valve. Wanting more and more—living beyond one’s income—makes many of us susceptible to the dishonest promoter. The plan that offers exorbitant rewards or gives you and only you a once-in-a-lifetime deal is to be avoided.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p17" pid="RYHFLDpcLE2LYD6gRqQn7Q" hash="YUd8lw">Use of important, well-recognized names or undue reference to special community or religious affiliations are often used to gain confidence and open the door to sales deceptions.</p>

All worthwhile investment opportunities can bear deliberation and scrutiny. We must get all the available facts and consider them well, and then make decisions that are in the best interest of all. When marginal cases and situations arise, personal integrity must be an important element in any decision. When right actions are not clearly evident, personal honesty will lead us to discern and reveal relevant points or facts of which others may not be aware. A person of integrity will assist others to be honest. A person of integrity will ask questions and give answers that are accurate. Integrity makes it possible for us to chart a course of righteous personal conduct long before the time for action arrives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p19" pid="A_FPh_RlqEqgmlsXnmM7Cg" hash="h16iFw">A wise person will not allow himself to be victimized by the unscrupulous because of false pride. Oftentimes people are swindled because false pride prevents them from asking questions and seeking additional information. For fear of embarrassment or being thought ignorant, a prospect ofttimes nods his head in the affirmative when he really doesn’t understand the glib salesman’s line of chatter. “What does that mean?” “What are the risks?” “What are the pitfalls?” “What is the history of the company?” “What references do you have?” are questions worthy of pursuit. When promoters carelessly use simple but elusive words such as “hedge,” “shelter,” “exempt,” “annuity,” “umbrella,” “tax free,” “insulated,” and “deferrable,” the buyer had better be aware.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/this-is-no-harm.p20" pid="i2gv9rmtSEmD96XCW37Bcg" hash="6skUiw">If prudent decisions cannot be reached on the basis of one’s own expertise, advice should be sought from knowledgeable and trusted counselors.

In times of recession or depression, unwise debt is encouraged by promoters who would give us the opportunity to supplement our inadequate means. During periods of prosperity and plenty, some try to convince us that then is the time to borrow, speculate, and move up to higher levels of living by riding the waves of a guaranteed prosperous tomorrow. How often do we hear, “I would have made it big if the economy had not slowed down”? History should have taught all of us that there is enough risk and uncertainty in normal or conservative investments to cause the cautious to rebel at the exorbitant returns offered by those who would have us “bet on the come.”</p>

We encourage all to avoid going into debt for speculation purposes. “The love of money is the root of all evil.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/6.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 6:10</a>.) A proper balance in our money management skills should be the continuing goal of all who would be free of financial bondage.</p>

Lying has filled this friend’s life full of trouble. No one will ever convince this victim of deceit that “this is no harm.”</p>

He who tells the lie must live with the results. Deacons and Beehive girls should be taught the evils of deceit. Teachers and Mia Maids should be taught the importance of truth. Priests and Laurels should be taught the pitfalls that accompany dishonesty. Missionaries, to be successful and happy, must live by correct principles. Primary children can learn that telling lies is not good. Children in the home are entitled to see honesty taught by example. Unfortunate is the individual or family who is taught that honesty is a policy rather than the proper way of life.</p>

No man will ever be totally free who is living a lie. Only he who bears or who has borne such a continuing burden can relate appropriately to such a declaration. We should ever bear in mind that a wrong isn’t right just because many people do it. A wrong deed isn’t right just because it hasn’t become visible.</p>

In the academic classroom and in the classroom of life, the virtues of honesty should be stressed by all who espouse that “the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:36</a>.)

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p5" pid="ByQAIzP7I0ewP7N209plkA" hash="IN2OHQ">As I continued my walk to the visitors’ center, I began to ponder the actions of those persons who are giving time and money to discredit, embarrass, ridicule, and shame those who have religious views that differ from their own. Sometimes such actions can unify and strengthen those who are attacked. However, in some few instances they plant seeds of discord, and at times righteous people are hurt by their slander.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p6" pid="2_aVFIX5KUere_rBvvwcYw" hash="yax23A">I doubt that such actions can be called Christlike. At no time did Jesus Christ encourage us to spend time participating in damaging, destructive criticism. His message was to encourage us to seek, learn, and share all that is praiseworthy and of value as we associate with our fellowmen. Only those who are vindictive and cantankerous participate in ferreting out and advertising the negative and unsavory.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p7" pid="F8P9xtYsGky4boR23UVtHQ" hash="68ZhGQ">I will be forever grateful for the wise counsel my mission president gave me as I arrived in England to serve as a missionary. He said, “Elder Ashton, these people in this land have been at it a long time. If you will keep your eyes, ears, and mind open, you can learn much while you are here. Look for the good and overlook that which is different from your ways.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p8" pid="I4WXR2m3gEavtBFPC24aOA" hash="wcw74w">The longer I stayed in England, the more I appreciated his advice. Day by day I grew to love and appreciate that great country and its people. For example, instead of freezing in the raw winter weather, I did as the English did—I put on another sweater rather than wasting time murmuring and complaining.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p9" pid="lFSNVMGP5UaJ2eGVjRp0-w" hash="bFg9RQ">Robert West wrote, “Nothing is easier than fault-finding; no talent, no self-denial, no brains … are required to set up in the grumbling business.” (<span class="emphasis">Richard L. Evans’ Quote Book,</span> Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1971, p. 221.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p10" pid="L_Kmu2DfMkWHJxKxTN9K6g" hash="rbwyzA">Whether accusations, innuendos, aspersions, or falsehoods are whispered or blatantly shouted, the gospel of Jesus Christ reminds us that we are not to retaliate nor contend. “Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p11" pid="9JzRiUGkXkGmgYh7oqueiQ" hash="ghC-oQ">“For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness to God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.19-20" class="scriptureRef">James 1:19–20</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p12" pid="FWm8OkyhYUeXvYFytDV1UA" hash="mqHMvA">No religion, group, or individual can prosper over an extended period of time with fault-finding as their foundation. To the world, and especially to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we declare there is no time for contention. “If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.26" class="scriptureRef">James 1:26</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p13" pid="f12Kqj-CpU6WpDS-b5pwQg" hash="v3kcAg">The poet Robert Frost once defined education as “the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence.” Probably we will never be free of those who are openly anti-Mormon. Therefore, we encourage all our members to refuse to become anti-anti-Mormon. In the wise words of old, can we “live and let live”? (Johann Schiller, in <span class="emphasis">The Home Book of Quotations,</span> New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1935, p. 1119.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p14" pid="pQKprTvcaEio5lg_XyRK7A" hash="xtnkng">Certainly one of our God-given privileges is the right to choose what our attitude will be in any given set of circumstances. We can let the events that surround us determine our actions—or we can personally take charge and rule our lives, using as guidelines the principles of pure religion. Pure religion is learning the gospel of Jesus Christ and then putting it into action. Nothing will ever be of real benefit to us until it is incorporated into our own lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p15" pid="GPT9EWZyrUmzfA01N4QZag" hash="QRsAzA">It seems to me there has never been a period in history when it has been more important for us to be engaged in pure religion as taught by the Savior. This religion is not to retaliate, or to exchange in kind, evil actions or unkind statements. Pure religion encompasses the ability to cherish, to build up, and to turn the other cheek in place of destroying and tearing down. Blessed are they who strive to serve Him without wasting time faulting Him or those who serve Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p16" pid="0cH_G_7_dEufHX_nOmss5g" hash="Z4rVTg">The discerning realize that it is not realistic to expect perfection in others when none of us is perfect.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p20" pid="GJ53v-TKDESpxfbF7l_mTA" hash="wPshvA">Meaningful progress can be made only when all of us can cast the motes out of our own eyes, leave judgment to our Father in Heaven, and lose ourselves in righteous living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p21" pid="7qXPp7nGkUCgo0-KH7DjIw" hash="EWGeSg">As we reflect upon actions that do not fit the definition of pure religion, perhaps we should contemplate the nature of this term: “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep … unspotted from the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.27" class="scriptureRef">James 1:27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p22" pid="rOe8EMequ0WtFru6tGL2Nw" hash="4_GbgQ">The words are simple, but a basic formula is revealed—namely, help those who are in need, build your life around the gospel of Jesus Christ, and avoid yielding to worldly temptations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p23" pid="K7TNUXQy80WAvLAH00rZ-g" hash="1u5xNw">As with most simple formulas, all of us must analyze our own lives and use wisdom and free agency as we apply the basic principles. Jesus said, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.21" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:21</a>.) The doing is always more difficult than the knowing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p24" pid="v6p7N-T_ekqUuJKgpveIrA" hash="Pjs-rw">We were visiting some friends this past summer. A very young son with a new tricycle was disturbed because his parents were giving us their attention and all of us were ignoring him. He rode his trike as fast as his little legs could pedal, calling, “Look at me!” The inevitable happened as he looked at us instead of where he was going. He rode directly into a lawn chair. To try to stem the tears and take his mind off the hurt, his mother said, “That naughty chair hurt you. Let’s spank the chair.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p25" pid="bLofBohAcU60Wa8R2tuvwA" hash="dI8fJg">I suppose her response momentarily distracted the boy, but the mother was letting her son blame something else for the accident rather than himself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p26" pid="9Km69Ycsh0eMPwawC4QWAg" hash="t-83vw">How many times do we look for something external on which to place blame for our actions? It hurts to look inward and assume responsibility for our situations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p27" pid="JqjBZ9mVtk-hVcUlnquatA" hash="tM6LpQ">To keep ourselves unspotted from the world requires taking charge of and ruling our lives from within, accepting responsibility for our own actions, and choosing the role of peacemaker rather than retaliator when those around us are critical or spread false propaganda. It includes being aware that God’s work on earth is done by human beings, all of whom have some weaknesses. It encompasses the ability to look for the good accomplished rather than being disillusioned when human failings surface. It includes resisting the urge to proclaim such weaknesses so adamantly that the basic good is overshadowed and testimonies waver.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p28" pid="fjgD47UEbUOuGTLZXFZJZg" hash="GnYnlg">Pure religion is maintaining a balance between sophisticated, intellectual information and the basic “bread and butter” principles of the gospel. Latter-day Saints are encouraged to pursue learning in all areas. However, superior knowledge and academic achievements need to be enhanced by wisdom, good judgment, and spiritual guidance in order to use all that is learned for the benefit of the individual and his fellowman.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p29" pid="pEjWXu89OU-YAbz1q4tFsA" hash="VPQ0PQ">Some think they can learn of God only by appreciating his handiwork. Mountains, streams, flowers, birds, and animals are to be enjoyed and admired; but this is not enough. In the formal Church setting, gospel truths are shared, new concepts are internalized, and new experiences are offered—all of which can result in enriched feelings about oneself and in learning better methods of helping others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p30" pid="RATCeHRiNEW-RlpfJ7FOgw" hash="607fkQ">One who practices pure religion soon discovers it is more rewarding to lift a man up than to hold him down. Happiness is bound up with helpfulness. Those who fail to protect someone’s good name, who take advantage of the innocent or uninformed, who build a fortune by pretending godliness to manipulate others, are missing the joy of practicing pure religion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p31" pid="eD4PPZbA3U6IJzggwRrqMw" hash="hLCAnQ">Many have found joy by extending mercy and tender care to those around them. What a strength it is to witness friends visiting nursing homes to comfort patients who don’t even have the capacity to express appreciation. There are some who would question God’s motives when he allows many to linger in pain and hopeless physical and mental deterioration. While this process is taking place, others teach us by their compassionate service and patience. One who has served in many leadership positions in the Church, even in missions and temples, now without specific assignment, meets each month with those confined in a nursing home and often says, “What satisfaction I get each month as I visit these precious souls.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p32" pid="BHPVdu4rXk-dcjj8sQFyrg" hash="-t_3-g">Pure religion is showing concern and affection for those who, because they have lost their companions, are experiencing feelings of loneliness and neglect. Recently I visited with a bishop who has in his ward more than sixty widows. He beamed, “I love them all!” At least once a week he and his counselors visit them, in addition to the calls made by their home teachers. “They are the joys of our lives,” he repeated. He might have said, “Don’t you think that is more than our share?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p33" pid="QhZcxV_Mc02shoiog3sU3g" hash="FC3PvA">Another worthy practice in pure religion is a daily telephone call to each housebound person in a neighborhood. A loving, older, widowed lady said, “If I telephone each day, it gives them a lift, and if they don’t answer the phone, it lets me know they probably need a personal visit from me. One of these friends could not afford a telephone, so this same sister had a phone installed and took care of the monthly bill.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p34" pid="zunCaLgQiEq2w-hGyKAe_Q" hash="cB3MdA">Pure religion encompasses patience and long-suffering. A father recovering from the wounds of alcoholism has often said, “I am making my way back because my family would not give up on me. Everyone had written me off except my wife and children.” How sweet are those words: “I am making my way back because my family would not give up on me.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p35" pid="6-4DQbeiGkiA0cwR7OVFPg" hash="QFQwmw">Pure religion is practiced when we lift the unfortunate and unusual children. Some of God’s choicest earthly spirits are those without meaningful parental care. Many are given family relationships by foster parents on a part- or full-time basis.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p36" pid="ZcXOvnTqNUu7Yvf4TCx24w" hash="wnmn-w">Pure religion is having the courage to do what is right and let the consequence follow. It is doing the right things for right reasons. To be righteous or serving or loving or obedient to God’s laws just to earn praise or recognition is not pure religion. It is being able to withstand ridicule and even temporary unpopularity with some peer groups when you know who you are and for what goals you are reaching. So many of our young people, and older ones also, have developed just such inner strength. They have a great influence for good on others with whom they associate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p37" pid="yYFpwlBt10yyBw8Wm-m0Sg" hash="2O6p_w">Loving those around us includes being sensitive to feelings of others. As is often done, a conducting officer announced that when the deacons were through passing the sacrament, they were invited to go and sit with their families. One father noticed a boy walk out and sit in the foyer. The next week he invited that deacon to sit with his family rather than go through the embarrassment and loneliness caused by not having his own family in attendance. This parent responded to the need of the boy rather than criticizing the leaders for the policy. The actions of this father can be enlarged on and put into practice by every member.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p38" pid="AG5JeuQ8JEKXEF0r3oKUHA" hash="YUcLNA">The safety and protection of each person, especially children, should be a concern for all of us. We can be instrumental in assisting in the protection of each other by being aware of potential dangers and being willing to do our part to thwart those who would injure, steal, or abuse any person, young or old.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p39" pid="UzkfFzxQ5E--CapVd_MzBA" hash="Hj1tiQ">Another example of pure religion can be practiced in today’s political election processes by those who explain and debate the issues and avoid pettiness and slander. Real political winners are those who would accept defeat rather than participate in character assassination.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p40" pid="Tvfe5cSp20-EIKTq-0oYtg" hash="BvTykA">Examples of pure religion can be found on every hand. At a funeral about a month ago, I learned of a valiant young lady on a mission in a distant land who, after much prayer and many tears, wrote to her dying mom just before the terminal illness took its toll, and told her that even though she would like to be at her bedside, she would follow her mother’s teachings and stay in the mission field to finish her assignment and search out those who wanted to hear the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p41" pid="HK4bODiaWkeXrTNa52M2lw" hash="SST15A">From the simple scripture that defines pure religion come great guidelines. To be unspotted from the world, one must avoid all of Satan’s evil plans for the inhabitants of the world. Retaliation, fault-finding, deceit, pettiness, hypocrisy, judging, and destroying one another do not belong in the definition of pure religion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p42" pid="kHjRsEmzdk-q14URvwazoQ" hash="yNG2JA">Empathy is sincere love for self and our fellowmen. Henry David Thoreau said, “Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other’s eyes for an instant?” If this were possible, I’m sure we could visit and help the widowed and fatherless and all who need our help with the pure love of Christ and thus be responsive to the needs of those around us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/pure-religion.p43" pid="a9Ndsy0mrkGxwa1Z2ZjXPg" hash="W2OsQA">May God help us to learn and live the principles of pure religion. The business of lifting each other is a full-time occupation. Pure religion can never be taught or lived by those who are petty, prejudiced, contentious, or unresponsive to the needs of their fellowmen. Pure religion is following the teachings of our Savior. Jesus Christ does live. This is his Church. To this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

When I asked, “How long has it been since you wrote a letter to your mother?” he said, “Oh, about three or four weeks, I guess.” When I suggested he write her a letter straightway, he responded with, “What does <span class="emphasis">straightway</span> mean?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/straightway.p2" pid="UDYu6Nhh9ky7J8r5kSWWtA" hash="u8a0jg">
        <span class="emphasis">Straightway</span> is a power word. <span class="emphasis">Straightway</span> is an action word. It means immediately, without delay or hesitation. It means at once. Also, it is associated with having no curve or turn—a straight course, track, or path. <span class="emphasis">Procrastination</span> would be the very opposite of <span class="emphasis">straightway.</span> To procrastinate is to put off intentionally and habitually something that should be done. Procrastination is unproductive delay. Someone has wisely said, “Procrastination is a silly thing, it only makes me sorrow; but I can change at any time—I think I will tomorrow!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/straightway.p3" pid="tigv61cyz0eGVVkKYodjoA" hash="Co7OrA">“Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>

How descriptive, how powerful, how rewarding when properly applied in human conduct.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/straightway.p9" pid="xX1IpUPWy0WGj_QfmYIXVQ" hash="bV1wjw">We invite all to serve the Savior and walk in His paths straightway. There is an urgency for all of us who have this knowledge of His divinity to act upon it without hesitation or delay. The time is now.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/straightway.p10" pid="sDm-7SFIckmrhgGZCZdvIQ" hash="F-x_ZA">Joshua reminds us of the importance of making decisions promptly: “Choose you this day whom ye will serve; … but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/24.15" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 24:15</a>.) Not tomorrow, not when we get ready, not when it is convenient—but “this day,” straightway, choose whom you will serve. He who invites us to follow will always be out in front of us with His Spirit and influence setting the pace. He has charted and marked the course, opened the gates, and shown the way. He has invited us to come unto Him, and the best time to enjoy His companionship is straightway. We can best get on the course and stay on the course by doing as Jesus did—make a total commitment to do the will of His Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/straightway.p11" pid="VGVSzn0ML0aiHV6dTIGNyg" hash="1ahgzg">To straightway follow our Savior requires effort on our part. No longer does He personally walk the earth with us, but He has not left us alone. His guidelines and commandments are always with us if we will study the scriptures. We must learn His will before we can do His will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/straightway.p12" pid="rHtNrgHzpk6W0zXc6H1Gaw" hash="WRXJaA">A prerequisite for “doing” is goal setting. Actions are preceded by thoughts and planning. All of us must take charge of our own lives. We must evaluate the choices that are open to us, and then we must act positively on our own decision. An old proverb states, “A journey of one thousand miles begins with the first step.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/straightway.p13" pid="XiH1LmgwjUaryYWWrxlMiw" hash="oW_8IQ">The word <span class="emphasis">straightway</span> suggests the urgency to take that first step toward any worthy goal.</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:7</a>.) To take that first step may require great courage, but somehow possibilities and potential strengths begin to appear once the decision to act positively is made. Unsuspected courage and strength will be given to those who start forward in the right decision.</p>

Strength upon strength was added to him. He grew from the disciple who denied his Master thrice, to the man who could be intimidated by no man. When he and John were set in the midst of “Annas the high priest, … and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kingdom of the high priest” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Acts 4:6</a>), Peter boldly declared that salvation comes because of Christ.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/straightway.p17" pid="ePoM-L6KtE2JreqPC5JT2g" hash="-yFFQg">The high priest could have brought great harm to these brethren, but he only dared to command them “not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</p>

In the face of threats, these Apostles were given added courage: “And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/4.33" class="scriptureRef">Acts 4:33</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/straightway.p19" pid="FK8fut7OM02JRvLbfaHHPw" hash="VvIqFQ">By taking that first step straightway, Peter learned to be a fisher of men. He identified his goals, and as he moved towards them, he grew in strength, power, and conviction.</p>

Then when we have identified our goal, may we have the courage to act upon our decision, confident that added strength and power will be given according to our needs as we follow the Good Shepherd.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/straightway.p21" pid="NNfhMgUGIEiNqDzNZraDZQ" hash="M9puUQ">As we plan to follow the Savior straightway, Satan may try to dissuade us by making the task look impossible, by making us doubt our worthiness or ability. Each is different; each has his own strengths.</p>

Hence, in speaking in terms of their trade, the Savior said, “I will make you fishers of men.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:19</a>.) To the carpenter, He would say, “I will make you builders of men.” To the teachers, “I will make you teachers of men.” No person has all the talents.</p>

William Shakespeare wrote, “Our doubts are traitors, And make us lose the good we oft might win By fearing to attempt.” (<span class="emphasis">Measure for Measure,</span> act 1, sc. 4, lines 77–79.)</p>

Don’t procrastinate action while wishing for missing abilities. To those who are inclined to respond with “Not now” or “Not yet” to the invitation to “come, follow me,” may we suggest, with all the love and sincerity we possess, He wants you. He will welcome you straightway regardless of where you have been, where you are now, who you are, or what talents you possess or lack.</p>

Recently a stake president told me that one of the most sincere thank-yous he had ever received came from a young mother with two children who, under very difficult conditions, was trying diligently to succeed as a single parent. After a lengthy interview, her words of appreciation were simply, “Thank you for listening to me. I think I can face my problems much better now.”</p>

Peace must first come from within. It flows from the individual to the home, to the community, to the nations, and to the world. This peace can only come as we resist the damaging pastime of passing judgment. In the scriptures we are warned to judge not, that we be not judged. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/14.1" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 14:1</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.1" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:1</a>.)

On her stooped shoulders was draped a threadbare shawl. Suddenly she stopped, leaned down, picked up something that sparkled brightly in the sunlight, and put it under her shawl. A policeman observed her actions and hurried over to her. In a very gruff voice he said, “Let me see what you are hiding under your shawl!” The old woman drew out from the folds in the shawl a broken piece of glass, saying, “It is only a sharp piece of broken glass. I picked it up so some barefoot boy might not step on it and cut his foot.”</p>

Therefore, we think we can abdicate our responsibility, and we find ourselves hoping that other people or a change of conditions will solve our difficulties.

Then self-esteem will grow and commitment toward goals of greater magnitude will become possible. The journey of success is long and is dotted with a series of commitments to worthy goals. A person does not become committed to worthwhile goals just by making the declaration or decision. It must be daily progression toward established purposes.</p>

The newly called presidency, one of whom was serving as a bishop at the time, asked if I could interview a prospective bishop so if he were cleared he could be installed the following Sunday after conference.

I just hoped it wouldn’t come too soon.” She continued with, “Even though we are newlyweds [and incidentally, they told me the reason they had waited until their thirties to marry was because they had spent a long time finding each other] if you are impressed to call Randy to be a bishop, he will be a good one, and I will help him.”</p>

The Lord has blessed me with a talent that has helped me through the years to support my family. I earn a living by serving as a dressmaker. I am indeed grateful for my ‘Church family’—members who have inspired me and helped me to accept cheerfully and confidently my single parenthood.”</p>

Rather, each should assess her own situation, her own energy, and her own talents, and then choose the best way to mold her family into a team, a unit that works together and supports each other. Only you and your Father in Heaven know your needs, strengths, and desires. Around this knowledge your personal course must be charted and your choices made.</p>

She is in her mid-thirties and has suffered much heartache in her life. Shortly after she and her husband were married in the temple, he became inactive. This man chose to spend most of his time with male companions. There was no concern for the welfare of his family nor any desire to build a meaningful relationship with his wife. Church activities became nonexistent in his life, and soon he was led down the path of transgression.</p>

It is important for them to never give up, to never cease living. As Sister Carol Clark has so beautifully stated: “The personal challenge is not to wait successfully but to live richly, fully, joyfully. The goal is not to wait for the right person but to <span class="emphasis">be</span> the right person” (<span class="emphasis">A Singular Life: Perspectives for the Single Woman,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974, p. 9.) May I emphasize the word <span class="emphasis">live.</span> Live richly, fully, joyfully. Be excited about your chance to grow and develop your potential. Be excited about life and the opportunities and privileges that the Lord has given you.</p>

The first challenge in life is to learn, accept, and internalize “Who am I?” If this question is researched carefully in the scriptures and in Church teachings, the importance of each and every soul will be verified. A good self-image is one of the most important and necessary steps in facing life. So often we believe about ourselves only the things that others have implanted. There is no woman in or out of the Church who is not a loved child of God—no one!</p>

Because the child had transgressed, they were adamant in their feelings that God was displeased with them. Their attitude reflected bitterness and loss of self-respect. Momentarily they were letting themselves be consumed and destroyed by the trying circumstances.</p>

This scripture does not tell us how or when this commitment will be effective or realized, but His promise is real and binding. Our challenge is to endure.

In our race for eternal life, pain and obstacles will confront all of us. We may experience heartaches, sorrow, death, sins, weakness, disasters, physical illness, pain, mental anguish, unjust criticism, loneliness, or rejection. How we handle these challenges determines whether they become stumbling stones or building blocks. To the valiant these challenges make progress and development possible.</p>

She is in the process of looking for a job. One day an interviewer asked her what her goals were—where did she think she would be five years from now? She said to him, “I can’t think that far ahead. For right now I have to just take it one day at a time.” This is what we must do when faced with trials and setbacks in our lives. Enduring well is accomplished by personal discipline hour by hour and day by day, not by public declaration.</p>

I will identify her as Diane because that is her real name. Diane was captain of the University of Utah’s first national women’s championship gymnastics team. In Miami, Florida, for the first-ever American professional tour, she over-rotated on a practice vault, landed on her neck, and damaged her spinal cord. Her slender, delicate body, which had endured hundreds of hours of demanding routines and the accompanying torturous training, was broken. The gal with the dazzling smile who was recognized as the heart of the team was now faced with the challenge of accepting sympathy as her reward or getting on with her life.</p>

But life is not like that. No matter who you are, you will have problems. Tragedy and frustration are the unexpected intruders on life’s plans. Someone has said, “Life is what happens to you while you are making other plans.” It is important that we not look upon our afflictions as a punishment from God. True, our own actions may cause some of our problems, but often there is no evident misconduct that has caused our trials. Just the normal journey through life teaches us that nothing worthwhile comes easy.</p>

How easy it is for some of us to lose our way when the unexpected, and seemingly undeserved, surface in our lives. Greatness is best measured by how well an individual responds to the happenings in life that appear to be totally unfair, unreasonable, and undeserved. Sometimes we are inclined to put up with a situation rather than endure. To endure is to bear up under, to stand firm against, to suffer without yielding, to continue to be, or to exhibit the state or power of lasting.</p>

Kimball was President of the Council of the Twelve. I remember his saying to me, “Marvin, I am Acting President of the Twelve. Harold B. Lee is President of the Twelve. As long as he is serving as a counselor in the First Presidency and is my senior, I am merely Acting President.” He wanted me to understand that. He has always been careful never to assume any role that was not rightfully his. He was indicating also his respect for President Lee and at the same time teaching me. He has always applied Matthew 23:12—“He that shall humble himself shall be exalted.” [<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/23.12" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 23:12</a>]</p>

I want to talk to you.” Of course I waited. When we were alone he said, “I don’t want the First Presidency or the other members of the Twelve to know, but I don’t feel very good today. Will you please give me a blessing?”</p>

I had the responsibility for his safety. I had tried to talk him out of it. But he is a disciple of Christ and holds on to the words of God: “I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: … Naked, and ye clothed me: … I was in prison, and ye came unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.35-36" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:35–36</a>.)</p>

One week I remember among the Twelve we had been almost everywhere around the globe. President Kimball listened to all of us and then gave his report: “I spent Saturday and Sunday visiting the sick and the homebound.” The rest of us who thought we had had a busy and productive weekend realized that a man of God had again taught us a lesson.</p>

Very often the Twelve and the First Presidency pray together. When President Kimball takes his turn to be voice, he generally includes this phrase in his prayers: “Bless our enemies. Help us to understand them, and them to understand us.” He doesn’t ask for vengeance or retaliation, just for understanding so differences can be resolved. Perhaps family differences and neighborhood problems could be resolved if we would follow our prophet’s example and pray for patience and forgiveness.</p>

He knows that guidance and help are available through prayer.</p>

He has already given us more direction than most of us are following. So often we are reminded of the sign on his desk that says, “Do it.” Yet are we doing all we can to live productive, spiritual lives, with love of God and neighbor at the center of our plans and actions? Have we learned the power and the need of unconditional love? He even shows love to his enemies and many become friends. He has no time for envy, hate, ridicule, or evil speaking. Do we?</p>

Each Thursday morning after the Twelve have met for two hours, we are joined by the First Presidency to take care of our joint business. When President Kimball comes into the room on the fourth floor of the temple, one by one we go by and shake his hand.</p>

What else do I need? I can now go into the world and accomplish all of my assignments more effectively when I realize President Kimball trusts me and loves me.</p>

The thing that is important is that he is there. Despite pain, discomfort, and a tired, worn body, he is there. From him we learn what enduring and persistence are all about.</p>

Kimball: “He that is ordained of God and sent forth, the same is appointed to be the greatest, notwithstanding he is the least and the servant of all.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:26</a>.)</p>

To him President Kimball has delegated much responsibility. With wisdom and judgment President Gordon B. Hinckley bears a tremendous load as he carries on the myriad tasks the prophet needs to have completed. Week after week President Hinckley sits at the side of the President in the temple, deferring to him, respecting his wishes, carrying on the daily responsibilities of the First Presidency, never assuming authority or becoming obtrusive. There is a mighty bond between President Kimball, President Romney, and President Hinckley. As they serve together each one teaches us what it means to be united and to be men of God.</p>

Kimball is a prophet, preserved in this day for purposes and occasions such as this. We can reflect, ponder, and be grateful the Lord has given us an extended period in which to enjoy his influence. His life motivates us to set our goals and make our plans to become disciples of Christ such as he. May God help us as priesthood bearers to follow his example, heed his priceless counsel, and share his wisdom and love in our homes, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I share it with you today as I endeavor for a few minutes to direct your thinking toward the important word <span class="emphasis">peace.</span> A beautiful little blind girl was sitting on the lap of her father in a crowded compartment in a train. A friend seated nearby said to the father, “Let me give you a little rest,” and he reached over and took the little girl on his lap.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p2" pid="a0boYCrWLkaEniHc0vLNjw" hash="bheIFA">A few moments later the father said to her, “Do you know who is holding you?”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p4" pid="jQzOpSW-tk-09p9Vo8VIHA" hash="zfsJRQ">Some might be inclined to say, “What a perfect trust this child had in her father.” Others may say, “What a wonderful example of love.” And still others might say, “What an example of faith.” To me it indicates a beautiful blending of all of these principles, which brought a priceless inner peace to the child. She knew she was safe because she knew her father <span class="emphasis">knew</span> who was holding her. Affection, respect, and care over the years had placed in this little girl’s heart a peace that surpasseth all understanding. She was at peace because she knew and trusted her father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p5" pid="p-O9W9NT60GAUWlH2uoJDQ" hash="vev_MQ">We plead for peace in our prayers and thoughts. Where is peace? Can we ever enjoy this great gift while wars, rumors of wars, discord, evil, and contention swirl all around us? The answer is yes. Just as the little blind girl sat on the stranger’s lap with perfect contentment because her father knew him, so we can learn to know our Father and find inner peace as we live his principles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p6" pid="H1F7VGuS7UGeriU7Yu4FRw" hash="FKrrdQ">It is very significant that when Jesus came forth from the tomb and appeared to his disciples, his first greeting was, “Peace be unto you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.36" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:36</a>.) Peace—not passion, not personal possessions, not personal accomplishments nor happiness—is one of the greatest blessings a man can receive. Our trust and our relationship with our Heavenly Father should be one similar to that of the little blind girl and her earthly father. When sorrow, tragedy, and heartbreaks occur in our lives, wouldn’t it be comforting if when the whisperings of God say, “Do you know why this has happened to you?” we could have the peace of mind to answer “No, but you do.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p7" pid="R-0PWSHomEmz_BJwIpl5jw" hash="09tDoA">Certainly peace is the opposite of fear. Peace is a blessing that comes to those who trust in God. It is established through individual righteousness. True personal peace comes about through eternal vigilance and constant righteous efforts. No man can be at peace who is untrue to his better self. No man can have lasting peace who is living a lie. Peace can never come to the transgressor of the law. Commitment to God’s laws is the basis for peace. Peace is something we earn. It is not a gift. Rather, it is a possession earned by those who love God and work to achieve the blessings of peace. It is not a written document. It is something that must come from within.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p8" pid="YmMSJHmZGUGSBMVo7Z-sdA" hash="ophsNQ">The Salt Lake Valley was settled by those who trekked over the plains under extremely difficult conditions so they could worship God in peace. Left behind was Nauvoo, a deserted city desecrated by the uninformed, misinformed, embittered enemies of the Church. Peace had flown from the City Beautiful. What a price some of those who have gone before us have paid for the privilege of worshipping in peace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/peace-a-triumph-of-principles.p9" pid="dvQoQvEvO0OJIcqZmB0cNw" hash="zaZ6Zw">Never will peace and hatred be able to abide in the same soul. Permanent peace will elude those individuals or groups whose objective is to condemn, discredit, rail at, or tear down those whose beliefs are different from their own. These people live by hatred and would destroy others insofar as it is in their power to do so. True Christians have no time for contention. Lasting peace cannot be built while we are reviling or hating others. Those who preach hate, ridicule, and untruths cannot be classified as peacemakers. Until they repent they will reap the harvest to which those engaged in the business of hatred are entitled. Feelings of enmity and malice can never be compatible with feelings of peace.</p>

These are they who are greedy and power hungry. “Be not deceived; God is not mocked: … He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/6.7-8" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 6:7–8</a>.) Inner peace flees from those who sacrifice virtue for sexual promiscuity. There are some who advocate and promote new sexual exploits under the guise of “relief from stress.” These people are only sowing unto the flesh and peddling devilish deeds. Wickedness, no matter how it is labeled or camouflaged, will eventually bring grief and heartache and wipe out inner peace.</p>

Peace must stem from an inward contentment built upon trust, faith, and goodwill toward God, fellowmen, and self. It must be constantly nurtured by the individual who is soundly anchored to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Only then can a person realize that the trials and tribulations of daily life are less important than God’s total goodness.</p>

He is progressing well and delights in showing us what he can do. While he develops these performance skills his body is maturing in limberness and strength. The last time he invited me to feel the muscles in his arms, I congratulated him. I was proud. As he jumped away from me (gymnasts, it seems, are always jumping and springing), I was impressed with the thought that his parents, grandparents, teachers, and others have an obligation to teach him one of life’s great truths. Flabbiness of character should always be more of a concern than flabbiness of muscles. Body building and body conditioning are worthwhile goals, but there is more needed to gain true inner peace. We must blend balance in our lives and increase in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.52" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:52</a>) to reach our full potential.</p>

Those who love their neighbors can bring peace and happiness to many. Love can build bridges to understanding and tear down walls of suspicion and hate. Christlike love can bring peace into any neighborhood. With that kind of love each of us can help resolve petty differences, be they in the home or community.</p>

We cry out today with urgency, “Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon the rulers of our land; may those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.54" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 109:54</a>.) The respected Winston Churchill once said, “The day will come when … victorious nations will plan and build in justice and freedom a house of many mansions, where there will be room for all.”</p>

Thank God for those other nations who teach and live in peace. Thank God for worthy men who work to keep it that way. Our responsibility as a nation and its people is to continue to take the lead in furthering peace on earth and goodwill toward all men. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.14" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:14</a>.) To all mankind worldwide who would anxiously engage themselves in lasting peace, we share: “But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:23</a>.)</p>

The main purpose of schools must always be to develop character, to develop loyalty to the government, loyalty to the home, and loyalty to the individual. This is what real peace is all about—internal and external. No peace, even though temporarily achieved, will be lasting unless it is built upon the solid foundation of such eternal principles as love of God, love of neighbor, love of self. Most men yearn for peace, cry for peace, pray for peace, and work for peace, but there will not be lasting peace until all mankind follow the path pointed out and walked by the living Christ. There can be no peace in sin and disobedience. If I do not have peace within me, others around me will suffer.</p>

Our responsibility as Church members is to instill in an ever-growing number of people the fact that our personal attitudes and behavior can bring a measure of peace to our troubled world and a sense of stability to anxious times. With peace in our hearts we can know that the trends of the world and the criticisms of men cannot alter the truths of God.</p>

With world conditions of riots, protests, arms buildups, wars and rumors of war, mistrust, poverty, disappointments, terrorism, tragedies, etc., there has never been a period in history when there is a greater need to accept another of the Lord’s eternal promises.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p2" pid="APWKb1b_UUmo-aH01Mkrtg" hash="_qlSiw">“Behold, this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p3" pid="EexGsbumHk-XSpsRMpIqiw" hash="PFzprg">“Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.5-6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:5–6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p4" pid="W5Vpo74Y9ESQWMdJplKV-A" hash="WHx8rQ">Good cheer is a state of mind or mood that promotes happiness or joy. Some like to think good cheer is found in a bottle, a six-pack, an injection, a pinch under the lip, rationalization, or self-deceit. Incidentally, it has been my observation over the years that those who try to drown their sorrows with drink only sicken their tomorrows. With God’s help, good cheer permits us to rise above the depressing present or difficult circumstances. It is a process of positive reassurance and reinforcement. It is sunshine when clouds block the light.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p5" pid="C0P_6URjcEqv9CW5kmGOpw" hash="rizd1g">Recently, while visiting with a wife who had suddenly lost a husband through a tragic death, I was touched by this lovely lady from Washington, Utah, when she said, “My heart is heavy and sad, but my soul is of good cheer.” There was a powerful inward cheer dominating the sorrowful situation. The promise, “for I the Lord am with you,” was triumphing over heartache and despair. People of good cheer soften the sorrow of others as well as those that weigh mightily upon themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p6" pid="Er94WLKi50Sz7G-kbKa9_g" hash="4arYMQ">None of us will escape tragedy and suffering. Each of us will probably react differently. However, if we can recall the Lord’s promise, “for I the Lord am with you,” we will be able to face our problems with dignity and courage. We will find the strength to be of good cheer instead of becoming resentful, critical, or defeated. We will be able to meet life’s unpleasant happenings with clear vision, strength, and power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p7" pid="M6gw_LNm7E-yNrlR2nS8FA" hash="AA7P6A">All over the world we have many members who are taking the blessings of the gospel to those who will listen. Those who accept and live the teachings of our Savior find the strength to be of good cheer, for he declared, “Whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.25" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:25</a>.) When we apply this principle in our lives and share it with our associates, it is possible to supplant discouragement, tragedy, and gloom with hope and cheer. The fruits of cheerfulness lie within each of us, side by side with our resolution, priorities, and desires. They will never come from without. They cannot be purchased or stolen. They are above price.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p8" pid="uh8Tib9kwU-x7HpYApxd7A" hash="v7OIdQ">When I think of those about us who are well-disciplined and anxiously engaged in being of good cheer, many great examples come to mind. They lift us with their state of mind of gladness, joy, and hope. They seem to move forward happily with an extra dimension of power and love. Let me share an example or two.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p9" pid="9eHSPAupQ0qB1C1DICPoGA" hash="OWhMvQ">One beautiful “good cheer” lady I have loved deeply over the years is very special. For more than thirty-five years her husband has been afflicted with Parkinson’s disease.</p>

She has cheerfully cooperated in making it possible for him to function well as a father, husband, bishop, high councilor, and successful building contractor. When his mobility has reached discouraging stages of near zero, she has lifted him. Her neighbors, and they are everyone she knows, find her to be the first visitor when there is an unusual need. Her good cheer is endless. She brings peace of mind and comfort to all with whom she associates. The more I watch her, the more I realize good cheer builds contagious enthusiasm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p11" pid="y42itCzkpkubGvBKEv-P5A" hash="Wv_Wtw">What a joy it is to see someone of good cheer, who, when others because of an unpleasant happening or development live in angry silence or vocal disgust, meets the situation with cheerful endurance and good spirits.</p>

Meaningful change has brought great joy and happiness to her and her family. Let me share this message of good cheer as told in her own words.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p15" pid="TMpMqPwJTEeOhbTWJM3zwA" hash="t2Nieg">“In 1975 there was a family who lived near the main road in a small village. My parents were rather poor. My father worked at the local post office, while my mother stayed home caring for the children.</p>

She turned to drink, tobacco, and gambling. Many times she would play cards all day and all night and not return to care for her children.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p18" pid="oUqpp5bbO0-gqrfvmlD6yw" hash="N-z_WA">“One day my father came home and told my mother that if she continued on with her gambling and didn’t care for the children, he would have to divorce her. The family faced a crisis. At that time I was helping care for my three younger brothers. My parents asked each child who he or she wanted to live with, Mom or Dad. It was a very difficult decision to have to choose between my mother and my father. It was a time of much suffering and sorrow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p19" pid="FnPmT0z00kWcvxqrRaudxw" hash="2ZWImg">“It was during this time that my oldest sister first met some missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She studied about the Church and came to accept the teachings and adopt them into her life. She asked me to go to church with her. I was very sad and angry at first to think she had changed religions. I had only known the teachings of Buddha and had come to love the customs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p20" pid="JFy4d-pRT0OTBNonNZnXsw" hash="OoiM4A">“But I noticed a change in my sister. She was more loving and kind and did many things to help our family. I decided to study with the missionaries. My mother listened also. Before very long, we both realized that we had done things wrong and needed to change our lives. We repented of our sins and were baptized. When my father and two older brothers saw the change in us, they decided to study also. My father had been an important officer and teacher in the Buddhist church. He spent much time studying and reading the standard works. He prayed often and sincerely to know the truth. At last his humble prayers were answered. He knew, as we did, that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was true.</p>

She and her family are living witnesses that when people come to realize that “I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you,” a whole family can change their despair to good cheer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p23" pid="hr_0CgKEk0uCAgRS3uF0Xg" hash="LNgUIg">In contrast to this family in Bangkok, some of us who have the happiness and good cheer of the gospel can lose it by becoming involved in iniquity and deceit. One of the most destructive forms of deceit is self-deceit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p24" pid="4oRDTOqCJUOqVUfquiWrlw" hash="YQIb0g">Modern-day prophets have pled in plainness for us to avoid “get-rich-quick” schemes if we would avoid the heartaches of financial bondage. Perhaps we have not said enough about the fact that too many of us, in our moments of dreaming of grandeur, plant the seeds of economic disaster. Then at a later date when much is lost, we blame those who participated with us. It is difficult to be of good cheer when self-deceit is our companion. When we willingly expose ourselves to the winds and storms of fraud and scam, we should not be surprised when we come down with deficit disease. Over the years of listening to those who have suffered heavy money losses, I have heard many in desperation declare, “I was taken.” Often my heart, mind, and the Spirit have prompted me to share, “Yes, you were taken by yourself.” We all need to be encouraged to lift up our heads and see where our thoughts and undeclared priorities are taking us. Self-deceit permits us to blame others for our failures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p25" pid="IjF2AWqQfE6x9wcqevwlaQ" hash="nqxKTQ">For many years President Ezra Taft Benson has reinforced his talks of love and guidance to our youth with the truth that wickedness never can be happiness. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>.) In dating and courting, decisions of conduct, to be effective, must be made before the moment of enticement and temptation surfaces. Too often immoral conduct results from self-deceit. We have allowed ourselves to blame others for the incident of misconduct when our failure to make decisions ahead of time was not thought to be of importance. The thought that wickedness brings good cheer makes reason stare.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p26" pid="r_cmQIBDYUq-AHREg0dWVQ" hash="02Otmg">A constant effort must be made to lift our daily conduct so that it squares with our knowledge of truth and our standards. Self-mastery must always triumph over self-deceit for us to taste the fruits of good cheer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p27" pid="vHSxvIXQh02Af67mAsKjJg" hash="mgqZqg">One form of self-deceit is rationalization. We prevent the Lord from being with us because we stray from his paths and explain our actions by consciously or unconsciously making excuses. We say to ourselves: “I did it just to see what it was like.” “Everyone else was doing it.” “I didn’t want to be different.” “There was no other way to be accepted graciously.” Or “He made me do it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p28" pid="CQ-3HNGYYk-VcBtsW9_DnQ" hash="bRG-hw">The companionship of good cheer is possible through keeping the commandments of God, not through rationalization. We must commit ourselves to principles and not live by comparison or excuses. Horace Mann wisely said, “In vain do they talk of happiness who never subdued an impulse in obedience to a principle.” (from <span class="emphasis">Common School Journal,</span> quoted in <span class="emphasis">Horace Mann: His Ideas and Ideals,</span> comp. Joy Elmer Morgan, Washington, D.C.: National Home Library Foundation, 1936, p. 149.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p29" pid="PWmjIZiId0G7e0USAhVB-A" hash="Uyi2lg">Self-deceit is at best only temporarily successful. Then when the gap between truth and our knowledge of the right and our behavior becomes too large, we are forced to close it with rationalization. The true test is, how do we measure up when Christlike conduct standards are applied.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/be-of-good-cheer.p30" pid="Do93XFfylEepKu9EHLD_Rg" hash="3yJ8Pw">Cheerfulness will never be a blending of self-deceit and rationalization. Being of good cheer permits us to rise above the moment and situation. Generally, rationalization is unconscious. We slip into it unaware and gradually. It becomes a crutch for those who choose to walk in crooked paths.</p>

When Jesus comes into our lives, cheer lights the way.

He drank before he had dinner, and he would have what he called a “bracer” before involving himself in major business decisions. During a routine physical examination one day, a doctor told him that, for the good of his health, he should break the drinking habit. When I asked him what he intended to do, he said, “That’s easy. I’ll just change doctors.”</p>

She now tells us of a few times she even woke her husband up in the middle of the night and insisted that he go to an all-night store to get her a pack of cigarettes. This couple came in contact with the missionaries, believed their message, and joined the Church. When she knew she had to quit smoking, the woman almost immediately threw off the chains of this habit and became free of tobacco addiction.</p>

He pleads with his sons with these words:</p>

Who among us hasn’t felt the chains of bad habits? These habits may have impeded our progress, may have made us forget who we are, may have destroyed our self-image, may have put our family life in jeopardy, and may have hindered our ability to serve our fellowmen and our God. So many of us tend to say, “This is the way I am. I can’t change. I can’t throw off the chains of habit.”</p>

They cause us to become confused and less able to be guided by God’s Spirit. Lehi also reminded his sons that their new land should “be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 1:7</a>). He could have said, “If so, it shall be because ye have been bound into captivity by the chains of unrighteous living.” Samuel Johnson wisely shared, “The chains of habit are too small to be felt until they are too strong to be broken” (<span class="emphasis">International Dictionary of Thoughts,</span> Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969, p. 348).</p>

We are bound by inferior self-images created by misconduct and indifference. We are chained by an unwillingness to change for the better. Is it any wonder, in our day as it was in Nephi’s, that God’s pleas are “awake,” “listen,” “procrastinate no longer,” “believe me,” “come back,” and “seek the straight course”?</p>

He stands to lose family, employment, personal pride, and his own life. His cries of “I’m hooked” tug at the soul. The use of cocaine and other drugs causes those involved to become totally chained to their addiction. Those who peddle drugs not only provide chains for others, but shackle themselves with the weights of unrighteousness as well. To those not involved, avoid drugs in any form with all of your might. To those involved, seek help to remove the chains that will drag you down and smother you. Drugs are not a “quick fix.” They are a quick exit through a door which too often swings only one way—toward heartache and self-destruction.</p>

Throughout this time in my life I drifted farther and farther from the Church and the teachings of the gospel. This neglect brought disappointment after disappointment to myself and my family.

      <description>Some weeks ago a man holding a high office in the Church asked a special favor of me. “Would you be good enough to take the time to listen while a mother, father, and their teenage daughter, special friends of mine, try to talk to each other?”</description>

As the verbal storms developed with bitter intensity, I found myself the only listener. Even though they had individually and collectively agreed I would be the counselor, judge, arbiter, or referee, if you please, I found myself waiting patiently for an opportunity to be heard. During the heated and emotional confrontation, the teenager repeatedly expressed her resentment with, “You can’t talk to me like that. I am an adult now. You can’t treat me like that. I am an adult now. You can’t dominate my life anymore. I am an adult now.”</p>

By definition, an adult is a person who has attained the age of maturity—full grown. While it is true a person may be legally classified as an adult when he or she reaches a certain age, for our purposes today the kind of adult status we are talking about must be earned by actions and attitude.</p>

If a person is mature, he or she will not need to announce it. Personal conduct is the only true measurement of maturity. Adult classification, when it pertains to behavior, does not come with age, wrinkles, or gray hair. Perhaps it is not too far off the mark to say adult conduct is a process. Mature conduct is generally developed through self-discipline, resilience, and continuing effort.</p>

When we who are more senior use an expression like “I am older than you” to clinch a point, I am not too sure it is very effective. How much better it is to gain respect and love through worthy parental conduct than to seek it through the means of the age differential.</p>

By your faith and works you will be known for what you are. By your fruits you will be known and classified. Those among us who use abusive arguments, temper tantrums, demeaning and painful criticism, fruitless counter-complaints, and disrespect will benefit no one. Let us put away petty malice, resentment, and retaliatory practices that are self-destructive and return to a path of safety well marked by the Good Shepherd.</p>

Boulders and hills don’t stop the hike to the top of the mountain. Top awards are not given unless the difficult merit badges are earned as well as the easier ones. The boys’ tenacity to continue on the Scouting path, not the honors awarded, is the maturing element of the program.</p>

To become a disciple of Jesus Christ, we must continue in righteousness and in His word. When someone shares with enthusiasm his joy in now being an active member of the Church, the thought crosses my mind, “Wonderful, but for how long will you stay that way?” Incidentally, some years ago I was contacted by an insurance agent. When he started his sales approach with “I am an active member of the Church,” the first thought that crossed my mind was, “Who said so?”</p>

Those who are morally clean will conduct themselves in a more adult fashion if they will spend less time declaring it and more time living and teaching others the blessings of chastity. Full tithe payers will receive more joy and reward from being obedient to the principle of tithing than from being so classified or recommended.</p>

Responsible student conduct on any campus is applauded. A pledge of “on my honor I will do my best,” either in writing or when self-enforced, can make the difference in character development. Making and keeping commitments may seem restrictive and outdated in a today world where “play it loose” is the pattern, but the benefits are clear to the mature.</p>

They may feel that such interviews are juvenile. Those who strive for continual growth realize that counselors can help one analyze himself and find solutions to personal problems.

Strength, growth, and happiness result from analyzing the direction our lives are taking. Those who have been lost, misunderstood, or offended and those totally involved in the Church are invited to come and fellowship together within the framework of the gospel of Jesus Christ. To be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not enough. Participation in priesthood, Relief Society, Young Women, Young Men, Primary, and Sunday School opportunities is necessary if we are to move forward anxiously in personal development that is adult, real, and eternal. Perhaps all of us would do well to realize that as we promote personal activity and involvement in the Church, it might be much better to be classified a member of “good coming” instead of a member in good standing. It is our responsibility and privilege to encourage the immature and give them opportunities for growth and development.</p>

Bumps, disappointments, and the unexpected helped him gain the status of being wise beyond his years. Oftentimes maturity can best be measured by our endurance. “If the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</p>

For you to classify yourself as all-state, all-American, or even all-world doesn’t mean anything if you alone determine the winner and present the trophy to yourself. By the same token, who among us has the right to label himself as a loser, no good, a dropout, or a failure? Self-judgment in any direction is a hazardous pastime. It is a fact of life that the direction in which we are moving is more important than where we are. I have never heard the best-educated ever declare, “I am educated now.” Some of the most potentially wise people in the world forfeit that classification when they spend their time advertising their abilities and knowledge rather than using their wisdom to improve themselves and help those with whom they associate.</p>

Let us communicate in words and deeds our concern and love for each other. Threats, ears that do not hear, eyes that do not see, and hearts that do not feel will never bring joy, unity, and growth. Patience with others, self, and God brings eternal maturity. Let God and our daily actions determine the authenticity of the statement “I am an adult now.”</p>

When, in disgust or discouragement, we allow ourselves to reach depressive levels of despair because of our demeaning self-appraisal, it is a sad day for us and a sad day in the eyes of God. For us to conclude that we have no gifts when we judge ourselves by stature, intelligence, grade-point average, wealth, power, position, or external appearance is not only unfair but unreasonable.</p>

It was only thirty-seven years. And then Sister Keefer proudly added that during all her time of service, she had never had a bad boy.</p>

All these Scouts had been boys touched by the service and caring of this one noble and great woman—the best Scouter ever in the ward’s entire history. She had the gift of caring, and here were some of the fruits of her labors. Generations yet to come will bless her name for what she has done. What a great gift have those who know how to care!</p>

May they and their families be helped with thoughts that will bring action, comfort, and a new sense of self-worth.</p>

George Bernard Shaw once wrote, “The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them” (<span class="emphasis">The Devil’s Disciple,</span> act 2). Indifference can be one of the most hurtful ways of behavior. Never should we in life allow ourselves to turn away, walk on the other side of the street, and pretend we didn’t see, or prohibit involvement in accepted ways. We need to learn to love everyone, even those who are difficult.</p>

Conversely, how unwise we are when we declare, “I’ll never speak to him again.” Never is a long time, and even those who have caused heartache or shame are not beyond ultimate repentance. Sometimes hurts to the heart are more damaging than physical blows. Yes, they may take longer to heal, but they will heal more quickly if we avoid bitterness and anger and practice forgiveness.</p>

Satan would like you to believe that because you’ve made one mistake it’s all over. He wants you to quit trying. It is important that discouragement is cast out of the lives of those who are waiting.

You can choose to be aware of the needs of each family member and do your part to help fill those needs. Some need a person to listen; some may need a compliment or positive reinforcement. There is strength and satisfaction in becoming involved in family projects. Encourage family love by being approachable even when you feel you have reason to turn away. The first step back in seeking family acceptance is to change oneself for the better. It is true today, true yesterday, and will be true tomorrow that effective leadership can only be administered through love.</p>

My generation, for example, was taught that a person’s I.Q. was supposedly a fixed measurement of a person’s capacity to learn. Such a notion is now generally discredited by the teaching profession. Interestingly, the Prophet Joseph Smith taught in the nineteenth century: “We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the intellect.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 51.) He was obviously ahead of his time!</p>

When it came time to choose a king to replace King Saul, the Lord gave this criteria to his prophet Samuel: “Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; … for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 16:7</a>.)</p>

We often use phrases about the heart to describe the total person. Thus, we describe people as being “big-hearted” or “goodhearted” or having a “heart of gold.” Or we speak of people with faint hearts, wise hearts, pure hearts, willing hearts, deceitful hearts, conniving hearts, courageous hearts, cold hearts, hearts of stone, or selfish hearts.</p>

Ultimately you and I will be judged not only for our actions, but also for the desires of our hearts. This truth was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith at a time when he was shown in vision the celestial kingdom. The revelation is recorded in section 137 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Joseph marveled when he saw his deceased brother Alvin in the celestial kingdom, for Alvin had died before the gospel was restored. Joseph then received this great truth:</p>

He said, “I wanted to go, but I am not worthy.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p2" pid="HbBmD3jqUE6H5ka58M1DGQ" hash="nBpAXg">“Who made that judgment?” I asked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p3" pid="DWECL4i1uE-lmkbQ7evoqg" hash="ebIobQ">“I did,” was his answer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p4" pid="iRl1Tbm4yUmwvPJxsnM_dQ" hash="RtA_0w">On another occasion I asked a young lady who was contemplating marriage if she was going to the temple. She said, “I would like to, but I am not worthy.” In response to the same question of who determined her unworthiness, she too said, “I did.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p5" pid="YcuRndox2EypvBP54MgkaQ" hash="I3Yrwg">A member mother who had known for many weeks that her daughter had planned a temple marriage was asked if she was going to attend the temple ceremony. “No. I am not worthy to get a temple recommend,” she answered.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p6" pid="idL6kaoTqEihOYzhFZIB5g" hash="aFiH8Q">Each of these people seemed to have made his own determination about worthiness. We do not have to be hindered by self-judgment. All of us have the benefit and added wisdom of a bishop and a stake president to help us determine our worthiness and, if necessary, to assist us to begin the process of becoming worthy to accomplish whatever goal we wish to achieve. When we take it upon ourselves to pass self-judgment and simply declare, “I am not worthy,” we build a barrier to progress and erect blockades that prevent our moving forward. We are not being fair when we judge ourselves. A second and third opinion will always be helpful and proper.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p7" pid="oRlla0Pg0UmpzX0yTrELZw" hash="IYtRrg">It occurs to me that there are probably hundreds or even thousands who do not understand what worthiness is. Worthiness is a process, and perfection is an eternal trek. We can be worthy to enjoy certain privileges without being perfect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p8" pid="TOvu36hOFkuoJDtBI2lP8g" hash="ehzlCg">Perhaps it is reasonable to conclude that personal measurement or judgment oftentimes may be severe and inaccurate. We may get bogged down as we try to understand and define <span class="emphasis">worthiness.</span> All of us are particularly aware of our shortcomings and weaknesses. Therefore, it is easy for us to feel that we are unworthy of blessings we desire and that we are not as worthy to hold an office or calling as someone next door.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p9" pid="hiBgXHScE0OOENaFDcFtHg" hash="hhQ9nA">All through life we meet some people who tell of their weaknesses with great enthusiasm and unreasonable prejudice. They may not report untruths, but they may leave out truths or they may not be fair with themselves. Misjudgments can be made. To move forward wisely and think clearly, all sides of the story must be reviewed. When we feel inadequate, capable and loving friends can help us realize our strengths and potential.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p10" pid="GGd3KmYmtEa-oP11Evr8cQ" hash="hvoifw">When counseling I have always tried to get the facts. Oftentimes those being interviewed resist sharing some of the facts because they make them uncomfortable. Worthy and lasting changes can only be made when actions are based upon the light of truth. Very often, people become comfortable in their self-declared unworthiness status.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p11" pid="IjP3JBYAcEO2UF2YVvLsQg" hash="nt5ODA">Possibly the hardest guidelines for us to follow are those we set for ourselves. To analyze our fears, our dreams, our goals, our motives can be soul-wrenching. We need others to help us. We may find that we fear failure so much that we won’t take a risk. Often our self-esteem is bruised by criticism. Many other facts about ourselves can be brought to light if we really want to know.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p12" pid="Zx5rO91_REqG8M5Rwst4wg" hash="7wlV8w">Perhaps we all live under some misconceptions when we look at each other on Sundays as we attend our meetings. Everyone is neatly dressed and greets each other with a smile. It is natural to assume that everyone else has his life under control and doesn’t have to deal with dark little weaknesses and imperfections.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p13" pid="7D8qai_LvEySIqhXWplDRg" hash="B5MzNw">There is a natural, probably a mortal, tendency to compare ourselves with others. Unfortunately, when we make these comparisons, we tend to compare our weakest attributes with someone else’s strongest. For example, a woman who feels unschooled in the gospel may take particular note of a woman in her ward who teaches the Gospel Doctrine class and seems to have every scripture at her fingertips. Obviously these kinds of comparisons are destructive and only reinforce the fear that somehow we don’t measure up and therefore we must not be as worthy as the next person.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p14" pid="ZrauS-NqOU6sqQnu3D5RLQ" hash="RGKzGw">We need to come to terms with our desire to reach perfection and our frustration when our accomplishments or behaviors are less than perfect. I feel that one of the great myths we would do well to dispel is that we’ve come to earth to perfect ourselves, and nothing short of that will do. If I understand the teachings of the prophets of this dispensation correctly, we will not become perfect in this life, though we can make significant strides toward that goal.</p>

That will not come all at once, but line upon line, and precept upon precept, example upon example, and even then not as long as we live in this mortal life, for we will have to go even beyond the grave before we reach that perfection and shall be like God.” (<span class="emphasis">Doctrines of Salvation,</span> comp.

We humble people, we who feel ourselves sometimes so worthless, so good-for-nothing, we are not so worthless as we think. There is not one of us but what God’s love has been expended upon. There is not one of us that He has not cared for and caressed. There is not one of us that He has not desired to save and that He has not devised means to save. There is not one of us that He has not given His angels charge concerning. We may be insignificant and contemptible in our own eyes and in the eyes of others, but the truth remains that we are children of God and that He has actually given His angels … charge concerning us, and they watch over us and have us in their keeping.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Truths,</span> comp. Jerreld L. Newquist, 2 vols., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974, 1:2.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p21" pid="cLX6YobaEUyHyeTXauw4aQ" hash="E-6mQw">If we are in the keeping of angels, God is certainly telling us that we are worthy to be watched over, helped, and directed by him. As we become aware of God’s watch-care and as we turn to Church leaders to help us learn how to become worthy members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we learn that we can reach the status of worthiness for each goal along life’s path. Yet we must strive for worthiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p22" pid="S83fuJjIZk638nfdlL9Xyw" hash="Fj-d5w">In Official Declaration—2 [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2.title" class="scriptureRef">OD 2</a>], accepted by the Church on September 30, 1978, we are reminded that certain privileges have worthiness as a prerequisite. In this official declaration, the word <span class="emphasis">worthy</span> or <span class="emphasis">worthiness</span> is used six times. This leaves little doubt as to the importance of being worthy if specific blessings are to be available to us.</p>

Guidance and suggestions should be offered in a loving way, but most of us have a tendency to rebel or be dismayed when someone suggests that our conduct is less than it should be. As Benjamin Franklin once said: “Those things that hurt, instruct. It is for this reason that wise people learn not to dread but welcome problems.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p34" pid="zc5OiTrlBUuGmoACl9TLaA" hash="vqtnTA">In life there are requirements for almost all privileges—education demands them, business has its regulations, sports and games have their rules, the Church has certain standards, and so on. But in every case there is help to meet those requirements. It is up to us to look for that assistance so we can understand the rules and strengthen ourselves as we receive direction from the sources available. It is not wise or proper for us to judge ourselves as being unworthy and thus stop our progress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/on-being-worthy.p35" pid="sIbMLAej902pnbTYZXEXhg" hash="6HrQuQ">When we dwell on our own weaknesses, it is easy to dwell on the feelings that we are unworthy. Somehow we need to bridge the gap between continually striving to improve and yet not feeling defeated when our actions aren’t perfect all the time. We need to remove <span class="emphasis">unworthy</span> from our vocabulary and replace it with <span class="emphasis">hope</span> and <span class="emphasis">work.</span> This we can do if we turn to quieter, deeper, surer guidelines—the words of our prophets and leaders, past and present.</p>

We are entitled to the help of others not only in assessing our worthiness but also in making the classification of “worthy” available to each of us. As we measure our worthiness, let us no longer put limitations upon ourselves. Rather, let us use those strengths and powers that are available to make us worthy to gain great heights in personal development. Thus we will reap the joy that comes to those who desire to improve and move forward with determination and effectiveness as they practice self-discipline and refuse to judge themselves as unworthy.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p1" pid="98eD5ZMcJ0uptwrHOobgeA" hash="DJJGmg">Many years ago I had the opportunity of witnessing a state-championship high-school track meet at Brigham Young University. The lesson I learned as I watched the mile run was most impressive. I know I shall never forget it. About a dozen young men had qualified to represent their schools. The starting gun was fired, and these young men who had trained so long and so hard took off. Four fellows, closely bunched together, took the early lead. Suddenly the runner in second place spiked the first runner’s foot with his shoe. As the leader was about to make the next stride forward, he found that he was without a shoe.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p2" pid="7KzNDlLrSk2gR2eGRNUNiQ" hash="ZZ2MhA">As I noticed this, I wondered what the leader would do because of what his competitor had unintentionally done to him. It seemed to me he had a number of choices. He could take a few extra quick sprints and catch up to the fellow who had put him out of first position, double up his fist, and hit him to get even. He could run over to the coach and say, “This is what you get—I have trained all my life for this big day, and now look what’s happened!” He could run off into the stands and say to his mother, father, or girlfriend, “Isn’t this horrible?” Or he could have sat down on the track and cried. But to my pleasure, he did none of these things. He just kept running.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p3" pid="zB8caUVU1UusXr2VvY2upg" hash="l-FpUw">This was halfway around the first lap, and I thought to myself, “Good for him; he’ll finish this first lap of the four and retire gracefully.” But after he had completed the first lap, he just kept running. He completed the second lap, then the third lap—and every time he took a stride, cinders were coming up through his stocking, hurting his foot. They ran on cinder tracks in those days. But he didn’t quit. He just kept running.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p4" pid="oCS4rY1Gm06DVxuvjy4vDg" hash="lJaEfw">I thought, “What an outstanding display of courage and self-discipline! What parents! What a coach! What leaders who have affected his life enough so that in a situation like this he would not stop running!” He finished the job he had to do. He did not place first, but he was a real winner. When I walked over to him at the completion of the race and congratulated him on his courageous performance, he was composed and in complete control. He was able to carry on when it would have been much easier to quit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/stalwart-and-brave-we-stand.p5" pid="mFKcsuhyD0Kop6fUzKj5Yg" hash="dITcTg">Just before our esteemed, honored Apostle and special friend of Aaronic Priesthood and their leaders worldwide, Elder Bruce R. McConkie, passed away nearly four and one-half years ago, with his sweetheart and eternal companion, Amelia, at his bedside, some very significant words were shared. As Sister McConkie held his hand during his final earthly minutes, she asked, “Bruce, do you have a message for me?” Though weak and expiring, he responded in a firm voice his last words, “Carry on.”</p>

Sister McConkie has since shared with me the great importance and strength of “carry on” as time has passed. Elder McConkie knew as a special witness the importance of, “Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</p>

As a group of Primary children stood before the congregation and sang “I Am a Child of God,” I noticed three young Primary members on the front row singing but saying nothing vocally. They were deaf; they sang with their hands. No one heard them audibly, but we received their message. They touched my spirit deeply, and it was my privilege to tell them in front of the members of that stake that our Heavenly Father heard them. Even though vocally they had said nothing, they transmitted a memorable message. In moving silence they taught of the spirit, they taught of the mind, and they taught of the heart. They had not given up singing just because they had no voice. They had been taught to carry on.</p>

Today it should be a way of life, our top priority and clarion call for young and old. Young people, boys and girls, and leaders worldwide, I encourage you to carry on. Do not give up, falter, or become weary. Do not yield to the ways of the world that can only bring unhappiness and discouragement. I love and respect young people who stand firm when outside influences would make it easy for them to fail or fall.</p>

Most of our youth are true to the faith despite conditions of the day and are avoiding the temptations and subtleties of misconduct that tempt them on every hand. What a joy it is to reflect upon the fact that we have more young men and young women than ever before serving in the mission field today, who have great commitment and are enjoying unusual success.</p>

It is a joy to see them stand firm as the mountains around us. God will continue to help them carry on, and their work will not be thwarted but will be enhanced and fruitful.</p>

Every previous gospel dispensation has drifted into apostasy, but ours will not. … God has saved for the final inning some of his strongest children, who will help bear off the kingdom triumphantly. And that is where you come in, for you are the generation that must be prepared to meet your God. … Make no mistake about it—you are a marked generation. There has never been more expected of the faithful in such a short period of time as there is of us. … Each day we personally make many decisions that show where our support will go. The final outcome is certain—the forces of righteousness will finally win. What remains to be seen is where each of us personally, now and in the future, will stand in this fight—and how tall we will stand. Will we be true to our last-days, foreordained mission?”</p>

I had the opportunity of meeting him in Wellington, New Zealand. Later on in the week someone said to me, “Would you like to see where Peter Snell does his training and his running?” I answered yes. I was shocked when I was taken down to the beach—not to a track, but to the beach. I asked, “Where does he run?” My friends said, “He runs out close to the water where the sand comes up over his feet. There it is difficult to pull his feet out of the sand after each stride.” I had an idea why, but I said to my friends, “Why does he run there?” They answered, “When he gets on a track in competition, he feels like he’s floating because he doesn’t have to pull his feet up out of the wet sand.”</p>

I learned from him. A little later my friends took me to another place where Peter Snell trained, up in the mountains. When I looked for a track again, they said, “No, he runs up the steep hills. Then, when he is on the level at track meets, it is pretty easy to run.” That is why he breaks records, and that is why I remember his example. They told me he ran every day regardless of the weather conditions or how tired he was.</p>

He’d also tried to live a faithful life and had been a very active servant in the gospel. Then he’d been called as a mission president. He had apparently been a very effective mission president and had subsequently returned to his home state. Throughout his life he’d experienced one success after another—he was a recognized leader in his community, had built a prosperous business. Being called as a mission president had sort of cemented in his mind that he’d “made it”—that he was an all-around success.</p>

Telling the story, this man said, “I realized that I’d become quite boastful—that while I felt I had a testimony of Jesus Christ, in my mind I had brought about all of these wonderful things through my hard work, intelligence, and so forth. But when hard times hit, I began to realize how offensive I must have been to others and to my Heavenly Father to assume that I had brought all of these good things on my own. I felt like I’d lived a life of arrogance and boasting.”</p>

Constantly we should be reminded that we must not boast of faith nor of mighty works, but instead should boast of God in his blessings and goodness to us. God will help us to understand that humility must be our foundation if the goodness of the Lord is to continue to come to and from us. The boasting man will certainly fall, because in his own strength no man endures. The boasting or conceited person in life is not expected by his peers to achieve great heights because he conveys an attitude he is already there.</p>

This is a most serious evil. It is a sin born of pride, a sin that creates a frame of mind which keeps men from turning to the Lord and accepting his saving grace. When a man knowingly or unknowingly engages in self-exultation because of his riches, his political power, his worldly learning, his physical prowess, his business ability, or even his works of righteousness, he is not in tune with the Spirit of the Lord.</p>

Indeed, that precedent was set in the premortal council when Jesus Christ pledged the fruits of all he might himself accomplish to go to the Father: “And the glory be thine forever.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:2</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.24" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:24</a>.)</p>

Her death had been announced openly to the multitude. Jesus himself had replied before the multitude that, notwithstanding her death, she would “be made whole.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/8.50" class="scriptureRef">Luke 8:50</a>.) All the people would soon know that she now lived and could only be expected to wonder how and by what means life had come to her again.</p>

We as a matter of standard gospel counsel encourage that those who enjoy the gifts of the Spirit and who possess the signs which always follow those who believe are commanded not to boast of these spiritual blessings. In our day, after naming the miraculous signs that always attend those who have faith and those who believe the very truth taught by Jesus anciently, the Lord has said:</p>

There were times when Jesus told the recipients of his healing power to go forth and testify of the goodness of God unto them, and other times when he limited the extent and detail of their witness.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.10-12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:10–12</a>.) When we seek the praise of man more than the praise of God, it will become easy to fall.</p>

Oftentimes, heavy winds, storms, angry clouds, down drafts, etc., have caused bumpy and anxious moments, particularly when it was time to land. A seasoned pilot gave me comfort once after such an experience when he talked about a landing pattern—the ordered flight path of an aircraft about to touch down. Precise instruments, experience, and trust guide the planes to safety en route and through proper landing and takeoff. “We can’t control the weather or elements, but we can stay within the pattern for safety,” he emphasized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p2" pid="_PJPPqDF5UuFcNDRCWA3pg" hash="uIKPzQ">One day I was admiring a beautiful hand-finished quilt made by a skilled seamstress. As we visited together, I learned that she had made many quilts over the years and was well known for her excellent handiwork. To my query, “Do you ever make one of these quilts without a pattern?” she said, “How would I know how it might turn out if I didn’t have a pattern to follow?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p3" pid="NR-i4wnUcUyCJ2uaLQPDow" hash="hcSyoQ">How can we even guess how our lives will turn out if we don’t choose to follow the right pattern?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p4" pid="E4jxipUAOE66ZyzI3578Tg" hash="-CTzfw">What a happy circumstance and strength in our day to have the Lord’s promise, “I will give unto you a <span class="emphasis">pattern</span> in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/52.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 52:14</a>.) I have always received courage, comfort, and direction from this powerful quotation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p5" pid="C2pZ0IRrHEqx3K26GYLDbQ" hash="nAKO3A">A pattern is a guide for copying, a design, a plan, a diagram or model to be followed in making things, a composite of traits or features characteristic of an individual. It is also the ordered flight path for an aircraft about to land.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p6" pid="bfWmi7AqIEGlpvfuK5FxjA" hash="qdOKiA">The gospel of Jesus Christ is God’s pattern for righteous living and eternal life. It makes possible goal-setting and lofty priorities. Satan and his advocates will constantly try to deceive and entice us into following their patterns. If we are to achieve daily safety, exaltation, and eternal happiness, we need to live by the light and truth of our Savior’s plan. All salvation revolves around our Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p7" pid="1OAol7ah00OndFgnJY3y6w" hash="qcBLvA">In a recent conversation with a drug addict about priorities, life’s patterns, hopes, goals, and purposes, I was grieved when this attractive young lady said, “God is loving. God is kind. Leave me alone, and never mind.” The wayward and disobedient will never be happy while smothered with Satan’s suggestion that practice makes permanence. God’s gift and commitment to agency never will include a tolerance of sin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p8" pid="RgFIVlOGUUOPC1zawLNMcw" hash="wKCMkg">God is truly loving and kind. Part of his pattern is to help us use our gift of free agency, but his pattern does not condone sin. When we abuse our agency to choose a life-style contrary to revealed patterns, we must live with the consequences. Our unwillingness to follow the true and tested patterns given for our happiness causes the individual, family, and friends heartaches and ultimate disaster. Our freedom to choose our course of conduct does not provide personal freedom from the consequences of our performances. God’s love for us is constant and will not diminish, but he cannot rescue us from the painful results that are caused by wrong choices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p9" pid="dg9nZGDApkmdnneVRmAkGg" hash="u9Ghbg">It is no secret that Satan wages open war with the truth and all those who live righteous lives. He deceives with skill and effectiveness even his own followers. He would have us give up, quit, rebel when setbacks come. Sometimes in life when we are committed to and are following proper patterns, we experience heavy bumps and anxious hours. Many times true winners in life are those who have been hurt and disappointed but have risen above these challenges. Very often in life, God gives us difficulties to bring out the best in us. It is true, life does not determine winners. Winners determine life.</p>

Grantland Rice once wrote, “When the One Great Scorer comes to write against your name, he marks—not that you won or lost—but how you played the game.” (In <span class="emphasis">The Home Book of Quotations,</span> 8th ed., sel. Burton Stevenson, New York: Dodd, Mead and Co., 1956, p. 754.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p11" pid="iHqH1xr98UOYSMQI-awwMw" hash="7UKrhA">Satan has a way of wrapping enticing diversions with ribbons, bows, and fancy coverings. Inside are immorality, self-destruction, and substandard culture temptations. His established pattern is to deceive at all costs. His call to “live it up,” “enjoy the ‘now,’” “go for it,” “do your own thing,” and yield to peer pressures are some of his available enticements for the susceptible in the days and hours to come. He cunningly uses damaging deceit in its most dastardly form. He would have us forget the essential thing in life is not conquering, but steadfast commitment to righteous patterns.</p>

Yielding to his temptations that promote immoral conduct will never bring happiness. When we are down and out and scrambling for relief from his clutches, he will continue to recommend patterns of conduct that allow us to destroy our self-respect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p13" pid="xe9musXb6EijiI9-9CFQJA" hash="kwu8-Q">Why does a loving God permit children he truly loves to be tempted by Satan and his ways? We have the answer from a great prophet-teacher:</p>

Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.16" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p15" pid="txAJxT7EF0-Es4MB5IwzHw" hash="btIGUA">Avoid Satan’s territory of deceit. It will never lead to happiness. Evidence to the contrary, there are no successful sinners. All of us must one day stand before God and be judged according to our personal deeds done in the flesh. The burdens of the sinner will never be lighter than that of the saint. Be not deceived by the lures of Satan. God is at the helm and is grieved when we, his children, stray from proven paths of enduring happiness and righteousness. He would have us hold fast to the iron rod with total commitment and strength.</p>

There are segments of our population that march, protest, and demand handouts and cures rather than follow God’s given rules of prevention and self-discipline. Following revealed patterns helps us to recognize our weaknesses, deal positively with them, overcome them, and rise to Christlike heights.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/a-pattern-in-all-things.p17" pid="Hg07CKsHpEm-PMB3I7W1cQ" hash="OxCqlA">We must, if we will have happiness, follow the straight and prescribed paths. “I will give you a pattern in all things” is one of the Lord’s greatest gifts and promises. Today it comes from him and his prophets. Keeping one’s mind occupied with constructive, useful things on a constant basis prevents Satan from having success in idle minds. Good music, art, literature, recreation, and other worthy pastimes can help establish proper patterns in one’s mind and conduct. Happiness is a by-product of righteous living and sharing within the framework of lofty patterns. Actions of the moment may be fun, but true happiness depends upon how you feel after the involvement is over.</p>

There are patterns for all worthy things if we will search for them. “And behold, it must be done according to the pattern which I have given unto you.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/94.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 94:2</a>.)

He was supposed to win, but he wound up finishing in fourth place. He went home from the Olympics discouraged, disillusioned, and embarrassed.</p>

He was a medical student at the time, and his studies were so demanding. He decided that he’d better get on with life and devote all of his time in preparing for medicine and forget his hopes about running the world’s record in the four-minute mile. He went to his coach and told him, “Coach, I’m through. I’m going to devote all my time to studying.” His coach said, “Roger, I think you are the man who can break the four-minute mile. I wish you’d give it one last try before you quit.”</p>

But before the night was over, he had convinced himself that he would develop an iron will before he quit running. He was going to break the four-minute mile.</p>

He knew he would have to eat the best foods. He knew he would have to go to bed early every night and sleep nine or ten hours, to let his body recuperate and constantly build up for the great day. He determined within himself that he was going to follow the rigid pattern he and the coach knew was necessary for victory and achievement.</p>

His parents and a few hundred others were present. The rest is history. Running strictly according to his charts and pattern, he ran the miracle mile in 3:59.4. He became the first man in recorded history to speed across this distance in less than four minutes. He had proven that man could run faster than was thought possible. He paid the price and reaped the rewards of following the proper pattern. Today in England he is a doctor in his own right. At the time of his victory over the one-mile barrier, he became an international hero in all the record books. The four-minute-mile barrier is broken constantly these days, but Roger Bannister set the pattern many years ago and followed it with total commitment, self-discipline, and a will of iron.</p>

Within the Church there is an established pattern for receiving revelation and instructions. We need to be reminded that anyone claiming to receive direction or revelation for others should be held suspect. This is especially true when the content is believed to have relevance for areas, regions, stakes, or wards in the Church for whom the person has no particular responsibility. God has in the past and will continue in the future to reveal his will through his prophets.</p>

He reminded us, “If ye love me, feed my sheep.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.17" class="scriptureRef">John 21:17</a>.) The love is greater than the who, where, how, or when.

Partial seclusion had become necessary. During this trying period Joseph Smith had the following revealed to him:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p2" pid="VN-z9rVJkkKHICIuhM4oXA" hash="11pCHQ">“Behold, thou wast called and chosen to write the Book of Mormon, and to my ministry; and I have lifted thee up out of thine afflictions, and have counseled thee, that thou hast been delivered from all thine enemies, and thou hast been delivered from the powers of Satan and from darkness! …</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p4" pid="urpN45hINky2WY8X57I1sA" hash="swZwZQ">The words “For, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days” were the Lord’s voice of gladness to His beloved Prophet. His message to Joseph Smith and to us is “You can do it, and I will help you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p5" pid="9yA0LxY2W0iixzKLosHLfg" hash="susLtg">Recently we read in local newspapers an account of the devastating effects of a fire that completely gutted a low-cost housing apartment. Many people were rushed out into the street for safety. They watched their living quarters and other earthly possessions go up in fire and smoke. One elderly gentleman who had escaped the holocaust was interviewed. When he was asked, “What were you able to save?” he responded with, “Only the things that you see, my clothing.” His next comment was touching and significant. It was simply, “Thank God there were no serious injuries or casualties.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p6" pid="2nsYRDSoBkq3-FH0SKP1nw" hash="kkOBbA">What did we hear from this tragedy? A voice of gladness from someone who could have been bitter and angry with the situation but chose to share a mature sense of values. He was bigger than that which had happened. He saw beyond the present and gave appreciation and hope for conditions and people in the future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p7" pid="MRVK0v5LZ0mhuMS57IxVzA" hash="ELGguQ">Disappointments, death, losses, or failures are real and difficult to manage but should never cause us to have barbed tongues, lasting resentment, or negative attitudes. The gospel encourages us to develop the capacity to learn from the past and present and see the opportunities that can be ours in the days to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p8" pid="HWWukxUhb06nt2nPyatv0w" hash="d4TLVw">From the Doctrine and Covenants, we are given this counsel: “Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 128:19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p9" pid="tkFU70n_M0SXOtGAUx55Yg" hash="iwcndQ">The Lord would have us mingle our voices of gladness with His to give strength, encouragement, and joy to His children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p10" pid="ITDKPCHlnE6WKVROlwbvgw" hash="brl1Zg">I recall as a young boy going with my father to visit an elderly widow living in humble circumstances. We shared a couple of boxes of food with her. When we were leaving, her remarks touched my heart. She said, “Thank you, Bishop, and please come back again, even if it’s just to say hello.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p11" pid="YUdFX1-xA0G2T-Q4wnnWPQ" hash="H5iAGA">This was probably the first time I realized that the food items were appreciated but the words of encouragement and the personal visit were of greater value.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p12" pid="FGtXGQ88iUisIjCYPwq5fg" hash="IgZX3g">In the world, where there are often voices of pessimism and negative feelings, the voice of gladness is welcome indeed. Some seem to live with doubt, fear of the future, and sorrow for the past. If it is our nature to criticize or demean, we can cause the voices of gladness to be silenced. We need those who bring gladness into our lives. We need those who give encouragement and reflect optimism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p13" pid="rQbYyUZFMEWRnTneb85Rcw" hash="QnT4dg">Sincere yet simple words of praise can lift souls and bring gladness. Mark Twain remarked that he could live two months on one good compliment. In the words of the biblical proverbs of Solomon: “A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/25.11" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 25:11</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p14" pid="rGtConQfLEeGOpKha0_HpQ" hash="OZJWBQ">Encouragement can be quick and simple, but it is a voice of gladness that is needed by everyone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p15" pid="hA79CMhKV0W_cNBNRKh9iw" hash="-0aQtA">Most of our returning military personnel are willing to be examples of voices of gladness as they remind us that some things in life, like precious freedom and liberty, are more important than life itself. Many have had their lives changed permanently, but their voices of gladness overshadow the prevailing interruption and sacrifices they have made for all of us. Hope springs eternal for those who have the vision to trust in and to live by God’s inspired principles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p16" pid="CIOHTZDcv0CC8ZY5Pn7yhg" hash="ucZpJQ">The gospel teachings have brought glad tidings to all the world. The subtle messages remind us of attitudes which can help us face the trials of life with less difficulty. Research has verified the fact that bitterness injures more the person who carries it than the one who caused it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p17" pid="lMZR_2xJKECeGBuahVpFEg" hash="C_KPVQ">Erma Bombeck has written a book about young cancer patients. As she planned her book, she came to the conclusion that the voices that came from these young people were filled with humor and optimism which kept “these kids in the mainstream of life. Perhaps laughing and believing in themselves was a major part of their survival.” (Erma Bombeck, <span class="emphasis">I Want to Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to Go to Boise,</span> New York: Harper and Row, 1989, p. xxi.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p18" pid="qPQ2cTZffUGEOZdeB9hNew" hash="hNRd5w">One sixteen-year-old boy said, “Man, without a sense of humor I wouldn’t have made it this far.” (Ibid., p. xviii.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p19" pid="d-F4iaJgU02cq-iCeeb07w" hash="atst6A">The author interviewed the youths with cancer and read many letters from them. She found one word constantly surfacing—<span class="emphasis">attitude.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p20" pid="qVUcYM-UVEy9SO6X1sv_Jg" hash="2NeOiA">“They took personal pride in the fact that they were fighting something bigger than they were and stronger than they were—something that might even overpower them. But they still had something their enemies couldn’t take away—hope. It is a formidable weapon. … When all else fails, pull out the big artillery, HOPE, and hang on.” (Ibid., pp. 5–6.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p21" pid="vaO8sk4liky28cuTwziS7A" hash="o_w0Zw">Words of hope and gladness are often repeated in the scriptures to help us think and perform positively.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p22" pid="T-IxtGdBnke-GsSFPi896w" hash="CS4C7Q">Isaiah says of Jesus Christ: “And when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him … ; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and … he was despised, and we esteemed him not.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/53.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 53:2–3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p23" pid="GlaMCcyDn0ymX9684FJYgg" hash="H6TI5g">But even though His suffering was beyond our comprehension, His voice of gladness reminds us: “Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.33" class="scriptureRef">John 16:33</a>.) Jesus challenges all of us to be happy and optimistic. As the cancer patients learned and medical research has proven: “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/17.22" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 17:22</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p24" pid="874Nf4zocEaipKS1zahqMw" hash="Rmp1xQ">Recently during a regional conference in California, a well-trained multistake chorus furnished beautiful music. As I listened and watched them, I was impressed with the fact that on the front row were four individuals who were participating with the choir who sang, not with their voices, but with their hands. I thought to myself on that occasion, how wonderful for a choir director to encourage their participation. Without the advantage of melody or audible lyrics, they were able to stand with pride and a sense of belonging to share their communication of gladness and be an inspiration to all the congregation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p25" pid="W8bJ1vWml0GDr4aHiP0atA" hash="68BCIw">Deference, courtesy, and respect had made their voices of gladness strengthening and comforting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p26" pid="WzSUh5-T7Eu0IeVqWeOLLg" hash="byu-PA">Thank God for noble souls who can and do weather life’s storms with sincere voices of gladness which overshadow the present and make the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ real and strengthening.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p27" pid="UOv7AywdP0iyKPxMovFqXg" hash="vDM_VA">“Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/14.19" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 14:19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p28" pid="HtRu60IEu0WomSIDLWxSKA" hash="19PY2Q">After a night of intense pain and suffering, one morning a husband stricken with a terminal illness said to his wife with great feeling, “I am so thankful today.” “For what?” she asked, knowing well his difficult and trying situation. He replied, “For God giving me the privilege of one more day with you.” A voice of gladness is so refreshing when an attitude of despair might be deemed appropriate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-voice-of-gladness.p29" pid="yr029njT9EuggIsZxP9A8A" hash="c4UqMw">How helpful and rewarding it would be if all of us would likewise thank God for one more day. For what? For the opportunity to take care of some unfinished business, to express appreciation, to repent, to right some wrongs, to influence for good some wayward child, to reach out to someone who cried for help—in short, to thank God for one more day to prepare to meet Him.</p>

I actually favor this latter interpretation. Today we often hear such expressions as “weak in the knees” or “knocking knees” to denote fear.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Charity </span>is, perhaps, in many ways a misunderstood word. We often equate charity with visiting the sick, taking in casseroles to those in need, or sharing our excess with those who are less fortunate. But really, true charity is much, much more.</p>

Charity is accepting someone’s differences, weaknesses, and shortcomings; having patience with someone who has let us down; or resisting the impulse to become offended when someone doesn’t handle something the way we might have hoped. Charity is refusing to take advantage of another’s weakness and being willing to forgive someone who has hurt us. Charity is expecting the best of each other.</p>

Most of us are already well aware of the areas in which we are weak. What each of us does need is family, friends, employers, and brothers and sisters who support us, who have the patience to teach us, who believe in us, and who believe we’re trying to do the best we can, in spite of our weaknesses. What ever happened to giving each other the benefit of the doubt? What ever happened to hoping that another person would succeed or achieve? What ever happened to rooting for each other?</p>

He loves to see us criticize each other, make fun or take advantage of our neighbor’s known flaws, and generally pick on each other. The Book of Mormon is clear from where all anger, malice, greed, and hate come.</p>

By the looks of what we constantly see depicted in the news media, it appears that Satan is doing a pretty good job. In the name of reporting the news, we are besieged with sometimes graphic depictions—too often in living color—of greed, extortion, violent sexual crimes, and insults between business, athletic, or political opponents.</p>

Let’s consider first the Sermon on the Mount, which to our knowledge was the first sermon Jesus Christ taught his newly called disciples. The overriding theme of the Savior’s sermon, which in many ways is the ultimate handbook on coming unto Him, seems to center around the virtues of love, compassion, forgiveness, and long-suffering—in other words, those qualities that enable us to deal with our fellowmen more compassionately. Let’s look specifically at the Savior’s message to the Twelve. They (and we) were admonished to “be reconciled to [our] brother” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.24" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:24</a>), to “agree with [our] adversary quickly” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.25" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:25</a>), to “love [our] enemies, [to] bless them that curse [us], [to] do good to them that hate [us], and [to] pray for them which despitefully use [us], and persecute [us].” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.44" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:44</a>.) We are told, “Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:39</a>.)</p>

And then, what did He emphasize during the brief period He spent with the Nephites on this continent? Basically the same message. Could this be because the way we treat each other is the foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ?</p>

All of the comments were thoughtful and appropriate. But after a time, this great teacher erased everything he had written. Then, acknowledging that all of the comments had been worthwhile and appreciated, he taught a vital principle: “The best and most clear indicator that we are progressing spiritually and coming unto Christ is the way we treat other people.”</p>

The cause of her unhappiness had little to do with the question at hand and was related more to the fact that at the time she was laboring under intense home pressure on a major task and was feeling frustrated and frazzled. Afterward, she was embarrassed at her behavior and immediately called to apologize for her outburst. Her friends in the presidency were generous and told her not to think another thing about it. Still she wondered if they might think less of her, now that they’d seen her at less than her best. But that evening the doorbell rang around dinnertime, and there stood the other members of the presidency with dinner in hand. “We knew when you lost your cool this morning that you must just be worn out. We thought a little supper might help. We want you to know we love you.” The young woman was amazed. In spite of her outburst that morning, her friends were there to offer support rather than criticism. Rather than seize the opportunity to bash her, they were filled with the spirit of charity.</p>

It might have been those first times you stayed overnight with a friend or went on a sleepover, as our grandchildren call them. As much as you wanted to be with your friends, you might have been lonely for your parents and for the secure feeling of being home, where it was safe and comfortable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-yearning-for-home.p2" pid="BuXEF5WmJk6zKiEABd43LA" hash="-sm3LQ">Sustained homesickness might not have come until later—when you left for college or to serve a mission, or even when you were uprooted by marriage and a move far from home. Or it might have occurred when your parents divorced and you found yourself struggling to adapt to new surroundings and maybe even a stepparent and new relatives. During these periods of adjustment and absence, you perhaps felt unsettled, lonely, and had a deep yearning for home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-yearning-for-home.p3" pid="Z8V-35np2EWd4E3RsaVkVg" hash="-b658g">Recently a mission president asked me to speak to a troubled missionary who was having extreme homesickness problems. His intense yearnings were causing poor performance, a waste of time, a lack of concentration, and a dislike for his present assignment. I took the occasion to tell him that some of the right kind of homesickness could be desirable, but it must be kept under control. Let me say at the outset, <span class="emphasis">yearning</span> is defined “to have a strong or deep desire; be filled with longing.” This missionary seemed very sincere in wanting to do better. Proper yearnings for home can be beneficial.</p>

We let ourselves become homesick for love, acceptance, security, understanding, and guidance that generally are taught and shared there. Home should be the place in which a person can unburden his soul and find renewed strength to face the world, where there is comfort, joy, and understanding, where best friends live, and where we can learn to be our best selves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-yearning-for-home.p5" pid="r8QFuZ4bXkGOClTDmng_bg" hash="NwLS3A">There is a certain kind of yearning for home we should never want to lose. Home should be an anchor, a port in a storm, a refuge, a happy place in which to dwell, a place where we are loved and where we can love. Home should be where life’s greatest lessons are taught and learned. Home and family can be the center of one’s earthly faith, where love and mutual responsibility are appropriately blended. Thinking of home with its pleasant and happy memories can make us stronger during our present and future days here upon the earth.</p>

It is unfortunate that among us we have people who have never experienced home life that has been and is desirable so that there can be an anxiousness under control for thoughts toward home. Our responsibilities are to share the warmth of our homes by being good neighbors and friends.</p>

It rained every day and was very cold and wet. Even so, there was no murmuring in the camp. The last day of the conference, the leader addressed the young women under cloudy skies. Despite the unseasonable cold, there was a feeling of warmth among them for this their temporary home. Maybe because of the cold, they were all drawn together and felt warm from the inside out.</p>

Even the prodigal son could not resist the pull of home. He spurned his father, his home life, and his heritage, lavishly wasting his inheritance on riotous living. When he had nothing and was reduced to living off the spoils that only swine would eat, his thoughts turned homeward. Could there have been moments, as he gleaned the fields for husks to eat, when he longed for the security, safety, and acceptance he’d had before? Might he have been deeply homesick? Repentant, and hoping his father would accept him as a servant, he finally returned home. His father rejoiced, welcoming him back with open arms and complete acceptance. He no doubt knew that welcoming his wayward son was crucial if he hoped to ever return to his heavenly home. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.11-32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:11–32</a>.)</p>

It’s natural to miss the people you are closest to. It’s normal to long to be where you feel secure, where those you love have your best interests at heart. It’s understandable to want to return to the place where you learned how to walk and talk, where you felt loved even when friends turned away, and where you were accepted, regardless of the situation. There’s no place on earth that can take the place of a home where love has been given and received.</p>

Tens of thousands of people have lost their homes. Armed forces personnel have raised tent cities to try and at least provide these victims with shelter. But the sobering fact is that, at least for a time, many of these people literally cannot go home. I cannot imagine how they must yearn for what they so recently had.</p>

He would have us become involved in a million and one things in this life—probably none of which are very important in the long run—to keep us from concentrating on the things that are really important, particularly the reality that we are God’s children. He would like us to forget about home and family values. He’d like to keep us so busy with comparatively insignificant things that we don’t have time to make the effort to understand where we came from, whose children we are, and how glorious our ultimate homecoming can be!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-yearning-for-home.p21" pid="8i0EiYRi0ES4liQ75EzDxg" hash="Gwj8rQ">We are literally the children of our Heavenly Father. We kept our first estate. During our experience in premortality, we lived and were cared for and taught by a loving Father. Among other things, we were schooled in what had to be a perfect spiritual and educational environment. And we rejoiced when told of the plan whereby we could prove ourselves. Hence the day arrived when it was our turn to experience a period of probation and testing, a period during which a veil would be drawn over our memories so that we would be free either to walk by faith and by the Spirit or to forsake our spiritual heritage and birthright.</p>

And I’m sure we would all agree that this second estate has lived up to its billing. It is a time of testing, of probation. The challenges and duties and responsibilities, at times, seem to overshadow almost everything else. Sadly, it’s easy to become so encumbered by the press of daily life that we lose our focus.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-yearning-for-home.p23" pid="OI1e2c2t00ajmhasqJiN4Q" hash="dcu7QA">One definition of the word <span class="emphasis">focus</span> is “directed attention,” or “emphasis.” Perhaps as much as anything in this day and age of mass media, instantaneous worldwide communications, and modern conveniences that seem to help us pack more into each day than would have been considered possible just a few decades ago, we need to focus and direct our attention to the things that really matter. And simply, what really matters is a personal testimony of Jesus Christ, an understanding of who we are and what we’re doing here, and an absolute determination to return home.</p>

Who’s just a little more concerned about his or her status and standing in mortality than in eternity. Whose focus is not directed to God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, with whom it is possible to have a glorious connection and bond.</p>

C. S. Lewis had an intriguing way of evaluating this dilemma: “We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. … We are far too easily pleased.” (<span class="emphasis">A Mind Awake,</span> New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1968, p. 168.)</p>

Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that misery which never dies—because of the praise of the world?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.38" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:38</a>.)</p>
