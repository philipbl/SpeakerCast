      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/to-become-one-of-the-fishers.p1" guid="151d0b56-3bb5-43f4-a894-8e973b0731dc" pid="LoJtW23L00G3SMzhT5AWIA" hash="YwaS2Q">My beloved brothers and sisters and friends: It has been a sublime and moving experience to participate in sustaining President Lee and his counselors yesterday morning as the new First Presidency of the Church, and I humbly entreat the same spirit to sustain me for these very few moments while I respond.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/to-become-one-of-the-fishers.p2" guid="e5e062c5-765c-42d6-8b8d-1a56e06acdfc" pid="erdsfbFsb0a4SHr3GaWwew" hash="UrdFeA">Since President Lee notified me of my call in the most moving and touching experience of my life last Thursday morning, there have come to me the most solemn broodings that can come to a human soul. I have asked myself a hundred times, Why me?—because it is beyond my understanding that I should be asked to join these great brethren of the General Authorities, all of whom I hold in such great esteem.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/to-become-one-of-the-fishers.p3" guid="c4a5163a-1953-4554-afa4-2b89625bf160" pid="iu9moRxw7kSFhD5NeVfC9g" hash="IGT_9g">I pray that God will have mercy upon me because of my weakness and shortcomings. As long as I remember I have had a personal witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and of his church, and it has always been easy for me to believe and to testify. I have concluded that if there is one amongst all the General Authorities who is the weakest and the least qualified, then I can fill that position. Also, because I served in Brazil on a mission, I am the only one who speaks Portuguese.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/to-become-one-of-the-fishers.p4" guid="9b0c42b0-d22b-487f-8af9-8fd6146ae851" pid="BxMmhD_nJkmpo3nfq4dNUg" hash="A9PAUQ">With all my heart I want to thank Ruth Wright Faust for letting me share her life and giving me the hope that we can share eternity together. She is more than a wife and a sweetheart because she has become part of my very being. With all my heart I want my children to know that I cannot succeed in this calling unless I also succeed as their father, and that they will always be paramount in my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/to-become-one-of-the-fishers.p5" guid="573cb977-f04b-4366-adce-cdcf83ff07dd" pid="bKNe2cG8wE22X5_-2kd7KQ" hash="ijgiFw">No man ever had a better father than did I, and I hope that I will always honor his good name. My widowed mother is among you in the television audience, and I am sure that she weeps. Many times in my childhood I have happened upon her on her knees, praying for her five sons, and I wish to tell her that this son continues to need her faith and prayers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/to-become-one-of-the-fishers.p6" guid="129f0a11-b271-4850-9c56-70130a755ff0" pid="CWTrzDOYHEOuXn-W3tfiLQ" hash="bFqCGw">I realize that life for me and mine can never and should never be the same. For twenty-two years and until last Thursday morning I have been a lawyer, and since then I have been trying to repent. Now I shall try to become one of the fishers and help these brethren cast forth and draw in the nets of eternal life. And I should like to say that if anyone has ever been offended by anything I have ever done in my church, professional, or political life, I humbly ask their forgiveness. I mentioned to a friend of mine who knew of this call that those who know me will say, “Surely James Faust was called of the Lord because no one else would have called him.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/to-become-one-of-the-fishers.p7" guid="61036d6e-8d5e-4d7b-8cbf-74ac48268eca" pid="gsL4jjsTqEWCyl_LKm3E9A" hash="e5VlEA">I wish President Lee to know that I sustain him, and He whom President Lee represents, with all of my devotion and all of my heart and all of my being. Under his hands I was ordained a bishop, and by him called to the stake presidency, and he has been for me all my adult life a great and beloved teacher and exemplar for all that is noble and good. President Tanner has been like a father to me, ever available, always helpful, kind, considerate, and he knows how much love and respect I have for him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/to-become-one-of-the-fishers.p8" guid="166e20d2-d138-4db8-8791-70d39f64e0bd" pid="eT7jyiWxUEyf-50yvjTAfQ" hash="OAdPXQ">President Romney, as you know, has special qualities of inspiration and wisdom and has been a special friend and confidant, and my respect and honor for him know no bounds. I would also like to mention the profound influence that President Henry D. Moyle and President Hugh B. Brown have had also on my life. These are and have been truly great men of the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/to-become-one-of-the-fishers.p9" guid="b5e6f941-a55f-48ac-ad7a-90c5053b4bb3" pid="SY1xektn9k-7aFR1LuWKzw" hash="0KSEmA">I express appreciation to all the host of people who have blessed my life, those from whom I have learned, my missionary companions, those with whom I served in bishoprics, on high councils, stake presidencies, and my beloved friends, the Regional Representatives of the Twelve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/to-become-one-of-the-fishers.p10" guid="70067091-d4f7-4948-ac60-2ac0c0888f49" pid="VcHqbbfzl0m5WZzLOa11aQ" hash="PXdPfA">Now as a humble follower of the divine Master, I bear witness to the divinity of him as the Savior of the world, and of his church as established in these days, now headed by President Harold B. Lee, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <description>My beloved brethren, I am humbled and honored by the transcending privilege of being able to speak to you in this great assemblage of the priesthood.</description>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p1" guid="27bcb278-25b6-440b-8817-3c83344fee2d" pid="5GyxKP60sEmwQD-U7T_UeQ" hash="KYItug">My beloved brethren, I am humbled and honored by the transcending privilege of being able to speak to you in this great assemblage of the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p2" guid="812dbbb7-7813-4b3e-a958-ec18a32a5846" pid="iRECwu-sQ0WA5jR-hYyzJg" hash="zBSB7g">I express appreciation to the First Presidency for the assignment that I share with my choice colleagues, Elders Marion D. Hanks and L. Tom Perry, to have concern for the adult single members of the Church over 18 who have, on occasion, been referred to as the “forgotten ones.” I am grateful to our advisers of the Twelve, Elders Thomas S. Monson, Boyd K. Packer, Marvin J. Ashton, and Bruce R. McConkie, for their constant interest and support, and to our director, Jeffrey R. Holland, as well as to the faithful and dedicated members of the general board.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p3" guid="0a20c80c-8d96-4652-ba91-61b2390f3b9e" pid="w3zRw-qvKk6J2UqCNvicaw" hash="-0Cb9w">During the past few months, we have spent many hours listening. Most of the single adult members are well adjusted to life and its problems, but they still need the loving attention from the Church and its members to reaffirm their usefulness and the love that God has for each of them. They are not problem people, but many have problems, often not of their own making. A choice friend reminds us, “If you don’t have any problems, just wait awhile.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p4" guid="ad2eea25-b7aa-4880-bd24-a7ea37c37bb6" pid="HPmjmzl6GEarC3Jd69xU0Q" hash="97je3g">We have been deeply moved and sobered as we have heard a common thread running through the expressions of many of the single adults. Loneliness and discouragement are for some their most constant companions. One great soul who has a good bishop, a good home teacher, a good position, and comfortable circumstances said, “I don’t need more to do; I just need someone to do it with.” This becomes a matter of great concern when we consider that approximately one-third of the adults in the United States are single.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p5" guid="9aba0cbd-cedc-4756-ab88-240e4e27d190" pid="pGY038SkH0i7wPvO1V9FCQ" hash="wedeqw">The proper and rightful focus of the Church on the home and the family frequently causes the single members who have no companion and family to feel left out. One writes, “Many members of the Church treat a divorcee as if she had leprosy. I have lived in a certain LDS ward in Salt Lake for several years, where they had a widows’ and widowers’ party every year at Christmas time. I was never invited. I have always lived a good life and believe the Savior would have invited me. I am acquainted with some who have experienced both death and divorce, and they say that divorce is worse than death.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p6" guid="7cddc626-b129-4489-9bbb-2a3c2f39ce69" pid="vwUN1ZtwcUivQ6tMPgJXUQ" hash="AyuJIg">Still another writes, “Believe me, with the Church emphasis on families and children, we are already thoroughly aware that we are ‘oddballs.’ It has been a real pleasure to be accepted as a normal person.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p7" guid="7d786158-9a19-4db6-946a-205d4bb90d4d" pid="oQ2uikeLXk6zstYG7WRVdg" hash="lPTeEw">We must begin by trying to reach the one—every single individual. We want all to feel that they belong to the Church in the context of Paul’s message to the Ephesians: “… ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:19</a>.) In our minds we draw two circles: one for the Young Adults, who are of the ages 18 to 25 and include all, whether at home, away from home, on campus, on missions, or in the military, within the circle. We draw another circle and include all of those age 26 and over in the Special Interests, whether never married, widow, widower, or divorced. Everyone who is single belongs in one of these two circles. There are none who are outside the circles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p8" guid="08846e88-5bb9-40c1-a854-ba4618924d51" pid="DXs9WjltPkiQJCOAScACcg" hash="DAGNAg">Brother Hanks recently reminded us of how the Lord directed Ananias to the one. Ananias was sent to the street called Straight to restore the sight of Saul of Tarsus, stricken blind at the time of his conversion. Ananias responded by reminding the Lord of how much evil Saul had done. The Lord said, “Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me. …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/9.15" class="scriptureRef">Acts 9:15</a>.) Paul states that Ananias “came unto me, … and said unto me, Brother Saul. …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/22.13" class="scriptureRef">Acts 22:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p9" guid="0c2fb588-4f5b-4aee-9df3-eb1feebbcc04" pid="ZA3-7h_UU02ae3_c7ide8w" hash="ngWMMg">Somehow we must reach the one—every single one—for they are “chosen vessels” unto the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p10" guid="90028d2b-efa1-48a7-a040-db79aea5adb1" pid="829n2GTCAka8vjyDP9X9Bw" hash="cVtHlw">Speaking to the single members, President Lee recently said, “In your ranks are some of the noblest members of the Church—faithful, valiant, striving to live the Lord’s commandments, to help build up the kingdom on earth, and to serve your fellowmen.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p11" guid="bfda9473-d268-4b32-aac6-ad670c9bc72a" pid="RHbf850dE0KDzm6Fd8YP3A" hash="XKccZA">As we undertake to reach the one, we should remember the counsel of the Lord to Samuel, as he was sent to the house of Jesse to find the one who should reign over Israel. The Lord said to Samuel, “Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature … , for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 16:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p12" guid="72b3baf4-4e4e-4157-89d7-9cf10438eb16" pid="3GVkg8JxFkyvk41muyz9TQ" hash="y0fREA">We believe that each single adult member of the Church may be reached through three fundamental principles: (1) priesthood direction and correlation, (2) individual involvement, and (3) flexibility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p13" guid="47750bfd-93fb-40b7-820b-9c24f6259f44" pid="GLYc_0lfK0G7Cd1pXFvjEQ" hash="3HM9pA">All activities will function under the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p14" guid="9a0afec8-f420-4e6c-97e2-fe07fabd1994" pid="HMgFbJOn8UGBU5gg6e_DmQ" hash="VEUUOw">Under the principle of individual involvement, priesthood leaders will advise and direct, but should encourage the growth and development of the single adults by delegating to them all appropriate responsibility in conceiving, planning, preparing, and executing their activities. This should be done within the context of the recent teaching of the General Authorities by President Lee, when he referred to the scripture, “Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.99" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:99</a>.) President Lee placed the emphasis on <span class="emphasis">let, </span>in the sense of permitting or allowing those given responsibilities to function within their callings without unnecessary restrictions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p15" guid="1c36d8fd-44e1-46db-9a16-1e7df0ab0fd3" pid="0qgNmVOX5Ei585seJnFQGA" hash="46IxKw">It is hoped that priesthood leaders will make things happen by letting or permitting single members to involve themselves in planning and carrying out their activities locally, directed toward service. Through service, wounds can be turned into muscles for living. Leaders from the single members’ groups themselves must be sufficiently innovative and creative to involve each one.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p16" guid="b7428a28-5420-4618-b261-81057cadbb29" pid="97UX1xgK2USLa4BGe1LngA" hash="RBMiPg">There may be complete flexibility in age groupings and in organizing according to their specific interests.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p17" guid="51673fd4-0772-4c43-a8f3-01cdf1db9829" pid="EfDQFZFFW0ehyXj3RFhE7w" hash="Rc0MTA">It is not intended that detailed programs will be sent out from Church headquarters. We hope to be sending principles, options, and models for local implementation into local programs and to stimulate other activities. Elder Packer suggests that you are being sent a cookbook, rather than a casserole. We will be asking the stake presidents to share their successful recipes with others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p18" guid="8ff7b4b2-fa3f-41ec-80c6-5832ef42cc89" pid="yj6qw479fkWj_61TBZnIhg" hash="IOMHnQ">There are limitless opportunities and possibilities within the concepts of the principles announced, which can be summed up in the statement of the Prophet Joseph Smith when asked how he governed his people. His response was, “I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p19" guid="8526ee78-2207-4782-a68f-09f674802918" pid="co-eVIND10a1lc-j1dL-wA" hash="LdljeQ">The First Presidency has recently authorized ward leaders to organize single adults not living at home for family home evening, with one designated as the leader. It was made clear that the group should not be called a family and the leader cannot appropriately be designated as a father. Monday evening will be the most convenient for these groups to meet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p20" guid="ccad8d24-bbe1-4e05-a49d-3faf0406b23c" pid="YiPy2iDVCkSN6gwYI-cpiQ" hash="q2yU1Q">There has been complete cooperation between Bishop Brown and his counselors directing Aaronic Priesthood MIA, Sister Spafford and her counselors in the Relief Society, and the managing directors of Melchizedek Priesthood MIA. We are all interested in having our combined efforts fit together with all other Church activities in the interest of all members of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p21" guid="9f68811d-9644-4219-9b4f-c3afc162eede" pid="kGHclMiiy0Wzg2Xpt0UBbw" hash="2K3JvA">Within the next few weeks, priesthood leaders throughout the Church will be receiving more detailed instructions from the First Presidency for the implementation of the adult single members’ activities of the Church. All will wish to study these instructions carefully and to follow them. One stake president, who has been leading out in these activities, recently said, “This program is not more work for the priesthood leaders, but it is an aid to them, if they will let the single members themselves organize and plan their own activities.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p22" guid="7fed2ff3-2784-4f70-9669-589863fa0542" pid="EgIVe69PgU-1PupTvyx7mQ" hash="rDDiww">What is proposed is a way to reach the one and have each feel that someone cares and that each has a place in the Lord’s church. Too often we are thoughtless and insensitive to the feelings of these choice souls among us. One well-meaning priesthood leader, concerned about one of these choice single women, whose heart was aching for companionship and a more fulfilling life, asked, “Why don’t you get a husband?” She replied in good humor, “Brother, I would love to, but I can’t go pick one off a tree.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p23" guid="f6b9f7fa-2ffe-41d7-8d1f-1ea7013fd647" pid="yHbnd-j2NEupMElHBfsvlg" hash="Gw2__A">Reaching the one will involve reaching out in many ways. Recent research indicates that 40 percent of the 18- to 22-year-olds feel that they do not have a single friend they can rely upon. Gerald A. Speedy, commenting on this problem, said, “Think what it would be like not to have a single friend. It is almost impossible to comprehend. Without a friend, a person is in a state of potential crisis.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/reaching-the-one.p24" guid="a1f27751-72c2-48f7-8752-110a9996b159" pid="GzmPLq1AaEqUW_CiJwHDlg" hash="Poen2w">I bear solemn witness to the divinity of this great and marvelous work and to the continuing inspiration that has come from the Lord through his chosen prophet, who has been far ahead of all of the thinking and the planning that has been done. Somehow, some way, we must reach the one, every single one, for they are “chosen vessels” unto the Lord. President Lee’s message to the single members is sublime: “To you, the words of the Master have a special meaning: ‘He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.’” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/10.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 10:39</a>.) That this may be so, I pray humbly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

One night he came home from work, faced with the problems of being both father and mother and felt unusually burdened with his responsibilities. One of his appreciative little girls, age 12 years, approached him eagerly, after having laid a rock on his dresser, which she had painted at school. On the flat portion of the rock she had written, “Happiness is having a dad who cares.” This painted rock and its sublime message instantly and permanently lightened the burden of this father.</p>

Liebowitz, to both of whom I give full acknowledgement, in an article appearing in the <span class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest </span>entitled “Nine Words That Can Stop Juvenile Delinquency.” The nine words suggested by the judge were, “Put father back at the head of the family.” President Richards concluded from the article “that the primary reasons for reduced percentages of juvenile delinquency in certain European countries, was a respect for authority in the home, which normally reposes in the father as head of the family.” President Richards continued: “For generations in the Church, we have been endeavoring to do just what the judge advocates, to put and keep the father at the head of the family, and with all our might, we have been trying to make him fit for that high and heavy responsibility.” Since the primary purpose of the Church is to help the family and its members, how well the father functions in his responsibility is of utmost importance.</p>

In all the world, there is no higher or greater honor or responsibility than motherhood. It is to be hoped that they too will have their powerful influence extended to even a greater degree within the home and beyond the home.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/happiness-is-having-a-father-who-cares.p6" guid="be89b63a-886d-4324-aeb7-0697d020a27f" pid="vrmuMWuYk0Ow1YVGg9DLWw" hash="LUwEQw">There are some voices in our society who would demean some of the attributes of masculinity. A few of these are women who mistakenly believe that they build their own feminine causes by tearing down the image of manhood. This has serious social overtones, because a primary problem in the insecurity of both sons and daughters can be the diminution of the role of the father image.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/happiness-is-having-a-father-who-cares.p7" guid="a385651d-e2fe-4bd0-9f72-a3c84bec6a10" pid="p4B1jHyiuUWQug16jE6v4Q" hash="l3eqeQ">Let every mother understand that if she does anything to diminish her children’s father or the father’s image in the eyes of the children, it may injure and do irreparable damage to the self-esteem and personal security of the children themselves. How infinitely more productive and satisfying it is for a woman to build up her husband rather than tear him down. You women are so superior to men in so many ways that you demean yourselves by posturing or belittling masculinity and manhood.</p>

Everyone knows fathers make mistakes—especially they themselves. Fathers are in need of all the help they can get; mostly they need love, support, and understanding from their own.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/happiness-is-having-a-father-who-cares.p9" guid="58ac6340-f896-43e4-95f2-42bc70b14662" pid="zHzhtEZ4qkqgVexJmlcv8g" hash="rT8xzQ">President Harold B. Lee has said, “Most men do not set priorities to guide them in allocating their time and most men forget that the first priority should be to maintain their own spiritual and physical strength; then comes their family; then the Church and then their professions, and all need time.” (<span class="emphasis">Bishop’s Training Course and Self-Help Guide, </span>sec. 2, p. 7.) In giving time to his children, a father should be able to demonstrate that he has enough love for his children to command as well as discipline them. Children want and need discipline. As they approach some dangers, they are silently pleading, “Don’t let me do it.” President [David O.] McKay said that if we do not adequately discipline our children, society will discipline them in a way we may not like. Wise discipline reinforces the dimensions of eternal love. This reinforcement will bring great security and stability into their lives.</p>

Recently, Elder Boyd K. Packer said to the single members of the Church, “We talk a lot about families. Sometimes in bitterness, you will want to say ‘all this talk about families, but I don’t have a family, and … ,’ stop there! Don’t add that extra phrase, ‘I wish they would stop talking so much about families.’ You pray that we do keep talking about families; about fathers and mothers and children and family home evening, temple marriage and companionship and all of the rest, because all of that will be yours. If we stop talking about it, then you, among all others, will be the losers.” (Melchizedek Priesthood MIA Conference, June 1973.)</p>

Recently I set apart the chief of police of a large city to serve as bishop for the second time. One of the women who was in the room at the time commented afterwards that she found it a little strange for the chief of police to be a bishop. The next morning in a conference meeting, the bishop responded by saying that he found nothing incompatible as chief of police with being bishop. He said that as chief of police he needed all of the help and guidance he could get from his ecclesiastical office as a spiritual father. He further said that he recommended the same source of help for all police chiefs.</p>

A soldier destroys in order to build. A father only builds, never destroys. The one has the potentiality of death; the other embodies creation and life. And while the hordes of death are mighty, the battalions of life are mightier still. It is my hope that my son, when I am gone, will remember me, not for the battle, but in the home repeating with him, our simple, daily prayer, ‘Our Father Who art in Heaven.’” (Emerson Roy West, <span class="emphasis">Vital Quotations, </span>Bookcraft, Inc., 1968.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/happiness-is-having-a-father-who-cares.p13" guid="48dbd4c2-6db4-4a78-89f2-43df99445497" pid="jF_hG_rPUUCuoVrjKkiqsw" hash="RE5LXQ">It is important to remember that in this Church, the husbands and fathers, and members of the family through them, enjoy a power and influence in their lives, far beyond the natural gifts of intellect and character of the father. I refer to the priesthood of God, which every worthy man and boy over 12 years of age enjoys.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/happiness-is-having-a-father-who-cares.p14" guid="e7ead5e4-38b3-4d41-a94b-57c2d4609ada" pid="YTSKy0Q2hEuK0gLH7B-e3Q" hash="8HA_Dg">A prominent Church and business leader in this community was born without life. His father, exercising his priesthood, made a promise that if his firstborn could live, that he, the father, would do all in his power to provide the proper example and teachings for his son. After a few minutes his infant son began to breathe and is well and vigorous to this day.</p>

The conscientious women of this Church wish to have such a righteous influence in abundance in their homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/happiness-is-having-a-father-who-cares.p16" guid="d21b1a4b-fc6e-432c-8184-e9f1629736ac" pid="Zz9OfwO3EEuVyNGQq-0K_w" hash="p6B6ng">Just a few weeks ago, in a stake conference, one gracious mother joyously recounted a marvelous experience of being in one of the temples with her husband and with all of her children but one and being sealed together as husband and wife and family for time and all eternity. Her husband, newly involved in the priesthood, sat in the conference audience a few rows back. For a moment she seemed to forget all of the rest of us and spoke only to him. Over the pulpit, and through the loudspeaker, with over 1,000 people in tears watching and listening, she said, “John, the children and I don’t know how to tell you what you mean to us. Until you honored the priesthood, the greatest blessings of eternity would not open up for us. Now they have. We all love you very much and we thank you with all our hearts for what you have made possible for us.”</p>

One little fellow was approached to see if he would be willing to go down and rescue the one who was lodged. The lad said, “I am scared to go in that hole, but I will go if my father will hold the rope.”</p>

Evans gave the proper dimension for all fathers in this faith when he said, “First of all, fathers are for giving a name and a heritage to their children—clean and honorable. Fathers are for long, hard work. Mostly their own kind of work. For not being home so much as mothers; for seeming to be pretty busy; and for trying to give their children the things their fathers never had. Fathers are for talking with, for encouraging; for putting arms around; for understanding mistakes, but not condoning them; for disciplining when needed, then loving all the more; for being strong and forceful, and for being tender and gentle.” (Emerson Roy West, <span class="emphasis">Vital Quotations.</span>)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/a-new-aristocracy.p2" pid="E-UWXdat7km30Y5MIee3ug" hash="ISsM9Q">For many centuries these countries have been considered to be among the most enlightened and advanced in the history of the world. Their peoples have made great contributions to the comfort, well-being, and culture of society. But, as in America and so many other countries, there is in these countries evidence of a sickening plague which is sapping, if not destroying, the life blood of humanity. The plague about which I speak seems most obvious among many of the young people, of youth and young adult age, although it is by no means limited to them. I refer to the steady, creeping moral dry rot which is manifested in the obscenity of their behavior and dress and in the debasing entertainment and the centers of pornography which they frequent. Many of these young people appear not only as vulgar, but dirty and repulsive. They have “freaked out.” Many seem to have forsaken all that is decent and possess a moral sickness and cynicism which is crippling and strangling to the enlightened human soul. They are eager participants in all of the repulsive and degrading practices which God has warned humanity against throughout the ages.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/a-new-aristocracy.p3" pid="gckJomyaMkaYI-Iu5l9ylA" hash="SeLeRw">There seem to be few countries in this world whose people have escaped this plague, for it is epidemic in proportion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/a-new-aristocracy.p4" pid="F1ZnZ2hNP0Gdw-4n6isxag" hash="AQhIIg">In great contrast to the low scenes in some of the streets, when we assembled in St. Erik’s Fair Center in Stockholm where 4,000 members of this Church had assembled, there was a completely different spirit and appearance. The youth and young adults at this great conference, along with the others participating, sang, danced, and demonstrated the best of themselves and their culture in a most delightful and uplifting manner. As we looked into their happy, clean, and appealing countenances and felt their enlightened presence, they radiated great moral strength and beauty. They reflected an inner light, even like the quartz prisms their Viking forefathers used to refract the rays of the sun when it was below the horizon to enable them to get their bearings. These youth and young adults are part of an almost worldwide new aristocracy—as the elect of God—who know that the source of all light is divine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/a-new-aristocracy.p5" pid="6KHU5DPzBU-PRe2sucArwA" hash="--ZBUw">The message I wish to speak today is one of hope. It concerns a conviction as well as a challenge that the youth, young adults, and young marrieds of this Church who believe in and follow its lofty purposes as a part of this new aristocracy will, by their influence and example, begin to reverse this spreading moral dry rot the world over.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/a-new-aristocracy.p6" pid="lOtC4eP1X0y9UCUTuk0OYw" hash="ey1HpA">In a letter to John Quincy Adams in 1813, Thomas Jefferson said: “There is a natural aristocracy among men. The grounds of this are virtue and talents. There is also an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth, without either virtue or talents.” (Thomas Jefferson, <span class="emphasis">Writings,</span> 13:396.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/a-new-aristocracy.p7" pid="a4ODWqCH-k22om6SXOMsYw" hash="SEpH1g">How is this new aristocracy distinguished? First, that no one need be excluded. It is formed from those who seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit of God. President Romney teaches us that there are three things we should know about such guidance: He says, “They are: (1) that it is very real, (2) that it is available to every person, and (3) that to follow it is the sure and only way to the solution of our problems.” (<span class="emphasis">Speeches of the Year,</span> Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 11 Jan. 1961, p. 2.)</p>

The new aristocracy will not be seeking to eliminate thoughtful inquiry, or be a board of censors as it were, but rather seek to teach right concepts and to replace bad ideas with enlightened thought. They will be involved in noble and selfless activities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/a-new-aristocracy.p9" pid="YLD6DulwGUuhxu9Y4cG69g" hash="QWdjTw">About a month ago four of the Young Adults gathered in Loughborough for a Young Adults conference, along with others from all over England. This group of four went to perform, as did the others, some unsolicited Christian service. Their intended activity, through no fault of their own, could not be performed, so they were left with some time on their hands. While walking along the street, they decided to stop at a pay telephone and call the local public hospital to see if they could be of help. A nurse in one of the wards answered the telephone and was asked by the one calling if four young people could come over to the hospital and scrub floors or walls, wash dishes, or do any other similar needed task without pay.

Kimball and set styles of their own, no matter how great the peer pressure is. They will not be moved in their inner strength by the cynics, bereft of spirituality, who portray those who believe in God as being stupid, misguided, uninformed, and unsophisticated. This new aristocracy is not led astray or intimidated by the sophistries of the insincere, the hypocritical, or the self-righteous. They will remember the counsel of Brigham Young, who said: “I would put you on your guard against those who wear a long face, and pretend to be so holy, and so much better than every body else—they cannot look pleasant because they are full of the devil. Those who have got the forgiveness of their sins have countenances that look bright, and they will shine with the intelligence of heaven.” (<span class="emphasis">Times and Seasons,</span> 6:956.) The words of the Prophet Joseph Smith will be remembered, “I love that man better who swears a stream as long as my arm yet deals justice to his neighbors and mercifully deals his substance to the poor, than the long, smooth-faced hypocrite.” (<span class="emphasis">History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</span> 5:401.)</p>

They live lives of productivity and usefulness. Approximately 18,000 of them presently perform a matchless service as missionaries at considerable monetary sacrifice to themselves and/or their loved ones. In the last fortnight I have been privileged to meet with some 200 of them laboring in a foreign country.

The missionaries found this family, and they joined the Church and I joined with them. I began to save my money so that if called on a mission, I might be able to go. I worked hard and was able to save much faster than I thought I could. Two years after my conversion, I am serving as a missionary.”</p>

A very special young friend of mine served as a missionary of this Church in Japan. His dedication to missionary work and the Japanese people was so complete and full that, rather than spend all of the money his parents sent to him, he unselfishly made a regular contribution of part of his money to help another local Japanese missionary. His parents sent him extra money so that he could buy some camera equipment available in Japan to record in pictures a few of the great experiences he was having. Rather than buy the camera equipment, which would have served him well for a lifetime, he chose rather to send the money back to his parents. In time, as with most missionaries, the clothes of my young friend became threadbare and thin. In order for him to be able to come home, it was necessary for him to buy a second-hand suit from one of the other elders. His regular denial of himself, in order to share his substance with the local Japanese missionary, was a very closely guarded secret. He is a good example of the young elect of God of this Church, as are hundreds of thousands of others.</p>

I desire also to speak with reverence about the hallowed hallmark of life, which is the ability to reproduce itself. I wish also to be an advocate for the unborn. For this reason I direct my remarks primarily to women, because only they can honor the holy calling of motherhood, which is the most exalted good that can be rendered to mankind.</p>

Since the beginning of man, God has taught of an absolute respect for human life. From the very first moment of his being until the last breath of his life, there is a veneration for life which includes those in being, but not yet born.</p>

Obligations inherent in the creation of precious human life are a sacred trust, which if faithfully kept, will keep us from degenerating into moral bankrupts and from becoming mere addicts of lust.</p>

Those who do not accept and meet those responsibilities, for any reason, as well as those who do, should never depart from the law of chastity if they wish to be truly happy. All members of this Church seeking eternal joy and peace are expected to and will wish to come to the marriage altar free from sexual transgressions—chaste and pure. Any who fail to do so may find that they have cheated themselves of their own self-respect, dignity, and much of the great joy they seek in marriage. Because of the special inner peace, strength, and happiness it brings, chastity, as the law of God, is and always has been really “in,” and unchastity is and always has been really “out.”</p>

But making it legal to destroy newly conceived life will never make it right. It is consummately wrong.</p>

This is contrary to insurmountable medical evidence. Dr. Bernard N. Nathanson recently revealed that he was among those who were militantly outspoken in favor of legalized abortion and joined in using every device available in political action to promote it. He helped set up and became director of the first and largest abortion clinic in the western world. After the center had performed some sixty thousand abortions, Dr. Nathanson resigned as director. He said, “I am deeply troubled by my own increasing certainty that I had in fact presided over 60,000 deaths. There is no longer serious doubt in my mind that human life exists within the womb from the very onset of pregnancy.” (<span class="emphasis">New England Journal of Medicine,</span> vol. 291, no. 22, p. 1189.)</p>

There is also life in the spirit, and some time before birth the body and the spirit are united. When they do come together, we have a human soul. For the Lord has said, “And the spirit and the body are the soul of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:15</a>.)</p>

(Dr. James H. Ford, M.D., <span class="emphasis">California Medical Journal,</span> Nov. 1972, pp. 80–84.) Some justify abortions because the unborn may have been exposed to drugs or disease and may have birth defects. Where in all the world is the physically or mentally perfect man or woman? Is life not worth living unless it is free of handicaps? Experience in working with handicapped children would suggest that human nature frequently rises above its impediments and that in Shakespeare’s words, “They say best men are molded out of faults, And, for the most, become much more the better For being a little bad” (<span class="emphasis">Measure for Measure,</span> 5, i, 445) in the physical sense.</p>

What a great gift to mankind the life of Helen Keller brought.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-sanctity-of-life.p17" pid="qiCEyIhZFEycyaasPfNUUA" hash="guWzFg">It is the belief of those who are members of this Church that human life is so hallowed and precious that there is an accountability to God on the part of those who invoke the sacred fountains of life.</p>

I quote, “Abortion must be considered one of the most revolting and sinful practices in this day. … Members of the Church guilty of being parties to the sin of abortion must be subjected to the disciplinary action of the councils of the Church as circumstances warrant.” Members are counseled neither “to submit to or perform an abortion except in the rare cases where” it is medically necessary, and, as the First Presidency has further counseled, “even then it should be done only after counseling with the local presiding priesthood authority and after receiving divine confirmation through prayer.” The First Presidency has advised that it will be amenable to the laws of repentance and forgiveness. (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> March 1973, p. 64.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-sanctity-of-life.p19" pid="aVbEHP2ZgkOFt2UiTxv9BQ" hash="Y3RSOA">It is my feeling that we grossly underestimate the sacred nature of motherhood. Psychiatric experts remind us that there are certain fundamental, biological facts which influence the psyche of those who bring new life into the world. One says, “The ability of mothers to accept infants after they are born is underrated and underestimated.” (Dr. S. Bolter, <span class="emphasis">American Journal of Psychiatry,</span> Oct. 1962, pp. 312–16.) Childbearing is a basic biological and psychological, privileged function of womankind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-sanctity-of-life.p20" pid="pEzjodHhAU-PDq0mS7Y-Tw" hash="BbjGdg">One of the most evil myths of our day is that a woman who has joined hands with God in creation can destroy that creation because she claims the right to control her own body. Since the life within her is not her own, how can she justify its termination and deflect that life from an earth which it may never inherit?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-sanctity-of-life.p21" pid="JKZC5KKE-UO5NkQ35pXydA" hash="dwJzBA">The great medical profession, for which I have such great respect, that for centuries has been committed to the preservation of life under the cardinal principles of treatment—“do no harm” and “protect life”—now finds itself destroying almost a million unborn children a year in the United States alone. Each of these, because of tiny chromosomal differences, would have been different from any other person born in the world. How many with special gifts like unto Moses, Leonardo da Vinci, and Abraham Lincoln might have been among them?</p>

One great physician says, “We do that much for seagulls, flamingos and whooping cranes.” This same physician, Dr. Henry G. Armitage, Jr., states, “Not without comment shall it come to pass that a state (so fretful for the preservation of the praying mantis but holding an unborn baby to be of no account) can send a spark of immortality swinging out into limbo and conspire with citizen and physician to turn a fragile, living object of simple innocence and complex wonder into a pathetic pulp and consign it by rude and peremptory passage to the furnace or sewer—unknown, unwanted [and] undefended.” He further questions how a woman as “the fertile adornment of our race can be deluded into the notion that she is a mere portress of unwanted luggage or be by blandishment seduced into believing that she has dominion over life not her own.” He says, “An abortion is never commonplace, for the world holds no heartbreak like the death of innocence. Whenever and wherever it occurs, we all suffer another loss from that little which sustains us and holds us together. It is the degradation of humanity. It is fulness emptied, innocence defiled, song unfinished, beauty discarded, hope unsprung. In our absence, housebreakers are robbing us of everything that we own: of virtue, honor, integrity, trust, innocence, truth, beauty, justice and liberty.” (Dr. Henry G. Armitage, Jr., <span class="emphasis">The Death of Innocence.</span>)</p>

For the Savior of the world said, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these … ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>.)</p>

These pegs in the ground mark the dimensions of a new temple soon to be erected for the glory of God and the endless blessing of his children in South America. This temple will be different from any other building now standing in South America.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-keys-of-the-kingdom.p2" pid="9hF9TUzQPU6aZZVSH-zjBQ" hash="kJHQvg">As I stood where the entrance of the temple will be, I recalled how thirty-six years ago my companions and I landed by ship in Santos after twenty-one days at sea and went by train to Sao Paulo. There were other missionaries on the same vessel going to Argentina and Uruguay, which were the two other relatively new missions on the continent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-keys-of-the-kingdom.p3" pid="h2TND5QiL0iGpTqUWVXHVw" hash="2nf98g">In all of South America there was but a mere handful of members of the Church, mostly emigrants from Europe, many of whom were converted in Europe. As I stood last week on this site where this new, special, multimillion-dollar building will stand, I recalled how difficult and unpromising the future of the Church appeared in South America thirty-six years ago. In all of our mission we had only three baptisms in one year, despite the conscientious labors of over seventy missionaries. We did not have the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, or the Book of Mormon translated into Portuguese. We held our meetings in rooms that were small and unfit for the lofty message we were trying to teach. We often had to sweep out these rooms before meeting to remove the empty bottles and trash from the revelry of the night before. It was always difficult and often discouraging.</p>

There are now twenty-two stakes and seventeen missions of the Church with over 152,000 members on that vast continent; and the work has only begun. Our great first generation of South American Regional Representatives and stake and mission presidents are men of affairs, including bankers, businessmen, factory owners, and professional men. They are men of great ability and faith.</p>

Surely it is a fulfillment of what Jesus said to his early apostles: “And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:19</a>.) Having seen it all from close range, I cannot doubt that this is the work of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-keys-of-the-kingdom.p6" pid="P9-nwoSPSkCabmMFQawtrA" hash="ipAcEQ">What has happened in Brazil has also happened in the other countries as well. The day I was at the temple site, President McAllister of the Bolivia La Paz Mission wrote, “We are still amazed at the growth of the Church since we were here before. When we left in 1967 there were fewer than 300 members compared to our current 8,500.” President Bradford, sustained yesterday as a General Authority, writes from Chile, “For as young as the Church is in Chile, I marvel at the strength and ability of many local leaders.” Surely the keys of the kingdom have been given to our present prophet and to the modern apostles, even as these were given by the Savior anciently.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-keys-of-the-kingdom.p7" pid="QJumxSJ0QUuw_VRHUlzcaw" hash="TVMiig">Last week at the temple site, after much brooding and pondering, I stepped farther back to where the inner rooms of the temple will be. The morning mist had now cleared so that in the distance I could see part of the great city of Sao Paulo. I recalled how as a young missionary I presided over the work in that city, with thirteen missionaries and about 300 members. There are now four stakes of the Church and about 100 missionaries laboring in that city. There are also neighboring stakes in Campinas and Santos.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-keys-of-the-kingdom.p8" pid="OBeLX8Hl_kCgd8n2MtjQEQ" hash="cAQS0w">This great progress in South America has come about largely through the sacrifice and dedication of hundreds of missionaries and their families, as well as dedicated mission presidents from the United States and Canada. This is changing. In the Brazil Porto Alegre Mission there are now 136 missionaries of which fifty-eight, or 43 percent, are native-born Brazilians. All of the four mission presidents in Argentina are native South Americans. How can anyone who has seen what I have deny that this is the work of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-keys-of-the-kingdom.p9" pid="56N96xQ7s0mDIF4MnvSPdQ" hash="cv57vg">That morning last week I walked farther on the holy templegrounds. I tried to establish from the ground pegs where the sealings will be. Already it seems to be hallowed ground. In my mind’s eye I could see young couples clean and pure, hand in hand, and with smiles on their faces, many with brown skins handsomely contrasting their white clothing, who will come to this sacred spot to be married under the power of the holy priesthood of God for time and for all eternity. It was easy to imagine the great joy of whole families who will come to that spot to be sealed and bound together under the same authority into an eternal family association through their worthiness. They will come from elevated passes and high plains of the Andes; they will come from the sea coast; they will come from the great cities. On that spot the doors will also be opened to the kingdom for those who died without an opportunity to accept the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ on this earth. In addition, worthy members will receive the ordinances relating to mankind’s eternal journey and to the endless potential and development of each human soul. This has been provided by a gracious, just, and loving Father for all of mankind, and permits those who have participated in these enlightening ordinances to raise themselves to their highest potential in this life and for all eternity, with an endless association with their families in the presence of their Creator.</p>

It takes forty-three <span class="emphasis">soles</span> to make one dollar. Now their plans have changed. They are planning to take all five children to the first temple in South America. His brother stake president in the same city has never had the privilege of being endowed and of being sealed to his wife and family in a temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-keys-of-the-kingdom.p11" pid="miy5xFF30UCS3ZGH7K0SBQ" hash="ZM54Eg">That morning a week ago on the Sao Paulo Temple site, I walked farther back, still inside of where the temple will be. Having looked at these plans many times, I knew where I was. I have had goose pimples and felt tears almost every time I have looked at those plans. I was now standing where the baptistry will be. Thanks to President Kimball, as in all other temples since Nauvoo it will be a font borne on the back of twelve lifelike oxen representing the twelve tribes of Israel. Here will come the children, full of the mirth and excitement of youth, to perform the sacred ordinances of vicarious baptism for those who have not had that opportunity in their lifetime. It was easy to imagine the pleasure of those coming to be baptized and the great joy of those who have waited so long for this saving ordinance in their eternal journey. I was grateful that Jesus had said to his apostles: “And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.” Contemplating all of this I could not doubt that this is the work of God upon the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-keys-of-the-kingdom.p12" pid="uaySUXL_x0CvMUcMTd_UdA" hash="3BVXrw">It was now time to walk on the outside of the pegs in the ground marking the dimensions of that long-awaited temple. I tried to imagine how high the front spire will be. At the same time I tried to contemplate the time when the short, stoic Indians from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay will also come to that spot and gaze up at the same spire. I wondered if some of the men might not admire the fine craftsmanship in the building and compare it with the quality of the workmanship in the walls of the sacred buildings of their forbears, still standing in Cuzco, and Machu Picchu, and many other places in South America. They had their temples also.</p>

One of them was sustained yesterday as a General Authority of this church. Recently there were over 8,000 of them assembled in the Plaza de Armas in Cuzco, Peru, to hear the Lamanite Generation from Brigham Young University. Their day is coming soon.</p>

It means great and endless blessings. It also means great sacrifice. President Kimball said recently in Tokyo as he announced the building of the first temple in the Far East, “No temple has ever yet been built that did not require sacrifice and hard work.” (Unpublished, untitled talk delivered by President Kimball, Aug. 9, 1975, p. 12) It takes many <span class="emphasis">pesos, escudos, soles,</span> and <span class="emphasis">cruzeiros,</span> to make one dollar. For instance, last month the faithful members in Chile raised 1,902,178 <span class="emphasis">escudos</span> toward the construction of the Sao Paulo Temple, which is $387.90.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-keys-of-the-kingdom.p15" pid="jhGBe5IYiUWSBGr7z-SSmg" hash="35R02Q">The Spirit of God has been distilled and has rested mightily upon the countries in South America since the time of my youth when missionary work there was so difficult. How does the work of God go there now? Problems—there are many; challenges—they are great, but the progress is almost unbelievable. What I have said about South America can be said of many other parts of the whole world. This is a great worldwide Church, and so far we have only seen the beginning. Having seen what I have seen in South America, I cannot deny that this is the work of God. I invite any who may have doubts, but who are sincere and honest in heart, to inquire further as to what is the generating force behind this great movement. It is the power of love—the love of God, the love of family, and the love of our fellowmen. And because Jesus has again given the keys of the kingdom to a living prophet and modern apostles, this love of family and others can be as eternal as the human soul. Said Jesus to his apostles of old: “And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:19</a>.)</p>

Amen.</p>

In the world I think we need fewer revolutions and more revelations. In my opinion, the greatest change in South America is a spiritual revolution which is coming about as a result of the influence of this Church and of the temple now under construction in São Paulo—and that influence is all within the counsel of Paul to the Ephesians: “the perfecting of the saints, … the unity of the faith, and … the knowledge of the Son of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.12,13" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:12, 13</a>.)</p>

We may not feel a closeness with Him because we think of Him as being far away, or our relationship may not be sanctifying because we do not think of Him as a real person.</p>

Since our own feelings are sacred to us and cannot be disputed by others, let us begin with those quiet assurances which occasionally can come to all of us and which we know are true. We cannot always prove these verities to others, yet they come as a form of knowledge. Is this part of the divine which ferments within us, reaching to its source? Is it not like a personal witness of truth flowing through the thin curtain which separates this world from another?</p>

        <span class="emphasis">First: A daily communion involving prayer.</span> A fervent, sincere prayer is a two-way communication which will do much to bring His Spirit flowing like healing water to help with the trials, hardships, aches, and pains we all face. What is the quality of our secret prayers when only He listens? As we pray, we should think of Him as being close by, full of knowledge, understanding, love, and compassion, the essence of power, and as having great expectations of each of us.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Second: A daily selfless service to another.</span> The followers of the divine Christ have to be weighed on the scales of what their actions are rather than on solemn professions of belief. The true measure is found in Matthew: “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these … , ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>.) A wise man observed, “The man who lives by himself and for himself is apt to be corrupted by the company he keeps.” (Charles Henry Parkhurst, quoted in <span class="emphasis">The International Dictionary of Thoughts,</span> Chicago: J.

        <span class="emphasis">Fourth: A daily acknowledgment of His divinity.</span> To have a daily, personal relationship with the Master, we must be His disciples. “For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:13</a>.)</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Fifth: A daily study of the scriptures.</span> President Kimball has said: “I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures, the distance narrows and the spirituality returns.” (“What I Hope You Will Teach My Grandchildren … ,” address to seminary and institute personnel, July 11, 1966.)</p>

The ancient apostles were there. They saw it all. They participated. No one is more worthy of belief than they. Said Peter: “For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.16" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 1:16</a>.) Said John: “For we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/4.42" class="scriptureRef">John 4:42</a>.) Modern-day witnesses, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, declared: “For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:23</a>.)</p>

It is a love that sustains a new beginning on a higher level and thereby continues “from grace to grace.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:13</a>.)</p>

I often went in agony of spirit, earnestly pleading with God to sustain me in the work I have come to appreciate more than life itself. I have, on occasion, felt the terrible aloneness of the wounds of the heart, of the sweet agony, the buffetings of Satan, and the encircling warm comfort of the Spirit of the Master.</p>

I have climbed a spiritual Mount Sinai dozens of times seeking to communicate and to receive instructions. It has been as though I have struggled up an almost real Mount of Transfiguration and upon occasion felt great strength and power in the presence of the Divine. A special sacred feeling has been a sustaining influence and often a close companion.</p>

We must be courageously obedient. My witness is that we will be called upon to prove our spiritual stamina, for the days ahead will be filled with affliction and difficulty.

After the divorce was concluded, I did not see her again for many years. A chance meeting with her on the street was very surprising. The years of loneliness and discouragement were evident in her once beautiful face.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p2" pid="LCFV6i_gJUiG76IASS1g0w" hash="f3hjhw">After passing a few pleasantries, she was quick to say that life had not been rich and rewarding for her and that she was tired of facing the struggle alone. Then came a most startling disclosure, which, with her permission, I share. She said, “Bad as it was, if I had to do it over again, knowing what I do now, I would not have sought the divorce. This is worse.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p3" pid="d5dA4VyO306nYSV9eenXrw" hash="yUHxZQ">Statistically, it is difficult to avoid a divorce because in the United States with every one hundred marriages there are now about fifty divorces. (<span class="emphasis">World Almanac,</span> 1976.) Unless the present rate of ever-increasing divorces diminishes, in the early 1980s with every one hundred marriages there will be seventy divorces.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p4" pid="hI-DoBgVqkCYqOgT5nTDig" hash="b0jxRA">Divorce can be justified only in the most rare of circumstances, because it often tears people’s lives apart and shears family happiness. Frequently in a divorce the parties lose much more than they gain.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p5" pid="ebNnZYzjYkeKO0JjqefYYQ" hash="h9liqQ">The traumatic experience one goes through in divorce seems little understood and not well enough appreciated; and certainly there need to be much more sympathy and understanding for those who have experienced this great tragedy and whose lives cannot be reversed. For those who are divorced, there is still much to be hoped for and expected in terms of fulfillment and happiness in life, in the forgetting of self and in the rendering of service to others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p6" pid="3zFhLqVkLki8SQbBDlYukw" hash="DbmiSQ">Why is happiness in marriage so fragile and fleeting for so many, yet so abundant for others? Why does the resulting train of heartache and suffering have to be so long and have so many innocent people on board?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p7" pid="97MSg7xIkEmiWU6LjhiAew" hash="UCmfvw">What are the missing enriching ingredients in so many marriages, all begun with such happiness and so many high hopes?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p8" pid="CO7VjiPvQkqYBIEJBeHFaA" hash="JwyGuw">I have long pondered these difficult questions. Having spent almost a lifetime dealing with human experiences, I am somewhat familiar with the problems of unhappy marriages, of divorce, and of heartbroken families. I can also speak of great happiness, for, thanks to my beloved Ruth, I have found in marriage the richest fulfillment of human existence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p9" pid="-XmzKfLC30miD4B2Mg9MRA" hash="J2fYMw">There are no simple, easy answers to the challenging and complex questions of happiness in marriage. There are also many supposed reasons for divorce. Among them are the serious problems of selfishness, immaturity, lack of commitment, inadequate communication, unfaithfulness; and all of the rest, which are obvious and well known.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p10" pid="JH00oGCtm0eIOYLcPYlX6Q" hash="QL3Q6A">In my experience there is another reason which seems not so obvious but which precedes and laces through all of the others. It is the lack of a constant enrichment in marriage. It is an absence of that something extra which makes it precious, special, and wonderful, when it is also drudgery, difficult, and dull.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p11" pid="BhMefi3-FUKQHVGWF2abSw" hash="jzM4cw">You might wonder, “How can a marriage be constantly enriched?” Adam, speaking of Eve, said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/2.23" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 2:23</a>.)</p>

Money itself seems neither to make a couple happy, nor the lack of it, necessarily, to make them unhappy, but money is often a symbol of selfishness.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p20" pid="SW8El_ADK0qtEnbSZj9w2w" hash="42zeNA">I commend to all the excellent discussion by President Kimball, “Marriage and Divorce,” in which he reminds us, “[There are] no combination[s] of power [which] can destroy [a] marriage except the power within either or both of the spouses themselves.” (<span class="emphasis">Marriage and Divorce,</span> Deseret Book, p. 17.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p21" pid="-2nIeqEgskS7syswJ6E6Tg" hash="VAIdJQ">Marriage relationships can be enriched by better communication. One important way is to pray together. This will resolve many of the differences, if there are any, between the couple before sleep comes. I do not mean to overemphasize differences, but they are real, and make things interesting. Our differences are the little pinches of salt which can make the marriage seem sweeter. We communicate in a thousand ways, such as a smile, a brush of the hair, a gentle touch, and remembering each day to say “I love you” and the husband to say “You’re beautiful.” Some other important words to say, when appropriate, are “I’m sorry.” Listening is excellent communication.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p22" pid="5QwjCBsVY0GGZQ8KHMrcDQ" hash="N5b3lg">Complete trust in each other is one of the greatest enriching factors in marriage. Nothing devastates the core of mutual trust necessary to maintain a fulfilling relationship like infidelity. There is never a justification for adultery. Despite this destructive experience, occasionally marriages are saved and families preserved. To do so requires the aggrieved party to be capable of giving unreserved love great enough to forgive and forget. It requires the errant party to want desperately to repent and actually forsake evil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p23" pid="AP7wB_kgJ0WGt21MjQLxzA" hash="8BMw6A">Our loyalty to our eternal companion should not be merely physical, but mental and spiritual as well. Since there are no harmless flirtations and no place for jealousy after marriage, it is best to avoid the very appearance of evil by shunning any questionable contact with another to whom we are not married.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p24" pid="HySwexgiRUSZf6eH1FnWuA" hash="b5dDqg">Virtue is the strong glue which holds it all together. Said the Lord, “Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:22</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p25" pid="Wsb_74deJEumU8L270RkzA" hash="sYFMbw">Of all that can bless marriages, there is one special enriching ingredient, which above all else will help join a man and a woman together in a very real, sacred, spiritual sense. It is the presence of the divine in marriage. Shakespeare, speaking in <span class="emphasis">Henry the Fifth,</span> said, “God, the best maker of all marriages, combine your hearts in one.” (<span class="emphasis">Henry V,</span> 5:2.) God is also the best keeper of marriages.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p26" pid="Pu0lN6Zf10mXYKAq3rWC6w" hash="gFopJA">There are many things which go into making a marriage enriching, but they seem to be of the husk. Having the companionship and enjoying the fruits of a Holy and Divine Presence is the kernel of a great happiness in marriage. Spiritual oneness is the anchor. Slow leaks in the sanctifying dimension of marriage often cause marriages to become flat tires.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p27" pid="dwThVPVgwUG_3p43PDgLMg" hash="4NnnHg">Divorces are increasing because in many cases the union lacks that enrichment which comes from the sanctifying benediction which flows from the keeping of the commandments of God. It is a lack of spiritual nourishment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p28" pid="Kss3Qa7L3Ui8zCdUpudwbA" hash="2ciFbQ">I learned in serving almost twenty years as bishop and stake president that an excellent insurance against divorce is the payment of tithing. Payment of tithing seems to facilitate keeping the spiritual battery charged in order to make it through the times when the spiritual generator has been idle or not working.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p29" pid="lMYP0t6CYk2Mh7QIHlNbng" hash="WEjtXw">There is no great or majestic music which constantly produces the harmony of a great love. The most perfect music is a welding of two voices into one spiritual solo. Marriage is the way provided by God for the fulfillment of the greatest of human needs, based upon mutual respect, maturity, selflessness, decency, commitment, and honesty. Happiness in marriage and parenthood can exceed a thousand times any other happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p30" pid="35SZ9pglREWNkmw6MRLiUQ" hash="u_Vo0A">The soul of the marriage is greatly enriched and the spiritual growing process is greatly strengthened when a couple become parents. Parenthood should bring the greatest of all happiness. Men grow because as fathers they must take care of their families. Women blossom because as mothers they must forget themselves. We understand best the full meaning of love when we become parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p31" pid="6AELCLK8u0umpY3cKbPjfA" hash="0vVWcQ">Our homes should be among the most hallowed of all earthly sanctuaries.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p32" pid="OtyZxUBaXUCE68QxK_pbGg" hash="GVSp3A">In the enriching of marriage the big things are the little things. It is a constant appreciation for each other and a thoughtful demonstration of gratitude. It is the encouraging and the helping of each other to grow. Marriage is a joint quest for the good, the beautiful, and the divine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p33" pid="k62IN-kurkuAWGxdvaTFMw" hash="NUTp2Q">The Savior has said, “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/3.20" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 3:20</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-enriching-of-marriage.p34" pid="yObV2ZlWGUOpX6PEZxf8ig" hash="TdEsKw">May the presence of God be found enriching and blessing all marriages and homes, especially those of His Saints, as part of His eternal plan, I pray humbly in the sacred name of Jesus Christ.

I hope to be a disciple after the manner and example of President Kimball and the others in their love for all, and especially for the humble, the downtrodden, the poor, the afflicted, the needy, and the poor in spirit.

I seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit and pray that what I have to say will be guided by the Spirit and that it may abundantly rest upon all of us so that you might understand also by that special spirit.</p>

My message is intended as one of hope, strength, and deliverance. I speak of the refiner’s fire.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-refiners-fire.p" pid="t5VeMbjurkuD0sMD_oZ2tw" hash="9diN1Q">Some years ago president David O. McKay told from this pulpit of the experience of some of those in the Martin handcart company. Many of these early converts had emigrated from Europe and were too poor to buy oxen or horses and a wagon. They were forced by their poverty to pull handcarts containing all of their belongings across the plains by their own brute strength. President McKay relates an occurrence which took place some years after the heroic exodus: “A teacher, conducting a class, said it was unwise ever to attempt, even to permit them [the Martin handcart company] to come across the plains under such conditions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-refiners-fire.p" pid="3HAvEtvCcE6wNWVUXAnNAQ" hash="8dreXA">“[According to a class member,] some sharp criticism of the Church and its leaders was being indulged in for permitting any company of converts to venture across the plains with no more supplies or protection than a handcart caravan afforded.</p>

His face was white with emotion, yet he spoke calmly, deliberately, but with great earnestness and sincerity.</p>

You are discussing a matter you know nothing about. Cold historic facts mean nothing here, for they give no proper interpretation of the questions involved. Mistake to send the Handcart Company out so late in the season? Yes. But I was in that company and my wife was in it and Sister Nellie Unthank whom you have cited was there, too. We suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? <span class="emphasis">Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-refiners-fire.p" pid="A85dWkBCLUmTsVfoSlLVqg" hash="NG6Rcg">“‘I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it.’” He continues: “‘I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there.</p>

In the pain, the agony, and the heroic endeavors of life, we pass through a refiner’s fire, and the insignificant and the unimportant in our lives can melt away like dross and make our faith bright, intact, and strong. In this way the divine image can be mirrored from the soul. It is part of the purging toll exacted of some to become acquainted with God. In the agonies of life, we seem to listen better to the faint, godly whisperings of the Divine Shepherd.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-refiners-fire.p" pid="nhd30KOPoU-E00lnwu2RwA" hash="tYjs1g">Into every life there come the painful, despairing days of adversity and buffeting. There seems to be a full measure of anguish, sorrow, and often heartbreak for everyone, including those who earnestly seek to do right and be faithful. The thorns that prick, that stick in the flesh, that hurt, often change lives which seem robbed of significance and hope. This change comes about through a refining process which often seems cruel and hard. In this way the soul can become like soft clay in the hands of the Master in building lives of faith, usefulness, beauty, and strength. For some, the refiner’s fire causes a loss of belief and faith in God, but those with eternal perspective understand that such refining is part of the perfection process.</p>

This trial of faith can become a priceless experience. Stated Peter, “That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 1:7</a>).

Romney, speaking for the Lord, has said of this marvelous power: “The effect upon each person’s life is likewise similar. No person whose soul is illuminated by the burning Spirit of God can in this world of sin and dense darkness remain passive.

Central to solving these problems is the great need to get back on the right track and, if necessary, engage in each of the steps for full and complete repentance. Through this great principle, many things can be made fully right and all things better. We can go to others for help. To whom can we go? Elder Orson F. Whitney asked and answered this question: “To whom do we look, in days of grief and disaster, for help and consolation? … They are men and women who have suffered, and out of their experience in suffering they bring forth the riches of their sympathy and condolences as a blessing to those now in need. Could they do this had they not suffered themselves?</p>

However, in areas of the world where human and other resources are inadequate, priesthood leaders may be able to use some technical know-how in helping their members become self-reliant. This support is currently being given in a splendid way by a dedicated group of skilled technical and professional people whose principal ministry is to foster practical, Christlike service. They are called as welfare services missionaries. There are at present over seven hundred of these missionaries serving in almost sixty missions throughout the world, helping local leaders to establish the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/establishing-the-church-welfare-services-missionaries-are-an-important-resource.p18" pid="dA5tZ1gYEEeB22cpTb_O3Q" hash="jfmrWA">An important function of welfare services missionaries is to assist local priesthood leaders in teaching the fundamental principles of welfare. They may also, under priesthood direction, teach members how to improve their manner of living. Although we do not have storehouses and production projects everywhere, we must have basic welfare principles taught and applied even in the smallest of branches. At the heart of welfare in the Church are six gospel principles: love, service, work, self-reliance, stewardship, and consecration (which encompasses sacrifice). These principles undergird the other fundamentals of welfare, which are the law of the fast, quorum service and Relief Society compassionate service, personal and family preparedness, and functioning welfare services committees.</p>

As home teachers help a family mend a fence, or as Relief Society sisters prepare food for a neighbor who is ill, they experience the meaning of service. In seeking to be prepared individually and as a family, members practice self-reliance and work. The local welfare services committee coordinates the Church’s role in these aspects of basic welfare.</p>

Utilizing their experiences and training, welfare services missionaries, as resources to leaders and members, can identify ways in which the members can take better care of themselves. These leaders in turn help members to begin practicing a gospel-centered way of life.</p>

I am enclosing a picture of Brother and Sister Duane C. Thorn standing behind some sheet-metal ovens he has constructed. Brother Thorn has made over a hundred of these, and his wife has been teaching the women how to use them over a regular bonfire to bake bread. It’s the first time many of these families have had a facility to do any baking. He has also made large tubs for them to do their washing in to improve their sanitation.</p>

Brother Spencer invented and taught the local people how to use several machines, including a tapa-cloth machine which has saved them many hours of difficult labor. This machine also caught the eye of the king. He has become a very close personal friend of the king. In fact, for the next month he traveled with the king and his party to all of the islands on an agricultural fair where he was a guest of the king.</p>

Social workers, farmers, career counselors, skilled tradesmen, home economists, and nurses are some examples of the types of skilled missionaries that are needed.</p>

You should know that there is currently a need for couples with ability in languages other than English. At present, the greatest needs are for Spanish speakers.</p>

They set forth the specific helps they desire from welfare services missionaries and then consult with their Regional Representative and mission president. The requests will be forwarded to the Missionary Department as approved by the General Authority Executive Administrator. Missionaries with specific skills are then assigned to meet the identified needs.</p>

The Church must be constantly aware of the need to build and lift people temporally and spiritually. Paradoxically, the most successful way to assist someone in need is by leading them into the service of others.</p>

It is his responsibility to regularly review the progress of welfare services missionary efforts with Regional Representatives representing the stake presidents, mission presidents, and with the other leaders who function in the temporal offices in the area council. In this council meeting, welfare services missionary work can be incorporated into the area master plan for welfare services. This planned, unified approach will insure order and constancy as we proceed to establish the Church.</p>

As members experience the benefits of fundamental welfare activities in their lives, they are moved to want to share their joys with others.</p>

Under his guidance and with the assistance of all the branch members, a piece of land was obtained, and the Tan family home was dismantled, transported, and rebuilt. Brother Tan began farming the land and started a family produce business which is now flourishing. Some hard work, dedication, and love from local leaders and members, aided by the suggestions of welfare services missionaries, caused a miracle for one family and a great learning and growing experience for a whole branch.</p>

Why does this Church continue to flourish and grow so dramatically? In 1979 there were almost two hundred thousand convert baptisms in addition to the natural growth of the Church. What distinguishes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from all others? We believe that we can answer this question more correctly than anyone else.</p>

Among them is its organization with prophets and Apostles, who Paul said are the foundation of the Church (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.20" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:20</a>); the First Quorum of the Seventy, also the great order of lay priesthood leadership, the missionary system, the welfare program, the temples, the genealogical effort, and many other distinguishing features.</p>

This is in fulfillment of the promise of the Savior: “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.16" class="scriptureRef">John 14:16</a>).</p>

The result of this endowment is that for 150 years the leadership and membership of this church have enjoyed, and now enjoy, continuous revelation and inspiration directing them in what is right and good.</p>

It does so because of divine direction to the leaders and members. This began in our day when God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith early in the spring of 1820. However, we claim that God’s inspiration is not limited to the members of this church. The First Presidency has stated:</p>

One factor in salvation is personal revelation. Joseph Smith said: “No man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelations. The Holy Ghost is a revelator” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 6:58).</p>

David and all of the army of Israel were insulted by the humiliating taunts of this formidable giant, but David knew that inspiration had brought him to save Israel. King Saul was so impressed with the faith and determination of this young boy that he appointed David to fight Goliath.</p>

Then David threw a rock from his sling with such force and accuracy that the stone sank deep into the forehead of Goliath. Goliath fell to the earth a dying man, and the Philistines fled in fear.</p>

Over the fence from our place were some tumbledown sheds which had attracted a curious boy, adventurous as I was. I started to climb through the fence and I heard a voice as clearly as you are hearing mine—‘Don’t go over there!’ calling me by name. I turned to look at father to see if he were talking to me, but he was way up at the other end of the field. There was no person in sight.

I should like to direct my remarks to the leaders of the Church, and especially to the future leaders, the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood. Many of you young men will have leadership responsibilities sooner than you realize. It does not seem long since I was a deacons quorum president. As far as the worldwide, fast-growing Church is concerned, leadership is one of our greatest challenges.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/these-i-will-make-my-leaders.p2" pid="66zvIr4JEkS63l5idVbe0w" hash="2ma4HA">A year or so ago I sat in an elders quorum meeting. The members of the presidency were fine, capable young men; but when they got around to sharing the quorum responsibilities and getting the work done, they limited it to those who were present and who would volunteer. Not one assignment was given.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/these-i-will-make-my-leaders.p3" pid="yzLnDDHVv0qe2IIw54YbpQ" hash="8SsoDQ">One of the first principles we must keep in mind is that the work of the Lord goes forward through assignments. Leaders receive and give assignments. This is an important part of the necessary principle of delegating. No one appreciates a willing volunteer more than I, but the total work cannot be done as the Lord wants it done merely by those doing the work who may be present at meetings. I have often wondered what the earth would look like if the Lord in the Creation had left the work to be done only by volunteers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/these-i-will-make-my-leaders.p4" pid="zS9cdUrZ6UqHDvwGkeIlGg" hash="hlOC9w">If we look upon fulfilling of assignments as building the kingdom of God and as being an opportunity as well as a privilege and an honor, then assignments and challenges should certainly be given to every member of the quorum. Such involvement should include, with appropriate wisdom and discretion, those who perhaps need them the most—the inactive and the partially active brethren. Assignments always should be given with the greatest love, consideration, and kindness. Those asked to respond should be treated with respect and appreciation.</p>

Whether such assignments come in writing, as most do, or are personally given, they are always couched with “if you please” or “if it is convenient” or “Would you kindly attend to this or to that.” Never are these assignments framed in terms of a command or a demand.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/these-i-will-make-my-leaders.p6" pid="q_YGPjpNU0-cniD81pH-gQ" hash="-i0W_w">Ever since I was first in Egypt in World War II, I have been interested in ancient ruins. There is a fascination in observing why some columns still stand and others have toppled over. Very frequently those still standing do so because they bear a weight on top. There is, I believe, a parallel principle in leadership. Those who stand faithful to their priesthood are often those who bear some weight of responsibility. Those involved are those most likely to be committed. So a successful quorum leader will want all of those in his quorum to have an opportunity to serve with some kind of calling appropriate to the circumstances.</p>

A leader cannot ask of others what he is not willing to do himself. Our safest course is to follow the example of the Savior, and our security is to listen to and follow the direction of his prophet, the President of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/these-i-will-make-my-leaders.p8" pid="Ef7c0yIYDE6YlIaKqH-2TQ" hash="2wfX8Q">Some years ago I was traveling in the Rosario Argentina Mission up in the northern part of Argentina. As we were traveling along the road, we passed a large herd of cattle being moved. The herd was moving peaceably and without difficulty. The herd was quiet. There were no dogs. Out in front leading the herd were three gauchos on horseback, each about fifteen or twenty yards apart. These three horsemen were slumped forward in their saddles, completely relaxed, confident that the herd would follow them. At the rear of the herd was a single rider bringing up the rear. He, too, was slumped forward in his saddle as if he were sleeping. The whole herd moved peacefully, quietly, and was subdued. From that experience it seemed obvious to me that leadership is about three-fourths show-the-way and about one-fourth follow-up.</p>

Those who are called to lead in the ministry of the Master are not called to be chiefs or dictators. They are called to be good shepherds. They are to be constantly training others to take their place and become greater leaders than their teachers. A good leader expects much, inspires greatly, and sets on fire those he is called to lead.</p>

Something should move and change. He must see that those under him do not fail. But it should be done in the Lord’s way. He should be the instrument in the hands of the Almighty for changing lives. He needs to know where he is now, where he is going, and how he is going to get there.</p>

He introduced me to one of the officials, and the official said they would change $1,000. I did not have $1,000 in cash and had only a check drawn on a bank in Salt Lake City. The exchange house had never done business with me before. In fact, they had never seen me before and could not expect to ever see me again. They had no way to verify if I had $1,000 on deposit in the bank upon which I had drawn the check. But they accepted my check without hesitation—based solely on the fact that I was a Mormon and that they had previously done business with other Mormons.

I have never felt more keenly the need for both the aid of the divine Spirit and the understanding of those who hear. I humbly pray that I might not be misunderstood.</p>

Heber C. Kimball recorded, “The following vision was manifested to him [Joseph Smith] as near as I can recollect:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/the-dignity-of-self.p4" pid="pIROpE1s8EGae9Nuv1XhdQ" hash="iXonAQ">“He saw the Twelve going forth, and they appeared to be in a far distant land. After some time they unexpectedly met together, apparently in great tribulation, their clothes all ragged, and their knees and feet sore. They formed into a circle, and all stood with their eyes fixed upon the ground. The Savior appeared and stood in their midst and wept over them, and wanted to show Himself to them, but they did not discover Him.” (Orson F. Whitney, <span class="emphasis">Life of Heber C. Kimball,</span> 2d ed., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, p. 93; see also <span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 2:381.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/the-dignity-of-self.p5" pid="XsNDMXfiE0m0QkGXPYw9Zw" hash="uXDfbw">A message that can be inferred from this is that, because the Twelve had suffered so much, had endured so greatly, and had so exhausted themselves in leading the battle of righteousness, they were bowed down and did not look up. Had they only looked up they might have beheld the Lord Jesus, who wanted them to see him, weeping over them, suffering with them, and standing in their midst.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/the-dignity-of-self.p6" pid="q__jq0fGeEiUbcMQvg12HA" hash="aRjujA">Not many months ago we were in one of the oldest cities on earth. Some of the greatest wonders of the world are there; so are crime, squalor, poverty, and filth. Our kind hosts observed as we were making our way through the teeming masses—past the overloaded donkeys, the filth, the smells—that everything was beautiful in that city if you would raise your sights and only look a foot or more above the ground.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/the-dignity-of-self.p7" pid="cQLMAVY7B0ekSloNcjKrmA" hash="iOpKdQ">In recent times the price of oil, gold, and other precious minerals has greatly increased. These treasures are all obtained by looking down. They are useful and necessary, but they are tangible riches. What of the treasures that are to be found by raising our vision? What of the intangible riches which come from the pursuit of holiness? Stephen looked upward: “Being full of the Holy Ghost, [he] looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/7.55" class="scriptureRef">Acts 7:55</a>.)</p>

They have to cope with a darkness and moral fog as dense as many of us can ever remember. We live in a world where success seems largely measured by possessions. How the possessions may have been acquired often seems immaterial. Honesty, decency, chastity, and holiness are frequently downgraded as being of lesser worth than possessions. Are our young people enticed to look up or down?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/the-dignity-of-self.p9" pid="l57b4UKCJUKdZiLcxTrzBg" hash="x-JT8Q">The desire for profitable gain and popularity in the entertainment world has unmasked in the most appealing way all of the evils of the human race. The most revolting practices and perversions have been masqueraded and even urged upon our inexperienced young people by some seeking to seductively merchandise the evil side of human behavior. Consciences seem seared with a hot iron; spiritual cells seem closed. Ideals of emptiness and uselessness of life are fostered. Nobility of thought and purpose seems not to be sufficiently taught, encouraged, or valued.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/the-dignity-of-self.p10" pid="IAM8KjsMW06lUvBn0U9dQg" hash="PqPiyw">The standard of the common thief, “What can we get away with?” has become the standard for many in the world rather than what our own integrity ought to demand that we do. What has happened to self-respect and personal integrity, which would not permit even entertaining the idea of doing cheap or small things? An example might be our relationship with the financial credit by which the world’s commerce is carried on. Often we forget that those who extend credit to us are also extending trust and confidence in us. Our own integrity is involved. I recall my father speaking with profound respect of a man whom father as a lawyer had taken through bankruptcy. Given time, this man paid in full all of his creditors who had trusted him and extended confidence in him, even though he was legally relieved of paying the debts. Our own integrity is a substantial part of our individual worth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/the-dignity-of-self.p11" pid="vibTs0Ji3ESTsV7PSt-wjg" hash="uujSyQ">How can Christian belief and morality translate more completely into Christian action? Does our commitment fall short of being a consecration? The doubting Thomas wanted to believe; he believed part way. It is my firm persuasion that building self-esteem sufficiently to forsake all evil requires a consecration to the saving principles and ordinances of the gospel under divine priesthood authority. It must be consecration to simple, basic Christian principles, including honesty to self and others, forgetting of self, integrity of thought and action. The principles of the restored gospel are so plain, so clear, so compassionate, so endowed with beauty, so graced with love unfeigned, as to be imprinted with the indisputable impress of the Savior himself.</p>

Instead of squarely and honestly meeting the problems of life, many negotiate their way through difficulties, rationalizing their departure from the great truths which bring happiness and justifying the leaving of their sacred promises and holy commitments for seemingly logical but fragile and unjustifiable reasons.</p>

Have we been measuring by standards that are too short and unworthy of those in the pursuit of holiness? Have we taken too much comfort in feeling that we have qualified through our attendance at meetings or through minimal involvement in a conscience-easing effort? Have our guidelines been a ceiling instead of a floor?</p>

To attract attention or in the name of comfort and informality, many have sunk not only to immodesty but to slovenliness. Against their own self-interest, they present themselves to others in the worst possible way.</p>

Repenting of transgressions and forsaking of weaknesses represent, however, a great restorative salve for the strengthening of human worth and dignity.</p>

In a value-free society—free of morals, free of standards—many also live free of feelings of self-worth, self-respect, and dignity. Far too many young people, and older ones, too, fail to realize, as the motto of the city of Nottingham, England, affirms: <span class="emphasis">Vivet post funera virtus</span> (“Virtue lives on after death”).</p>

This is a route destined to failure because it does not take into account the powerful importance of the subjective things we can know but not measure. For instance, I love my wife and family, and I feel their love for me. You cannot measure how deep our feelings of love are for each other, but that love is very real to us. Pain is also difficult to measure, but it is real. The same is true of faith in God. We can know of his existence without being able to quantitatively measure it. Paul states, “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.16" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:16</a>.)</p>

No one need assume that the Twelve who failed to see the Savior because they stood with their eyes fixed upon the ground had in any way failed in their labors. As a body they continued strong and steadfast in their ministry. Their discouragement was only temporary. Their labors were heroic; their acts were bold and courageous. Joseph the Prophet, at the conclusion of that vision, was privileged to see the completion of the work of the Twelve. Heber C. Kimball records: “He (Joseph) saw until they had accomplished their work, and arrived at the gate of the celestial city; there Father Adam stood and opened the gate to them, and as they entered he embraced them one by one and kissed them. He [Adam] then led them to the throne of God, and then the Savior embraced each one of them and kissed them, and crowned each one of them in the presence of God. … The impression this vision left on Brother Joseph’s mind was of so acute a nature, that he never could refrain from weeping while rehearsing it.” (Whitney, <span class="emphasis">Life of Heber C. Kimball,</span> pp. 93–94.)</p>

The fruits of the search for holiness in their lives have been transparent, expressed through their inner dignity, their feelings of self-respect and personal worth. Shakespeare, speaking through Polonius, reminds us:</p>

Since about eight o’clock that morning Dr. Willard Richards, Samuel H. Smith, and nine others had plodded along the dusty road between Carthage and Nauvoo, Illinois. Moving along the road with the solemn procession were two wagons heaped with bushes to protect their cargo from the blistering heat of the sun.</p>

Wearily, Dr. Richards and Samuel Smith, brother to the two murdered men, pressed toward Nauvoo and talked of the events just the day before during which Joseph and Hyrum were gunned down by an armed mob with painted faces. The two victims, along with Dr. Richards and John Taylor, were lodged in Carthage Jail, supposedly for their protection, when the mob, numbering from 150 to 200 marauders, stormed the jail and shot to death their intended victims.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/the-expanding-inheritance-from-joseph-smith.p3" pid="ME7DoRgowk2uucJnrx-azw" hash="cgdaHQ">Word of the deaths had already reached Nauvoo, headquarters city for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As the wagons and their foot-weary guardians entered the city, several thousand citizens greeted the procession with the most solemn lamentations and mourning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/the-expanding-inheritance-from-joseph-smith.p4" pid="q6Vkqc19xUaohkT10xpSpA" hash="srDzGw">The bloodied bodies were tenderly removed from the wagons at the Nauvoo Mansion and were carefully washed from head to foot. The various wounds were filled with cotton, soaked in camphor, and death masks were impressed on each face. Fine, plain clothing was then placed on each body. When these preparations were completed, the bodies were viewed that night by the bereaved widows and children of the two men, along with many of their closest associates. Then on Saturday, more than ten thousand mourning Saints viewed the remains of their beloved Prophet Joseph and his brother, the Patriarch Hyrum. The bodies were then secretly and lovingly buried. (See <span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 6:614–31.)</p>

What has transpired in a century and a half bears eloquent testimony to the eternal nature of the work of this singularly remarkable man, Joseph Smith. The Church which he restored has had dramatic growth in many parts of the earth. It has produced an unequaled missionary system and an unmatched welfare program. Its governing system gives priesthood power and authority from God to all worthy male members, at the same time recognizing the exalted status of women as being equal to men. The Church has an inspired law of health and temporal well-being far ahead of its time. By revelation from God, the Church also possesses those keys, saving principles, and ordinances which will bring eternal exaltation to mankind, living and dead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/the-expanding-inheritance-from-joseph-smith.p7" pid="3HmHfV_L80mbq7f9DcdKLw" hash="f83Lyg">Because of these and other reasons, millions of people have become members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But to each true believer there must ultimately and finally come a conviction that Joseph Smith was a revealer of truth, a prophet of God. Each must be convinced that God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ did appear to Joseph Smith and did commission him to reestablish the church of Christ upon the face of the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/the-expanding-inheritance-from-joseph-smith.p8" pid="Op52Wz0ecES1tayWoLKbMQ" hash="9d2-zA">I have such a conviction, and it is my humble desire to share with you some of the things which verify my testimony of Joseph Smith and his work. My own witness is a spiritual one more than a scientific or historical one. I doubt that the gospel of Jesus Christ as restored to earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith and as taught by all the prophets who have succeeded him will ever be completely provable by the scientific method alone. It must be accepted by faith and understood by the gift and power of God. For instance, one of the truths revealed by Joseph Smith on February 27, 1833, taught of the harmful effects of tea, coffee, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages. Such teachings today can be proven scientifically, yet in my opinion, the greatest promises contained in the Word of Wisdom (D&amp;C 89) are spiritual. It contains a promise of wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, and of the passing by of the destroying angel as the children of Israel were passed by. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.19,21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89:19, 21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/the-expanding-inheritance-from-joseph-smith.p9" pid="xL-mgVQockm_UlTx7KbsEw" hash="GYzkGg">One of the most significant contributions of Joseph Smith is his work in translating and publishing the Book of Mormon, a sacred volume of scripture brought forth from ancient records. When it was first published in 1830, there was little scientific or historical evidence to substantiate the claims of Joseph Smith that the record came from metallic plates and told of ancient civilizations on the North and South American continents. Today such outward evidences have been discovered and help confirm that Joseph Smith was telling the truth about the Book of Mormon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/the-expanding-inheritance-from-joseph-smith.p10" pid="ckHze2VJj0edDtf_jzAD9g" hash="vsztBg">But we also still look to the spiritual witnesses for our confirming belief in the book. Critics have long tried to explain away the Book of Mormon but simply have not been successful. Theories concerning its origin have come and gone, and the book still lives on to testify that Jesus is the Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/the-expanding-inheritance-from-joseph-smith.p11" pid="DvPAykrx-kKg1IeV8R9WqQ" hash="m1M0-g">Most objective, analytical scholars have come to recognize that it would have been impossible for an uneducated boy such as Joseph Smith, reared on the frontiers of America, to write the Book of Mormon. It contains so many exalted concepts, has such different writing styles, and is compiled in such a way that no one person could be its author. The honest inquirer can be led by faith to believe that Joseph Smith did translate the Book of Mormon from ancient plates of gold which were written with engraved characters in the reformed Egyptian language. No other explanations which have seriously challenged Joseph Smith’s own account of the Book of Mormon have been able to survive as being factually correct. The evidences of a century and a half continue, and these increasingly affirm that Joseph Smith spoke the truth, completely, honestly, and humbly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/the-expanding-inheritance-from-joseph-smith.p12" pid="BRG8xkQtaEqgrh6ZocBdHA" hash="kS4GTQ">As I submit to you my testimony of Joseph Smith, I acknowledge his humanness along with his great spiritual powers. He did not claim to be divine, nor a perfect man. He claimed only to be a mortal man with human feelings and imperfections, trying honestly to fulfill the divine mission given to him. He so describes himself in recorded counsel given to some of the members of the Church who had just arrived in Nauvoo on October 29, 1842. Said the Prophet, “I told them I was but a man, and they must not expect me to be perfect; if they expected perfection from me, I should expect it from them; but if they would bear with my infirmities and the infirmities of the brethren, I would likewise bear with their infirmities.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:181.)</p>

As such reminders came to him, sometimes kindly and sometimes sternly, he dictated them as the mouthpiece of the Lord to those who transcribed the revelations. One such example is found in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 5, verse 21: “And now I command you, my servant Joseph, to repent and walk more uprightly before me, and to yield to the persuasions of men no more.” [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/5.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 5:21</a>]</p>

If he were intending to fabricate a great falsehood or wanted to perpetrate a fraud or practice deceit, would he have been so truthful about his own humanness? His complete candor in admitting human frailties and in declaring the loving discipline of God offers powerful proof of his honesty and probity. His statements stand on more solid footing because they were declarations against human nature and admissions against self-interest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/the-expanding-inheritance-from-joseph-smith.p15" pid="wxVdiVuE70SnyKKIouEdrA" hash="e4pP-w">He knew that such candor would and did make him an object of hatred, ridicule, and social disapproval, but he spoke openly the unvarnished truth. He was prepared for such vicissitudes of life early in his ministry. He was told by the angel Moroni in 1823, only three years after his glorious vision of God the Father and Jesus Christ, that his name would be known for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and peoples, and that both good and evil would be spoken of him. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.33" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:33</a>.) However, the intensity of the evil and persecution surprised even Joseph and caused him to ask on one occasion: “Why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.20" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:20</a>). But he met the challenges and overcame the strife and was stronger because of them.</p>

They were only things that are a part of any human being. He and his work enjoyed the benediction of Deity. On a special occasion, the Lord said to him, “Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph Smith, I am well pleased with your offering and acknowledgments, which you have made; for unto this end have I raised you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:1</a>.)</p>

His personality was a magnet to many people, attracting those of all ages and all classes. Many whom he inspired were extremely intelligent, dedicated, and capable men and women. The courage which they evidenced in behalf of the work of Joseph Smith, along with their sacrifices, suffering, and dedication, were almost beyond belief.</p>

Before Joseph went to the Carthage Jail, he said to Dr. Richards: “‘If we go into the cell, will you go in with us?’ The doctor answered, ‘Brother Joseph you did not ask me to cross the river with you—you did not ask me to come to Carthage—you did not ask me to come to jail with you—and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free.’ Joseph said, ‘You cannot.’ The doctor replied, ‘I will.’” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 6:616.)</p>

The work of this church moves forward in an astonishing way. The great body of the Latter-day Saints remain faithful to their testimonies of Joseph Smith and his work. Since Joseph’s day, millions have accepted by faith and have had confirmed by the Holy Spirit that Joseph’s account of seeing the Father and the Son is true and that he restored to earth the pure gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

But the evidences of the truthfulness of his statements will continue to mount. The devotion and commitment of those who accept the restored gospel will continue to be severely tested. Their faith will be sorely tried, as has been the case with so many in the past. But like Joseph himself, millions will live and die faithful to the gospel he restored. As time moves on, the stature of Joseph Smith will loom ever larger. He will stand higher and higher in the esteem of mankind. Ever so many will come to a profound conviction, as I have, that there is a divine source to the message he taught and an eternal purpose to the work which he restored on earth.</p>

I learned of this bequest as a small boy at my mother’s knee. My great-great-grandfather, Edward Partridge, was intimately associated with the Prophet Joseph for several years prior to his losing his life in consequence of the persecution. (See <span class="emphasis">History of the Church</span> 4:132.) He was baptized by Joseph. In a revelation received by the Prophet, he was called as the first bishop of the restored Church.

Like others who were close to the Prophet, he knew Joseph’s heart and soul. Grandfather could not have been deceived. I believe his life and death both prove that he did not lie. His devotion, suffering, and sacrifice eloquently testify that he had implicit faith in Joseph as an inspired servant of God.</p>

The delicately hand-carved roses, figures, and designs in the beautiful woods make his furniture as lovely as I have ever seen. Every piece is exquisite. Every creation is a masterpiece. One day my Ruth and I were in the entrance of his factory when a beautiful, newly made piece of furniture was carried in from the factory for showing. The grain of the wood flowed beautifully, and the finish was perfection. But to President Spat the hardware did not seem up to standard. Without hesitation, he took a screwdriver and a pair of pliers and pulled off all the hardware. His only remark was, “That is not my work.” President Spat seems incapable of making a piece of furniture which is not as near perfect as it can be. His work reflects his honor and integrity.</p>

At a meeting in Social Hall in Salt Lake City, an intruder under a claim of authority tried to enter the hall; and Joseph W. McMurrin, being true to his trust to guard the servants of the Lord, restrained him from going through the door. President Heber J. Grant relates that the intruder “finally got his hand loose and took his pistol and, pressing it against Brother McMurrin’s body, fired two bullets … through his vitals. Those bullets lodged just under the skin in his back. He was attended by Dr. Joseph Benedict who told Joseph W. McMurrin that no man could live after two bullets had passed through his vitals, and then added: ‘If you wish to make a dying statement you should do so immediately.’</p>

Erekson, a wise and successful member of a high council I was involved with, made a statement which impressed me greatly. He said, “There are many in our generation who have not known the blessings of economic adversity!” I wish to speak this morning about the blessings we may receive as we meet the challenges of economic stress.</p>

One person said you can tell it this way: “A recession: a period in which you tighten your belt, a depression: a time in which you have no belt to tighten.” (<span class="emphasis">Braude Speaker Encyclopedia,</span> p. 46.)</p>

Some people are losing their employment and their hard-earned possessions. Others are faced with a lack of food and clothing. In a normal lifetime most people have had, or will face, difficult economic times. We read in Ecclesiastes that “the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/eccl/9.11" class="scriptureRef">Eccl. 9:11</a>.)</p>

Although the following examples have far greater meaning for mankind in general, they have their lessons for us individually when we are confronted with trials in our lives.</p>

The scattering of Israel throughout the world sprinkled the blood that believes, so that many nations may now partake of the gospel plan. The history of the Nephites is one of trial, calamities, and suffering, but through it all the experiences gained brought strength and development.</p>

Charles Dickens laid the setting for his book <span class="emphasis">A Tale of Two Cities</span> in the following introduction:</p>

The inscription reads:</p>

He it is whose singular praise it is to have done the best things in the worst times, and to have hoped them in the most calamitous.”</p>

There is no guarantee against personal hard financial times. Financial difficulty may result from several kinds of misfortunes, including all types of natural disasters such as floods, fires, and earthquakes. Accidents and illness can produce unexpected and staggering medical and hospital bills. The misfortunes of other members of our own family may require our help. Unemployment and inflation can quickly wipe away hard-earned savings.</p>

Discouragement and frustration are frequent companions to misfortune. Economic problems occasionally put a strain on family relationships. They often require us to do without things we feel we want or need. What can be a calamity for one can be an opportunity for another. Shakespeare, speaking through Duke Senior, said,</p>

One writer said, “Out of the same substances one stomach will extract nourishment, and another poison; and so the same disappointments in life will chasten and refine one man’s spirit and embitter another’s.” (William Matthews, <span class="emphasis">Webster’s Encyclopedia of Dictionaries,</span> New American Edition, Ottenheimer Publishers, Inc., p. 864.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p16" pid="zwG0wWLL-0qFuYxVZwL2kw" hash="u2NVug">“‘You remember the story of the two buckets that went down in the well; as the one came up, it said, “This is surely a cold and dreary world. No matter how many times I come up full, I always have to go down empty.” Then the other bucket laughed and said, “With me it is different. No matter how many times I go down empty, I always come up full.”’” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1951, p. 40.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p17" pid="Pz1VkdWe3k-_RPBJcKcRxQ" hash="hkWQAw">Brother Joseph Stucki, a faithful Church member, died Christmas Eve in 1927 after a short illness, leaving his wife with seven children, the eldest son being on a mission. Two of the children and a nephew she was rearing were later taken in death. Another son was also sent on a mission. This was accomplished by much hard work—taking in sewing and living on a few dollars per month from an insurance policy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p18" pid="CtlpPswwFU2goEH13AV1hQ" hash="4_SEoA">During this difficult time, flour was being distributed to needy members of the ward. Some of the young men had been asked to deliver it. A bag of flour was brought to Sister Stucki’s home. Since she felt that there were other families in the ward that needed that flour worse than she did, she declined to keep it, telling the young man that she was trying to teach her family to be independent and self-reliant. While worthy members of the Church should feel free to accept help from the Church proffered by the bishop, Sister Stucki was trying to teach the young man who came to her door a lesson. You see, the young man delivering the flour was her own son! All the surviving children attended college and became very successful people. They lived by the motto, “Make it do, or do without.”</p>

H. Spurgeon, Sorrow’s Discipline, no. 9.) Some of the blessings available in overcoming economic adversity are:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p20" pid="p4y8nHe-_EixqV7mEpp5Dg" hash="gaWcDQ">First, and perhaps most important, our faith and testimony can be strengthened. The faithful member of the Church learns that in times of economic stress the Lord helps those who have sought him early. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/54.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 54:10</a>.) But those members who haven’t begun early in their religious life may resolve to seek the Lord more diligently. We learn to recognize the Lord’s hand in helping us. In hard times we have a chance to reevaluate and reorder our priorities in life. We learn what is most important to us. The way is open to strengthen faith and testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p21" pid="6auO3KNVpEu4WNdqrEPTYQ" hash="Oz4oBQ">Second, we may learn the need for humility. Our dependence upon the Lord becomes a means of developing teachableness, an important aspect of humility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p22" pid="Op3zO2kaeka2_gH0mO_e_A" hash="lEcdEw">Third, family members learn cooperation and love for each other by being forced to draw closer together to survive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p23" pid="Mo7vJc3yoUqwHIvkswo-JQ" hash="9hM8Ag">Fourth, personal dignity and self-respect may be achieved. Someone said, “Be glad there are big hurdles in life, and rejoice, too, that they are higher than most people care to surmount. Be happy they are numerous.” (Anonymous.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p24" pid="9wt9xYqgWEK6kjS4dW2ggw" hash="RK-U2w">Fifth, we can become stronger and more resilient. Edmund Burke said: “Difficulty is a severe instructor, set over us by the supreme ordinance of a parental Guardian and Legislator, who knows us better than we know ourselves, and he loves us better too. … He that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves, and sharpens our skill. Our antagonist is our helper.” (“Reflections on the Revolution in France,” in Edmund Burke, Harvard Classics, 50 vols., New York: P. F. Collier and Son Co., 1909, 24:299–300.)</p>

Sometimes economic adversity requires more time than we anticipate. He who learns to bear his adversities while working to overcome them increases in patience, and thus he is not overcome by his circumstances. In economic and social affliction certain people of the Book of Mormon were exhorted to bear them patiently that they might not be “led away by the temptations of the devil.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.39" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:39</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p26" pid="yn0nlf_rZkuA4wycOK47iA" hash="30sIGw">Seventh, we rise to heights previously unobtainable by the use of talents and skills which might not have been developed otherwise. Economic necessity opens the way for profitable learning experiences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p27" pid="oGLnMRnGsUaIVIMQtVGgug" hash="HvfT1g">Eighth, we can learn to trust the Lord and thus overcome fear. “If ye are prepared ye shall not fear.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:30</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p28" pid="z83dWPrjB0iMi4oID1UMiw" hash="IIneEw">There are many ways economic hard times can be met. Sometimes we must accept less than we hope for. A speaker once stated, “I passed a small church displaying a large sign. It read: ‘Annual Strawberry Festival,’ and below in small letters ‘On account of depression, prunes will be served.’” (<span class="emphasis">Braude Speakers Encyclopedia,</span> p. 51.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p29" pid="jnxLc42YREycSD2h-G2nFg" hash="Pe69Ww">Karen Nielson was born in Aalborg, Denmark, in 1844. She was the daughter of a farm family. In her early years she was taught the skills of successful dairy farming at the knee of her father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p30" pid="o5rT2YRbcEaSO2yhAu_fXQ" hash="KBdxvw">In 1861, Karen was baptized and was never able to return to her home because of her father’s opposition to her conversion. She left Denmark and immigrated to Utah with a group of Scandinavian Saints in 1862. She lived for a few years in Utah County where she married Benjamin Franklin Barney, and then they were called to settle the Sevier Valley.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-blessings-we-receive-as-we-meet-the-challenges-of-economic-stress.p31" pid="peY8aaC3Ukyp5oJRVozuIw" hash="lC5gKA">Karen bore ten children and then was left a widow with several of her children still at home. She had no close family to return to, so she drew on the knowledge she had gained on the Danish farm. She improved the dairy herd using the breeding skills she’d learned from her father. Her herd was soon recognized as one of the finest in the area, and she was able to support her family and care for their needs. Until Karen was well into her eighties, she milked her cows night and morning and cared for her farm with the help of her sons and grandsons. Her legacy was one of hard work and the knowledge that our lives are only as good as we make them. She never turned away from hardships—they seemed only to strengthen her.</p>

	<p pid="izffWNNrUUOBj7XqDKhimA" hash="6KGzYg">I have previously suggested eight blessings that may come as we strive to overcome economic adversities. I should like to now suggest six ways to help us from being overcome by economic stress:</p>

            <span class="emphasis">Seek first the kingdom of God.</span> (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.33" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:33</a>.) This seeking includes the payment of our tithes and a generous fast offering and thus being blessed both spiritually and temporally by our obedience. Seeking first the kingdom of God will involve striving to keep the law the Apostle James called “the royal law,” which is, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/2.8" class="scriptureRef">James 2:8</a>.) Seeking first the kingdom of God involves the keeping of the divine commandments. Spiritual strength comes from many sources, including personal prayer, the study of the scriptures, and the willingness to “submit to all things … the Lord seeth fit to inflict.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>.) These measures can give us a certain, peaceful stability.</p>

            <span class="emphasis">Solidify family strengths and resources.</span> Chief among a family’s resources are its spiritual strengths, which are enhanced by praying together. Budgeting money together will produce a special unity, as will the holding of family councils. We should work together toward storing a year’s supply of food, clothing, and other necessities. In times of stress extra acts of kindness are particularly needed and appreciated. When there is limited money available, it is easier to teach children the wise use of money, including the need to save for the future. The family can be reminded to maintain an eternal perspective rather than concentrate on worldly possessions and wealth. Family organizations are helpful to render the individual help that may be needed. It is also important to learn how to accept family help graciously.</p>

And again, “All things shall work together for your good.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 90:24</a>.) The attitude with which we submit to “all things” is important. Maintaining a positive attitude and being cheerful are helpful. A belief that “all these things shall give thee experience, and … be for thy good” is like a spiritual stabilizer. (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:7</a>.)</p>

            <span class="emphasis">Be adaptable in your work.</span> Theodore Roosevelt said: “No man needs sympathy because he has to work. … Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.” (<span class="emphasis">The Reader’s Digest Treasury of Modern Quotations,</span> New York: Reader’s Digest Press, 1975, p. 169.) In times of economic difficulty it may be necessary to work for less pay. We should be willing to learn new, marketable skills. There are a great many men who have found new joy and satisfaction in having a second career wholly unrelated to the work for which they were originally trained. Family members need to find ways to supplement income through appropriate work opportunities. Being flexible in our approach to our work opportunities may just make it possible to keep afloat financially. Giving a full day’s work for a full day’s pay has saved many jobs. It will also help us avoid accepting government doles which rob us of our dignity and our self-respect.</p>

            <span class="emphasis">Avoid Debt.</span> President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., taught us to “avoid debt as we would a plague.” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1937, p. 26.) This is particularly sound counsel in these times of exorbitantly high interest rates. Debt and its ever-present offspring, interest, are merciless taskmasters. A year and a half ago in this Tabernacle, President Clark’s voice, on a tape, was heard to say, “Whoever borrows should understand what interest is; it is with them every minute of the day and night.” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1938, p. 103.)</p>

            <span class="emphasis">Reduce expense.</span> When asked how some people in a small farming community in southern Utah got by on their meager cash income, George Lyman said, “They lived on the absence of expense.” On another occasion, someone observed: “Generations of great thinkers have dreamed of a moneyless society somewhere in the future. As far as some of us are concerned, we’re already ahead of our time.” (Sam Levenson, “You Don’t Have to Be in Who’s Who to Know What’s What,” Simon and Schuster, 1979, p. 184.) Economic wealth does not endow eternal blessings, and financial difficulty does not revoke eternal covenants.</p>

As a young man I recall President J. Reuben Clark pleading time after time in general priesthood meetings that there be unity in the priesthood. He would quote frequently the message of the Lord, “I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p2" pid="pOx6LPdTuEyZG3Q89PDAFg" hash="wVmFog">Unity in the priesthood should reflect unity in our homes. One wonders why so many more homes are now being weakened and why so many families are disintegrating. The reasons are complex. No doubt it has much to do with the social disorders of the day. We are all subjected to sparkling, enticing false advertising. Violence is powerfully portrayed everywhere. Our society is permeated with the suggestion that selfishness and instant gratification are acceptable or even respectable conduct. The evils of alcoholism have exploded and been magnified by other forms of drug abuse. The sexual revolution has been crippling to the spiritual, mental, and physical health of families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p3" pid="lphXRKacXkCA21IdkDnIvg" hash="mIFCUw">Among the assaults on families are the attacks on our faith, for which parents should prepare their children. Some of it is coming from apostates who had testimonies and now seem unable to leave the Church alone. One, complaining of Church policy, was heard to say: “I am so mad: if I had been paying my tithing I would quit.” Persecution is not new to the devoted followers of Christ. More recently, however, the anger and venom of our enemies seems to be increasing. Brigham Young said, “We never began to build a temple without the bells of hell beginning to ring.” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Brigham Young,</span> sel. John A. Widtsoe, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1973, p. 410.) With twenty-two temples under construction or in the planning stage, there seems to be a lot of bells to be rung.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p4" pid="4365N3X7vESWB4SS_dkgUw" hash="fG64kg">When I hear of a family breaking up, I question if family home evening and family prayers have been regularly held in that home and if the law of tithing has been observed. Has that family reverenced the Sabbath day? Have the parents murmured against Church teachings and leaders? I wonder what could possibly justify the forsaking of eternal promises made in the temple, or what could warrant the breaking up of a family with children of tender years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p5" pid="7kxLWd2ciUWa0mu10-AeFg" hash="td32-Q">Why is one family strong, yet another family weak? The problems are infinitely complex. Yet, there are answers. Abundant evidence shows that the presence of a firm, loving father in the home is far more likely to produce responsible, law-abiding children than if the father is not there, or if he does not function as a father at home. In either case it throws a double burden on the mother.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p8" pid="1-1JoFv8-UWhplrydyX2-Q" hash="5BVImg">Surely, the most important ingredient in producing family happiness for members of this Church is a deep religious commitment under wise, mature parental supervision. Devotion to God in the home seems to forge the spiritual moorings and stability that can help the family cope. Some may say this is an over-simplification of a very complex problem, yet I believe the answers lie within the framework of the restored gospel of Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p9" pid="GB6orqnh7k2ADsuZPVEB4A" hash="fzBtUw">One of the reasons for weakened families is the lack of absolutes. An absolute has no restriction, exception, or qualification. It is fixed and certain. There must be some things which family members should always try to do, and some activities that family members should scrupulously avoid. Truthfulness should be an absolute in every family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p10" pid="v4v7zZ9ul0OUny10NtrzNw" hash="yuFqqA">How can parents and family members introduce and build familial strength? One of my closest boyhood friends recently died of cancer. His family decided he would be happier spending his last days in his own home, so they took him out of the veterans hospital, where the cancer was diagnosed, and cared for him within the familiar walls of his own house. His eighty-one-year-old mother left her home in another state and moved in to supervise the tender, loving care. A sister and a brother left their homes far away several times to help in the emergencies. His children, some of whom also lived away, came and set up a twenty-four-hour vigil so that he would never be alone.</p>

          <p pid="aiKoPpv4_k-URk2HBWyEPg" hash="lGlQ_Q">Hold family prayer night and morning. The source of our enormous individual strength and potential is no mystery. It is an endowment from God. We need not consume addicting chemicals found in drugs, including alcohol, to make us capable of meeting life’s problems. We need only to draw constantly from the power source through humble prayer. It often takes a superhuman effort for parents of a busy family to get everyone out of bed and together for family prayer and scripture study. You may not always feel like praying when you finally get together, but it will pay great dividends if you persevere.</p>

          <span class="label">2.</span>
          <p pid="ZDFvygpFuEK2k4MMGGsRyA" hash="K4ZKDA">Study the scriptures. All of us need the strength that comes from daily reading of the scriptures. Parents must have a knowledge of the standard works to teach them to their children. A child who has been taught from the scriptures has a priceless legacy. Children are fortified when they become acquainted with the heroic figures and stories of the scriptures such as Daniel in the lions’ den, David and Goliath, Nephi, Helaman and the stripling warriors, and all the others.</p>
          <p pid="nttCZHDojkqgV5p_kWXZtA" hash="ekUFww">Having prayer, scripture study, and meals together gives incredibly important time to talk and listen as parents and children, brothers and sisters.</p>

          <p pid="IwmFiA-yLkiWEpMjyFG8Bg" hash="2-sOiQ">Teach discipline and obedience. If parents do not discipline their children and teach them to obey, society may discipline them in a way neither the parents nor the children will like. Dr. Lee Salk, child psychologist, said: “The ‘do your own thing’ trend has interfered with people developing close and trusting family relationships. It tells people that they are neurotic if they feel a sense of responsibility for the feelings of other family members. People are also told to let all their feelings out, even if it is very hurtful to someone else.” (Special Section Families, U.S. News and World Report, Inc., 16 June 1980, p. 60.) As Dr. Salk states, this is, of course, patently wrong. Without discipline and obedience in the home, the unity of the family collapses.</p>

          <p pid="DvzXsZHVIUuy8xseQ5897Q" hash="6jUFrw">Place a high priority on loyalty to each other. The dictionary defines the word loyal as being “constant and faithful in any relation implying trust or confidence; bearing true allegiance to the constituted authority.” (Britannica World Language Dictionary, s.v. “loyalty.”) If family members are not loyal to each other, they cannot be loyal to themselves.</p>

          <p pid="u72h-CnuukOWYCBV77jqOw" hash="42au8g">Teach principles of self-worth and self-reliance. One of the main problems in families today is that we spend less and less time together. Some spend an extraordinary amount of time, when they are together, in front of the television, which robs them of personal time for reinforcing feelings of self-worth. Time together is precious time—time needed to talk, to listen, to encourage, and to show how to do things. Less time together can result in loneliness, which may produce inner feelings of being unsupported, untreasured, and inadequate. Self-worth is reinforced in many ways. When parents say to a son or daughter, leaving the home for some activity, the simple but meaningful words, “Remember who you are,” they have helped that child feel important.</p>

          <p pid="CHXjl0uuWEibQ5Cop96kUA" hash="M_L0Pw">Develop family traditions. Some of the great strengths of families can be found in their own traditions, which may consist of many things: making special occasions of the blessing of children, baptisms, ordinations to the priesthood, birthdays, fishing trips, skits on Christmas Eve, family home evening, and so forth. The traditions of each family are unique and are provided in large measure by the mother’s imprint.</p>

He always did that. … Taking me in his arms and calling me by my kid name, he said, ‘Grandy, my boy, I love you.’” (In Conference Report, October 1967, pp. 111–12.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p17" pid="pTt63e8VhE-4c1qIzXvqxQ" hash="CpHA8w">How can our priesthood leaders, already administratively burdened, be helpful to parents in order to help their children? I believe the answer is basic. In the last days of the Savior’s ministry he said to Peter: “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p18" pid="SvzjNtGEKUCmj7pEy8B2rQ" hash="mDDo0w">“But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.31-32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:31–32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p19" pid="G1LgmE20o0ODZh0MlxzYYQ" hash="4VALtw">There needs to be a converting and a strengthening of parents. This comes about by the teaching, the understanding, and the applying of gospel principles. It is a great challenge to the priesthood leaders to have everyone in our wards, branches, and quorums be strengthened in their understanding of the gospel. Priesthood leaders are clothed with great authority. When bishops and other priesthood leaders are needed for specific family or personal reasons, their availability is a great strength and comfort. Their genuine interest and concern for us as individuals is a vital support mechanism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p20" pid="kvIiICK65EuvmWVbm-Ki2w" hash="Qf5hTQ">Now, brethren, in conclusion may I say something to promote better understanding in our work. Let us not perceive that just because we are holding our meetings, making our home teaching visits, and are involved in other activities that we are necessarily fully serving the membership of the Church. All of the Spirit, the goodness, and the mercy of Christ should be found in our ministering in the Church and in our families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p21" pid="laWqC19MQEi5XtdIEDU6Tw" hash="FT0Bcw">Religion in the distant past has often been cloaked with rigorous fanaticism, bigotry, and intolerance. With the restoration of the gospel came the holy priesthood of God, to be exercised not in the spirit of coercion and compulsion but in the spirit of free agency, resting on a foundation of “gentleness and meekness, and … love unfeigned.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:41</a>.) This is the sweet spirit of the Christ himself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p22" pid="ZKoZykrzK0S3l-9CeeK7og" hash="nLYOlA">Now, these exalted concepts must be implemented by wise men. As direction is given in the Church and in our homes, there should be no spirit of dictatorship and no <span class="emphasis">unrighteous dominion.</span> The keys and powers of the priesthood can be “handled only upon the principles of righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:36</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p23" pid="bRYqnpPTAE2YrH4dSMtJBQ" hash="EuU7ug">God, through his prophets, has given the priesthood in recent times the great challenge to advance worldwide the holy work in which we are engaged. All worthy men may now be given the priesthood. With the coming of these inspired changes, I wonder if there has been an enlarging of attitude based upon the exalted principles the Savior taught. Has the extended responsibility of the priesthood caused us to have a better understanding of our work? Are some of us unsuccessful in differentiating between the sin and the sinner?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p24" pid="Eso3tOf4K0Kfimb-fZtWrw" hash="IXNK0A">Many of us have sat in ward councils, priesthood executive councils, and other meetings on the ward levels. We took the time to identify the names of those who had lost their way. But our efforts to reach them could have been more effective. At times we were too judgmental. Sometimes we lost track of the individual in our focus on the program. I do not criticize the programs and activities. I am grateful for them. They are necessary. They are inspired and great. I only ask for greater concern for the individual and the family, which after all is the purpose of God’s holy work. “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p25" pid="SvcmaKQD4EuhyNgG9kocFg" hash="nsoagg">May we put our lives and homes in order. We must stay true to the great absolutes of the restored gospel: namely, Christ and him crucified, the divine restoration of the gospel in our time, the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith’s divine calling as a prophet of God, and continuing revelation to his successors, according to the needs of the Church and its members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/enriching-family-life.p26" pid="kG0FN5srLUeCLsoItYamCw" hash="lmT0Ww">If we are united and go forward under the leadership of those who have the keys to the kingdom of God on earth, our homes will be enriched, our lives purified, and the gates of hell will not prevail against us. May we follow the counsel of Alma, and “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>.)

It was a timeworn copy of the Book of Mormon. Almost every page was marked; in spite of tender handling, some of the leaves were dog-eared, and the cover was worn thin. No one had to tell her that one can get closer to God by reading the Book of Mormon than by any other book. She was already there. She had read it, studied it, prayed over it, and taught from it. As a young man I held her book in my hands and tried to see, through her eyes, the great truths of the Book of Mormon to which she so readily testified and which she so greatly loved.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p2" pid="WultY-MUvUGSk8GGXYuObQ" hash="uu_VLg">As a young boy in the Cottonwood Ward, I was greatly impressed when I listened to James H. Moyle tell in sacrament meeting of his having heard both Martin Harris and David Whitmer, two of the witnesses of the Book of Mormon, affirm their testimony concerning that book. They, along with Oliver Cowdery, had testified in connection with the original publication of the Book of Mormon “that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we … bear record that these things are true.” (“The Testimony of Three Witnesses,” Book of Mormon.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p3" pid="4Tjuc7KPykWIyBKkoLCoGA" hash="gr1hEQ">When James H. Moyle visited David Whitmer, Whitmer was an old man; he was out of the Church and was living in a log cabin in Richmond, Missouri. Of this visit to David Whitmer, James H. Moyle stated in this very building on March 22, 1908:</p>

He told me in all the solemnity of his advanced years, that the testimony he had given to the world, and which was published in the Book of Mormon, was true, every word of it, and that he had never deviated nor departed in any particular from that testimony, and that nothing in the world could separate him from the sacred message that was delivered to him. I still wondered if it was not possible that he could have been deceived, … so I induced him to relate to me, under such cross-examination as I was able to interpose, every detail of what took place. He described minutely the spot in the woods, the large log that separated him from the angel, and that he saw the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, that he handled them, and that he did hear the voice of God declare that the plates were correctly translated. I asked him if there was any possibility for him to have been deceived, and that it was all a mistake, but he said, ‘No.’” (quoted in Gordon B. Hinckley, <span class="emphasis">James Henry Moyle</span> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1951], p. 366–67.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p5" pid="2FEgZU4A_0CBBqWSRANHvw" hash="qEGklA">However, the Book of Mormon did not yield its profound message to me as an unearned legacy. I question whether one can acquire an understanding of this great book except through singleness of mind and strong purpose of heart. We must ask not only if it is true, but also do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Said Moroni, “Ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:4</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p6" pid="0XGSqHmay0miLnDGZsjq7Q" hash="4Onujg">Joseph Smith, who translated the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon came, had this to say: “I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:461.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p7" pid="3Rc8Vc4Jx0yhZ1RuiU31qg" hash="lmeG1w">The dictionary says that a keystone is “the uppermost and last set stone of an arch which completes it and locks its members together.” A secondary definition is “the fundamental element, as of science or doctrine.” (<span class="emphasis">Funk and Wagnalls New Practical Standard Dictionary, Britannica World Language Edition,</span> 2 vols., 1956, 1:735.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p8" pid="m9lrD_oAPkWiGU9eig8O6g" hash="eWj-sg">The Book of Mormon is a keystone because it establishes and ties together eternal principles and precepts, rounding out basic doctrines of salvation. It is the crowning gem in the diadem of our holy scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p9" pid="Wby_G-MsLkujAM1jMxZujA" hash="q3Uc0w">It is a keystone for other reasons also. In the promise of Moroni previously referred to—namely, that God will manifest the truth of the Book of Mormon to every sincere inquirer having faith in Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:4</a>)—we have a key link in a self-locking chain.</p>

With that firmly in place, it logically follows that one can receive a verification that the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price are true companion scriptures to the Bible and the Book of Mormon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p11" pid="VCOE3ZgRbE6oOTAuNPoPqQ" hash="oWkn3Q">All of this confirms the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the divine mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, led by a living prophet enjoying continuous revelation. From these basic verities can flow an understanding of other saving principles of the fulness of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p12" pid="0HbDKgQX40aDmIAXnK7VGQ" hash="XAuF9A">In addition, the Book of Mormon is a necessary keystone of our own individual faith. President Ezra Taft Benson affirmed, “I have noted within the Church the difference in discernment, in insight, conviction, and spirit between those who know and love the Book of Mormon and those who do not. That book is a great sifter.” (<span class="emphasis">New Era,</span> May 1975, p. 19.) An understanding of the Book of Mormon can really help lock into place an individual’s faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

The title page states that it is an account taken from the records of people living in the Americas before and after Christ. It was “written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation. … And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.”</p>

Cannon stated that “the Book of Mormon is not a geographical primer. It was not written to teach geographical truths. What is told us of the situation of the various lands or cities … is usually simply an incidental remark connected with the doctrinal or historical portions of the work.” (<span class="emphasis">Juvenile Instructor,</span> Jan. 1890, p. 18.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p15" pid="OY7Xs0psz0q79Ve4HaUTvg" hash="2fpsvQ">What, then, is the Book of Mormon? It is confirming evidence of the birth, life, and crucifixion of Jesus and of his work as the Messiah and the Redeemer. Nephi writes about the Book of Mormon: “All ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.10" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 33:10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p16" pid="RvjqB3Ux3EGISsqhXV7yng" hash="6YPA4A">Nephi and his brother Jacob join with Isaiah to constitute three powerful pre-Messianic voices proclaiming the first coming of Jesus. Isaiah is quoted extensively by Nephi because he is the principal Old Testament prophet who prophesied of the coming of the Messiah.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p17" pid="mIc6BilHi0OF9g4k-yHRgg" hash="K_lJCQ">The Book of Mormon establishes the truthfulness of the Bible. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.40" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 13:40</a>.) It is evidence “to the world that the holy scriptures are true.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:11</a>.) It foretells the establishment of the fulness of the gospel of peace and salvation. It was written to give us principles and guidelines for our eternal journey.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p18" pid="kO03tDSWpUaek8QeYWWL3A" hash="I5eBEg">One of the ultimate messages of the Book of Mormon, and indeed of the Old Testament and all human history, is that mankind cannot reach perfection on its own. There is another message which comes through loud and clear from its pages. It is the often unpopular and seemingly harsh injunction—“Repent or perish.” When the Book of Mormon people listened to this prophetic message, they flourished. When they forgot the message, they perished.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p19" pid="DIZ3wcUqkUKfjhKv8X-CrQ" hash="IyTeAw">In Galatians Paul said, “The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/3.24" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 3:24</a>.) The records maintained by the Book of Mormon prophets—and portions of what is now the Bible brought from the eastern continent—served, according to Abinadi, “to keep them in remembrance of God and their duty towards him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.30" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 13:30</a>.) So the Book of Mormon is a schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.27-32" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 13:27–32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p20" pid="EsQuljNF-Ua_EgbSCcr7Lg" hash="2Ps54g">The test for understanding this sacred book is preeminently spiritual. An obsession with secular knowledge rather than spiritual understanding will make its pages difficult to unlock.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p21" pid="cjFgM8HXTUuJavJh5weKRA" hash="QRKZWQ">To me it is inconceivable that Joseph Smith, without divine help, could have written this complex and profound book. There is no way that Joseph Smith, an unlearned young frontiersman, could have fabricated the great truths it contains, generated its great spiritual power, or falsified the testimony of Christ that it contains. The book itself testifies that it is the holy word of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p22" pid="XFJsD_cf0EOHFGNpZq8P0A" hash="3zWLPQ">New evidence of the divinity of the Book of Mormon has just come to light. The recently discovered letter of Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph’s mother, dated January 23, 1829, to her sister-in-law, Mary Pierce, is additional confirmation of the Book of Mormon. This letter was written a year before the Book of Mormon was published. It contains an accurate statement of some of the happenings of the times and the contents of the book and other historical information. [ed. note: This letter was later discovered to be a forgery, a fact that in no way affects the truth and accuracy of the Book of Mormon.]</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p23" pid="AJ8NYGpNWEKfRWih1OiHzg" hash="9zMoBA">With the aid of modern computer science, a topical guide has been placed in the King James Version of the Bible, containing doctrinal cross-references to the other scriptures. From these references we find countless confirming evidences that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon with the aid and power of God. On almost every one of its 531 pages are numerous references that tie in doctrinally to the King James Bible. In comparison, many statements that seem fragmented in the Bible are more complete in the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p24" pid="Il1g6jwydka1s1bLPfFTKw" hash="wXuMZA">References to teachings also taught in the Old Testament and the New Testament are so numerous and overwhelming throughout the Book of Mormon that one can come to a definitive conclusion by logic that a human intellect could not have conceived of them all. But more important than logic is the confirmation by the Holy Spirit that the story of the Book of Mormon is true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p25" pid="Tuo0_4jgHEyYXfSiAlBIaQ" hash="0m3dsw">All scriptures are one in that they testify of Jesus. Jacob, a Book of Mormon prophet, reminds us that “none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7.11" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 7:11</a>.) Speaking of the scriptures, the Psalmist said, “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/119.105" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 119:105</a>.)</p>

Why, then, has hostility been engendered against the book? In part, no doubt, it may have come because the origin of the book was from golden plates delivered to Joseph Smith by an angel. These were seen and handled by selected witnesses, but not put on public display. Perhaps it is also because it is claimed primarily to be the work of ancient prophets here on the American continent.</p>

He said in 3 Nephi, “This is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.32" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:32</a>.)</p>

As a special witness, I testify that Jesus is the Christ and that Nephi’s and Isaiah’s prophecies of His coming have in fact been fulfilled. Like Nephi, “We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophecy of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:26</a>.)</p>

I rejoice in the calls of Elder Oaks and Elder Nelson to the Council of Twelve Apostles. Brother Nelson has touched my heart deeper than any other man. He has held my heart in his hands and has cut into it and sewn in eight bypasses. He and the Lord literally gave me a new heart.

This area is known to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the Sacred Grove. On the day of our visit, the bees were kissing the wildflowers, and the soft zephyrs gently rustled the leaves of the great trees. It is a place of perfect peace and serenity. It was easy to believe that the heavens were opened and that the magnificent vision took place there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-magnificent-vision-near-palmyra.p3" pid="rT2W-usiokWfpTSMB-AIcw" hash="eEPcAg">I refer to the awesome experience of Joseph Smith when he beheld God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, in the spring of 1820. There has been no event more glorious, more controversial, nor more important in the story of Joseph Smith than this vision. It is possibly the most singular event to occur on the earth since the Resurrection. Those who do not believe it happened find it difficult to explain away. Too much has happened since its occurrence to summarily deny that it ever took place. Some years later, still suffering under the impact of that happening, Joseph said, “If I had not experienced what I have, I should not have known it myself.” (<span class="emphasis">Millennial Star,</span> Nov. 1844, p. 93.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-magnificent-vision-near-palmyra.p4" pid="76lT3W5-9U-2PJ_QtMCsOQ" hash="rHAMRQ">Young Joseph Smith, fourteen years of age, lived with his family near Palmyra, New York. In the spring of 1820, Joseph, like many others, was caught up in the religious excitement of the day. Desiring to know the truth for himself, and encouraged by the epistle of James, he knelt in solitary, fervent prayer in that beautiful grove not far from his home. He was at first violently seized by “the power of some actual being from the unseen world.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.16" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:16</a>.) In an effort to extricate himself, he exerted all his powers to call upon God for deliverance from this tremendous evil power. At this point he said:</p>

When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—<span class="emphasis">This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.16-17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:16–17</a>.)</p>

Obviously, Joseph was overwhelmed by the occasion and the instructions he received.</p>

As a result, much ridicule, contempt, and even hatred were visited upon him. His mother, Lucy Mack Smith, relates that after the First Vision, “from this time until the twenty-first of September, 1823, Joseph continued, as usual, to labor with his father, and nothing during this interval occurred of very great importance—though he suffered every kind of opposition and persecution from the different orders of religionists.” (<span class="emphasis">History of Joseph Smith by His Mother,</span> ed. Preston Nibley, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1958, p. 74.) The prejudice and the hatred pursued Joseph until his martyrdom.</p>

I have actually seen a vision. … I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.25" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:25</a>.)</p>

These accounts corroborate the First Vision as written by Joseph Smith himself.</p>

As an example, the Prophet refers in the published account of the First Vision to the religious fervor in the area where the Smith family was living at the time. Among others, Brigham Young later affirmed: “I very well recollect the reformation which took place in the country among the various denominations of Christians—the Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and others—when Joseph was a boy.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 12:67.)</p>

Later, Joseph received the plates of gold and translated the Book of Mormon from them. He subsequently received the keys and powers of the holy priesthood of God, and established The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

I have such a conviction. It is a sure conviction that lies deep in my soul. As a special witness of the same Christ who appeared with the Father and instructed the boy Joseph Smith, I bear witness of the truthfulness of the magnificent First Vision near Palmyra. I declare this in all soberness and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="DpmwP2-EE0ml0guxn5kb4g" hash="Et8I4A">With a prayer in my heart for understanding, and with some timidity, I speak today concerning parents and children with special problems. I do so because I am persuaded that these extraordinary challenges are, as the Savior himself said, that “the works of God should be made manifest.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/9.3" class="scriptureRef">John 9:3</a>.) How these challenges are met can often be the expression of the very essence of the gospel of Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="Cpwwmka1UU6H0zLDZ-5nNg" hash="26EOEg">It is a common sight in our congregations to have a small group of people near the front who communicate by the graceful motion of the hands as well as by the Spirit. They are people who cannot hear. Always some kind and gifted soul sits in front of the group and lovingly converts the sounds and syllables into distinguishable motions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="6o_CfRA73EWS4V2pavp2gw" hash="-tXotQ">Recently in a large meeting, we were touched to observe the hearing-impaired members singing the hymns in parts through the motion of their hands. When the bass and tenor parts were sung, the hands of the sisters were motionless; when the soprano and alto parts were sung, the hands of the brethren were still. To me it was a very touching sight.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="ypUYfhlczE-xE5y1g46ksg" hash="y8IWyw">Those who are without hearing are some of the special ones among us, as are the people who do not have sight and those who have other physical or mental limitations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="1Cvkj12Q1kCVvkI_VfTYjQ" hash="PR0lDg">I wish to say a word of appreciation for those among us who struggle with handicaps, and impart a message of comfort to their families, especially to the parents. Where in all of the world is the son or daughter of God who is totally without blemish? Is life not worth living if it is not perfect? Do not the people with handicaps also bring their own gifts to life—and to others who are free of those handicaps—in a manner that cannot come in any other way? There is hardly a family without one of its members who might be considered physically or mentally diminished. I have a great appreciation for those loving parents who stoically bear and overcome their anguish and heartbreak for a child who was born with or who has developed a serious mental or physical infirmity. This anguish often continues every day, without relief, during the lifetime of the parent or the child. Not infrequently, parents are required to give superhuman nurturing care that never ceases, day or night. Many a mother’s arms and heart have ached years on end, giving comfort and relieving the suffering of her special child.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="iYvQcS5LrkeEvGE1qQwyWg" hash="ysRHDw">The anguish of parents upon first learning that their child is not developing normally can be indescribable. The tearful concern, the questions about what the child will and will not be able to do are heartrending: “Doctor, will our child be able to talk, walk, care for himself?” Often there are no certain answers but one: “You will have to be grateful for whatever development your child achieves.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="8I7WTI1s0E2y8Y4Rp_IJLQ" hash="EBM8Kw">The paramount concern is always how to care for the person who is handicapped. The burden of future nurturing can seem overwhelming. Looking ahead to the uncertain years or even to a lifetime of constant, backbreaking care may seem more than one can bear. There are often many tears before reality is acknowledged. Parents and family members can then begin to accept and take the burden a day at a time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="CU780KSkQkegMX4HcKnjlw" hash="sXy4Pw">Said one great mother of a severely handicapped child: “I gradually began to take only one day at a time, and it didn’t seem so hard. In fact, at the end of each day I would thank the Lord for the strength I had to get through that day and pray that tomorrow would be as good. That way I learned to love him and appreciate his place in our home.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="kAkenY-EGECN_QDYrS-8mA" hash="1QMcNw">A missionary writing to his parents said of his severely handicapped younger brother: “Mom, kiss Billy every day for me. In one of the discussions we learned that my little brother is an automatic winner of the kingdom of God. I only pray that I too may live with my Heavenly Father and see my little brother and talk and converse with him. He’s a special gift, and we are truly blessed.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="GpmKFbZ2S0OP7vN3lFeC6g" hash="gHatbw">The challenge of having handicapped people is not new. Many have questioned why some have such limitations. It was so in the time of Jesus:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="pQeMUeVR5UqcXnq4kMrHhA" hash="7d50yQ">“And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="sZkNA_y_tkSd48sCXJbBMA" hash="Z0vPwA">“And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="k-HWeM9mvk6xFUf7ulB6nA" hash="_5ijZg">“Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/9.1-3" class="scriptureRef">John 9:1–3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="tuNanE6Q_U-tP5q5SwPxEQ" hash="0rReEg">How are the works of God manifest in these, our handicapped brothers and sisters? Surely they are manifested greatly in the loving care and attention given by parents, other family members, friends, and associates. The handicapped are not on trial. Those of us who live free of such limitations are the ones who are on trial. While those with handicaps cannot be measured in the same way as others, many of the handicapped benefit immensely from each accomplishment, no matter how small.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="HLV1QS9Bpky4XxnVQCueXA" hash="KwJIHA">The handiwork of God is manifest with respect to the handicapped in many ways. It is demonstrated in the miraculous way in which many individuals with mental and physical impediments are able to adjust and compensate for their limitations. Occasionally, other senses become more functional and substitute for the impaired senses in a remarkable way. A young friend greatly retarded in speech and movement repaired a complicated clock although she had had no previous training or experience in watch or clock making.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="wyEKVHGcb0eP0D_XFc1BrQ" hash="pkBKoA">Many of the special ones are superior in many ways. They, too, are in a life of progression, and new things unfold for them each day as with us all. They can be extraordinary in their faith and spirit. Some are able, through their prayers, to communicate with the infinite in a most remarkable way. Many have a pure faith in others and a powerful belief in God. They can give their spiritual strength to others around them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="-GAJ1rnqP0KCP87OnzPeeQ" hash="1IOgUg">For the handicapped, trying to cope with life is often like trying to reach the unreachable. But recall the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith: “All the minds and spirits that God ever sent into the world are susceptible of enlargement.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 354.) Certainly, in the infinite mercy of God, those with physical and mental limitations will not remain so after the Resurrection. At this time, Alma says, “the spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.43" class="scriptureRef">Alma 11:43</a>.) Afflictions, like mortality, are temporary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="ggZmpjgn6kWrv0YLUV2d8A" hash="Ci_Vbg">Surely more sharing of the burden will contribute to the emotional salvation of the person who is the primary caregiver. Just an hour of help now and then would be appreciated. One mother of a child who is handicapped said, “I could never dream of going to Hawaii on a vacation; all I can hope for is to have an evening away from home.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="6VtzoQ9NiEC12b0j0YNDig" hash="0LNaWg">The Savior’s teaching that handicaps are not punishment for sin, either in the parents or the handicapped, can also be understood and applied in today’s circumstances. How can it possibly be said that an innocent child born with a special problem is being punished? Why should parents who have kept themselves free from social disease, addicting chemicals, and other debilitating substances which might affect their offspring imagine that the birth of a disabled child is some form of divine disapproval? Usually, both the parents and the children are blameless. The Savior of the world reminds us that God “maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.45" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:45</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="vx23o3w_zEuq5VlkJIx19Q" hash="pnHVUg">May I express a word of gratitude and appreciation to those many who minister with such kindness and skill to our handicapped people. Special commendation belongs to parents and family members who have cared for their own children with special needs in the loving atmosphere of their own home. The care of those who are diminished is a special service rendered to the Master himself, for “inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these … , ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="LZCtiKiYcUG_if81r86FMg" hash="69RCpA">Parents of handicapped children are occasionally embarrassed or hurt by others who awkwardly express sympathy but cannot know or appreciate the depth of the parents’ love for a handicapped child. Perhaps there is some comparison in the fact that there is no less love in families for the helpless infant who must be fed, bathed, and diapered than for the older but still dependent members. We love those we serve and who need us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="g-H4r6SQ3UWsQ3l6j0vkfQ" hash="gTyZRA">Is it not possible to look beyond the canes, the wheelchairs, the braces, and the crutches into the hearts of the people who have need of these aids? They are human beings and want only to be treated as ordinary people. They may appear different, move awkwardly, and speak haltingly, but they have the same feelings. They laugh, they cry, they know discouragement and hope. They do not want to be shunned. They want to be loved for what they are inside, without any prejudice for their impairment. Can there not be more tolerance for differences—differences in capacity, differences in body and in mind?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="U8K64Oa20Ei0bTMpIlEUUA" hash="1G4bbA">Those who are close to the handicapped can frequently feel the nobility of the spirits who are confined in differently shaped bodies or who have crippled minds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="oIKfS9ZRX0OsEh3QoKFWjA" hash="ggyz4Q">May I also say a word of comfort for the anguished parents of children who have lost their way and have turned a deaf ear to parental pleading and teaching. While much of the time most children follow in their parents’ footsteps—obedient to their teachings, reciprocating their love—a few turn their backs like the prodigal son and waste their lives. The great principle of free agency is essential in fostering development, growth, and progress. It also permits the freedom to choose self-indulgence, wastefulness, and degradation. Children have their agency and often express it when very young. They may or may not follow the teachings and wishes of their parents. Most parents do the best they know how, but also understand well the words of Lehi: “Hear the words of a trembling parent.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.14" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 1:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="ix0Zzl4BYEWmptGjNOo12g" hash="YYUBBg">We are indebted to Elder Howard W. Hunter for these wise words: “A successful parent is one who has loved, one who has sacrificed, and one who has cared for, taught, and ministered to the needs of a child. If you have done all of these and your child is still wayward or troublesome or worldly, it could well be that you are, nevertheless, a successful parent. Perhaps there are children who have come into the world that would challenge any set of parents under any set of circumstances. Likewise, perhaps there are others who would bless the lives of, and be a joy to, almost any father or mother.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1983, p. 65.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="6urYLB2Kb0ml0LYwvJFNRg" hash="7Pyvng">As caring parents we do the best we can. I am hopeful that in parenting God will judge at least partially by the intent of the parental hearts. Children have so much to learn. Parents need to teach their children so many things. They are commanded to teach their children specifically “the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:25</a>.) But, having lived by these truths and having taught them in their home, parents cannot always ensure their children’s good behavior. Said Ezekiel, “The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ezek/18.20" class="scriptureRef">Ezek. 18:20</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="ywK0kDpny0ic67ogApsqhw" hash="U-CJ5A">Parents have the obligation to teach, not force, and having prayerfully and conscientiously taught, parents cannot be answerable for all their children’s conduct. Obedient children do bring honor to their parents, but it is unfair to judge faithful parents by the actions of children who will not listen and follow. Parents do have the obligation to instruct, but children themselves have a responsibility to listen, to be obedient, and to perform as they have been taught. Parents are parents and usually serve their children more than the children serve their parents. To concerned parents I would paraphrase Winston Churchill: “Never give up, never give up, never, never, never.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="f2U7dAj2IEmZUZbmqHybUg" hash="yVLWWw">I do not have any foolproof formula for the nurturing of children. Beyond being a good example and teaching faith, it is essential to give children unreserved love, to give measured discipline, and to try to instill self-mastery in them. A great mother who scrubbed floors to help her children through school said, “I taught my children to pray, to have good manners, and to work.” The Lord reminds us that we should continually teach repentance, faith in Christ, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:25</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="4fCITDQmVUiUXhwFaX710Q" hash="WUb1aw">The works of God are manifest in so many ways in the challenges of parents and children, especially to those who are handicapped and to those who have lost their way. For those who have asked, “Why did this happen to me?” or, “Why did this happen to my child?” there is assurance that the difficulty will not last forever. Life on this earth is not long. Caring for the unfortunate and laboring with the wayward is a manifestation of the pure love of Christ. For those who carry such a challenge in this life, God himself provides a response. That response is patience and the strength to endure. It lies, as Paul and Job testify, “in hope of eternal life, … promised before the world began” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/titus/1.2" class="scriptureRef">Titus 1:2</a>), “when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/38.7" class="scriptureRef">Job 38:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/the-works-of-god.p" pid="iDMVy9Fv6UCa7hfNywdeww" hash="x1YIyw">I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world and the Redeemer of mankind. I testify that through obedience to His commandments we may enjoy the strength to triumph over every challenge of this life. May God grant this peaceful sustaining influence to all and especially to those in greatest need. I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The hospital was staffed with native orderlies who were to keep the hospital clean, change the beds, and generally be of help to the patients. Because of the prevalence of malaria and its carrier, the mosquito, we slept under large mosquito nets which hung from the ceiling and covered the whole bed. One night as I went to bed I slipped my wallet under my pillow and drifted off to sleep.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-resurrection.p2" pid="FzBg3ypJ4UyI07MqUC0QBA" hash="AFWngg">Some time later in the night I was awakened and startled to feel some hands slipping under my bedclothes. I suspected that a thief was after my wallet. I instinctively grabbed one of the hands and switched on the light. My wallet slipped out from under the pillow. To my surprise, I held the arm of the native boy who was the orderly assigned to clean my room. All he said in defense of his action was, “Don’t worry. I am a disciple.” He could tell from the look on my face that I did not understand. In further explanation, he said simply, “I am a disciple. I am a Christian. I do not want your purse. I was only tucking the mosquito netting around your bed to protect you from the mosquitoes while you slept.” I came to know that this young man was not only a Christian, he was a disciple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-resurrection.p3" pid="c3e0LtP85kKvbt14JOlBaw" hash="wXz-Ew">True disciples are those who go beyond simply believing. They act out their belief. Said the Savior, “If any man will <span class="emphasis">do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,</span> whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/7.17" class="scriptureRef">John 7:17</a>; italics added.) Disciples follow the Divine Master. Their actions speak in symphonic harmony with their beliefs. They know who they are. They know what God expects of them. They mirror inner peace and certainty concerning the mission and resurrection of Christ. They hunger and thirst after righteousness. They know they are here on this earth for a purpose. They understand life after death. They believe that the transcendent event in the ministry of the Christ was the Atonement, culminating in the Resurrection.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-resurrection.p4" pid="TQF6wIsmMEy_y_iZ73hWsw" hash="LqMJoQ">The prophet Ether says that a disciple may with “surety hope for a better world, … which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.4" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:4</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-resurrection.p5" pid="WmD-3Y5eOUGCz0hKvx9uUg" hash="UMZsDA">I should like on this afternoon before Easter to testify concerning the surety of hope all disciples may have through the resurrection of the Christ. The resurrection of Jesus is one of the greatest messages of all Christianity. It is a divine gift of the Atonement for all mankind. The idea that one who has died can live again was so unprecedented, so foreign to all human experience, that even the Apostles, who had been told it would happen, could hardly believe it.</p>

John testified that Peter and John literally ran to the sepulchre to see for themselves. They found that the tomb was empty, just as the women had said, except for the linen burial clothes. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.3-10" class="scriptureRef">John 20:3–10</a>.) Peter departed “wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.12" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:12</a>.)</p>

Without wishing to give any offense, I would sincerely like to try and relate this search to everyone, including those Church members and others who consider themselves to be “loving critics” of the Church. I do so, not out of fear that any criticism or opposition might injure the Church, but rather out of a sincere spiritual concern for the critics themselves. Criticism can be helpful if it is properly motivated and if it reaches those who make the decisions, but it is often a symptom of a problem with which the critics themselves are struggling. I believe those who find fault would be surprised at how often the leadership of the Church prays for them. It is in that spirit I would like to speak today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-abundant-life.p2" pid="BoiE8BaQw0GJFc0FfmggCQ" hash="KEEGNQ">President Gordon B. Hinckley reminded us, “As a Church, we encourage gospel scholarship and the search to understand all truth. Fundamental to our theology is belief in individual freedom of inquiry, thought, and expression. Constructive discussion is a privilege of every Latter-day Saint.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Sept. 1985, p. 5.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-abundant-life.p3" pid="1mtBOQAOBEaOWxWUUxL3iQ" hash="BmcdAQ">The Savior said, “I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.10" class="scriptureRef">John 10:10</a>.) How is the abundant life to be obtained? The abundant life involves an endless search for knowledge, light, and truth. President Hugh B. Brown said: “God desires that we learn and continue to learn, but this involves some unlearning. As Uncle Zeke said: ‘It ain’t my ignorance that done me up but what I know’d that wasn’t so.’ The ultimate evil is the closing of the mind or steeling it against truth, resulting in the hardening of intellectual arteries” (in baccalaureate address, Utah State University, Logan, Utah, 4 June 1965.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-abundant-life.p4" pid="NhGv2-1SJkOHg_rOnjioTQ" hash="uBBH2g">We gain knowledge from two sources. One is the divine and the other is secular. Rex E. Lee has referred to them as the “rational process and the extrarational process” (In <span class="emphasis">Brigham Young University 1981–1982 Fireside and Devotional Speeches, Provo: Brigham Young University, 1982, p. 131.) We are all more familiar with the rational process that we learned in school and through lifelong study. The extrarational, or divine source, is less common. This source is, however, more sure. Both sources may be available to us. Fortunately, we do not have to choose one to the exclusion of the other. Brother Lee continues, “We should feel equally at home in the academy and in the temple. We should regard each as a center of learning.” (Speeches,</span> p. 132.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-abundant-life.p5" pid="3GPt_0XbdEGQtrXPVebGgQ" hash="Ov_sLQ">We are apparently part of an expanding universe. Secular knowledge is expanding very rapidly. Our knowledge of gospel truth is also expanding. Prophets continue to speak. Increased understanding of the scriptures is also possible. And so the opportunities for the abundant life increase as we pursue the quest for truth and knowledge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-abundant-life.p6" pid="HpimENzv9UuSsMxrwWDmwQ" hash="sS1N3w">In the infinite process of accepting and rejecting information in the search for light, truth, and knowledge, almost everyone may have at one time or another some private questions. That is part of the learning process. Many are like the biblical father of the child with the “dumb spirit” who pleaded with the Savior: “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/9.24" class="scriptureRef">Mark 9:24</a>.)</p>

But I cannot help wondering if a member of the Church does not place himself in some spiritual peril when publicly disparaging the prophetic calling of Joseph Smith, or his successors, or any of the fundamental, settled doctrines of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-abundant-life.p8" pid="INQ3JsCaM02zsVFSNVcU5Q" hash="IjYoYQ">When a member expresses his private doubts or unbelief as a public chastisement of the leadership or the doctrine of the Church, or as a confrontation with those also seeking eternal light, he has entered upon sacred ground. Those who complain about the doctrine or leadership of the Church but who lack the faith or desire to keep God’s commandments risk separating themselves from the divine source of learning. They do not enjoy the same richness of the Spirit that they might enjoy if they proved their sincere love of God by walking humbly before Him, by keeping His commandments, and by sustaining those He has appointed to lead the Church.</p>

They may also have been lost and forgotten by those who should be more caring.</p>

Members of the Church, like everyone else, are being surfeited with deceptions, challenges, and temptations. However, to those of enduring faith, judgment, and discernment, there is an invisible wall which they choose never to breach. Those on the safe side of this invisible wall are filled with humility, not servitude. They willingly accept the supremacy of God and rely upon the scriptures and counsel of His servants, the leaders of the Church. These leaders of the Church are men with human frailties, and are imperfect in their wisdom and judgment. Perfection in men is not found on the earth. But almost without exception these leaders sincerely, humbly, and prayerfully render great and dedicated Christian service to the best of their ability. More important, they hold a divine warrant and commission through which great and eternal blessings come to those who sustain and follow them. They are God’s servants.</p>

For instance, a critic recently wrote that obedience to commandments such as tithing is mandatory. In order to claim certain blessings, obedience is certainly obligatory, but compliance is never mandatory—that is, forced. Nothing is mandatory in this church. Free agency is a cardinal principle of obedience. Obedience comes from love of God and a commitment to his work. The only punishment for serious transgression or apostasy is the removal of members from the society and fellowship of the Church. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/134.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 134:10</a>.)</p>

Some seem afraid to look to any source of wisdom and knowledge above themselves. They rely only on the secular source of learning.</p>

This may result from a lack of divine knowledge. When I was a boy, one frequently maligned doctrine was the Word of Wisdom. Some took offense when Church leaders taught it. Now scientific proof, unknown in my youth, has established the Word of Wisdom to be a great law of physical health, even though, in my opinion, its greatest benefits are spiritual.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-abundant-life.p19" pid="mXajlD4utU6GB9vA4PU6kw" hash="oitnaA">I have heard some say, “Well, I can believe all of the revelations but one.” It is hard to understand this logic. If one believes that revelations come from a divine source, how can one pick and choose? Acceptance of the gospel should be complete and absolute, with full heart and soul.</p>

The Apostle Paul reminded us that the misuse of the truth changes it into a lie. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/1.18-25" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 1:18–25</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-abundant-life.p21" pid="_Mf2GhtmYk6IhniouhAf2g" hash="J3-Bxg">Since the beginning of the restored Church there have been much opposition and many critics both from within and without. What have been the results of all this opposition and criticism? Some of the spiritually immature, the weak, and incredulous have dropped out. The Church itself, however, not only survives, but it grows and strengthens. In some respects nothing in the world is equal to this work. Despite the many challenges of great growth there are indications of increased faith over much of the earth. For instance, never in the history of the world have so many temples been built.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/the-abundant-life.p22" pid="DZZTH1x_7UeZiKMYSsNzWg" hash="EhjSCQ">I do not believe this work will be stopped or seriously injured by its detractors. There are many prophetic statements to the contrary. History has proven quite conclusively that the Church has grown under persecution; it has prospered under criticism. By finding fault with the doctrines, practices, or the leadership of the Church, one can waste much time and effort in a fruitless endeavor. Those who have been washed in the waters of baptism put their eternal soul at risk by carelessly pursuing only the secular source of learning. We believe that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has the fulness of the gospel of Christ, which gospel is the essence of truth and eternal enlightenment. We hold that the great legacy of this church is that it possesses the only full means for eternal life.</p>

It is well established by revelation and practice that the current President of the Church and his counselors have the keys to declare the doctrine of the Church. The investiture of this authority comes from revelation. The Presidency are constituted “a quorum … to receive the oracles for the whole church.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.126" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:126</a>.) Of this authority, President Stephen L Richards stated: “They [the Presidency] are the supreme court here on earth in the interpretation of God’s law.</p>

The written part consists in authenticated scripture, ancient and modern, and in the recorded utterances of our latter-day prophets.

When, therefore, a judgment is reached and proclaimed by these officers, it becomes binding upon all members of the Church, individual views to the contrary notwithstanding. God’s Kingdom is a kingdom of law and order.” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1938, pp. 115–16.)</p>

That is not what we want. We hope that their sincerity would be manifested rather by building upon those feelings that have kept them in the Church. Their faith can be strengthened by following their intuitive judgment and the purest and noblest feelings of their own souls. By looking to a source higher than themselves, they can receive answers to their questions from the divine source. If there have been some mistakes, there is a way back. The doors are wide open; welcoming arms are outstretched. There is a place for all; there is a contribution for each to make.</p>

I testify that the Church is worthy of our full trust. There is no inconsistency between truth and faith. I know that everyone who sincerely and righteously seeks to know this can have it spiritually confirmed. May we open up our minds, hearts, and spirits to the divine source of truth. May we reach above ourselves and beyond our mundane concerns and become heirs to the knowledge of all truth and to the abundant life promised by our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I pray that this may be so, in His holy name, amen.</p>

This is important to our happiness. Let us examine ourselves and, like pilots in the sky, take our bearings to see if we are on course financially. We must build upon sound principles. The bedrock principle of which I speak is that the responsibility for welfare rests with me and my family. In 1936 the First Presidency said in a great statement of purpose, “The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves.” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 3.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p2" pid="ZVGeQCYJ_k-8HbmEO6e0Iw" hash="Yu4YvQ">Some of us are children of the Great Depression in the United States over fifty years ago. Most of us who passed through that period will never forget the difficult economic times almost everyone experienced. At that time many banks failed; people lost their life’s savings; a great many were unemployed, and some of them lost their homes because they could not pay the mortgage. Many went hungry. If we didn’t eat our oatmeal cereal for breakfast, we would often have it fried for lunch or dinner. Such widespread economic problems could come again. But any of us, at any time, could meet with a personal calamity, such as sickness or an accident, which could limit or destroy our income.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p3" pid="azgPM3_vJEaW6mnGYpA-7g" hash="hoMCWA">The purpose of the welfare program is to care for the poor and the needy and make the members of the Church, by their obedience to gospel principles, strong and self-reliant. At the center of caring for the poor and the needy in a worldwide church is a generous contribution to the fast offerings, and personal and family preparedness. At the very heart of taking care of our own needs is our own energy and ability, with help to and from our own families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p4" pid="CtTa9kQZn0KmvDxo9mOfCw" hash="MogDYQ">I should like to discuss five prescriptions which, if followed, will make each of us better able to control our destinies.</p>

        <span class="strong">First prescription: Practice thrift and frugality. </span>There is a wise old saying: “Eat it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.” Thrift is a practice of not wasting anything. Some people are able to get by because of the absence of expense. They have their shoes resoled, they patch, they mend, they sew, and they save money. They avoid installment buying, and make purchases only after saving enough to pay cash, thus avoiding interest charges. <span class="emphasis">Frugality</span> means to practice careful economy. (See <span class="emphasis">Webster’s New World Dictionary,</span> 2d. college edition.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p6" pid="-gUxjcGNs0Wx93Q_dYgS-w" hash="8wtwBg">The old couplet “Waste not, want not” still has much merit. Frugality requires that we live within our income and save a little for a rainy day, which always seems to come. It means avoiding debt and carefully limiting credit purchasing. It is important to learn to distinguish between wants and needs. It takes self-discipline to avoid the “buy now, pay later” philosophy and to adopt the “save now and buy later” practice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p7" pid="VfB547GSj0ejjF43qEfDVA" hash="Vyw4mQ">There are some investment counselors who urge speculative credit practices described as “leverage,” “credit wealth,” and “borrow yourself rich.” Such practices may work successfully for some, but at best they succeed only for a time. An economic reversal always seems to come, and many who have followed such practices find themselves in financial ruin and their lives in shambles.</p>

What troubles they invite if their income should be suddenly cut off or seriously reduced! We all know of families who have obligated themselves for more than they could pay.” (<span class="emphasis">Pay Thy Debt, and Live,</span> Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year, Provo: 28 Feb. 1963, p. 10.)</p>

A mortgage on a home leaves a family unprotected against severe financial storms. Homes that are free and clear of mortgages and liens cannot be foreclosed on. When there are good financial times, it is the most opportune time to retire our debts and pay installments in advance. It is a truth that “the borrower is servant to the lender.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/22.7" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 22:7</a>.)</p>

They immediately want things it took their parents years to acquire. It is not the pathway to happiness to assume debts for a big home, an expensive car, or the most stylish clothes just so we can “keep up with the Joneses.” Payment of obligations is a sacred trust. Most of us will never be rich, but we can feel greatly unburdened when we are debt-free.</p>

        <span class="strong">Second prescription: Seek to be independent. </span>The Lord said that it is important for the Church to “stand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:14</a>.) Members of the Church are also counseled to be independent. Independence means many things. It means being free of drugs that addict, habits that bind, and diseases that curse. It also means being free of personal debt and of the interest and carrying charges required by debt the world over.</p>

Once in debt, interest is your companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip away from it; you cannot dismiss it; it yields neither to entreaties, demands, or orders; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course or fail to meet its demands, it crushes you.” (in Conference Report, Apr., 1938, p. 103.)</p>

It includes family solidarity and spiritual increase.” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1979, p. 119; or <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1979, p. 81.) It is my firm belief, after many years of close observation, that those who honestly pay their tithes and offerings do prosper and get along better in almost every way. It is my testimony that in discharging this debt to the Lord, one enjoys great personal satisfaction. Unfortunately this great satisfaction will be known only by those who have the faith and strength to keep this commandment.</p>

        <span class="strong">Third prescription: Be industrious. </span>To be industrious involves energetically managing our circumstances to our advantage. It also means to be enterprising and to take advantage of opportunities. Industry requires resourcefulness. A good idea can be worth years of struggle.</p>

The impoverished man replied, “There was so little snow in the mountains, I thought there would be a drought, so I did not plant.” As it turned out, unforeseen spring rains made the crops bountiful for those industrious enough to plant. It is a denial of the divinity within us to doubt our potential and our possibilities.</p>

        <span class="strong">Fourth prescription: Become self-reliant. </span>I have always admired those who have the ability and skills to make things with their hands. When those skills were passed out in the previous world, I must have been out to lunch. The ability to make repairs around the home, to improvise, to take care of our own machinery, to keep our automobiles running, is not only an economic advantage, but it also provides much emotional resilience.</p>

Kimball counseled: “I hope that we understand that, while having a garden, for instance, is often useful in reducing food costs and making available delicious fresh fruits and vegetables, it does much more than this. Who can gauge the value of that special chat between daughter and Dad as they weed or water the garden? How do we evaluate the good that comes from the obvious lessons of planting, cultivating, and the eternal law of the harvest? And how do we measure the family togetherness and cooperating that must accompany successful canning? Yes, we are laying up resources in store, but perhaps the greater good is contained in the lessons of life we learn as we live providently and extend to our children their pioneer heritage.” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1977, p. 125; or <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1977, p. 78.) This heritage includes teaching our children how to work.</p>

        <span class="strong">Fifth prescription: Strive to have a year’s supply of food and clothing. </span>The counsel to have a year’s supply of basic food, clothing, and commodities was given fifty years ago and has been repeated many times since. Every father and mother are the family’s storekeepers. They should store whatever their own family would like to have in the case of an emergency. Most of us cannot afford to store a year’s supply of luxury items, but find it more practical to store staples that might keep us from starving in case of emergency. Surely we all hope that the hour of need will never come. Some have said, “We have followed this counsel in the past and have never had need to use our year’s supply, so we have difficulty keeping this in mind as a major priority.” Perhaps following this counsel could be the reason why they have not needed to use their reserve. By continued rotation of the supply it can be kept usable with no waste.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p24" pid="ItbaOw87d0y4IDfOvnVrTw" hash="9orknw">The Church cannot be expected to provide for every one of its millions of members in case of public or personal disaster. It is therefore necessary that each home and family do what they can to assume the responsibility for their own hour of need. If we do not have the resources to acquire a year’s supply, then we can strive to begin with having one month’s supply. I believe if we are provident and wise in the management of our personal and family affairs and are faithful, God will sustain us through our trials. He has revealed: “For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.17" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 104:17</a>.)</p>

Good King Benjamin, speaking through the pages of the Book of Mormon, counsels, “I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.26" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:26</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-responsibility-for-welfare-rests-with-me-and-my-family.p26" pid="6jdcRje0nkWZdT33nnTMXg" hash="CcOQ1g">You may ask, “How can I discern which of the prophetic utterances of this conference have a particular message for me?” My answer is, you can know. You can know by the whisperings of the Holy Spirit if you righteously and earnestly seek to know. Your own inspiration will be an unerring vibration through the companionship of the Holy Ghost. As the Lord spoke to Elijah, this will come, not in the great strong wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, but in a still, small voice. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.11-12" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 19:11–12</a>.) This will help us, if necessary, to make the required change in our lives and life-styles to get onto a sure course.</p>

Each of us has a lamp to light the way, but it requires that every one of us put the oil in our own lamps to produce that light. It is not enough to sit idly by and say, “The Lord will provide.” He has promised that they who are wise and “have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide” will have the earth given unto them. (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.57-58" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:57–58</a>.) It is further promised that “the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.59" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:59</a>.) May it ever be so I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We have just heard the prophet of God. He is a watchman on the tower. He has raised a warning voice. I would urge all to listen and follow his counsel. It is tremendously important always to be in harmony with those who, according to Paul, have “watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/13.17" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 13:17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p2" pid="Amcb16Og50y__BAGzDfVFQ" hash="Svrg5g">Isaiah spoke of a people who did not care to listen to their prophets and seers, who were urged, “Say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/30.10" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 30:10</a>). Nephi explained, “The guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.2" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 16:2</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p3" pid="_pZQd_7ZRUKXs25Z53-HFQ" hash="SfD04A">President Spencer W. Kimball spoke of the duty of prophets. He said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p4" pid="K6jSVkAll06grQlfE25yfQ" hash="WAhvgw">“I am sure that Peter and James and Paul found it unpleasant business to constantly be calling people to repentance and warning them of dangers, but they continued unflinchingly. So we, your leaders, must be everlastingly at it; if young people do not understand, then the fault may be partly ours. But, if we make the true way clear to you, then we are blameless” (“Love Versus Lust,” Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year, Provo, Utah, 5 Jan. 1965, p. 6). I wish to speak today of unwanted messages. My purpose in doing so is to attempt to give strength against mistakes, suffering, heartache, and anguish.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p5" pid="O7lG8DCaIEiLXB7d9Ku2Dw" hash="opNiAg">May I begin by sharing with you a personal experience from a time many years ago when I received an unwelcome but valuable message from my devoted father. After World War II was over, I was married and wanted to get on with my life. My memorable mission was finished before my military service. I was not anxious to become a student again and go back to the university where I had started some eight years before. My intended course would require another three years of intensive study, discipline, and poverty. With all of this in mind I said to my father, “I don’t think I will go back to school. I’ll just get a job or start a business and go forward in my life.” Now, my father had completed law school after World War I as an older student with a wife and three children. His response was typically direct. He said bluntly, “What can you do?” His answer was so brutally honest that it hurt, but I could not ignore it. I went back to the university and completed the course. This frank but well-intentioned message changed my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p6" pid="31Qg4FpjlEiKJUeAeP04uQ" hash="75kAow">In the time of Jesus, a certain ruler asked the Savior a very significant question and received a hard answer which he did not want to hear. With the hard answer came a great promise. The meaningful question the rich man asked was: “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p7" pid="uu-_1HYCc0KWVsPE0hboAA" hash="fMSvzg">Jesus answered, “Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother,”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p8" pid="n5ajPpSM8UeH7F4yCR_baw" hash="Ry9nbg">And the ruler answered, “All these have I kept from my youth up.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p9" pid="K30P-3jKcEiwWRqJ_qorQQ" hash="GnLrJA">The unwelcome answer then came from the Master: “Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p10" pid="SGpwOKJRTU-_r8sTjxbZ9A" hash="tClfxw">When the ruler heard this, “he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p11" pid="CwjyG3mq3kCI0lJNZRVn1w" hash="i7oiPg">“And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/18.18,20-24" class="scriptureRef">Luke 18:18, 20–24</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p12" pid="Y31jvU-K_02NF95RJ5pXkQ" hash="MKxmdQ">How people handle their earthly riches is among the great tests they have in life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p13" pid="SEq99J0UyEqMghVfWYIEUA" hash="McdQ3g">This same Jesus of Nazareth spoke much novel doctrine which seemed hard to accept. Some said, “What new doctrine is this?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/1.27" class="scriptureRef">Mark 1:27</a>). Jesus did not speak of revenge nor of getting even. He spoke of loving our enemies and doing good to them that hate us, of blessing those that curse us, and of praying for those which despitefully use us (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.27-28" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:27–28</a>). He counseled his followers, when smitten on one cheek, to “offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid [him] not to take thy coat also” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.29" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:29</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p14" pid="301O7b7NbEeQbBPN-rEXDA" hash="axiVjw">Another interesting new doctrine was to go beyond loving only our own and being good just to our friends. Another strange idea Jesus taught was to lend goods and money, hoping for nothing in return. The Master counseled us to be merciful, to judge not and condemn not, and to be kind to the unthankful and to the evil (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.34-37" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:34–37</a>). He also spoke of being careful “when all men shall speak well of you” because all men spoke well of the false prophets (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.26" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p15" pid="mHtr3xyTTk-0qMdhUCQ2CA" hash="45bNQA">The promise for those who can do this is great: “Ye shall be the children of the Highest” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.35" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:35</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p16" pid="O7qejhCrPkSJ5Odk47Ijrg" hash="CLtZhQ">May I mention two or three other messages which seem no longer popular? One is to respect the Sabbath day. While the Savior himself cautioned against extreme forms of Sabbath day observance, it is well to remember whose day the Sabbath is. There seems to be an ever-increasing popularity in disregarding the centuries-old commandment to observe and respect the Sabbath day. For many it has become a holiday rather than a holy day of rest and sanctification. For some it is a day to shop and buy groceries. The decision of those who engage in shopping, sports, work, and recreation on the Sabbath day is their own, for which they alone bear responsibility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p17" pid="nRW0Rcw0DE6gCTWNzikgQQ" hash="1WtgVA">The Lord’s commandment about the Sabbath day has not been altered, nor has the Church’s affirmation of the commandment to observe the Sabbath day. Those who violate this commandment in the exercise of their agency are answerable for losing the blessings which observance of this commandment would bring. The Lord has spoken in our day concerning the Sabbath day. We are to keep ourselves “unspotted from the world” and “go to the house of prayer.” We are to rest from our labors and pay our “devotions unto the Most High” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9-10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:9–10</a>). The Doctrine and Covenants reminds us: “And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy may be full” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:13</a>). The blessings for those who do righteousness are supernal. They shall enjoy “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:23</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p18" pid="WxooF03kuUyF8VyPyluHSQ" hash="9_ymbw">Another transcendent but often unheeded message which peals down from Sinai is “Honour thy father and thy mother” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.12" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:12</a>). I have frequently walked by a rest home that provides excellent care. But it is heartrending to see so many parents and grandparents in that good care facility so forgotten, so bereft of dignity, so starved for love. To honor parents certainly means to take care of physical needs. But it means much, much more. It means to show love, kindness, thoughtfulness, and concern for them all of the days of their lives. It means to help them preserve their dignity and self-respect in their declining years. It means to honor their wishes and desires and their teachings both before and after they are dead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p19" pid="wndcbPLrZUmkxBsd0xXPrQ" hash="oqrqWw">Some years ago I created a stake on one of the islands in Japan. As usual, we held many interviews with the leaders to become acquainted with them. One of the men had moved to that area from Tokyo to take care of his aged and ailing father and his father’s business, which was in difficulty because of the father’s ill health. After the father died, the son went to his father’s creditors and acknowledged his father’s debts. He requested time from those creditors so that he could assume and pay all of his father’s outstanding obligations. In our interview I asked him how he was managing to meet this responsibility. He answered that he was getting along quite well and that he would be able to handle his father’s debts. The Lord saw fit to honor him with a call to be one of the leaders of that stake.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p20" pid="ZIyRJT8zC0mXTkHq0FGj4g" hash="h_HMZw">Besides being one of God’s commandments, the kind, thoughtful consideration of parents is a matter of common decency and self-respect. On their part, parents need to live so as to be worthy of the respect of their children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p21" pid="x7iQsnjR3U-2HxAHeIiNbw" hash="GoD21g">I cannot help wondering about parents who adopt the attitude with their children, “do as I say, not as I do” with respect to using harmful substances, going to inappropriate movies, and other questionable activities. Children often take license from their parents’ behavior and go beyond the values the parents wish to establish. There is one safe parental rule: do not just avoid evil, avoid the very appearance of evil (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Thes. 5:22</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p22" pid="66azxUd_QU-id79ikviW8A" hash="Mnm3Mg">I should like to speak of one more strong message. It is frequently astounding to see the dereliction of people in keeping the standards of ordinary fairness and justice. This delinquency manifests itself in so many ways. It is sometimes evident in commercial transactions, as well as in private contacts. Injustice to others is manifest even in the way automobiles are sometimes driven. This unfairness and injustice results principally from one person seeking an advantage or an edge over another. Those who follow such a practice demean themselves greatly. How can those of us who do not practice ordinary fairness and justice have serious claim on the blessings of a just and a fair God?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p23" pid="_UKWcR-Wi0mgddT2GkAlRw" hash="1y2y6g">Do some of us seek to justify our taking of shortcuts and advantage of others by indulging in the twin sophistries, “There isn’t any justice” and “Everybody does it”? There are many others who seemingly prosper by violating the rules of God and the standards of decency and fair play. They appear to escape the imminent law of the harvest, which states, “Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/6.7" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 6:7</a>). Worrying about the punishment we think ought to come to others is self-defeating to us. Brigham Young counseled that unless we ourselves are prepared for the day of the Lord’s vengeance when the wicked will be consumed, we should not be too anxious for the Lord to hasten his work. Said he rather, “Let our anxiety be centered upon this one thing, the sanctification of our own hearts, the purifying of our own affections” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 9:3).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p24" pid="_oj-A1lgyUmVFIWPfCOQpQ" hash="XwIXJg">Many modern professors of human behavior advocate as a cure to an afflicted conscience that we simply ignore the unwanted messages. They suggest that we change the standard to fit the circumstances so that there is no longer a conflict, thus easing the conscience. The followers of the divine Christ cannot subscribe to this evil and perverse philosophy with impunity. For the troubled conscience in conflict with right and wrong, the only permanent help is to change the behavior and follow a repentant path.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p25" pid="TzjkYRGxvkeF_NI096A0Yg" hash="BGzzZQ">The prophet Isaiah taught, “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/5.20" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 5:20</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p26" pid="KiQs--fI1UuPkGMnDA3_ow" hash="Nn66Zw">During all of my ministry, I have been fascinated by the manner in which Jesus hardened the bone and spirit of his chief Apostle, Peter. When Jesus told Peter that he had prayed that Peter’s faith would strengthen, Peter affirmed that he would go with the Savior to prison or to death. Peter was then told that the “cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.34" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:34</a>). After the predicted three denials, the powerful, unwelcome, but steel-hardening message came: Peter heard the cock crow. And he “went out, and wept bitterly” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.75" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:75</a>), but this strengthened Peter to fulfill his calling and to die for the cause.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p27" pid="Rk2tdLid_UGrqWE3-L5rKg" hash="rAR0uw">There is one unerring voice that is ever true. It can always be relied upon. It should be listened to, although at times this voice too may speak unwelcome warning messages. I speak of the still, small, inner voice which comes from the divine source. As the prophet Elijah learned, “the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p28" pid="opFLu5dgLEye18VhdzsoQQ" hash="oRi17w">“And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.11-12" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 19:11–12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p29" pid="S37IBlp_lU6NERlUUkXSIg" hash="jkd11Q">One single unwanted message may be a call to change our lives; it may lead to the specially tailored opportunity we need. I am grateful that it is never too late to change, to make things right, to leave old activities and habits behind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/10/unwanted-messages.p30" pid="tplgXoBL7U6JjB8nPIn8Vw" hash="eJ0vLg">I wish to testify that the prophetic messages of this conference will lead any who will listen—and follow the counsel given—to the promise of the Savior, which is peace in this life and eternal life in the world hereafter. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p2" pid="NJ2aKkfWyEm3rsG1fePFXQ" hash="pm3iFg">Recently I saw on the wall of a stake president’s office in Brisbane, Australia, a picture of a sad-faced little girl. Above the picture was written “Will I Be Happy?” I suppose everyone in the world could ask that question: “Will I be happy?” The Savior himself prayed that all of his disciples “might have … joy fulfilled in themselves” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.13" class="scriptureRef">John 17:13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p3" pid="eLcRhNR8GUK2_E0b0KA0nA" hash="W-L1gA">I wish to speak of a hope that children will know a future filled with some happiness and peace. No gift bestowed upon us is so precious as children. They are proof that God still loves us. They are the hope of the future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p4" pid="eQVty_u1UUmKLClWMjWHeA" hash="2zd6rg">In today’s world, I cannot help wondering, Who will love them enough to help them be happy? Who will love them enough to teach them faith and moral values? They must learn so much more than survival and self-gratification. There is such a great need for the teaching of the heart and not enough of the civilizing part of education. Where will children learn virtue? Who will care for them enough to mold their moral character? How can they become humane, kind, and happy and make life richer for themselves and others?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p5" pid="2-qC9OqNFkytoeTg87ZA4A" hash="imB1fg">This teaching of the next generation is not easy in a society where many fundamental beliefs are disappearing. Deadly mass marketing challenges almost every cherished human value. Excessive permissiveness under the banner of individual freedom is one driving force behind this. Reaching a public consensus on what values should be taught to the next generation is almost impossible. People strongly disagree about almost everything. Social restraints are weakened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p6" pid="zus_WAZMfkCs27D7RrYjyg" hash="F8wcFw">This means we will have to teach our children a life-style of our own and provide moral anchors in the sea of self-indulgence, self-interest, and self-service in which they float.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p7" pid="AJyaf7IsEkWMSR1asUlgfA" hash="O9EUuw">How can this tide of wrong values be reversed? Can anything be done to combat these challenges? May I suggest three ways to increase the hope that the next generation will grow up with a greater chance to find some continued happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p8" pid="qyhX-DUQUU6hs8lqKuCK0g" hash="GGGyDg">First, adults need to understand, and our children should be taught, that private choices are not private; they all have public consequences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p9" pid="ldcK3V4080CUpO15wAy3XQ" hash="Q4LPAA">There is a popular notion that doing our own thing or doing what feels good is our own business and affects no one but us. The deadly scourges that are epidemic all over the world have flourished in the context of this popular notion. But this is simply not true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p10" pid="WHv6oRd1hkS8j63Vkmp_cQ" hash="342pUg">All immoral behavior directly impacts society. Even innocent people are affected. Drug and alcohol abuse have public consequences, as do illegitimacy, pornography, and obscenity. The public cost in human life and tax dollars for these so-called private choices is enormous: poverty, crime, a less-educated work force, and mounting demands for government spending to fix problems that cannot be fixed by money. It simply is not true that our private conduct is our own business. Our society is the sum total of what millions of individuals do in their private lives. That sum total of private behavior has worldwide public consequences of enormous magnitude. There are no completely private choices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p11" pid="0-ZA9fyRZ0yNWWJ5lwt10A" hash="I_LkAw">Second, adults and children need to know that public and private morality is not outmoded. We need to love our children enough to teach them that laws, policies, and public programs with a moral and ethical basis are necessary for the preservation of a peaceful, productive, compassionate, and happy society. Without the qualities and characteristics of integrity, honesty, commitment, loyalty, respect for others, fidelity, and virtue, a free and open society cannot endure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p12" pid="klkEn4f6NEeSGPWgkpQGBQ" hash="8koSsg">Elder Dallin H. Oaks recently responded to those who say, “Don’t legislate morality.” Said Elder Oaks: “I suppose persons who mouth that familiar slogan think they are saying something profound. In fact, if that is an argument at all, it is so superficial that an educated person should be ashamed to use it. As should be evident to every thinking person, a high proportion of all legislation has a moral base. That is true of the criminal law, most of the laws regulating family relations, businesses, and commercial transactions, many of the laws governing property, and a host of others” (“Gambling—Morally Wrong and Politically Unwise,” transcript of an address given at Ricks College, 6 Jan. 1987, p. 20).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p13" pid="9PygesIXpUaag8e5LBONFw" hash="n0MpPg">Until recently, ethics and moral philosophy were the foundation of higher education. They were a legacy passed from generation to generation. Those values are as relevant today as when they were taught by Aristotle. Said he, “Man perfected by society is the best of all animals; he is the most terrible of all when he lives without law, and without justice” (<span class="emphasis">Politics,</span> 1.1253a, 31–34). Therefore, public and private morality need much greater emphasis everywhere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p14" pid="Bn0ofRyvUUWF9M5wBj2TKw" hash="yppjtw">The third, and most important, way to prepare our children for some lasting happiness is to fortify the family. For centuries the family was the bedrock of this and many other nations. It was the glue that held society together. Now many families are in trouble, and the glue is coming unstuck. As a result, many children are bewildered: they are growing physically but lack the support system, the disciplined moral framework, and the love and understanding that a strong family can provide.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p15" pid="URFoWDBBG0e3YKY7N0zT2w" hash="lKdsUw">It is in a home and with a family that values are usually acquired, traditions are fostered, and commitments to others are established. There are really no adequate substitutes. Church, school, and government programs can only reinforce and supplement that which is acquired at home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p16" pid="RAdcrFUMeUWdhPwWC3IAFA" hash="oYI6eA">To strengthen the family, the morals of human sexuality need to be restored. Bryce Christensen recently wrote, “Children who have watched parents treat one another with affection and courtesy already understand more about the relationship between the sexes than they will ever learn from any class in reproductive physiology” (<span class="emphasis">The Family in America,</span> Mar. 1987, 1:3).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p17" pid="No-E2vBhy0CODvnxjmwhzQ" hash="IMv08A">By the word of the Lord, all men and women are to practice chastity before marriage and fidelity after marriage. “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” said the Lord (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.14" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:14</a>), “nor do anything like unto it” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:6</a>). The Apostle Paul was more explicit in his epistle to the Corinthians (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/6.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 6:9</a>), as was Alma in the Book of Mormon (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.1-13" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:1–13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p18" pid="gZK8Yb-lBE64Hc5yeGwY3A" hash="oymWmg">Alternatives to the legal and loving marriage between a man and a woman are helping to unravel the fabric of human society. That fabric, of course, is the family. These so-called alternative life-styles cannot be accepted as right because they frustrate God’s commandment for a life-giving union of male and female within a legal marriage (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.28" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:28</a>). If practiced by all adults, these life-styles would mean the end of family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p19" pid="kQgligd0tUm9zTHwCuzQ4Q" hash="YR8VEQ">The scriptures clearly and consistently condemn all sex relations outside of legal marriage as morally wrong. Why is this so? It is so because God said so. It is so because we are made in the image of God, male and female (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.27" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:27</a>). We are his spirit children (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:24</a>). We were with him in the beginning (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:23</a>). Bringing to pass our exaltation is his work and glory (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>). We are directed to be the children of light (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/106.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 106:5</a>). We are heirs to eternal life. The Spirit gives light to every man and woman who comes into the world (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:46</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p20" pid="wTQZg5SMekqtp0WdHBUugw" hash="MWYyFQ">What values can be taught most effectively in the home? By commandment, parents in this church are to teach their children faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:25</a>). At home, in the warm security of discipline and love, we learn the values that never change. We learn the differences between right and wrong, as well as self-discipline, self-mastery, personal responsibility, all of the essentials of good character, concern for others, and civil manners.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p21" pid="Vi7tHVfa1U2uCh20Z9NXrA" hash="sjnnMw">Values, public as well as private, cannot last very long without being regenerated and sustained by religious belief; they are a matter of continued renewal. An awakening of faith and belief in religious values is essential. Family teachings are encouraged by the Church, and the Church, in turn, through its covenants and ordinances, unifies the eternal family. Our temples are testaments of our faith in the everlasting family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p22" pid="6mMKg5PY70yal4sykhAGWw" hash="y5eX4w">Some say families can’t do the job because so many people just do not have families. It is true that a great many do not have a functioning family. Or it is said that too many families fail. Unfortunately, that is also true. However, with all its shortcomings, the family is far and away the greatest social unit, the best answer to human problems, in the history of mankind. Rather than further weaken family ties, they need to be strengthened. To aid parents, the Church has available a thoughtful booklet, <span class="emphasis">A Parent’s Guide</span> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1985). I would urge overburdened parents to accept every help. Cannot grandparents, brothers and sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends also reinforce by example and precept their love and concern for members of the extended family?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p23" pid="NMo43O2hIUSEDfZZ5_JAMg" hash="qCE5lw">My Aunt Angie has hand made 175 quilts for her children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and others. They are works of art; but more important, each is a labor of love. She can say to a member of her extended family, as she presents a specially made quilt, “Except when I pricked my finger, with every stitch I thought of my love for you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p24" pid="3VvnUAMlO0qC5CC8AOhuAg" hash="yW0EhA">Good family life seems to have little to do with whether we are in affluent or humble circumstances. All over the world the poor have good, resilient families. They do their best to raise their children and be good neighbors; they are “money-poor” but “value-wealthy.” Family problems seem to fall on both the wealthy and the impoverished.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p25" pid="LR0603AQL0SwITHXYBFE-A" hash="tku1OQ">The White House Conference on Families reports that “Good families, rich or poor or in between, provide encouragement and support to their children, but no excuses. They teach character. They insist upon standards. They demand respect. They require performance” (<span class="emphasis">The White House Report on the Family,</span> Nov. 1986, p. 32).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p26" pid="dRm-8ZGlZ0qJPu10UNU2Rg" hash="-OK-RA">The <span class="emphasis">White House Report on the Family</span> continues:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p27" pid="aFaTbVf_iES8XJBOvgqySQ" hash="62hSRw">“For most … life is not a matter of legislative battles, judicial decrees and executive decisions. It is a fabric of helping hands and good neighbors; bedtime stories and shared prayers; loving-packed lunchboxes and household budget balancing; tears wiped away and a precious heritage passed along; it is hard work and a little put away for the future. In a healthy society, heroes are the men, women, children who hold the world together one home at a time; the parents and grandparents who forgo pleasures, delay purchases, foreclose options, and commit most of their lives to the noblest undertaking of citizenship; raising children who, resting on the shoulders of the previous generation, will see farther than we and reach higher” (pp. 8–9).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p28" pid="ABczIxOadUmL412lM324bw" hash="0dEujg">Troubled as many homes may be in our society, we cannot abandon the home as the primary teacher of moral values. Nowhere else will moral values be taught so effectively. As Brigham Young counseled, we must teach children “by faith rather than by the rod, leading them kindly by good example into all truth and holiness” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 12:174).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p29" pid="9zknvWCob0mr4qjRU7O7wg" hash="srs7JQ">There is a deep private and public need to retrieve for the children the comfort of belief and of belonging. The products of wealth, technology, and science all fail to satisfy inner spiritual hungering.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p30" pid="R3o2nxZYpUidYt6wdxFH3Q" hash="loiyhA">Without turning back to the word of our Creator, no one is wise enough to sort out what ethical, spiritual, and moral values should be taught to the next generation, and to their children, and to their children’s children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p31" pid="6yDyk7xJEEOzOI6qVe6SJQ" hash="RuPZ3A">There is reason for hope. More people seem to recognize that public solutions are not as effective as family solutions. Some authority seems to be returning to the head of the home. But, most important, I see many adults, mostly parents and grandparents, who are “crazy about kids.” If in the process we can bring back into our lives and into our homes sacred spiritual and moral truths, we will reclaim a sacred and precious part of our heritage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/will-i-be-happy.p32" pid="RvGWaQ_cGEKFQJKNT4Lq8A" hash="MkfYbw">Someone must love the children enough to do this. Then, if it is done everywhere, to the boys and girls who ask “Will I be happy?” we can answer: “Of course! You are going to be happy, and even more. If you keep the covenants and commandments of God, you will have the joy promised by the Savior when he walked upon the earth. You will have ‘peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come’ (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:23</a>),” which is the ultimate message of this church to the world. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

One of the more impudent boys replied, “We came to see you perform a miracle.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p2" pid="KryfPKvpXUmFf2VL7Ou1kg" hash="mI4nPA">The teacher walked slowly over to the boy and menacingly responded, “We don’t perform miracles here, but we do cast out devils!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p3" pid="H4PVXEhf_0amZ3C35qaPLw" hash="9DP-bA">For some reason I feel impressed to speak today against the devil and his angels—the source and mainspring of all evil. I do so prayerfully, because Satan is not an enlightening subject. I consider him to be the great imitator.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p4" pid="Gl0SRaiosUirqKKajP_dkg" hash="JKHp-g">I think we will witness increasing evidence of Satan’s power as the kingdom of God grows stronger. I believe Satan’s ever-expanding efforts are some proof of the truthfulness of this work. In the future the opposition will be both more subtle and more open. It will be masked in greater sophistication and cunning, but it will also be more blatant. We will need greater spirituality to perceive all of the forms of evil and greater strength to resist it. But the disappointments and setbacks to the work of God will be temporary, for the work will go forward (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 65:2</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p5" pid="yT09kz-9BkyJT6O7m3LOLA" hash="JmG3Rg">It is not good practice to become intrigued by Satan and his mysteries. No good can come from getting close to evil. Like playing with fire, it is too easy to get burned: “The knowledge of sin tempteth to its commission” (Joseph F. Smith, <span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 373). The only safe course is to keep well distanced from him and any of his wicked activities or nefarious practices. The mischief of devil worship, sorcery, casting spells, witchcraft, voodooism, black magic, and all other forms of demonism should be avoided like the plague.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p6" pid="4ltw-5Y8nk-Kq3rjhcgk7w" hash="_nVJBA">However, Brigham Young said that it is important to “study … evil, and its consequences” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Brigham Young,</span> comp. John A. Widtsoe, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1941, pp. 256–57). Since Satan is the author of all evil in the world, it would therefore be essential to realize that he is the influence behind the opposition to the work of God. Alma stated the issue succinctly: “For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.40" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:40</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p7" pid="yQ1YvOF7h0e0BMgqEW_FHw" hash="6YRT8Q">My principal reason for choosing this subject is to help young people by warning them, as Paul said, “lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/2.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 2:11</a>). We hope that young people, unfamiliar with the sophistries of the world, can keep themselves free of Satan’s enticements and deceitful ways. I personally claim no special insight into Satan’s methods, but I have at times been able to identify his influence and his actions in my life and in the lives of others. When I was on my first mission, Satan sought to divert me from my future path and, if possible, to destroy my usefulness in the Lord’s work. That was almost fifty years ago, and I still remember how reasonable his entreaties seemed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p8" pid="1y9RPU4A50GdULHzI_gw6w" hash="dEdB9g">Who has not heard and felt the enticings of the devil? His voice often sounds so reasonable and his message so easy to justify. It is an enticing, intriguing voice with dulcet tones. It is neither hard nor discordant. No one would listen to Satan’s voice if it sounded harsh or mean. If the devil’s voice were unpleasant, it would not entice people to listen to it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p9" pid="lAcYR9AZpkKY16SUpa7Wsw" hash="wz9gmw">Shakespeare wrote, “The prince of darkness is a gentleman” (<span class="emphasis">King Lear,</span> act 3, sc. 4, line 143), and “the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose” (<span class="emphasis">The Merchant of Venice,</span> act 1, sc. 3, line 95). As the great deceiver, Lucifer has marvelous powers of deception. As Paul said to the Corinthians, “And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/11.14" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 11:14</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p10" pid="OeWOjOm6lkWRlYahnhbPsg" hash="i6Yt8g">Some of Satan’s most appealing lines are “Everyone does it”; “If it doesn’t hurt anybody else, it’s all right”; “If you feel all right about it, it’s OK”; or “It’s the ‘in’ thing to do.” These subtle entreaties make Satan the great imitator, the master deceiver, the arch counterfeiter, and the great forger.</p>

It is the still, small voice which is within us. But once we have succumbed, the braking system begins to leak brake fluid and our stopping mechanism becomes weak and ineffective.</p>

His influence is everywhere: “And the Lord said unto Satan, From whence comest thou?

Initially, he was not the perpetrator of evil. He was with the hosts of heaven in the beginning. He was “an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:25</a>). He came before Christ and proposed to God the Father, “Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:1</a>). This he proposed to do by force, destroying the free agency of man. Does his statement “Give me thine honor” mean that he wanted to mount an insurrection to supplant even God the Father?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p19" pid="D1XJw0UHOEenDkKXO0-Evw" hash="RqTX1Q">Satan became the devil by seeking glory, power, and dominion by force (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.3-4" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:3–4</a>). But Jesus, chosen “from the beginning” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:2</a>), said unto God, “Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:2</a>). What a contrast in approaches! Wrong as his plan was, Satan was persuasive enough to entice one-third of the hosts of heaven to follow him (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 29:36</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/12.4" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 12:4</a>).

And so this personage who was an angel of God and in authority, even in the presence of God, was removed from the presence of God and his Son (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:25</a>). This caused great sadness in the heavens, “for the heavens wept over him—he was Lucifer, a son of the morning” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:26</a>). Does this not place some responsibility on the followers of Christ to show concern for loved ones who have lost their way and “are shut out from the presence of God” (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.49" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:49</a>)? I know of no better help than to show unconditional love and help lost souls seek another path.</p>

However, Peter warns, “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/5.8" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 5:8</a>).</p>

In this manner, our good motives become so misdirected that we lose friends and, even more serious, we come under the influence of the devil.

He can have no power over us unless we permit it. He is really a coward, and if we stand firm, he will retreat. The Apostle James counseled: “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/4.7" class="scriptureRef">James 4:7</a>). He cannot know our thoughts unless we speak them. And Nephi states that “he hath no power over the hearts” of people who are righteous (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22.26" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 22:26</a>).</p>

So Satan and his angels are not all-powerful. One of Satan’s approaches is to persuade a person who has transgressed that there is no hope of forgiveness. But there is always hope. Most sins, no matter how grievous, may be repented of if the desire is sincere enough.</p>

As a consequence, literally hosts of people have been victimized by him and his angels. There is, however, an ample shield against the power of Lucifer and his hosts. This protection lies in the spirit of discernment through the gift of the Holy Ghost. This gift comes undeviatingly by personal revelation to those who strive to obey the commandments of the Lord and to follow the counsel of the living prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator.p33" pid="n3UFBwcZaEOTewSut86bfA" hash="7dNePA">This personal revelation will surely come to all whose eyes are single to the glory of God, for it is promised that their bodies will be “filled with light, and there shall be no darkness” in them (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.67" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:67</a>). Satan’s efforts can be thwarted by all who come unto Christ by obedience to the covenants and ordinances of the gospel. The humble followers of the divine Master need not be deceived by the devil if they will be honest and true to their fellow men and women, go to the house of the Lord, receive the sacrament worthily, observe the Sabbath day, pay their tithes and offerings, offer contrite prayers, engage in the Lord’s work, and follow those who preside over them.</p>

These same principles, covenants, and ordinances are coupled with the rights and powers of the priesthood of Almighty God. We of this church are the possessors and custodians of these commanding powers which can and do roll back much of the power of Satan on the earth. We believe that we hold these mighty forces in trust for all who have died, for all who are now living, and for the yet unborn.</p>

I feel impressed, brethren, to speak to the men and the boys who hold the priesthood of Almighty God concerning our responsibility to the faithful sisters of the Church. You might wonder why I would want to address this subject. I wonder myself, but I am prompted to, and feel there is a need. I believe that we as members of the Church, and as the holders of the priesthood, will never achieve our potential without having in our lives the blessings of the unique qualities of our mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, and all of the good women of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/the-highest-place-of-honor.p2" pid="2LvSHQVjPUyMEXdJjHoYAQ" hash="Mne7MA">Perhaps you have all heard the story, and it is just a story, of the insensitive man who held two season tickets to the basketball games at the local university. His wife died, and a day or two later he went to the game. The seat previously occupied by his wife was empty. Someone said, “Those seats of yours must be very expensive. Couldn’t you find a member of the family to come and sit in your wife’s seat?” The man answered, “No, they couldn’t come. They’ve all gone to her funeral.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/the-highest-place-of-honor.p3" pid="L1gz-PnDCUGohDAFAhwREQ" hash="XIYS4Q">I fear that we brethren often get far too engrossed in the apparent importance of our own activities and relegate the less visible contributions of the sisters to a lesser role. They serve very quietly and effectively, often unnoticed, unrecognized, and unappreciated.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/the-highest-place-of-honor.p4" pid="pAPvYq5NakCC8YD--OG_Fg" hash="79H2YQ">The priesthood places upon the fathers the responsibility of being the head of the family and the home. What does being the head of the family mean? It is a priesthood power, and the Doctrine and Covenants, section 121, makes it clear that all priesthood responsibilities must be exercised “only by persuasion, … by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:41</a>). Holding the priesthood does not mean that a man is a power-broker, or that he sits on a throne, dictating in macho terms, or that he is superior in any way. Rather, he is a leader by authority of example. Paul’s counsel to the Ephesians included, “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/5.25" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 5:25</a>). As Christ lifts us all, so must we, rather than put down women or anyone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/the-highest-place-of-honor.p5" pid="XyMQCSsLz0-w-yXlMgPPxQ" hash="QCpYCw">Nowhere does the doctrine of this Church declare that men are superior to women. Paul said to the Corinthians, “Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 11:11</a>). Each brings his or her own separate and unique strengths to the family and the Church. Women are not just cooks, stewards of our homes, or servants. They are much more. They are the enrichment of humanity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/the-highest-place-of-honor.p6" pid="mn5qKv2Mc0OFVoaD3ezfyw" hash="kQsNQw">It is most important that you Aaronic Priesthood holders learn what strengths you have as men. Possibly you were foreordained to great priesthood callings. You need to learn that these masculine strengths are great, noble, and God-given; however, they also have some limitations. Because of these limitations, it is equally important to learn how the influence of good women in our lives can complement these strengths and overcome these limitations. As you walk on the way to eternity, it is important to gain some understanding and appreciation for the wonderful endowments and callings God has given uniquely to women.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/the-highest-place-of-honor.p7" pid="UKpdfRDkdUSelvY2V0mFMA" hash="CoDYAA">I wonder if we really understand the fulness of these queenly endowments. If we could recognize the true greatness of these women, we would not treat them as we sometimes do. The world often uses and abuses women. We holders of the priesthood should honor good women in and out of the Church as true sisters, not as objects and sources of service or pleasure. Our consideration for women should spring from esteem for the daughters of Zion and an awareness of their true identity more than from a concern with their functions and roles.</p>

Clark comp., <span class="emphasis">Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75, 6:5). This has been confirmed by President Heber J.

Homer Durham, Salt Lake City: <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> 1941, p. 150).</p>

But it is too soon for you deacons and teachers to think seriously about dating. Dating, along with temple marriage, will come at the appropriate season in your life. You have to be elders to go to the temple.</p>

Your eternal helpmate will gently hold you to your potential. She will give loving and thoughtful encouragement, as well as comfort and discipline. She will also lift you up when you are down and bring you back to earth when you are puffed up. She will bless your life in countless ways. As President Kimball said, “Brethren, we cannot be exalted without our wives. There can be no heaven without righteous women” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1979, p. 5).</p>

Women are not in any sense lesser creations than men. In fact, they lose something when they are compared to men. President David O. McKay stated, “A beautiful, modest, gracious woman is creation’s masterpiece” (David O. McKay, <span class="emphasis">Gospel Ideals,</span> Salt Lake City: <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> 1953], p. 449). Daniel Defoe, the great English writer, stated, “A woman of sense and manners is the finest and most delicate part of God’s creation, the glory of her Maker. … He gave the best gift either God could bestow or man receive” (quoted in <span class="emphasis">England in Literature,</span> ed.

In this they equal and even surpass men, as they do in faith, morality, and commitment when truly converted to the gospel. They have “more trust in the Lord [and] more hope in his word” (“More Holiness Give Me,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 131). This inner spiritual sense seems to give them a certain resilience to cope with sorrow, trouble, and uncertainty.</p>

President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated, “I feel likewise that it ill becomes any man who holds the priesthood of God to abuse his wife in any way, to demean or injure or take undue advantage of the woman who is the mother of his children, the companion of his life, and his companion for eternity if he has received that greater blessing” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1982, p. 77). This, of course, means verbal as well as physical abuse.</p>

Likewise, when male and female violate these commandments, I believe the priesthood holder is generally more blameworthy because he has been entrusted with the great, righteous power to act in the name of God. One who violates this trust demeans both this ultimate power and himself and seriously injures the woman who has his confidence.</p>

As you date, you will be entrusted by a girl’s parents with their most cherished blessing. You will have the responsibility to protect not only her well-being, but also her honor, even above your own safety. One of the duties of manhood is to safeguard womanhood. When you become a parent, you cannot shirk this responsibility to be concerned for the dating of your own children.</p>

I soon developed indigestion. The longer it went, the worse I felt. When we got back to her home, I found the father had kept his promise. There in his big leather chair was this wonderful, concerned family patriarch waiting for one of his fine daughters to be safely back under his own roof.

When within the covenant of marriage a man and a woman invoke the great powers of creation, they literally become partners with God in creating new human life.

They seem to have less time to magnify the feelings of charity and benevolence that the Prophet Joseph said comes naturally to them (see <span class="emphasis">History of The Church,</span> 4:605). Life has become harder and more complex; in some ways, it demands more of all of us. It has become more difficult for mothers and wives to meet all of the challenges and expectations that are placed upon them. Our seemingly insatiable appetites for material things suggest that probably these demands could very well increase in the future.</p>

All my life, a good woman, either my mother or my wife, has prepared most of my nourishment, kept my clothes clean, and provided a loving atmosphere at home. They did this willingly because of their great desire to show their love through service. But marriage and mothering is more than the routine of washing socks, making beds, and putting food on the table. It is also not being taken for granted; it is being appreciated and being appropriately thanked. It also means being helped.</p>

Even with the additional demands placed upon women in our day, men generally have not responded with commensurate helpfulness. Recent research indicates that men have increased their helping in the home only twenty-seven additional minutes per week. The conclusion is, “Women are still the primary caretakers and managers” (Mary Lou Simms, <span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> 25 Feb. 1988, p. C3). They also carry so much of the burdens of the kingdom.</p>

It is the highest, holiest service to be assumed by mankind” (<span class="emphasis">Messages of the First Presidency,</span> 6:178). The priesthood cannot work out its destiny, nor can God’s purposes be fulfilled, without our helpmates. Mothers perform a labor the priesthood cannot do. For this supernal gift of life the priesthood should have love unbounded for the mothers of their children. Men should give them honor, gratitude, reverence, respect, and praise. A man who fails to gratefully acknowledge his debt to his own mother who gave him life is insensitive to the Holy Spirit. I wish to acknowledge to both my mother and my wife a debt which is so great I shall never be able to repay it.</p>

They are entitled to our deepest veneration, our fullest appreciation, and our most profound respect. I believe angels attend them in their motherly ministry. That we may so honor them I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

These years have been challenging and, in many ways, difficult, but they have also been fulfilling. My wife and I have been trying humbly to serve the Lord as best we know how. We have traveled over much of the earth in my ministry. This has afforded us opportunity to bear witness of the Savior in many countries.</p>

I wish to testify of the mediation, the atonement, and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. I speak of these transcendent events in light of my spiritual knowledge that Jesus is the Redeemer and the Son of God. I also testify of His divinity and of those events in the office, the priesthood, the calling, and the authority of the holy Apostleship with which I and my Brethren are charged.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-supernal-gift-of-the-atonement.p3" pid="mlATNurC802-9B-ekUi8ZQ" hash="C0rXmA">Through the Atonement and those singular events surrounding it, all of the terrible individual and collective sins of all mankind were taken upon the Lord’s shoulders. The marvelous result of this great suffering was that He was able to redeem from physical death the believers and the obedient as well as the unbelieving and disobedient. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.13-14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 46:13–14</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/24.15" class="scriptureRef">Acts 24:15</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:22</a>.) Every person ever born or yet to be born is the beneficiary of both the mediation and the atonement of the Savior. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.42" class="scriptureRef">Alma 11:42</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-supernal-gift-of-the-atonement.p4" pid="sW9NUq2k-0Sxf8ZfRBZoIQ" hash="Jzg3Sg">The act of the Atonement is, in its simplest terms, a reconciliation of man with his God. The word <span class="emphasis">atonement</span> means to be at one. “It is literally <span class="emphasis">at-one-ment</span>.” (James E. Talmage, <span class="emphasis">The Articles of Faith,</span> 47th ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924, p. 75.) Because of their transgression, Adam and Eve, having chosen to leave their state of innocence (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.23-25" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:23–25</a>), were banished from the presence of God. This is referred to in Christendom as the Fall, or Adam’s transgression. It is a spiritual death because Adam and Eve were separated from the presence of God and given agency “to act for themselves and not to be acted upon.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:26</a>.) They were also given the great power of procreation, so that they could keep the commandment to “multiply, and replenish the earth” and have joy in their posterity. (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.28" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-supernal-gift-of-the-atonement.p5" pid="8AaP1EYTWESpBKQvp7k61w" hash="ocmcxw">All of their posterity were likewise banished from the presence of God. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.22-26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:22–26</a>.) However, the posterity of Adam and Eve were innocent of the original sin because they had no part in it. It was therefore unfair for all of humanity to suffer eternally for the transgressions of our first parents, Adam and Eve. It became necessary to settle this injustice; hence the need for the atoning sacrifice of Jesus in his role as the Savior and Redeemer. Because of the transcendent act of the Atonement, it is possible for every soul to obtain forgiveness of sins, to have them washed away and be forgotten. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.6-9" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:6–9</a>; Talmage, <span class="emphasis">Articles of Faith,</span> p. 89.) This forgiveness comes about, however, on condition of repentance and personal righteousness.</p>

Through the grace of Jesus Christ, immortality comes to all men, just or unjust, righteous or wicked. However, eternal life is “the greatest of all the gifts of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>.) We obtain this great gift, according to the Lord, “if you keep my commandments and endure to the end.” If we so endure, the promise is, “you shall have eternal life.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>.)</p>

It explains that the Lord is giving to the vast majority of men, those who will not be obedient, the blessing of immortality; and to those who will serve him, the blessing of eternal life.” (<span class="emphasis">The Way to Perfection,</span> Salt Lake City: The Genealogical Society of Utah, 1946, p. 329.)</p>

We still do not know how the Savior was able to take upon Himself and bear our transgressions, our foolishness, our grief, our sorrows, and our burdens. It was indefinable and unfathomable. It was almost unbearable. The indescribable agony was so great in Gethsemane that “his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.44" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:44</a>.) The haunting cry on the cross, in a loud voice in His native Aramaic, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/15.34" class="scriptureRef">Mark 15:34</a>) gives but a mere glimpse of His suffering and humiliation. One cannot help wondering how many of those drops of precious blood each of us may be responsible for.</p>

Through the divinity which is within us as a gift of the great Creator, we can come to complete fruition as heirs of God with eternal powers, dominions, and progression without end. Paul said this gift is a free gift. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/5.15" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 5:15</a>.) Through the Mediation and Atonement we will be resurrected ourselves without going through any part of the atoning agony that the Son of God went through.</p>

After the crucifixion, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome had bought sweet spices to anoint his body.

When they arrived, they found that the stone had been rolled away. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/16.3-4" class="scriptureRef">Mark 16:3–4</a>.) A great earthquake had intervened, and an angel had rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it, causing the keepers to shake with fear and become as dead men. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.2-4" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:2–4</a>.) The angel instructed the women to tell the disciples quickly of the Lord’s resurrection, assuring them that “he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:7</a>.) As they went to tell the disciples, “Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:9</a>.)</p>

This special ministry changed the Apostles from an uncertain, confused, divided, and weak group into powerful witnesses of the Lord. Mark records that the Savior upbraided the eleven “because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/16.14" class="scriptureRef">Mark 16:14</a>.)</p>

In all human experience, this had never happened before. It was completely unprecedented. This was a different experience than the raising of Jairus’ daughter (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/5.22,24,35-43" class="scriptureRef">Mark 5:22, 24, 35–43</a>), the young man of Nain (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/7.11-15" class="scriptureRef">Luke 7:11–15</a>), or Lazarus (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/11.1-44" class="scriptureRef">John 11:1–44</a>). They all died again. Jesus, however, became a resurrected being. He would never die again. So it was that to the Apostles the story of Mary Magdalene and the other women who witnessed the Resurrection “seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.11" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:11</a>.)</p>

It was the revelation that Christ had risen from the grave. His promises had been kept, his Messianic mission fulfilled. In the words of an eminent writer, ‘The final and absolute seal of genuineness has been put on all his claims and the indelible stamp of divine authority upon all his teachings. The gloom of death had been banished by the glorious light of the presence of their Risen, Glorified Lord and Savior.’</p>

It should help us carry all burdens, bear any sorrows, and also fully savor all joys and happiness that can be found in this life. The disciples who walked with the Savior on the road to Emmaus said to one another, “Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:32</a>.) No wonder they entreated him, “Abide with us: for it is toward evening,” and he “sat at meat with them.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.29-30" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:29–30</a>.)

All nature is stirring. The grass is growing. The leaves are budding. The fruit trees are straining to blossom. Lambs are being born. Flowers are coming forth. We have celebrated the Easter season, and we have joined all Christendom to rejoice in the resurrection of the Savior from the tomb of death.</p>

Jesus was mindful of the great ordeal ahead of him. He agonized, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/14.34" class="scriptureRef">Mark 14:34</a>.) He was ready for the unspeakable agony. Said he, “The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/14.38" class="scriptureRef">Mark 14:38</a>.)</p>

Jesus had spoken of leaving them. They knew that the Master whom they loved and depended upon was going somewhere, but where, they did not know. They had heard him say, “I will not leave you comfortless. … But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.18,26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:18, 26</a>.)</p>

I do so because I am persuaded that there is a greater need for divine oversight in our lives today than ever before. I wish to testify that, by the power and gift of the Holy Ghost, we can know what to do and what not to do to bring happiness and peace to our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/the-gift-of-the-holy-ghost-a-sure-compass.p6" pid="-xPpP_uiP0KSRqEpcThg2w" hash="qr1Pww">Elder LeGrand Richards stated, “It must … be understood that the Holy Ghost is the medium through whom God and his Son, Jesus Christ, communicate with men [and women] upon the earth.” (<span class="emphasis">A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,</span> rev. ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1966, p. 119.) All men are enlightened by the Spirit of God, or Light of Christ—sometimes called conscience. Job stated, “But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/32.8" class="scriptureRef">Job 32:8</a>.) This is the Spirit of God emanating from Deity. This power of God is the means by which, as President Joseph F. Smith stated, “every man is enlightened, the wicked as well as the good, the intelligent and the ignorant, the high and the low, each in accordance with his capacity to receive the light.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 62; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.3-13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:3–13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/the-gift-of-the-holy-ghost-a-sure-compass.p7" pid="BpHH2jMAeEKNRt70stl2KA" hash="j5AMJw">The gift of the Holy Ghost, however, in distinction from the Spirit of God, does not come to all men and women. The ministrations of the Holy Ghost are, however, limited without receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “there is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 199). Many outside the Church have received revelation from the Holy Ghost, convincing them of the truth of the gospel. Cornelius, as well as many in attendance on the day of Pentecost, received the Holy Ghost before baptism. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.1-12" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:1–12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.30-44" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:30–44</a>.) It is through this power that seekers after truth acquire a testimony of the Book of Mormon and the principles of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/the-gift-of-the-holy-ghost-a-sure-compass.p8" pid="2X5z-Y7g7kmk40LxZUgSdQ" hash="tUEV4A">The gift of the Holy Ghost comes after one repents and becomes worthy. It is received after baptism by the laying on of hands by those who have the authority. On the day of Pentecost, Peter instructed those who had previously been touched spiritually by the Holy Ghost, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.38" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:38</a>.) Those possessing the gift of the Holy Ghost can come to a greater light and testimony. The Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth and impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and the son Jesus Christ so deeply that no earthly power or authority can separate him from that knowledge. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.18" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:18</a>.)</p>

In addition, the gift of the Holy Ghost is available as a sure guide, as the voice of conscience, and as a moral compass. This guiding compass is personal to each of us. It is unerring. It is unfailing. However, we must listen to it in order to steer clear of the shoals which will cause our lives to sink into unhappiness and self-doubt.</p>

I speak, among other values, of the standards of chastity, parental respect, fidelity in marriage, and obedience to God’s laws—such as Sabbath observance—which have been weakened, if not destroyed. Society has been misled.</p>

Rowan, commenting on the lowering of television standards, said, “Author and commentator Malcolm Muggeridge once told a story about some frogs who were killed without resistance by being boiled alive in the cauldron of water. Why didn’t they resist? Because when they were put in the cauldron, the water was tepid. Then the temperature was raised ever so slightly, and the water was warm, then a tiny bit warmer, then a bit warmer still, and on and on and on. The change was so gradual, almost imperceptible, that the frogs accommodated themselves to their new environment—until it was too late. The point that Mr. Muggeridge was making was not about frogs but about us and how we tend to accept evil as long as it is not a shock that is thrust on us abruptly. We are inclined to accept something morally wrong if it is only a shade more wrong than something we are already accepting.” (<span class="emphasis">National Press Club Forum</span>.)</p>

This Comforter is a personage of spirit and a member of the Godhead. The Doctrine and Covenants explains why the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit: “The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:22</a>.)</p>

It can be more mind-expanding and can make us have a better sense of well-being than any chemical or other earthly substance. It will calm nerves; it will breathe peace to our souls. This Comforter can be with us as we seek to improve. It can function as a source of revelation to warn us of impending danger and also help keep us from making mistakes. It can enhance our natural senses so that we can see more clearly, hear more keenly, and remember what we should remember. It is a way of maximizing our happiness.</p>

For instance, it can help us learn to forgive. There comes a time when people must move on, seeking greater things rather than being consumed by the memory of some hurt or injustice. Dwelling constantly on past injuries is, by its nature, limiting to the Spirit. It does not promote peace.</p>

The Spirit of the Holy Ghost can be a confirming witness, testifying of heavenly things. Through that Spirit, a strong knowledge distills in one’s mind, and one feels all doubt or questions disappear.</p>

To have a covenant or ordinance sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise is a compact through which the inherent blessings will be obtained, provided those seeking the blessing are true and faithful. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.50-54" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:50–54</a>.)</p>

Such marriages become rich, whole, and sacred. Though each party to the marriage can maintain his or her separate identity, yet together in their covenants they can be like two vines wound inseparably around each other. Each thinks of his or her companion before thinking of self.</p>

However, that sealing may be broken by unrighteousness. It is also important to remember that if a person undertakes to receive the sealing blessing by deceit, “then the blessing is not sealed, notwithstanding the integrity and authority of the person officiating.” (Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class="emphasis">Doctrines of Salvation,</span> 3 vols., comp.

This principle is basic to our belief. President Wilford Woodruff declared: “Whenever the Lord had a people on the earth that He acknowledged as such, that people were led by revelation” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 24:240.) I affirm at the beginning that the inspiration of God is available to all who worthily seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This is particularly true of those who have received the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p2" pid="HO8lpfJve0KMUJkhLbiLsg" hash="zWwWmw">I wish to speak today, however, of God’s communications to all of his children through prophets, as distinguished from personal revelation received by individual members of the Church and others. The prophets, seers, and revelators have had and still have the responsibility and privilege of receiving and declaring the word of God for the world. Individual members, parents, and leaders have the right to receive revelation for their own responsibility but have no duty nor right to declare the word of God beyond the limits of their own responsibility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p3" pid="ae-EB9fWdkCqHp-45U_6bQ" hash="5s8SPw">I use as my text the ninth article of faith: “We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.” [<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.9" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:9</a>]</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p4" pid="3sjC7aZWz0OmJsd7zbfR_w" hash="6Rzh-Q">The first part states: “We believe all that God has revealed.” Through the ages, God’s messages to his children generally have been revealed through prophets. Amos tells us, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>.) These are the prophetic oracles who have tuned in over the centuries to the “celestial transmitting station,” with a responsibility to relay the Lord’s word to others. The principal qualifications of a prophet in any age are not wealth, title, position, physical stature, scholarship, or intellectual attainment. The two qualifications are that a prophet must be called as such by God, by open prophecy, and ordained by one known to have legal and spiritual authority, and he must receive and declare revelation from God. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:11</a>.) No man knows the ways of God except they be revealed unto him. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.8" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:8</a>.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p5" pid="5uHIFxXkdkGpLIjUtkdBKg" hash="Xvjizg">Over the centuries revelation from prophets has come incrementally. The Lord stated: “For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and prove you herewith.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 98:12</a>.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p6" pid="fRoRKoh0yUSQh2AdJdD-LQ" hash="XPICFw">Revelations have come by different means. Among other ways, they have come by the guidance of the Holy Ghost (which is perhaps most common), by the spoken word, and by visits from holy messengers.</p>

        <h3 class="title" pid="4-l818oGSUSRZXVBb23D6Q" hash="AH0kEg">Present Revelation</h3>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p7" pid="3j_BSe8C6UOdYVFuLzSIWg" hash="Poj6BQ">The ninth article of faith continues: “We believe … all that [God] does now reveal.” For some strange reason it seems easier for many to believe the words of dead prophets rather than those of living prophets. The greatest revelator in our time has been Joseph Smith. In the difficult period between 1823 and 1843, just twenty years, 134 revelations were received, printed, and made public.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p8" pid="B3rqwWre_EqdE7d5qZwTYw" hash="m3gGqg">Each of the eighty-nine Apostles called since then has been sustained as a prophet, seer, and revelator. But <span class="emphasis">the</span> prophets, seers, and revelators succeeding Joseph as Presidents of the Church have been those Apostles in whom all of the keys of Christ’s earthly kingdom have been active and functioning.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p9" pid="wdIG71ct7kuHYHswMswJJw" hash="MUi4nA">We now move forward nobly and boldly, with courage and conviction, led by our venerable prophet, Ezra Taft Benson. He is in every respect entitled to our sustaining action. For forty-six years he has been sustained as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is now the senior Apostle on the earth. He has been ordained and set apart as the prophet, seer, and revelator to the world. He has been sustained as the President of the Church. He has been given two inspired Counselors to help him. He is the presiding high priest over all the priesthood on the earth. He alone holds and exercises all of the keys of the kingdom under the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the head of this church and is the chief cornerstone. In his presidency, assisted by his two great Counselors and sustained by the Quorum of the Twelve, he is leading this work forward.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p10" pid="IxTNOEzkL0S6AQ28ZcE0GQ" hash="2TX2Vw">I do not believe members of this church can be in full harmony with the Savior without sustaining his living prophet on the earth, the President of the Church. If we do not sustain the living prophet, whoever he may be, we die spiritually. Ironically, some have died spiritually by exclusively following prophets who have long been dead. Others equivocate in their support of living prophets, trying to lift themselves up by putting down the living prophets, however subtly.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p11" pid="NbPFwTve5k6ZMlW0JuRSUw" hash="wEKcEA">In our lifetime we have been favored with ongoing communication from the heavens, which have been open to the prophets of our time. Major divine pronouncements have included what we now know as section 138 of the Doctrine and Covenants, given in 1918. [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 138</a>] Surely one of the greatest divine disclosures came in 1978 when the blessings of the priesthood and temple became available to all worthy male members. Line upon line and precept upon precept, new knowledge and direction have been given to the Church.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p12" pid="1WARxNx5fkmQu_BF73ifaw" hash="hCkkaQ">Thus, by revelation in our day the Seventies have been given an expanded role as members of Area Presidencies and in general Church administration, helping the First Presidency and the Twelve “in building up the church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:34</a>.) Many other divine instructions have also been received. Much revelation received, in this time as well as anciently, has been doctrinal. Some of it has been operational and tactical. Much of it is not spectacular. President John Taylor reminds us: “Adam’s revelation did not instruct Noah to build his ark; nor did Noah’s revelation tell Lot to forsake Sodom; nor did either of these speak of the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt. These all had revelations for themselves.” (<span class="emphasis">Millennial Star,</span> 1 Nov. 1847, p. 323.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p13" pid="lSMTJYQzR0qryKpIfkq1JQ" hash="xP2COA">In our time God has revealed how to administer the Church with a membership of over six million differently than when there were just six members of the Church. These differences include the use of modern technology, such as films, computers, and satellite broadcasts, to teach and communicate new ways to conduct missionary work in various nations; the location and building of temples; and many others.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p14" pid="YTMuL_oFa0qlb3NCbSUXjA" hash="r33a6Q">This process of continuous revelation comes to the Church very frequently. President Wilford Woodruff stated, “This power is in the bosom of Almighty God, and he imparts it to his servants the prophets as they stand in need of it day by day to build up Zion.” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 14:33.) This is necessary for the Church to fulfill its mission. Without it, we would fail.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p15" pid="dNv8YZ6Weku82rnv4y3CFA" hash="g69-bA">A very encouraging portion of the ninth article of faith we have been considering is its conclusion, “We believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.” Elder Boyd K. Packer stated: “Revelation is a continuous principle in the Church. In one sense the Church is still being organized. As light and knowledge are given, as prophecies are fulfilled and more intelligence is received, another step forward can be taken.” (<span class="emphasis">The Holy Temple,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1980, p. 137.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p16" pid="gTleRklUeU2igaaghjmcUg" hash="Y7pwKg">This Church constantly needs the guidance of its head, the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. This was well taught by President George Q. Cannon: “We have the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants; but all these books, without the living oracles and a constant stream of revelation from the Lord, would not lead any people into the Celestial Kingdom. … This may seem a strange declaration to make, but strange as it may sound, it is nevertheless true.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p17" pid="HJUtD09X10SG_WxUr__h2w" hash="SXpa5Q">“Of course, these records are all of infinite value. They cannot be too highly prized, nor can they be too closely studied. But in and of themselves, with all the light that they give, they are insufficient to guide the children of men and to lead them into the presence of God. To be thus led requires a living Priesthood and constant revelation from God to the people according to the circumstances in which they may be placed.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Truth,</span> Classics in Mormon Literature Series, 2 vols. in one, sel. Jerreld L. Newquist, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1987, p. 252.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p18" pid="EHb78Ynf50GnZLmMNCaL3A" hash="mKHRhg">When will this promised revelation come? Only God knows when. It will come as needed. To whom will it come? To obtain the answer to this, we must go back to the words of Amos: “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>.) This continuous revelation will not and cannot be forced by outside pressure from people and events. It is not the so-called “revelation of social progress.” It does not originate with the prophets; it comes from God. The Church is governed by the prophet under the guidance and direction of God. Parley P. Pratt disclosed:</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p19" pid="Bb6qiX_A906vPKv2X3dipw" hash="7GgWnA">“The legislative, judicial, and executive power is vested in Him [the Lord]. He reveals the laws, and he elects, chooses, or appoints the officers; and holds the right to reprove, to correct, or even to remove them at pleasure. Hence the necessity of a constant intercourse by direct revelation between him and his church.” (<span class="emphasis">Millennial Star,</span> Mar. 1845, p. 150.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p20" pid="rOi36X_qMky34-JfgvvBfQ" hash="i9vADA">We have been promised that the President of the Church will receive guidance for all of us as the revelator for the Church. Our safety lies in paying heed to that which he says and following his counsel.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p21" pid="Zfulaeplz0qkCtWE5ubhxw" hash="uF1aeQ">The doctrine of this church was stated by Elder Stephen L Richards: “They [the Presidency] are the supreme court here on earth in the interpretation of God’s law.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p22" pid="6GID0E9WDkm7EUm7vWpQOQ" hash="1QpOPw">“In the exercise of their functions and delegated powers they are controlled by a constitution, a part of which is written and a part of which is not. The written part consists in authenticated scripture, ancient and modern, and in the recorded utterances of our latter-day prophets. The unwritten part is the spirit of revelation and divine inspiration which are appertinent to their calling.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p23" pid="i0AqpwPPJkiU8Q0hx0VbKQ" hash="un4DfA">“In formulating their interpretations and decisions they always confer with the Council of the Twelve Apostles who by revelation are appointed to assist and act with them in the government of the Church. When, therefore, a judgment is reached and proclaimed by these officers it becomes binding upon all members of the Church, individual views to the contrary notwithstanding. God’s Kingdom is a kingdom of law and order.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1938, pp. 115–16.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p24" pid="xL8c_bUEokCdpjxT1RaQhg" hash="9bYNSw">How can we be so sure that, as promised, the prophets, seers, and revelators will never lead this people astray? (See Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> July 1972, p. 88.) One answer is contained in the grand principle found in the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants: “And every decision made by either of these quorums must be by the unanimous voice of the same.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:27</a>.) This requirement of unanimity provides a check on bias and personal idiosyncrasies. It ensures that God rules through the Spirit, not man through majority or compromise. It ensures that the best wisdom and experience is focused on an issue before the deep, unassailable impressions of revealed direction are received. It guards against the foibles of man.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p25" pid="lDslm-WvM0KGLsENbIlyug" hash="dz1q5Q">The responsibility for determining the divine validity of what one of the oracles of God states does not rest solely upon him. President J. Reuben Clark stated, “We can tell when the speakers are ‘moved upon by the Holy Ghost’ only when we, ourselves, are ‘moved upon by the Holy Ghost.’” (Daniel H. Yarn, Jr., ed., <span class="emphasis">J. Reuben Clark: Selected Papers on Religion, Education, and Youth,</span> Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1984, pp. 95–96.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p26" pid="0p5P7v-ca0aWSo1HzgT-Ew" hash="LehvqQ">This is in harmony with the counsel of Brigham Young: “I am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God whether they are led by Him. I am fearful they settle down in a state of blind self-security, trusting their eternal destiny in the hands of their leaders with a reckless confidence that in itself would thwart the purposes of God in their salvation, and weaken that influence they could give to their leaders, did they know for themselves, by the revelations of Jesus, that they are led in the right way. Let every man and woman know, by the whispering of the Spirit of God to themselves, whether their leaders are walking in the path the Lord dictates, or not.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 9:150.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p27" pid="bvti7i9-O0iFa6-E3qtrcw" hash="vKzpeA">Revelation was required to establish this church. Revelation has brought it from its humble beginnings to its present course. Revelation has come like flowing, living water. Continuing revelation will lead it forward to the windup scene. But as President Clark told us, we do not need more or different prophets. We need more people with “a listening ear.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1948, p. 82.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation.p28" pid="RZQs52t0GkG9kLouPInA3w" hash="dzOaTA">We make no claim of infallibility or perfection in the prophets, seers, and revelators. Yet I humbly state that I have sat in the company of these men, and I believe their greatest desire is to know and do the will of our Heavenly Father. Those who sit in the highest councils of this church and have participated as inspiration has come and decisions have been reached know that this light and truth is beyond human intelligence and reasoning. These deep, divine impressions have come as the dews from heaven and settled upon them individually and collectively. So inspired, we can go forward in complete unity and accord.</p>

I pray that we may be responsive to his Spirit and be found listening to the oracles he has appointed. I so pray because I know that we mortals, without the aid of revelation, cannot know the purposes of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The Lord has said, “And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:21</a>.) It is clear to me from this scripture that to “thank the Lord thy God in all things” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:7</a>) is more than a social courtesy; it is a binding commandment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p2" pid="XS0W0qosFkKDssQIyvVa6A" hash="xmb2CA">One of the advantages of having lived a long time is that you can often remember when you had it worse. I am grateful to have lived long enough to have known some of the blessings of adversity. My memory goes back to the Great Depression, when we had certain values burned into our souls. One of these values was gratitude for that which we had because we had so little. The Great Depression in the United States in the early thirties was a terrible schoolmaster. We had to learn provident living in order to survive. Rather than create in us a spirit of envy or anger for what we did not have, it developed in many a spirit of gratitude for the meager, simple things with which we were blessed, like hot, homemade bread and oatmeal cereal and many other things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p3" pid="MCqNgqyTHkOsquSerd1VMw" hash="kl0GBw">As another example, I remember my beloved grandmother, Mary Caroline Roper Finlinson, making homemade soap on the farm. Her recipe for homemade soap included rendered animal fat, a small portion of lye as a cleansing agent, and wood ashes as an abrasive. The soap had a very pungent aroma and was almost as hard as a brick. There was no money to buy soft, sweet-smelling soap. On the farm, there were many dusty, sweat-laden clothes to be washed and many bodies that needed desperately a Saturday night bath. If you had to bathe with that homemade soap, you could become wonderfully clean, but you smelled worse after bathing than before. Since I use soap more now than I did as a child, I have developed a daily appreciation for mild, sweet-scented soap.</p>

This was spoken of by the Lord: “For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift?” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:33</a>.) The Apostle Paul described our day to Timothy when he wrote that in the last days “men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.2" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 3:2</a>.) These sins are fellow travelers, and ingratitude makes one susceptible to all of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p5" pid="3HFdeWURjESYbn7sjOhHHQ" hash="hgWUNQ">The story of the thankful Samaritan has great meaning. As the Savior went through Samaria and Galilee, “he entered into a certain village, [and] there met him ten men that were lepers” and who “lifted up their voices and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” Jesus told them to go show themselves unto the priest.</p>

Those suffering from this terrible disease were required to agonize together, sharing their common misery. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/lev/13.45-46" class="scriptureRef">Lev. 13:45–46</a>.) Their forlorn cry, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us” must have touched the Savior’s heart. When they were healed and when they had received priestly approval that they were clean and acceptable in society, they must have been overcome with joy and amazement. Having received so great a miracle, they seemed completely satisfied. But they forgot their benefactor. It is difficult to understand why they were so lacking in gratitude. Such ingratitude is self-centered. It is a form of pride. What is the significance of the fact that the one who returned to give thanks was a Samaritan? As in the story of the good Samaritan, the point seems to be that those of lesser social or economic status often rise to a greater duty and nobility.</p>

Such sacrifice becomes your heritage also, for it is the inheritance of a people who have faults and imperfections but have a great nobility of purpose. That purpose is to help all mankind come to a sweet, peaceful understanding about who they are, and to foster a love for their fellowmen and a determination to keep the commandments of God. This is the gospel’s holy call. It is the essence of our worship.</p>

But modern communication brings into our homes a drowning cascade of the violence and misery of the worldwide human race. There comes a time when we need to find some peaceful spiritual renewal.</p>

In these peaceful environments, our souls are rested. We have the feeling of having come home.</p>

A family home evening, with music and spoken word, was arranged by President Muti in his stake center. The home evening was in honor of His Majesty King Tupou the Fourth, the reigning monarch of Tonga. The king, his daughter, and granddaughters graciously attended, as did many of the nobles and diplomatic representatives in Tonga. Our members put on a superb program of song and verse. One of the king’s granddaughters sang a little solo entitled “How Much I Love My Grandfather.” Elder John Sonnenberg and I were invited to respond briefly, which we were pleased to do.</p>

Social protocol is observed in many places, but the expression of kindness is universally appropriate.</p>

As gratitude is absent or disappears, rebellion often enters and fills the vacuum. I do not speak of rebellion against civil oppression. I refer to rebellion against moral cleanliness, beauty, decency, honesty, reverence, and respect for parental authority.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p20" pid="pp1SHmga8UOaUvdeoJBg0A" hash="8zKKgQ">A grateful heart is a beginning of greatness. It is an expression of humility. It is a foundation for the development of such virtues as prayer, faith, courage, contentment, happiness, love, and well-being.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p21" pid="R821EoKb50uddkh1ian79w" hash="-uMTww">But there is a truism associated with all types of human strength: “Use it or lose it.” When not used, muscles weaken, skills deteriorate, and faith disappears. President Thomas S. Monson stated: “Think to thank. In these three words are the finest capsule course for a happy marriage, a formula for enduring friendship, and a pattern for personal happiness.” (<span class="emphasis">Pathways to Perfection,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1973, p. 254.) Said the Lord, “And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:19</a>.)</p>

Last year I found myself late at night on an airplane bulging with passengers going north from Mexico City to Culiacan. The seats in the plane were close together, and every seat was taken, mostly by the gracious people of Mexico. Everywhere inside the plane there were packages and carryon luggage of all sizes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p23" pid="QzHs1RegwkyHjRpjayBb5A" hash="MYfpmg">A young woman came down the aisle with four small children, the oldest of which appeared to be about four and the youngest a newborn. She was also trying to manage a diaper bag and a stroller and some bags. The children were tired, crying, and fussing. As she found her seat in the airplane, the passengers around her, both men and women, literally sprang to her aid. Soon the children were being lovingly and tenderly comforted and cared for by the passengers. They were passed from one passenger to another all over the airplane.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p24" pid="z6ujZPJUTEuyctVZ0pmZcw" hash="DrhYxA">The result was an airplane full of baby-sitters. The children settled down in the caring arms of those who cradled them and, before long, went to sleep. Most remarkable was that a few men who were obviously fathers and grandfathers tenderly cradled and caressed the newborn child without any false, macho pride. The mother was freed from the care of her children most of the flight.</p>

I relearned that appreciation for and thoughtfulness and kindness to little children are an expression of the Savior’s love for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p26" pid="SmsMc4ST4UWE2gUYG6uXgw" hash="_gfjzw">How can we pay our debt of gratitude for the heritage of faith demonstrated by pioneers in many lands across the earth who struggled and sacrificed so that the gospel might take root? How is thankfulness expressed for the intrepid handcart pioneers who, by their own brute strength, pulled their meager belongings in handcarts across the scorching plains and through the snows of the high mountain passes to escape persecution and find peaceful worship in these valleys? How can the debt of gratitude possibly be paid by the descendants of the Martin and the Willie and the other handcart companies for the faith of their forebears?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p27" pid="pxrScyIIdkGwUaLazUIDmQ" hash="80tsjQ">One of these intrepid souls was Emma Batchelor, a young English girl traveling without family. She started out with the Willie handcart company, but by the time they reached Fort Laramie, they were ordered to lighten their loads. Emma was directed to leave the copper kettle in which she carried all of her belongings.</p>

She knew that the Martin company was only a few days behind. She had been privileged to start with the Willie company, and when the Martin company caught up, she joined the Paul Gourley family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p29" pid="v3MpzMt9HUeqwSeMpq7UNw" hash="YUXxcg">A young son wrote many years later: “Here we were joined by Sister Emma Batchelor. We were glad to have her because she was young and strong and meant more flour for our mess.” It was here that Sister Gourley gave birth to a child, and Emma acted as the midwife and loaded the mother and the child in the cart for two days, which Emma helped pull.</p>

Emma, age twenty-one, however, was a fortunate one. She came through the ordeal whole.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p31" pid="urZgKCnOfkmpzsR6mFQrXw" hash="C9AJyQ">A year later, she met Brigham Young, who was surprised that she was not maimed, and she told him, “Brother Brigham, I had no one to care for me or to look out for me, so I decided I must look out for myself. I was the one who called out when Brother Savage warned us [not to go]. I was at fault in that, but I tried to make up for it. I pulled my share at the cart every day. When we came to a stream, I stopped and took off my shoes and stockings and outer skirt and put them on top of the cart. Then, after I got the cart across, I came back and carried little Paul over on my back. Then I sat down and scrubbed my feet hard with my woolen neckerchief and put on dry shoes and stockings.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/gratitude-as-a-saving-principle.p33" pid="3QDdX7A4tEy5cmtYYAwTIw" hash="t2OMbw">As with all commandments, gratitude is a description of a successful mode of living. The thankful heart opens our eyes to a multitude of blessings that continually surround us. President J. Reuben Clark said, “Hold fast to the blessings which God has provided for you. Yours is not the task to gain them, they are here; yours is the part of cherishing them.” (<span class="emphasis">Church News,</span> 14 June 1969, p. 2.) As we come to the close of this great conference, I hope that we may cultivate grateful hearts so that we may cherish the multitude of blessings that God has so graciously bestowed. May we openly express such gratitude to our Heavenly Father and our fellowmen, I pray in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

It has to do with the privilege and responsibility of being good parents. On this subject there are about as many opinions as there are parents, yet there are few who claim to have all of the answers. I am certainly not one of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p2" pid="FQ4ku4YTo0-gYtsKD3xclw" hash="YA1zNQ">I feel that there are more outstanding young men and women among our people at present than at any other moment in my lifetime. This presupposes that most of these fine young people have come from good homes and have committed, caring parents. Even so, the most conscientious parents feel that they may have made some mistakes. One time, when I did a thoughtless thing, I remember my own mother exclaiming, “Where did I fail?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p3" pid="080H37c6oE2PWRCc97D1Ng" hash="qP-kDw">The Lord has directed, “Bring up your children in light and truth.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.40" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:40</a>.) To me, there is no more important human effort.</p>

It is an effort requiring consecration. President David O. McKay stated that being parents is “the greatest trust that has been given to human beings.” (<span class="emphasis">The Responsibility of Parents to Their Children,</span> pamphlet, Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, n.d., p. 1.)</p>

Surely no more important work is to be done in this world than preparing our children to be God-fearing, happy, honorable, and productive. Parents will find no more fulfilling happiness than to have their children honor them and their teachings. It is the glory of parenthood. John testified, “I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/3-jn/1.4" class="scriptureRef">3 Jn. 1:4</a>.) In my opinion, the teaching, rearing, and training of children requires more intelligence, intuitive understanding, humility, strength, wisdom, spirituality, perseverance, and hard work than any other challenge we might have in life. This is especially so when moral foundations of honor and decency are eroding around us. To have successful homes, values must be taught, and there must be rules, there must be standards, and there must be absolutes. Many societies give parents very little support in teaching and honoring moral values. A number of cultures are becoming essentially valueless, and many of the younger people in those societies are becoming moral cynics.</p>

In order to do this, we must first reinforce the primary teachers of children. Chief among these are the parents and other family members, and the best environment should be in the home. Somehow, some way, we must try harder to make our homes stronger so that they will stand as sanctuaries against the unwholesome, pervasive moral dry rot around us. Harmony, happiness, peace, and love in the home can help give children the required inner strength to cope with life’s challenges. Barbara Bush, wife of President George Bush, a few months ago said to the graduates of Wellesley College:</p>

You must read to your children and you must hug your children and you must love your children. Your success as a family, our success as a society, depends not on what happens in the White House but on what happens inside your house.” (<span class="emphasis">Washington Post,</span> 2 June 1990, p. 2.)</p>

As a consequence of this sacrifice, conscientious parents develop a nobility of character and learn to put into practice the selfless truths taught by the Savior Himself.</p>

They should be honored and helped in their heroic efforts. But any mother’s or father’s task is much easier where there are two functioning parents in the home. Children often challenge and tax the strength and wisdom of both parents.</p>

In the future, infrequent family scripture study may be inadequate to arm our children with the virtue necessary to withstand the moral decay of the environment in which they will live. Where in the world will the children learn chastity, integrity, honesty, and basic human decency if not at home? These values will, of course, be reinforced at church, but parental teaching is more constant.</p>

For instance, when parents attend movies they forbid their children to see, parental credibility is diminished. If children are expected to be honest, parents must be honest. If children are expected to be virtuous, parents must be virtuous. If you expect your children to be honorable, you must be honorable.</p>

Paul reminds us that children should “learn first to shew piety at home.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/5.4" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 5:4</a>.)</p>

Child rearing is so individualistic. Every child is different and unique. What works with one may not work with another. I do not know who is wise enough to say what discipline is too harsh or what is too lenient except the parents of the children themselves, who love them most. It is a matter of prayerful discernment for the parents. Certainly the overarching and undergirding principle is that the discipline of children must be motivated more by love than by punishment. Brigham Young counseled, “If you are ever called upon to chasten a person, never chasten beyond the balm you have within you to bind up.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 9:124–25.) Direction and discipline are, however, certainly an indispensable part of child rearing. If parents do not discipline their children, then the public will discipline them in a way the parents do not like. Without discipline, children will not respect either the rules of the home or of society.</p>

President David O. McKay stated, “Parents who fail to teach obedience to their children, if [their] homes do not develop obedience society will demand it and get it. It is therefore better for the home, with its kindliness, sympathy and understanding to train the child in obedience rather than callously to leave him to the brutal and unsympathetic discipline that society will impose if the home has not already fulfilled its obligation.” (<span class="emphasis">The Responsibility of Parents to Their Children,</span> p. 3.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/the-greatest-challenge-in-the-world-good-parenting.p18" pid="mJP8-KtriU6xLpvEPY36_Q" hash="xfb5LQ">An essential part of teaching children to be disciplined and responsible is to have them learn to work. As we grow up, many of us are like the man who said, “I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.” (Jerome Klapka Jerome, in <span class="emphasis">The International Dictionary of Thoughts,</span> comp. John P. Bradley, Leo F. Daniels, and Thomas C. Jones Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969, p. 782.) Again, the best teachers of the principle of work are the parents themselves. For me, work became a joy when I first worked alongside my father, grandfather, uncles, and brothers. I am sure that I was often more of an aggravation than a help, but the memories are sweet and the lessons learned are valuable. Children need to learn responsibility and independence. Are the parents personally taking the time to show and demonstrate and explain so that children can, as Lehi taught, “act for themselves and not … be acted upon”? (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:26</a>.)</p>

The children themselves have a responsibility to listen, obey, and, having been taught, to learn. Parents cannot always answer for all their children’s misconduct because they cannot ensure the children’s good behavior. Some few children could tax even Solomon’s wisdom and Job’s patience.</p>

In a sense, some children in those circumstances hold their parents hostage by withholding their support of parental rules unless the parents acquiesce to the children’s demands. Elder Neal A. Maxwell has said, “Those who do too much <span class="emphasis">for</span> their children will soon find they can do nothing <span class="emphasis">with</span> their children. So many children have been so much <span class="emphasis">done for</span> they are almost <span class="emphasis">done in</span>.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1975, p. 101.)

In times of difficult decisions they are most likely to follow the teachings of their parents rather than the example of their peers or the sophistries of the media which glamorize alcohol consumption, illicit sex, infidelity, dishonesty, and other vices. They are like Helaman’s two thousand young men who “had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them” from death. “And they rehearsed … the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/56.47-48" class="scriptureRef">Alma 56:47–48</a>.)</p>

When this belief becomes part of their very souls, they have inner strength. So, of all that is important to be taught, what should parents teach? The scriptures tell us that parents are to teach their children “faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost,” and “the doctrine of repentance.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:25</a>.) These truths must be taught in the home. They cannot be taught in the public schools, nor will they be fostered by the government or by society. Of course, Church programs can help, but the most effective teaching takes place in the home.</p>

All of these things, you see, let us in so easily into the real quality and tone of [Christ’s] interests, so specific, so narrowed down, so enlisted in what is small, so engrossed with what is minute.” (“Kindness and Love,” in <span class="emphasis">Leaves of Gold,</span> Honesdale, Pa.: Coslet Publishing Co., 1938, p. 177.)</p>

I also wish to speak of the exquisite beauty and fragrance to be found in life, and of a crown of glory. I wish that I better understood all of the divine purposes in having to contend with so many painful irritants in this life. Lehi explained one reason: that we will appreciate and savor the goodness and loveliness of the world. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.10-13" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:10–13</a>.) Adam was told that the ground is cursed with thorns and thistles for our sakes. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/3.17-18" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 3:17–18</a>.) Likewise, mortality is “cursed” with the thorns of worldly temptation and the slivers of sin so that we can be tested and prove ourselves. This is necessary for our eternal progression. The Apostle Paul explained, “Lest I should be exalted above measure … , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 12:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p2" pid="JFZR48hGIU6pr753I7Lq-Q" hash="02lvng">The denial of our own sins, of our own selfishness, of our own weakness is like a crown of thorns which keeps us from moving up one more step in personal growth. Perhaps worse than sin is the denial of sin. If we deny that we are sinners, how can we ever be forgiven? How can the atonement of Jesus work in our lives if there is no repentance? If we do not promptly remove the slivers of sin and the thorns of carnal temptation, how can the Lord ever heal our souls? The Savior said, “Repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.13" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 9:13</a>.) It is most difficult for us to pray for those who hate us, who despitefully use us, who persecute us. But by failing to take this vital extra step, however, we fail to remove some of the festering briars in our souls. Extending forgiveness, love, and understanding for perceived shortcomings and weaknesses in our wives, husbands, children, and associates makes it much easier to say, “God be merciful to me a sinner.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/18.13" class="scriptureRef">Luke 18:13</a>.)</p>

As a young boy, when school was out for the summer and we went to the farm, off came our shoes. The shoes stayed off all summer long except for special occasions. For the first week or two, when our feet were tender, the smoothest pebble or stick would be painful. But as the weeks came and went, the soles of our feet toughened so that they could withstand almost anything in the path except thistles, of which there seemed to be more than any other weed. And so it is with life; as we grow and mature and keep close to Him who was crowned with thorns, our souls seem to get stronger in withstanding the challenges, our resolve hardens, our wills become firmer, and our self-discipline increases to protect us from the evils of this world. These evils are so omnipresent, however, that we must always walk in the paths which are the most free of the thistles of earthly temptation.</p>

Only later did we realize the effects that this had on our own and neighboring gardens. Many of us delight in flirting with temptation, only later to learn how we and others have sown the seeds of our own unhappiness and how we can also affect our neighbor’s happiness.</p>

It is called conscience. It is our spirit’s natural response to the pain of sin, just like pain in our flesh is our body’s natural response to a wound—even a small sliver. Conscience strengthens through use. Paul told the Hebrews, “But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 5:14</a>.) Those who have not exercised their conscience have “their conscience seared with a hot iron.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.2" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 4:2</a>.) A sensitive conscience is a sign of a healthy spirit.</p>

The power to remove the thorns in our lives and in the lives of others begins with ourselves. Moroni writes that when we deny ourselves of ungodliness, then the grace of Christ is sufficient for us.

How much we resist the momentary pain of removing a sliver, even though it will relieve the longer-lasting pain of a festering sore. Everyone knows that if thorns and briars and slivers are not removed from the flesh, they will cause sores that fester and will not heal.</p>

A few years ago, on a beautiful fall day, some of us were walking in the fields. Ben was going back and forth in front of us, sniffing the ground, tail wagging, and obviously enjoying himself. After a while we sat down on a ditch bank to rest and could feel the warmth of the autumn sun caressing us. Ben came limping up to his master and, with a pained look in his eye, held up his front paw. Ben’s master gently took his paw into his hands and examined it carefully. Between two of his toes was a thorn. The thorn was carefully removed, and Ben stayed long enough to wag his tail a little more vigorously and receive a few pats on his head. He then ran off, no longer limping nor bothered by the pain. I was amazed that Ben instinctively seemed to know that the thorn needed to come out to relieve the pain and to know where to go to have it removed. Like Ben, we also seem to instinctively look for relief from the thorns of sin that inflict us. In contrast, however, we do not always seek our Master for relief; and many do not yet know who their Master is.</p>

Thus, there was pressed down upon Him a crown of thorns. He accepted the pain as part of the great gift He had promised to make. How poignant this was, considering that thorns signified God’s displeasure as He cursed the ground for Adam’s sake that henceforth it would bring forth thorns. But by wearing the crown, Jesus transformed thorns into a symbol of His glory. As Emily Dickinson so aptly described it:</p>

However, though they ulcerate and though they torment, they can still be removed, and the healing process will take place. When the infection is healed, the soreness will leave. That process is known as repentance. Repentance and forgiveness are among the greatest fruits of the Atonement. It is not easy to remove the thorns of pride, the thistles of selfishness, the slivers of ego, and the briars of appetite.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p20" pid="ungQNe7dmU-eZ3XEwwAL6A" hash="WuWlxw">In Roselandia, Brazil, outside the great city of São Paulo, there are many acres of beautiful roses. When one stands on a small hill above the rose fields, the aroma is delightful and the beauty is exhilarating. The thorns on the bushes are there, but they in no way lessen the enjoyment of the sight and the smell. I would challenge all to put the thorns, slivers, and thistles we encounter in life in proper perspective. We should deal with them but then concentrate on the flowers of life, not on the thorns. We should savor the smell and beauty of the flower of the rose and the cactus. To savor the sweet aroma of the blossoms, we need to live righteous and disciplined lives in which the study of the scriptures, prayer, right priorities, and right attitudes are integrated into our lives. For members of this church, that focus sharpens inside of our temples. We will all surely encounter some of the thorns, but they are only incidental to the sweet fragrances and exquisite beauty of the blooms. Did not the Savior say, “Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.16" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:16</a>.)</p>

M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1912, 3:173.) The ancient Latin phrase <span class="emphasis">sic transit gloria mundi</span> means “thus passes away the glory of this world.” Earthly rewards can be a sore temptation. In contrast, those who are faithful and are committed to service are promised that they will be “crowned with honor, and glory, and immortality, and eternal life.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/75.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 75:5</a>.) Thus neither honors nor trials can defeat. Paul spoke of an incorruptible crown (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/9.25" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 9:25</a>), and James spoke of the faithful receiving a “crown of life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.12" class="scriptureRef">James 1:12</a>). John the Revelator counseled, “Hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/3.11" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 3:11</a>.)</p>

So selfishness can make what we think is a noble crown into a crown of thorns beyond our power to endure. When I first started my professional career, one of the senior members in our office asked another senior member for some help on a legal matter. The other man who was asked to help was gifted and able but also selfish. He replied, “What’s in it for me” The “what’s in it for me?” philosophy is basically what’s wrong with the world. It is surely one of the sharpest points in a crown of thorns.</p>

Is it not time that we begin denying ourselves, as the Savior counseled, and surrender and master ourselves rather than indulge ourselves in a “do my own thing” selfish little world? The question is not so much what we can do, but what God can do through us. Paul said, “If man therefore purge himself … , he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/2.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 2:21</a>.)</p>

When going to school I was very poor. I worked long hours in a canning factory catching steaming-hot cans for twenty-five cents an hour. I learned that selfishness has more to do with how we feel about what we have than how much we have. A poor man can be selfish and a rich man generous, but a person obsessed only with getting will have a hard time to find God. I have come to know that with any privilege comes responsibility. Most privilege carries with it the responsibility to serve, to give, and to bless. God can take away any privilege if it is not used under His omnipotent will. Meeting that challenge to give, to serve, to bless in faithfulness and devotion is the only way to enjoy the crown of glory spoken of by the original Apostles. It is the only way true meaning comes to life. We will be able to receive honors or scorn with equal serenity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-crown-of-thorns-a-crown-of-glory.p25" pid="bhRM-_RgGEK_dbBdqOnnkA" hash="cXPYJw">I conclude with the words of Ezekiel, “And thou, son of man, … though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ezek/2.6" class="scriptureRef">Ezek. 2:6</a>.) In our constantly changing world, may we continually cling to those things that do not change: to prayer, to faith, to saving covenants, to love of families, and to brotherhood. By removing the slivers of sin and the thorns of worldly temptation in our lives, and by denying ourselves and taking up our own cross and following the Savior, we can change a crown of thorns to a crown of glory. I testify, as one of his humble servants called to be His special witness, that He lives. I witness from the depths of my soul that we are engaged in His holy work, to which, if we are faithful, we can be crowned with honor, glory, and eternal life. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/75.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 75:5</a>.) In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I seem to have been led in my thinking by a concern that so many in our generation are missing great blessings by not honoring the Lord’s day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p2" pid="1sLm_cw8CUuZHP3at_4XsA" hash="MIvhBw">I confess that as a young boy, Sunday was not my favorite day. Grandfather shut down the action. We didn’t have any transportation. We couldn’t drive the car. He wouldn’t even let us start the motor. We couldn’t ride the horses, or the steers, or the sheep. It was the Sabbath, and by commandment, the animals also needed rest. We walked to Church and everywhere else we wanted to go. I can honestly say that we observed both the spirit and the letter of Sabbath worship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p3" pid="SpEzvPeq0Uaj6DQESNe1lw" hash="K3rcmA">By today’s standards, perhaps Grandfather’s interpretation of Sabbath day activities seems extreme, but something wonderful has been lost in our lives. To this day, I have been pondering to try to understand fully what has slipped away. Part of it was knowing that I was well on the Lord’s side of the line. Another part was the feeling that Satan’s influence was farther away. Mostly it was the reinforcement received by the spiritual power which was generated. We had the rich feeling that the spiritual “fulness of the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:16</a>) was ours, as promised by the Lord in section 59 of the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>

This long emphasis alone is an indication of its importance. In Genesis, we learn that God himself set the example for us in the creation of the earth:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p8" pid="0gkiqLSJ70ibojobQMEjdQ" hash="XZGl3A">In biblical times this commandment to rest and worship was so strict that a violation of it called for the death penalty. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/31.15" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 31:15</a>.) Even the earth was given a sabbath rest: “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the Lord: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/lev/25.4" class="scriptureRef">Lev. 25:4</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p9" pid="cypGp8thnk-aSmVS83UCxA" hash="fM47QQ">The Sabbath was referred to in the Old Testament days as a blessed and hallowed day (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.11" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:11</a>), as a symbol of a perpetual covenant of faithfulness (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/31.16" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 31:16</a>), as a holy convocation (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/lev/23.3" class="scriptureRef">Lev. 23:3</a>), as a day of spiritual celebration (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/lev/23.32" class="scriptureRef">Lev. 23:32</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p10" pid="AQgxCnUb-UulI1zKRfJ4CA" hash="SwkmWQ">Jesus reaffirmed the importance of the Sabbath day devotion, but he introduced a new spirit into this part of worship. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.20" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:20</a>.) Rather than observe the endless technicalities and prohibitions concerning what should and should not be done on the Lord’s day, he affirmed that it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/12.12" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 12:12</a>.) He taught us that “the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/12.8" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 12:8</a>) and introduced the principle that “the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/2.27" class="scriptureRef">Mark 2:27</a>). He performed good deeds on the Sabbath, such as healing the man with palsy (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/2.1-12" class="scriptureRef">Mark 2:1–12</a>) as well as the man with the paralyzed hand (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/12.10-13" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 12:10–13</a>). So the divine mandate of Sabbath day observance in our day is now more of a manifestation of individual devotion and commitment rather than a requirement of civil law.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p19" pid="Uwj35DZlXE6fuB26B_YfBQ" hash="ljXykw">“The Sabbath is a holy day in which to do worthy and holy things. Abstinence from work and recreation is important but insufficient. The Sabbath calls for constructive thoughts and acts, and if one merely lounges about doing nothing on the Sabbath, he is breaking it. To observe it, one will be on his knees in prayer, preparing lessons, studying the gospel, meditating, visiting the ill and distressed, sleeping, reading wholesome material, and attending all the meetings of that day to which he is expected. To fail to do these proper things is a transgression on the omission side.” (<span class="emphasis">The Miracle of Forgiveness,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969, pp. 96–97.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p20" pid="K0SGW-HX10Cy2D_QvQ7FgQ" hash="xg9GjQ">Over a lifetime of observation, it is clear to me that the farmer who observes the Sabbath day seems to get more done on his farm than he would if he worked seven days. The mechanic will be able to turn out more and better products in six days than in seven. The doctor, the lawyer, the dentist, the scientist will accomplish more by trying to rest on the Sabbath than if he tries to utilize every day of the week for his professional work. I would counsel all students, if they can, to arrange their schedules so that they do not study on the Sabbath. If students and other seekers after truth will do this, their minds will be quickened and the infinite Spirit will lead them to the verities they wish to learn. This is because God has hallowed his day and blessed it as a perpetual covenant of faithfulness. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/31.16" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 31:16</a>.)</p>

They received manna from heaven daily except on the Sabbath. The manna had to be gathered and used the day it fell, or it became wormy and would stink. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/16.20,30" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 16:20, 30</a>.) But on the sixth day, prior to the Sabbath, twice as much manna fell as on the other days. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/16.5" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 16:5</a>.) The children of Israel were instructed by the Lord to gather twice as much so that it would last for two days because the manna did not fall on the Sabbath day. When they did this, a third miracle happened. On the Sabbath day the manna gathered the day before did not stink, and there were no worms in it, for it was preserved for Sabbath day use. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/16.24" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 16:24</a>.)</p>

One is the story of the cobbler working under one of the megalith stones in Avebury, near Stonehenge, England:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p26" pid="3SFWad6RR0al2WIbNQAGXA" hash="ICWGTA">“‘One Sunday,’ wrote John Saunders in his journal for August 13, 1712, ‘a cobler was mending of shoos under one of these great stones. The minute he rose the stone fell down and broke in pieces on the very ground where he sat which made him see the great providence of God in preserving him alive and so deter him from braking the Sabbath for which reason he never more worked on the Sabbath day.’” (Michael Pitts, <span class="emphasis">Footprints through Avebury,</span> Dorchester, England: The Friary Press Limited, 1985, pp. 31–32.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p27" pid="ZiEF_s8COUCQWzh3kXUpqQ" hash="AznOVw">A more recent miracle occurred at the Wells Stake Welfare Tannery some years ago where hides of animals were tanned into leather. On regular workdays, the hides were removed from the vats and fresh lime placed in the vats, after which the hides were returned to the lime solution. If the hides were not turned on holidays, they would spoil. But the change was never made on Sunday, and there were no spoiled hides on Monday. Explained J. Lowell Fox, the supervisor of the tannery at the time:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p28" pid="tRbHV1PFtki11C26p3Rjtw" hash="xU8few">“This brought a strange fact to our minds: holidays are determined by man, and on these days just as on every week day, the hides need to have special care every twelve hours. Sunday is the day set aside by the Lord as a day of rest, and He makes it possible for us to rest from our labors as He has commanded. The hides at the tannery never spoil on Sundays. This is a modern-day miracle, a miracle that happens every weekend!” (<span class="emphasis">Handbook for Guide Patrol Leaders,</span> Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1964, p. 37.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p29" pid="MiSBW1uTYUOGXJhY0vFTmw" hash="E51FmQ">Why has God asked us to honor the Sabbath day? The reasons I think are at least threefold. The first has to do with the physical need for rest and renewing. Obviously God, who created us, would know more than we do of the limits of our physical and nervous energy and strength.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p30" pid="vYZyzdlT_0-1JN29x3Z9sg" hash="6ukAFA">The second reason is, in my opinion, of far greater significance. It has to do with the need for regeneration and the strengthening of our spiritual being. God knows that, left completely to our own devices without regular reminders of our spiritual needs, many would degenerate into the preoccupation of satisfying earthly desires and appetites. This need for physical, mental, and spiritual regeneration is met in large measure by faithful observance of the Sabbath day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p31" pid="YR6Ygoi4lkSzZIA7Ij3GUA" hash="O_X8vw">The third reason may be the most important of the three. It has to do with obedience to commandments as an expression of our love for God. Blessed are those who need no reasons other than their love for the Savior to keep his commandments. The response of Adam to the angel who asked Adam why he made a sacrifice unto the Lord is a model for all. Responded Adam, “I know not, save the Lord commanded me.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.6" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p32" pid="FQunr9-xy02megq-PXf4TA" hash="EWtrIg">The prophet Samuel reminds us, “To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/15.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 15:22</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p33" pid="OGfHdTnh2UWPqNAcmbu9gw" hash="VLZvuw">In this day of increasing access to and preoccupation with materialism, there is a sure protection for ourselves and our children against the plagues of our day. The key to that sure protection surprisingly can be found in Sabbath observance: “And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p34" pid="R422WIt0vEieCSPFGKX8kw" hash="uAshpw">Who can question but that sincere Sabbath observance will help keep ourselves unspotted from the world? The injunction to keep the Sabbath day holy is a continuing covenant between God and his elect. The Lord told Moses and the children of Israel, “Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations … for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/31.13,16-17" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 31:13, 16–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p35" pid="jq77GjF9Q02iEolyH0vLpA" hash="Zk2TmA">The Mosaic injunctions of Sabbath day observance contained many detailed do’s and don’ts. This may have been necessary to teach obedience to those who had been in captivity and had long been denied individual freedom of choice. Thereafter, these Mosaic instructions were carried to many unwarranted extremes which the Savior condemned. In that day the technicalities of Sabbath day observance outweighed the “weightier matters of the law” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/23.23" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 23:23</a>) such as faith, charity, and the gifts of the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p36" pid="FMjJZBOqm0ClxnbX0xOFtQ" hash="CUojrg">In our time God has recognized our intelligence by not requiring endless restrictions. Perhaps this was done with a hope that we would catch more of the spirit of Sabbath worship rather than the letter thereof. In our day, however, this pendulum of Sabbath day desecration has swung very far indeed. We stand in jeopardy of losing great blessings promised. After all, it is a test by which the Lord seeks to “prove you in all things” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 98:14</a>) to see if your devotion is complete.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p37" pid="xlwogMulOkyK49c1bpIBpQ" hash="h-A0Tw">Where is the line as to what is acceptable and unacceptable on the Sabbath? Within the guidelines, each of us must answer this question for ourselves. While these guidelines are contained in the scriptures and in the words of the modern prophets, they must also be written in our hearts and governed by our conscience. Brigham Young said of the faithful, “The spirit of their religion leaks out of their hearts.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 15:83.) It is quite unlikely that there will be any serious violation of Sabbath worship if we come humbly before the Lord and offer him all our heart, our soul, and our mind. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.37" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:37</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-lords-day.p38" pid="Qir1ZD_ZAEyRTIXr6JAuWQ" hash="2imU_g">What is worthy or unworthy on the Sabbath day will have to be judged by each of us by trying to be honest with the Lord. On the Sabbath day we should do what we have to do and what we ought to do in an attitude of worshipfulness and then limit our other activities. I wish to testify unequivocally concerning the blessings of Sabbath day worship in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The psalmist stated, “He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/147.3" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 147:3</a>.) The healing is a divine miracle; the wounds are a common lot of all mankind. Shakespeare has said, “He jests at scars that never felt a wound.” (<span class="emphasis">Romeo and Juliet,</span> II.ii.1.) It seems that no one escapes the troubles, challenges, and disappointments of this world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p2" pid="DFiqQhY7REegSXVdLkTL8Q" hash="tqP_zw">In today’s overloaded society, some of the healing agents that our parents enjoyed seem not to be at work in our lives. Fewer and fewer are able to relieve stress by working with their hands and by tilling the soil. The increasing demands, the diversity of voices, the entreating sales pitches, the piercing noises, the entanglement of many personal relationships can rob our souls of the peace they need to function and survive. Our hurry to meet the relentless demands of the clock tears away at our inner peace. The pressures to compete and survive are great. Our appetite for personal possessions seems enormous. The increasing forces that destroy the individual and family bring great sadness and heartbreak.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p3" pid="VzPWGrpIVUW8T5IO398Klw" hash="UHA4hw">One reason for the spiritual sickness of our society is that so many do not know or care about what is morally right and wrong. So many things are justified on the basis of expediency and the acquiring of money and goods. In recent times, those individuals and institutions that have had the courage to stand up and speak out against adultery, dishonesty, violence, and gambling, and other forms of evil are often held up to ridicule. Many things are just plain and simply wrong, whether they are illegal or not. Those who persist in following after the evil things of the world cannot know the “peace of God, which passeth all understanding.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.7" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 4:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p4" pid="qVaMF_ngtEKy6HvdHeTJYQ" hash="yVWvIw">Someway, somehow, we must find the healing influence that brings solace to the soul. Where is this balm? Where is the compensating relief so desperately needed to help us survive in the world’s pressures? The onsetting comfort in large measure can come through increased communion with the Spirit of God. This can bring spiritual healing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p5" pid="hjYrrt07X0aWNyXDvgl4VA" hash="Q5awow">Spiritual healing is illustrated in the story of Warren M. Johnson, pioneer ferryman at Lee’s Ferry, Arizona. As a young man, Warren Johnson came west seeking his fortune in gold in the summer of 1866. He became very ill, and his companions left him under a tree in the yard of a family in Bountiful. One of the daughters found him and reported there was a dead man out in the yard. Although he was a complete stranger, this kind family took him in and nursed him back to health. They taught him the gospel, and he was baptized. He eventually ended up as the ferryman at Lee’s Ferry.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p6" pid="af212ApJxEy5CcbmSuoEjw" hash="_addWg">In 1891 the Warren Johnson family suffered a great tragedy. Within a period of a short time, they lost four children to diphtheria. All four were buried in a row next to each other. In a letter to President Wilford Woodruff, dated July 29, 1891, Warren told the story:</p>

But alas, in four and a half days [the oldest boy] choked to death in my arms. Two more were taken down with the disease and we fasted and prayed as much as we thought it wisdom as we had many duties to perform here. We fasted [for] twenty-four hours and once I fasted [for] forty hours, but to no avail for both my little girls died also. About a week after their death my fifteen year old daughter Melinda was [also] stricken down and we did all we could for her but she [soon] followed the others. … Three of my dear girls and one boy [have] been taken from us, and the end is not yet. My oldest girl nineteen years old is now prostrate [from] the disease, and we are fasting and praying in her behalf today. … I would ask for your faith and prayers in our behalf however.

I have not slackened in the performance of my duties, and hope and trust that I shall have the faith and prayers of my brethren, that I can live so as to receive the blessings you having authority … placed on my head.” (Warren Foote Autobiography, LDS Church Archives.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p14" pid="wTJsnBh5hUKm32GXc1tt7Q" hash="JBFmcA">The sixth article of faith states that, among other spiritual gifts, we believe in the gift of healing. To me, this gift extends to the healing of both the body and the spirit. The Spirit speaks peace to the soul. This spiritual solace comes by invoking spiritual gifts, which are claimed and manifested in many ways. They are rich, and full, and abundant in the Church today. They flow from the proper and humble use of a testimony. They also come through the administering to the sick following an anointing with consecrated oil. Christ is the great Physician, who rose from the dead “with healing in his wings” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:13</a>), while the Comforter is the agency of healing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p15" pid="v9i9Z_UXa0m9MVYAjHUpMg" hash="RsAIhw">The Lord has provided many avenues by which we may receive this healing influence. I am grateful that the Lord has restored temple work to the earth. It is an important part of the work of salvation for both the living and the dead. Our temples provide a sanctuary where we may go to lay aside many of the anxieties of the world. Our temples are places of peace and tranquillity. In these hallowed sanctuaries God “healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/147.3" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 147:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p16" pid="uYUyS08GgUq5AA_6ZsnYUg" hash="K2Ap9Q">The reading and the study of the scriptures can bring great comfort. President Marion G. Romney stated:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p17" pid="ZC3sbh8sY0qYdVvoRqjNqw" hash="w0DbUg">“I feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein. The spirit of reverence will increase, mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to that counsel. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity—the pure love of Christ—will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1960, pp. 112–13.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p18" pid="LmCgW3VZgUiyKP-V7TM2Wg" hash="-rWOcQ">When I was young, the health benefits of the Word of Wisdom, including abstinence from tobacco, alcoholic drinks, tea, and coffee, were not as well established as they are today. However, the spiritual benefits have long been validated. The Word of Wisdom promises that those who remember to keep this counsel and walk in obedience to the commandments “shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89:18</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p19" pid="EB6ohonDz0yG9yJQ0Qn7rw" hash="1-eJyg">Marrow has long been a symbol of vibrant, healthful living. But in a day of life-saving bone marrow transplants, the phrase “marrow to their bones” takes on an additional significance as a spiritual covenant. The promises for those who keep the Word of Wisdom continue. Those who observe this law “shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p23" pid="dTI8-Kj4w0aqCoyy8DYToQ" hash="kQ4igg">However, for many of us, the spiritual healing takes place not in great arenas of the world, but in our own sacrament meetings. It is comforting to worship, partake of the sacrament with, and be taught in a spirit of humility by neighbors and close friends who love the Lord and try to keep his commandments. Our good bishop assigns the participants to treat a gospel subject or principle. Invariably they speak by the power of the Holy Ghost, opening their hearts so that the audience can behold the jewels therein. The messages are given in humble witness and sweet counsel. We of the audience understand that which is taught by the spirit of truth and verify the accompanying testimonies.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p24" pid="yj42cvREnkK6TN3DSvH_DQ" hash="Ej2W0Q">Our sacrament meetings should be worshipful and healing, restoring those who attend to spiritual soundness. Part of this healing process occurs as we worship through music and song. Singing our beautiful, worshipful hymns is food for our souls. We become of one heart and one mind when we sing praises to the Lord. Among other influences, worshipping in song has the effect of spiritually unifying the participants in an attitude of reverence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p25" pid="o7Wf5-o_o0CSYZBzwJO-sw" hash="66Pg4Q">Spiritual healing also comes from bearing and hearing of humble testimonies. A witness given in a spirit of contrition, thankfulness for divine providence, and submission to divine guidance is a powerful remedy to relieve the anguish and concerns of our hearts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p26" pid="UWVWTShAeU6ngJLvo-EuIQ" hash="rez76w">I doubt that sincere members of this church can achieve complete spiritual healing without our being in harmony with the foundation of the Church, which, the Apostle Paul stated, is “the apostles and prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.20" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:20</a>.) This may not be the popular thing to do based upon the long history of rejection by the world of the prophets and their messages. Nevertheless, they are the oracles of God on earth and those called to lead and direct the work in this day and time. It is also essential for us to be found sustaining our bishops and our stake presidents and other leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/spiritual-healing.p27" pid="vdoZfbJsgke2Z_doS6MLQw" hash="pZ1J5Q">Recent information seems to confirm that the ultimate spiritual healing comes in the forgetting of self. A review of the accounts indicates that those who survived best in prison and hostage camps were those who were concerned for their fellow prisoners and were willing to give away their own food and substance to help sustain the others. Dr. Viktor Frankl stated: “We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of … human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, [and] to choose one’s own way [of life].” (<span class="emphasis">Man’s Search for Meaning, </span>New York: Simon and Schuster, 1963, p. 104.)</p>

We are instructed to pray to the Father in the name of his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, by the power of the Holy Ghost. The very act of praying to God is satisfying to the soul, even though God, in his wisdom, may not give what we ask for. President Harold B. Lee taught us that all of our prayers are answered, but sometimes the Lord says no. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the “best way to obtain truth and wisdom” is “to go to God in prayer.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, </span>p. 191.) Prayer is most helpful in the healing process.</p>

Smith stated, “But the healing of a wound is an art not acquired by practice alone, but by the loving tenderness that comes from universal good will and a sympathetic interest in the welfare and happiness of others.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine, </span>5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 264.)</p>

The Prophet Isaiah verified that “though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/1.18" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 1:18</a>.) The Prophet Joseph Smith stated, “There is never a time when the spirit is too old to approach God.

Indeed, the Lord has given it to us in these words: “Will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.13" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 9:13</a>.) In so doing, we have his promise that “he healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/147.3" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 147:3</a>.)</p>

The Apostle Peter speaks of “casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/5.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 5:7</a>.) As we do this, healing takes place, just as the Lord promised through the prophet Jeremiah when he said, “I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. … I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/31.13,25" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 31:13, 25</a>.)</p>

Then faith and hope will replace heartache, disappointment, torment, anguish, and despair, and the Lord will give us strength, as Alma says, that we “should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.38" class="scriptureRef">Alma 31:38</a>.) Of this I have a testimony, and I so declare it in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I acknowledge the faithful pioneers in all of the countries of the world who have helped establish the Church in their lands. First-generation members of the Church are indeed pioneers. They are and have been men and women of deep faith and devotion. Today, however, I speak primarily of the priceless legacy which belongs to the descendants of all pioneers, but especially to those who came into this valley and settled in Utah and other parts of western America.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p2" pid="kOK4jZnG3UWwkFGFqBblOg" hash="_lyVAg">In celebration of July 24th this year, we joined the Saints of the Riverton Wyoming Stake. Under the direction of President Robert Lorimer and his counselors, the youth and youth leaders of that stake reenacted part of the handcart trek which took place in 1856. We started early in a four-wheel-drive van and went first to Independence Rock, where we picked up the Mormon Trail. We saw Devil’s Gate a few miles up the road. Our souls were subdued when we arrived at the hallowed ground of Martin’s Cove, the site where the Martin Handcart Company, freezing and starving, waited for the rescue wagons to come from Salt Lake City. About fifty-six members of the Martin Handcart Company perished there from hunger and cold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p3" pid="eTCCEbvEkE2LvOmvEhT-1A" hash="blsaVw">It was an emotional experience to see the Sweetwater River crossing where most of the five hundred members of the company were carried across the icy river by three brave young men. Later, all three of the boys died from the effects of the terrible strain and great exposure of that crossing. When President Brigham Young heard of this heroic act, he wept like a child and later declared publicly: “That act alone will ensure C. Allen Huntington, George W. Grant and David P. Kimball an everlasting salvation in the Celestial Kingdom of God, worlds without end.” (Solomon F. Kimball, “Belated Emigrants of 1856,” <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> Feb. 1914, p. 288.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p4" pid="5neUsBEF5EWgbLhjLs_DQQ" hash="Z-qU3g">We went farther along the trail to the site where the members of the Willie Handcart Company were rescued. We felt that we were standing on holy ground. At that site twenty-one members of that party died from starvation and cold. We continued to travel up over Rocky Ridge, seven thousand three hundred feet high. This is the highest spot on the Mormon Trail. The two-mile ascension to Rocky Ridge gains over seven hundred feet in altitude. It was very difficult for all of the pioneers to travel over Rocky Ridge. It was particularly agonizing for the members of the Willie Handcart Company, who struggled over that ridge in the fall of 1856 in a blizzard. Many had worn shoes, and the sharp rocks caused their feet to bleed, leaving a trail of blood in the snow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p5" pid="m4Ry-g4eb0WGrRoQo4hJmw" hash="l8fy6Q">As we walked over Rocky Ridge, two square nails and an old-style button were picked up. No doubt these objects were shaken loose going over the sharp rocks. My soul was sobered to be in that historic spot. Several of my ancestors crossed that ridge, though none were in the handcart companies. Not all of my forebears who started in the great exodus to the West made it even to the Rocky Ridge. Two of them died at Winter Quarters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p6" pid="Z5F1c0eeMECBcm3AtHtRpg" hash="KsaTXA">As I walked over Rocky Ridge, I wondered if I have sacrificed enough. In my generation, I have not seen so much sacrifice by so many. I wonder what more I should have done, and should be doing, to further this work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p7" pid="NQyRdb6dpkKowRTsmVp4hw" hash="xMClPg">A few miles farther, at Radium Springs, we caught up with 185 young people and their leaders from the Riverton stake, who had been pulling handcarts in reenactment of the handcart treks. We bore testimony of the faith and heroism of those who struggled in agony over that trail 136 years ago.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p8" pid="AWci6anAYE-ctl5xq832Pg" hash="1DGc1A">We went on to Rock Creek Hollow, where the Willie Handcart Company made camp. Thirteen members of the Willie Company who perished from cold, exhaustion, and starvation are buried in a common grave at Rock Creek Hollow. Two additional members who died during the night are buried nearby. Two of those buried at Rock Creek Hollow were heroic children of tender years: Bodil Mortinsen, age nine, from Denmark, and James Kirkwood, age eleven, from Scotland.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p9" pid="Yljno2lLZUW4IGfAVeHQ3w" hash="Fvws3Q">Bodil apparently was assigned to care for some small children as they crossed Rocky Ridge. When they arrived at camp, she must have been sent to gather firewood. She was found frozen to death leaning against the wheel of her handcart, clutching sagebrush.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p10" pid="oA3SdoY0_EKQWjnCUzXPQQ" hash="j2kimQ">Let me tell you of James Kirkwood. James was from Glasgow, Scotland. On the trip west, James was accompanied by his widowed mother and three brothers, one of whom, Thomas, was nineteen and crippled and had to ride in the handcart. James’s primary responsibility on the trek was to care for his little four-year-old brother, Joseph, while his mother and oldest brother, Robert, pulled the cart. As they climbed Rocky Ridge, it was snowing and there was a bitter cold wind blowing. It took the whole company twenty-seven hours to travel fifteen miles. When little Joseph became too weary to walk, James, the older brother, had no choice but to carry him. Left behind the main group, James and Joseph made their way slowly to camp. When the two finally arrived at the fireside, James “having so faithfully carried out his task, collapsed and died from exposure and over-exertion.” (Private letter, Don H. Smith to Robert Lorimer, 20 Feb. 1990, quoting account of Don Chislett.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p11" pid="zE3KgJ2y4Ee7PX4xiqZCLw" hash="D_G1Lw">Also heroic were the rescuers who responded to President Brigham Young’s call in the October 1856 general conference. President Young called for forty young men, sixty to sixty-five teams of mules or horses, wagons loaded with twenty-four thousand pounds of flour to leave in the next day or two to “bring in those people now on the plains.” (LeRoy R. Hafen, <span class="emphasis">Handcarts to Zion,</span> Glendale, Cal.: Arthur H. Clarke Co., 1960, p. 121.) The rescuers went swiftly to relieve the suffering travelers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p12" pid="hFZZA0OAhUmZytiYcsadAQ" hash="MeTtlQ">When the rescued sufferers got close to the Salt Lake Valley, Brigham Young convened a meeting on this block. He directed the Saints in the valley to receive the sufferers into their homes, make them comfortable, and administer food and clothing to them. Said President Young: “Some you will find with their feet frozen to their ankles; some are frozen to their knees and some have their hands frosted. … We want you to receive them as your own children, and to have the same feeling for them.” (Hafen, <span class="emphasis">Handcarts to Zion,</span> p. 139.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p13" pid="m1pksHdKy0icSH9dSToKyg" hash="fyjMuQ">When the rescuers brought the Willie handcart pioneers into this valley, it is recorded by Captain Willie: “On our arrival there the Bishops of the different Wards took every person, who was not provided with a home, to comfortable quarters. Some had their hands and feet badly frozen; but everything which could be done to alleviate their sufferings, was done. … Hundreds of the Citizens flocked round the wagons on our way through the City, cordially welcoming their Brethren and Sisters to their mountain home.” (James G. Willie, <span class="emphasis">Journal History,</span> 9 Nov. 1856, p. 15.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p14" pid="h7oVUSsq40qn3hUYpSA4EQ" hash="lr1o-w">These excruciating experiences developed in these pioneers an unshakable faith in God. Said Elizabeth Horrocks Jackson Kingsford, “But I believe the Recording Angel has inscribed in the archives above, and that my sufferings for the Gospel’s sake will be sanctified unto me for my good.” (<span class="emphasis">Leaves from the Life of Elizabeth Horrocks Jackson Kingsford,</span> Dec. 1908, p. 7.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p15" pid="FOs7MUxvUk-X5ufQgKdfUQ" hash="ZAfY1w">In addition to the legacy of faith bequeathed by those who crossed the plains, they also left a great heritage of love—love of God and love of mankind. It is an inheritance of sobriety, independence, hard work, high moral values, and fellowship. It is a birthright of obedience to the commandments of God and loyalty to those whom God has called to lead this people. It is a legacy of forsaking evil. Immorality, alternative life-styles, gambling, selfishness, dishonesty, unkindness, addiction to alcohol, and drugs are not part of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p16" pid="E3zEY65Z5kKqmZgqP5BXuQ" hash="c814Uw">Here in Utah there is a voter decision about gambling to be made in a few weeks. The Church is not retreating from its stand on this issue. But as contests and issues heat up, we counsel members of the Church to be tolerant and understanding. We all have our moral agency, but if we use it unwisely, we must pay the price. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said, “We may use our agency as to whether we shall obey or disobey; and if we disobey we must abide the penalty.” (<span class="emphasis">Fundamentals of the Church Welfare Plan,</span> address at bishops’ meeting, 6 Oct. 1944, p. 3.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p17" pid="VwIWRCKaHE26_Aie_IcV4Q" hash="_5keww">I cannot help wondering why these intrepid pioneers had to pay for their faith with such a terrible price in agony and suffering. Why were not the elements tempered to spare them from their profound agony? I believe their lives were consecrated to a higher purpose through their suffering. Their love for the Savior was burned deep in their souls, and into the souls of their children, and their children’s children. The motivation for their lives came from a true conversion in the center of their souls. As President Gordon B. Hinckley has said, “When there throbs in the heart of an individual Latter-day Saint a great and vital testimony of the truth of this work, he will be found doing his duty in the Church.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1984, p. 99.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p18" pid="YpNuE_ItYEyIDh8GTr-_oQ" hash="pjTy4w">Above and beyond the epic historical events they participated in, the pioneers found a guide to personal living. They found reality and meaning in their lives. In the difficult days of their journey, the members of the Martin and Willie handcart companies encountered some apostates from the Church who were returning from the West, going back to the East. These apostates tried to persuade some in the companies to turn back. A few did turn back. But the great majority of the pioneers went forward to a heroic achievement in this life, and to eternal life in the life hereafter. Francis Webster, a member of the Martin Company, stated, “Everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities.” (David O. McKay, “Pioneer Women,” <span class="emphasis">Relief Society Magazine,</span> Jan. 1948, p. 8.) I hope that this priceless legacy of faith left by the pioneers will inspire all of us to more fully participate in the Savior’s work of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of his children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/a-priceless-heritage.p19" pid="wRdPir80nEOKR4OHJMx1oA" hash="xJ8Anw">You who are among the descendants of these noble pioneers have a priceless heritage of faith and courage. If there are any of you who do not enjoy fellowship with us in the gospel of Jesus Christ, we invite you to seek to know what instilled such great faith in your ancestors and what motivated them to willingly pay such a terrible price for their membership in this church. To those who have been offended or lost interest, or who have turned away for any reason, we invite all of you to join in full fellowship again with us. The faithful members, with all their faults and failings, are humbly striving to do God’s holy work across the world. We need your help in the great struggle against the powers of darkness so prevalent in the world today. In becoming a part of this work, you can all satisfy the deepest yearnings of your souls. You can come to know the personal comfort that can be found in seeking the sacred and holy things of God. You can enjoy the blessings and covenants administered in the holy temples. You can have great meaning and purpose in your lives, even in the profane world in which we live. You can have strength of character so that you can act for yourselves and not be acted upon. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:26</a>.)</p>

On this day we remember that the risen Lord has charged us with the responsibility to build the kingdom of God on earth. With this charge in mind, I hope to add a few thoughts that may strengthen the most important of all institutions—the family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p2" pid="Te43LB-8-0C6YoWuhQb9eA" hash="Z8SPIQ">In recent times, society has been plagued with a cancer from which few families have escaped. I speak of the disintegration of our homes. Immediate corrective treatment is urgent. In what I have to say, I do not wish to offend anyone. I affirm my profound belief that God’s greatest creation is womanhood. I also believe that there is no greater good in all the world than motherhood. The influence of a mother in the lives of her children is beyond calculation. Single parents, most of whom are mothers, perform an especially heroic service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p3" pid="ztQ5kjLmJkq6KQXGdEQNUg" hash="S-W1Ww">I hasten to acknowledge that there are too many husbands and fathers who are abusive to their wives and children and from whom the wives and children need protection. Yet modern sociological studies powerfully reaffirm the essential influence of a caring father in the life of a child—boy or girl. In the past twenty years, as homes and families have struggled to stay intact, sociological studies reveal this alarming fact: much of the crime and many of the behavioral disorders in the United States come from homes where the father has abandoned the children. In many societies the world over, child poverty, crime, drug abuse, and family decay can be traced to conditions where the father gives no male nurturing. Sociologically, it is now painfully apparent that fathers are not optional family baggage. We need to honor the position of the father as the primary provider for physical and spiritual support. I state this with no reluctance because the Lord has revealed that this obligation is placed upon husbands. “Women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/83.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 83:2</a>.) Further, “All children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/83.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 83:4</a>.) In addition, their spiritual welfare should be “brought to pass by the faith and covenant of their fathers.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.99" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:99</a>.) As regards little children, the Lord has promised that “great things may be required at the hands of their fathers.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.48" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 29:48</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p4" pid="Frz7r_b1ykmihRoo7Ols5Q" hash="3rJzwA">It is useless to debate which parent is most important. No one would doubt that a mother’s influence is paramount with newborns and in the first years of a child’s life. The father’s influence increases as the child grows older. However, each parent is necessary at various times in a child’s development. Both fathers and mothers do many intrinsically different things for their children. Both mothers and fathers are equipped to nurture children, but their approaches are different. Mothers seem to take a dominant role in preparing children to live within their families (present and future). Fathers seem best equipped to prepare children to function in the environment outside the family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p5" pid="gVw9XKMDZkS94DLUtLzn4w" hash="M4aqvQ">One authority states: “Studies show that fathers have a special role to play in building a child’s self-respect. They are important, too, in ways we really don’t understand, in developing internal limits and controls in children.” He continues, “Research also shows that fathers are critical in establishment of gender in children. Interestingly, fatherly involvement produces stronger sexual identity and character in both boys and girls. It is well established that the masculinity of sons and the femininity of daughters are each greater when fathers are active in family life.” (Karl Zinsmeister, “Do Children Need Fathers?” <span class="emphasis">Crisis,</span> Oct. 1992.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p7" pid="T25C7lmpvESEOVrejxyEHg" hash="NxadyQ">Is it not possible to give to woman-kind all the rights and blessings that come from God and legal authority without diminishing the nobility of God’s other grand creation, manhood? Eliza R. Snow stated in 1872: “The status of women is one of the questions of the day. Socially and politically it forces itself upon the attention of the world. Some … refuse to concede that woman is entitled to the enjoyment of any rights other than … the whims, fancies or justice … men may choose to grant her. The reasons which they cannot meet with argument they decry and ridicule; an old refuge for those opposed to correct principles which they are unable to controvert. Others … not only recognize that woman’s status should be improved, but are so radical in their extreme theories that they would set her in antagonism to man, assume for her a separate and opposing existence; and … show how entirely independent she should be.” Indeed, she continued, they “would make her adopt the more reprehensible phases of character which men present, and which should be shunned or improved by them instead of being copied by women. These are the two extremes, and between them is the ‘golden mean.’” (<span class="emphasis">The Woman’s Exponent,</span> 15 July 1872, p. 29.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p8" pid="Cy59lSRNNEmfYZQYGdNX9A" hash="xaFc-w">Many people do not understand our belief that God has wisely established a guiding authority for the most important institutions in the world. This guiding authority is called the priesthood. The priesthood is held in trust to be used to bless all of God’s children. Priesthood is not gender; it is blessings from God for all at the hands of the servants He has designated. Within the Church this authority of the priesthood can bless all members through the ministration of home teachers, quorum presidents, bishops, fathers, and all other righteous brethren who are charged with the administration of the affairs of the kingdom of God. Priesthood is the righteous power and influence by which boys are taught in their youth and throughout their lives to honor chastity, to be honest and industrious, and to develop respect for, and stand in the defense of, womanhood. Priesthood is a restraining influence. Girls are taught that through its influence and power to bless, they can fulfill many of their desires.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p9" pid="sHxcWQEGsk20Jqa3CPKsHQ" hash="4qEyaQ">Holding the priesthood means following the example of Christ and seeking to emulate his example of fatherhood. It means constant concern and caring for one’s own flesh and blood. The man who holds the priesthood is to honor it by eternally cherishing, with absolute fidelity, his wife and the mother of his children. He is to extend lifelong care and concern for his children, and their children. The plea of David for his rebel son is one of the most moving in all of the scriptures, “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/2-sam/18.33" class="scriptureRef">2 Sam. 18:33</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p10" pid="VovLsV9S8kCCuHydWiasgw" hash="KIGymQ">I urge the husbands and fathers of this Church to be the kind of a man your wife would not want to be without. I urge the sisters of this Church to be patient, loving, and understanding with their husbands. Those who enter into marriage should be fully prepared to establish their marriage as the first priority in their lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p11" pid="1XlMmocyF06wA_mFFT6E0Q" hash="0zEbig">It is destructive to the feeling essential for a happy marriage for either party to say to the other marriage partner, “I don’t need you.” This is particularly so because the counsel of the Savior was and is to become one flesh: “For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh[.]</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p12" pid="-J1ahY9eJU2IrtHJyr1idg" hash="jt09eg">“Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 19:5–6</a>.) It is far more difficult to be of one heart and mind than to be physically one. This unity of heart and mind is manifest in sincere expressions of “I appreciate you” and “I am proud of you.” Such domestic harmony results from forgiving and forgetting, essential elements of a maturing marriage relationship. Someone has said that we should keep our eyes wide open before marriage and half shut afterward. (Magdeleine de Scudéry, as cited in <span class="emphasis">The International Dictionary of Thoughts,</span> Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969, p. 472). True charity ought to begin in marriage, for it is a relationship that must be rebuilt every day.</p>

Either partner who diminishes the divine role of the other in the presence of the children demeans the budding femininity within the daughters and the emerging manhood of the sons. I suppose there are always some honest differences between husband and wife, but let them be settled in private.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p14" pid="1K2zOeRNFUy2i9sdts-I9Q" hash="TSaHTA">The importance of this subject emboldens me to say a word about covenant breaking. It must be recognized that some marriages just fail. To those in that circumstance, I extend understanding because every divorce carries heartache with it. I hope what I say will not be disturbing. In my opinion, any promise between a man and a woman incident to a marriage ceremony rises to the dignity of a covenant. The family relationship of father, mother, and child is the oldest and most enduring institution in the world. It has survived vast differences of geography and culture. This is because marriage between man and woman is a natural state and is ordained of God. It is a moral imperative. Those marriages performed in our temples, meant to be eternal relationships, then, become the most sacred covenants we can make. The sealing power given by God through Elijah is thus invoked, and God becomes a party to the promises.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p15" pid="m74tNn-r7Ei3dCgD3stZHw" hash="hzRHUg">What, then, might be “just cause” for breaking the covenants of marriage? Over a lifetime of dealing with human problems, I have struggled to understand what might be considered “just cause” for breaking of covenants. I confess I do not claim the wisdom or authority to definitively state what is “just cause.” Only the parties to the marriage can determine this. They must bear the responsibility for the train of consequences which inevitably follow if these covenants are not honored. In my opinion, “just cause” should be nothing less serious than a prolonged and apparently irredeemable relationship which is destructive of a person’s dignity as a human being.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p16" pid="0VQSYi43nkCpdzvAkmR--Q" hash="pX2ziw">At the same time, I have strong feelings about what is not provocation for breaking the sacred covenants of marriage. Surely it is not simply “mental distress,” nor “personality differences,” nor having “grown apart,” nor having “fallen out of love.” This is especially so where there are children. Enduring divine counsel comes from Paul:</p>

It is for men, women, and children to honor and respect the divine roles of both fathers and mothers in the home. In so doing, mutual respect and appreciation among the members of the Church will be fostered by the righteousness found there. In this way, the great sealing keys restored by Elijah, spoken of by Malachi, might operate “to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 110:15</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 4:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p20" pid="DZqivkeQp0-a9PxtfUuleA" hash="S3dofg">President Joseph Fielding Smith stated concerning the keys of Elijah: “This sealing power bestowed upon Elijah, is the power which binds husbands and wives, and children to parents for time and eternity. It is the binding power existing in every Gospel ordinance. … It was the mission of Elijah to come, and restore it so that the curse of confusion and disorder would not exist in the kingdom of God.” (<span class="emphasis">Elijah the Prophet and His Mission,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1957, p. 5.) Confusion and disorder are all too common in society, but they must not be permitted to destroy our homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p21" pid="qNYE4o8Nq0OfN8ORHACX_Q" hash="LUXThg">Perhaps we regard the power bestowed by Elijah as something associated only with formal ordinances performed in sacred places. But these ordinances become dynamic and productive of good only as they reveal themselves in our daily lives. Malachi said that the power of Elijah would turn the <span class="emphasis">hearts</span> of the fathers and the children to each other. The heart is the seat of the emotions and a conduit for revelation. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/4.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 4:5–6</a>.) This sealing power thus reveals itself in family relationships, in attributes and virtues developed in a nurturing environment, and in loving service. These are the cords that bind families together, and the priesthood advances their development. In imperceptible but real ways, the “doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul [and thy home] as the dews from heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/father-come-home.p22" pid="IpRnc6LEYUi0PlB4EU4qMA" hash="UO38DA">I so testify that the blessings of the priesthood, honored by fathers and husbands and revered by wives and children, can indeed cure the cancer that plagues our society. I plead with you, Fathers, come home. Magnify your priesthood calling; bless your families through this sacred influence, and experience the rewards promised by our Father and God. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I fervently pray, not only for understanding, but also that I might not be misunderstood. I earnestly seek the support of the Holy Spirit and the understanding of my brethren. I affirm my love and profound respect for the brethren of the priesthood of this church. Soon you younger men and boys will be placed in the responsibility of spiritually guiding your homes and the Church. It is essential that you young men understand the importance of keeping the covenants and honoring the priesthood you bear.</p>

The object of God’s work is “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>). God has given the priesthood to man at various times since Adam’s day to bring about the great plan of salvation for all mankind. Through our faithfulness, the transcendent blessings of eternal life flow from this priesthood authority.</p>

We must be loyal to the leadership who have been called to preside over us and hold the keys of the priesthood. The words of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., still ring loudly in our ears: <span class="emphasis">“Brethren, let us be united.”</span> He explained:</p>

It requires the ability to put away selfishness, greed, ambition and all of the baser qualities of the human mind. You cannot be loyal unless you are willing to surrender. … His own preferences and desires must be put away, and he must see only the great purpose which lies out ahead” (<span class="emphasis">Immortality and Eternal Life</span> Melchizedek Priesthood Course of Study, 1968–69, p. 163).</p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith said of the priesthood: “It is the eternal authority of God by which the universe was created and governed, and the stars in heaven came into existence, by which the great authority of exaltation operates throughout the universe.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/keeping-covenants-and-honoring-the-priesthood.p6" pid="4SUU2Px85UyyvsOwjZZzBw" hash="xquakg">The Prophet Joseph further taught: “Its institution was prior to ‘the foundation of this earth, or the morning stars sang together, or the Sons of God shouted for joy,’ and is the highest and holiest Priesthood, and is after the order of the Son of God” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 167). There is no question that the power of the priesthood exceeds our understanding. The Prophet Joseph taught of this great power “that every one being ordained after this order and calling should have power, by faith, to break mountains, to divide the seas, to dry up waters, to turn them out of their course;</p>

The priesthood is not, however, a floating essence. It must be conferred by ordination with specific offices. It is held by men under sacred duty to use its authority to accomplish God’s work for the blessing of men, women, and children alike. No one can claim priesthood authority except it is conferred openly by those possessing the authority, “and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:11</a>). The exercise of priesthood authority is directed by the keys of the priesthood. These keys rest with the presiding local and General Authorities of the Church. Those who have the keys are responsible for the guiding momentum and direction of the work of the Lord on the earth. Clearly, as Alma states, the shepherds of the Church are responsible for protecting the flock:</p>

Bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, and others who have the responsibility of keeping the Church pure must perform this labor in a spirit of love and kindness. It should not be done in a spirit of punishment, but rather of helping. However, it is of no kindness to a brother or sister in transgression for their presiding officers to look the other way. Some words on this subject come from President John Taylor:</p>

Do you hear it, you Bishops and you Presidents? God will require it at your hands.

The decisions of the leaders and quorums of the priesthood should follow the pattern of the presiding quorums. “The decisions of these quorums … are to be made in all righteousness, in holiness, and lowliness of heart, meekness and long suffering, and in faith, and virtue, and knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness and charity” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:30</a>).</p>

The Savior gave us this solemn warning: “Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:27</a>). The Lord made it clear that in the presiding quorums every decision “must be by the unanimous voice of the same; that is, every member in each quorum must be agreed to its decisions” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:27</a>). This means that after frank and open discussion decisions are reached in council under the direction of the presiding officer, who has the ultimate authority to decide. That decision is then sustained, because our unity comes from full agreement with righteous principles and general response to the operation of the Spirit of God.</p>

Those Councils are more in tune with the Lord than any individual persons they preside over, and the individual members of the Councils are generally guided by those Councils. In this church, where we have lay leadership, it is inevitable that some will be placed in authority over us who have a different background from our own. This does not mean that those with other honorable vocational or professional qualifications are any less entitled to the spirit of their office than any other. Some of the great bishops of my lifetime included a brickmason, a grocer, a farmer, a dairyman, and one who ran an ice cream business. What any may have lacked in formal education was insignificant. They were humble men, and because they were humble, they were taught and magnified by the Holy Spirit. Without exception, they were greatly strengthened as they learned to labor diligently to fulfill their callings, and to minister to the Saints they were called to preside over. So it is with all of the callings in the Church. President Monson teaches us, “Whom the Lord calls, the Lord qualifies” (Thomas S. Monson, <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1988, p. 43).</p>

The contributions of the sisters as we move into the future are needed more than ever to help establish the values, the faith, and the future of our families, and the well-being of our society.

The Lord values his daughters just as much as he does his sons. In marriage, neither is superior; each has a different primary and divine responsibility. Chief among these different responsibilities for wives is the calling of motherhood.

Kimball stated: “To be a righteous woman during the winding up scenes on this earth, before the second coming of our Savior, is an especially noble calling. … Other institutions in society may falter, and even fail, but the righteous woman can help to save the home, which may be the last and only sanctuary some mortals know in the midst of storm and strife” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1978, p. 103).</p>

Any attempt to use it in the home as a club to abuse or enforce unrighteous dominion is a complete contradiction of that authority and results in its loss. As a holder of the priesthood, the father holds a primary responsibility to claim spiritual and temporal blessings from the Lord for himself, his wife, his family, but these blessings can only be claimed in righteousness as he honors his priesthood. We are taught by the Lord that “no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:41</a>). In my opinion, there are few words in the holy scriptures of greater significance than the beautiful language contained in the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants as to how the priesthood is to be exercised:</p>

The limit comes in you if you do not live in harmony with the Spirit of the Lord and you limit yourselves in the power you exert” (<span class="emphasis">The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982, p. 498). President Kimball further stated: “One breaks the priesthood covenant by transgressing commandments—but also by leaving undone his duties.

We are told that the transcendent obligations of priesthood holders are “to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life,” and to bear “testimony to all the world,” and teach the world of the “judgment which is to come” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.43,61,87" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:43, 61, 87</a>). Then there is this marvelous promise, if we are faithful in our priesthood responsibilities: we shall be “sanctified by the Spirit,” and become “the elect of God,” and all that the “Father hath shall be given unto him” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.33,34,38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:33, 34, 38</a>). How much more important it is to receive “all that [the] Father hath” than to seek or receive anything else which this life offers.</p>

Condie and I were in the Salt Lake airport, we unexpectedly met a devoted and faithful couple who have been friends for long years. This couple has spent a lifetime of service, meekly, faithfully, and effectively trying to build up the Church in many places in the world. Elder Condie noted, “Isn’t it remarkable what people with five loaves and two fishes do to build up the kingdom of God.” This kind of quiet, devoted service to me is surely a fulfillment of the word of God “that the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:23</a>). Today I would like to speak of those of us who have only talents equal to five loaves and two fishes to offer the Savior to help feed the multitudes.</p>

I refer to the marvels of modern transportation and the increasing sophistication of all scientific knowledge, including the new electronic highway. We have forgotten that this amazing knowledge comes to mankind only as God chooses to reveal it, and it should be used for purposes nobler and wiser than mere entertainment. This knowledge permits the words of the prophets of God to be bounced off satellites hovering over the earth so it is possible for much of mankind to hear their messages.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p12" pid="yDkeAtydi0y_25i88ageyA" hash="YcrF3A">With this great knowledge has come also some skepticism about the simple and profound eternal truths taught in the miracle of the loaves and of the fishes—namely, that God rules in the heavens and the earth through his infinite intelligence and goodness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p13" pid="Z6780PZRf0W6g2lX1A8dtA" hash="Oie0Eg">We are also to understand and remember that we too, like the lad in the New Testament account, are the spirit children of our Heavenly Father, that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior, and the Redeemer of the world. We believe that in the centuries following the establishment of his kingdom upon the earth, the doctrines and the ordinances were changed, resulting in a falling away and the loss of the keys of priesthood authority from the earth. A miracle even greater than that of the loaves and the fishes was the vision of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who saw the Father and the Son in the Sacred Grove near Palmyra, New York. Subsequently the keys, the priesthood, and the saving ordinances were restored in their fulness, and Christ’s church was reestablished in our time. Thus God has again “fed” us and filled our “baskets” to overflowing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p14" pid="qMmDK9LukU-FvtzpdOHjKw" hash="O8A0Mg">It has been said that this church does not necessarily attract great people but more often makes ordinary people great. Many nameless people with gifts equal only to five loaves and two small fishes magnify their callings and serve without attention or recognition, feeding literally thousands. In large measure, they make possible the fulfillment of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream that the latter-day gospel of Christ would be like a stone cut out of the mountains without hands, rolling forth until it fills the whole earth (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/2.34-35" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 2:34–35</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 65:2</a>). These are the hundreds of thousands of leaders and teachers in all of the auxiliaries and priesthood quorums, the home teachers, the Relief Society visiting teachers. These are the many humble bishops in the Church, some without formal training but greatly magnified, always learning, with a humble desire to serve the Lord and the people of their wards.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p15" pid="wa-_8wv6ZUWqAyxIJOqu9g" hash="0ZCR7A">Any man or woman who enjoys the Master’s touch is like potter’s clay in his hands. More important than acquiring fame or fortune is being what God wants us to be. Before we came to this earth, we may have been fashioned to do some small good in this life that no one else can do. The Lord said to Jeremiah, “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/1.5" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 1:5</a>). If God has a work for those with many talents, I believe he also has an important work for those of us who have few.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p16" pid="Fbt_of6yjEeyWuVGnVAZhA" hash="mLzyTA">What is the central characteristic of those having only five loaves and two fishes? What makes it possible, under the Master’s touch, for them to serve, lift, and bless so that they touch for good the lives of hundreds, even thousands? After a lifetime of dealing in the affairs of men and women, I believe it is the ability to overcome personal ego and pride—both are enemies to the full enjoyment of the Spirit of God and walking humbly before him. The ego interferes with husbands and wives asking each other for forgiveness. It prevents the enjoyment of the full sweetness of a higher love. The ego often prevents parents and children from fully understanding each other. The ego enlarges our feelings of self-importance and worth. It blinds us to reality. Pride keeps us from confessing our sins and shortcomings to the Lord and working out our repentance.</p>

They do much of the hard, menial, unchallenging, poorly compensated work of the world. Life may not have been quite fair to them. They struggle to have enough to hold body and soul together. But they are not forgotten. If their talents are used to build the kingdom of God and serve others, they will fully enjoy the promises of the Savior. The great promise of the Savior is that they “shall receive [their] reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:23</a>). The one who had only two talents was able to say, “Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.” Thus said the Lord, “Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter … into the joy of thy lord” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.22-23" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:22–23</a>).</p>

They have so very much that they can contribute, but some become less than they might. They do not reach their potential of service, perhaps because they take so much pride in what they think they know and what they have. They seem unwilling or unable to yield “to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, … and [become] as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [them], even as a child doth submit to his father” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</p>

They have often pointed to the alleged disaffection of the youth of the Church. The lives and the dedication of our almost 50,000 young missionaries are testament enough of the faithfulness of many of our youth. In addition, during my lifetime, the Church has grown from 525,000 to about 8,500,000. I believe and testify that this is because of the restoration of the fulness of the keys and authority of the gospel of Christ to Joseph Smith.</p>

By this I suppose he meant that the moorings of the Church were being shaken by a very few who do not fully sustain the leaders of the Church or keep their covenants. To dispel this perception of cracks in our members’ faith, we need only to observe the joyful people who worship in any of our forty-five temples worldwide. Many are couples clutching their little bags and holding hands, and many are the unmarried, seeking the peaceful blessings of the house of the Lord. Their countenances reflect much joy and satisfaction in their lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/five-loaves-and-two-fishes.p21" pid="8x9IUfjZyUW7kxMK0T9fbw" hash="DASCPg">A major reason this church has grown from its humble beginnings to its current strength is the faithfulness and devotion of millions of humble and devoted people who have only five loaves and two small fishes to offer in the service of the Master. They have largely surrendered their own interests, and in so doing have found “the peace of God, which passeth all understanding” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.7" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 4:7</a>). I wish only to be one of those who experience this supernal inner peace.</p>

They are parents of Jeralee and their other five children. Jeff works on a building maintenance team that cares for some of our chapels in Pocatello, Idaho. Joyce is a mother and homemaker. One day last July, their daughter Jeralee, age eleven, was going door to door collecting money for her newspaper route. Jeralee never returned home—not that day, nor the next day, nor the next, nor ever.</p>

Other churches sent support and food for the searchers. It was learned that Jeralee had been abducted and brutally murdered by an evil man. When her body was found, the whole city was horrified and shocked. All segments of the community reached out to Joyce and Jeff in love and sympathy. Some became angry and wanted to take vengeance.</p>

Joyce said, “I know our Heavenly Father has heard and answered our prayers, and he has brought our daughter back to us.” Jeff said, “We no longer have doubt about where she is.” Joyce continued, “I have learned a lot about love this week, and I also know there is a lot of hate. I have looked at the love and want to feel that love, and not the hate. We can forgive.”</p>

Christensen and I, representing the General Authorities, were among the thousands privileged to attend Jeralee’s funeral service. The Holy Spirit blessed that gathering in a remarkable way and spoke peace to the souls of all who attended. Later, President Kert W. Howard, Jeralee’s stake president, wrote, “The Underwoods have received letters from people both in and out of the Church stating that they prayed for Jeralee, and they hadn’t prayed in years, and because of this, they had a renewed desire to return to the Church.” President Howard continued, “We will never know the extent of activation and rededication this single event has caused. Who knows the far-reaching effects Jeralee’s life will have for generations untold.” Many have come into the Church because they wanted to know what kind of a religion could give the Underwoods their spiritual strength.</p>

The enchanting smells of the open containers of spices and the sounds of men selling their wares were exhilarating. As we entered St. Saviour’s Monastery, looking for the door, we entered into old passageways surrounded by stone walls. We were told that some parts of the walls went back to the time of the Crusaders. On one wall hung an assortment of ancient rusted keys. Some of these keys were huge. All were larger than the keys we use today. Many of them were very ornate. Many of the doors the keys were made to open no longer exist, or if they do, the keys and the locks would be too rusty to open them.</p>

The keys I speak of never rust. These are the keys of life and salvation in the kingdom of God.

We reached out our hands, but neither of us was able to speak a word. … After we had done weeping we began to converse. … In the course of the conversation, he [Brigham Young] smote his hand upon his thigh and said, ‘Thank God, the keys of the kingdom are here.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Said Brigham Young to the Saints in meeting assembled, “If the people want President Rigdon to lead them they may have him; but I say unto you that the Quorum of the Twelve have the keys of the kingdom of God in all the world.” He continued: “I know where the keys of the kingdom are, and where they will eternally be.

President Hunter thus became the President and legal administrator of the Church, and the only man authorized to dispense, oversee, and exercise all of the keys of the kingdom of God on earth. He also became the successor to the keys held by Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, Heber J. Grant, George Albert Smith, David O.

He and his two companions stood on a bold projecting rock, where he proclaimed that Joseph Smith had seen the Father and the Son and had restored the gospel in its fulness and completeness. He testified that the keys of the holy Apostleship had been restored. He further testified that there were indeed living Apostles and prophets upon the earth.

We totally sustain and uphold President Howard W. Hunter, President Gordon B. Hinckley, and President Thomas S. Monson as the First Presidency. This feeling of complete unity and support for the First Presidency was expressed last Thursday in the Salt Lake Temple in a proclamation by President Boyd K. Packer on behalf of the Twelve. This was joined in by President Rex D. Pinegar, representing the Seventies, and Bishop Merrill J. Bateman for the Presiding Bishopric. All of the General Authorities then voted to fully sustain the expressions of President Packer of full support for the First Presidency and for each other. In this unity, the gates of hell will not prevail against us. I so testify and witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Elder Bruce R.

The Lord holds his shepherds accountable for the safety [meaning the salvation] of his sheep.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> The bearers of the priesthood have this great responsibility, whether it is father, grandfather, home teacher, elders quorum president, bishop, stake president, or other Church calling.</p>

When I was a very small boy, my father found a lamb all alone out in the desert. The herd of sheep to which its mother belonged had moved on, and somehow the lamb got separated from its mother, and the shepherd must not have known that it was lost. Because it could not survive alone in the desert, my father picked it up and brought it home. To have left the lamb there would have meant certain death, either by falling prey to the coyotes or by starvation because it was so young that it still needed milk. Some sheepmen call these lambs “bummers.” My father gave the lamb to me and I became its shepherd.</p>

We became fast friends. I called him Nigh—why I don’t remember. It began to grow. My lamb and I would play on the lawn. Sometimes we would lie together on the grass and I would lay my head on its soft, woolly side and look up at the blue sky and the white billowing clouds. I did not lock my lamb up during the day. It would not run away. It soon learned to eat grass. I could call my lamb from anywhere in the yard by just imitating as best I could the bleating sound of a sheep: <span class="emphasis">Baa.

I knew that I should help my pet, but I wanted to stay safe, warm, and dry in my bed. I didn’t get up as I should have done. The next morning I went out to find my lamb dead. A dog had also heard its bleating cry and killed it. My heart was broken. I had not been a good shepherd or steward of that which my father had entrusted to me. My father said, “Son, couldn’t I trust you to take care of just one lamb?” My father’s remark hurt me more than losing my woolly friend. I resolved that day, as a little boy, that I would try never again to neglect my stewardship as a shepherd if I were ever placed in that position again.</p>

There were times when it was so cold or stormy and I wanted to stay home and be comfortable, but in my mind’s ear I could hear my little lamb bleating, and I knew I needed to be a good shepherd and go with my senior companion. In all those many years, whenever I have had a desire to shirk my duties, there would come to me a remembrance of how sorry I was that night so many years ago when I had not been a good shepherd. I have not always done everything I should have, but I have tried.</p>

We ask you to look beyond any irritations or inconvenience in Church administration. We ask you to focus and concentrate on the simple, sublime, spiritually nourishing, and saving principles of the gospel. We ask you to stand steady. We ask you to be faithful in your stewardships as the shepherding priesthood authority of the Church. Let us be true to our callings and the holy priesthood we bear.

I don’t think that even my mother ever dreamed that her son would sit in these chairs. As I explained last night in general priesthood meeting, my long association with President Gordon B. Hinckley has blessed me over most of my adult life. As you know, he is a man of remarkable gifts and talents. All these long years he has been teaching, guiding, and blessing all of us. Over the years we have seen him grow in strength as the Lord has time and time again called and magnified him. He has had increasingly burdensome responsibilities in many callings, including as a counselor to three Presidents of the Church. He has magnified each calling he has received with great inspiration, intelligence, and energy in a remarkable way. His ministry has blessed the work of God throughout the world.</p>

Monson ever since he was the newest Apostle. President Monson has been blessed with a great mind and capacity. He has always been an outstanding leader as a boy and a man. Great responsibilities came upon him very early in life to school him. He is a man of great, simple faith. His outgoing and caring heart has blessed the people of this church tremendously over the many years of his ministry.</p>

I hope we can all overcome any differences of culture, race, and language. Since the early days of the Church, the General Authorities and missionaries have traveled over much of the earth to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and to establish the Church with keys and authority in many lands. An impressive and enjoyable part of our ministry has been to worship with the wonderful people of many cultures and ethnic groups. It has been soul satisfying to feel of their spiritual strength and their love and to love them in return.</p>

In some of these countries a large percentage of the population is poor. Many of them have much less opportunity than others to acquire the comforts of life and even some of the necessities. We have seen men and women working to exhaustion from sunrise to sundown for a pittance. Yet their ready smiles and cheerful countenances indicated that they had found some happiness with their lot in life.</p>

But we have also seen the generosity of members of this church who have great concern for those worldwide who lack the necessities of life. They generously contribute to help the poor in many countries, even though we have no members there. Humanitarian help has been given in 114 countries since 1985.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

In my experience, no race or class seems superior to any other in spirituality and faithfulness.

These needs are self-esteem, peace of mind, and personal contentment. I believe these are needs of God’s children everywhere. How can these needs be satisfied? I suggest that behind each of these is the requirement to establish one’s own personal identity as the offspring of God. All three needs, regardless of ethnic background, culture, or country, can be met if we look to the divinity that is within us. As the Savior himself has said, “And the Spirit giveth light to every man [and woman] that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man [and woman] through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

At sometime in his life, every man is conscious of a desire to come in touch with the Infinite. His spirit reaches out for God. This sense of feeling is universal, and all men ought to be, in deepest truth, engaged in the same great work—the search for and the development of spiritual peace and freedom.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

What can we give that no one else can? What can justify the great expenditure of effort, time, and means to “go … into all the world,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> as the Savior commanded. We cannot change the economy of countries. We do not seek to change governments. The answer is simple. We can offer the hope promised by the Savior: “Peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Lives are changed as the servants of God teach God’s children everywhere to accept and keep the commandments of God. Anyone, regardless of culture or economic circumstance, can go to the depths of his spiritual wells and drink of that water. He who partakes of this water, as the Savior said, “shall never thirst; but … shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> The basic needs of mankind identified by Dr. Wirthlin—self-esteem, peace of mind, and personal contentment—can be fully satisfied by faithful obedience to the commandments of God.

We become heirs to the kingdom of God, having joined the body of Christ and spiritually set aside some of our personal differences to unite in a greater spiritual cause. We say to all who have joined the Church, keep all that is noble, good, and uplifting in your culture and personal identity. However, under the authority and power of the keys of the priesthood, all differences yield as we seek to become heirs to the kingdom of God, unite in following those who have the keys of the priesthood, and seek the divinity within us. All are welcomed and appreciated. But there is only one celestial kingdom of God.</p>

For instance, the baptismal prayer and baptism by immersion in water are the same all over the world. The sacramental prayers are the same everywhere. We sing the same hymns in praise to God in every country.</p>

Honesty and integrity are taught and expected everywhere. Chastity before marriage and absolute fidelity to wife or husband after marriage are required of members of the Church everywhere. Members who violate these high standards of moral conduct place their Church membership in question anywhere in the world.</p>

Where a temple is available, priesthood authority gives no greater or lesser blessings in one place than another. Temple worship is a perfect example of our unity as Church members. All of us answer the same questions of worthiness to enter the temple. All the men dress alike. All the women dress alike. We leave the cares of the world behind us as we enter the temple. Everyone receives the same blessings. All make the same covenants. All are equal before the Lord. Yet within our spiritual unity there is wide room for everyone’s individuality and expression. In that setting, all are heirs to the kingdom of God. President Hunter said it well, “The key to a unified church is a unified soul, one that is at peace with itself and not given to inner conflicts and tensions.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

Many years ago we went to Manaus, Brazil, a city far upstream on the Amazon River, surrounded by jungle, to meet with the missionaries and the handful of Saints who were then in that area. We met in a very humble home with no glass panes in the windows. The weather was excessively hot. The children sat on the floor. The mission president, President Helio da Rocha Camargo, conducted the meeting and called on a faithful brother to give the opening prayer. The humble man responded, “I will be happy to pray, but may I also bear my testimony?” A sister was asked to lead the singing. She responded, “I would love to lead the singing, but please let me also bear my testimony.”</p>

All felt impelled to bear their profound witness of the Savior and his mission and of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. All who were there reached deep down in their souls to their spiritual taproots, remembering the Savior’s words that “where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> This they did more as heirs to the kingdom of God than as Brazilian members of the Church.</p>

Having everyone hear the gospel in their own tongue requires great effort and resources. The Spirit, however, is a higher form of communication than language. We have been in many meetings where the words were completely unintelligible, but the Spirit bore powerful witness of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. Even with language differences, hopefully no minority group would ever feel so unwelcome in the “body of Christ”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> that they would wish to worship exclusively in their own ethnic culture. We hope that those in any dominant culture would reach out to them in the brotherhood and sisterhood of the gospel so that we can establish fully a community of Saints where everyone will feel needed and wanted.</p>

Each of us, regardless of our nationality, needs to reach down into the innermost recesses of our souls to find the divinity that is deep within us and to earnestly petition the Lord for an endowment of special wisdom and inspiration. Only when we so profoundly reach the depths of our beings can we discover our true identity, our self-worth, and our purpose in life. Only as we seek to be purged of selfishness and of concern for recognition and wealth can we find some sweet relief from the anxieties, hurts, pains, miseries, and concerns of this world. In this manner, as President J. Reuben Clark said, we can bring “to flower and fruitage the latent richness of the spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> God can not only help us find a sublime and everlasting joy and contentment, but He will change us so that we can become heirs of the kingdom of God.</p>

We have the authority in our beings to respond to challenges of life any way we choose. Thus we gain mastery in any circumstance.

I know of his reality by a sure perception so sacred I cannot give utterance to it. I know and testify with an absolute awareness that Joseph Smith restored the keys of the fulness of times and that every President of the Church has held these keys, as does President Gordon B. Hinckley today, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

This evening I wish to speak primarily to the splendid young men of the Aaronic Priesthood. I do so because I recognize that the future of the Church and even the world depends upon how you young men regard and honor your priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/acting-for-ourselves-and-not-being-acted-upon.p2" pid="VzmUfPi8f06oB6HDSh2Dqw" hash="BSwrYg">Recently I asked some special young people what I should know about your generation. One young man spoke for the group and said, “We live on the edge.” Since that time I have thought a lot about what it means to live on the edge. Of course it can mean many things. I think my fine young friend was referring to hazardous motorcycling, cliff climbing, and other forms of recreation which may involve taking unnecessary risks to produce a challenge or a thrill.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/acting-for-ourselves-and-not-being-acted-upon.p3" pid="uEEwkBdNCkyft4FKqJWGVQ" hash="3iHquw">Some years ago Elder Marion D. Hanks told about a group of Boy Scouts who went cave exploring. The narrow trail was marked with white stones and lighted in sections as they went. After about an hour they came to a huge, high dome. Below it lay an area called the Bottomless Pit, so called because the floor of the cave had collapsed into a deep, gaping hole. It was hard not to jostle each other on that narrow path. Pretty soon, one of the bigger boys accidentally pushed a smaller boy into a muddy area away from the light. Terrified as he lost his footing, he screamed in the darkness. The ranger heard his cry of terror and came quickly. The boy let out another cry as the beam of the ranger’s light showed that he was right on the very edge of the pit.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

But this does not always happen. So many times young people are enticed to go to the very edge or even beyond it. With only a precarious toehold, it is easy to be seriously injured or even die. Life is too precious to throw away in the name of excitement, or, as Jacob said in the Book of Mormon, “looking beyond the mark.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

In a few years you will learn that this is not so. Living on the edge can also mean being perilously close to the Bottomless Pit. Of even more danger is to put your souls at risk by dabbling in drugs or other mind-abusing substances to “get a buzz.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/acting-for-ourselves-and-not-being-acted-upon.p6" pid="Fd1phh0eMkea2MXLsDGVHQ" hash="jxPMaw">Some of you may think that you will discover your strengths and abilities by living on the edge. Perhaps you also think it is a way to find your identity or manliness. Your identity, however, cannot be found from thrill seeking, such as intentionally and unnecessarily exposing your life or your soul to any kind of danger, physical or moral. There will always be enough risks that will come to you naturally without your having to seek them out. Your strength and identity will come from honoring your priesthood, developing your talents, and serving the Lord. Each of you will have to work very hard to qualify for your eternal potential. It will not be easy. Finding your true identity will tax your ability far beyond climbing a dangerous cliff or speeding in a car or on a motorcycle. It will require all of your strength, stamina, intelligence, and courage.</p>

Lee called me to be a member of a bishopric. He said, “From now on, you must not only avoid evil, but also the appearance of evil.” He did not interpret that counsel. That was left to my conscience.</p>

Each of us must take the responsibility for the moral decisions we make in life about how close we live to the edge. Lehi states: “And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Being acted upon means somebody else is pulling the strings.</p>

When I was a young lawyer, I was appointed by the judges to defend persons who were charged with infractions of the law. One time I was assigned to represent a young man. As we approached the bench, the venerable old federal judge looked down at both of us and asked, “Which one of you is the accused?” From these experiences, I learned that some individuals did not think they were responsible or guilty in any way even though they had violated a law. They felt they were not to be blamed. They had abdicated their consciences. They may have committed the wrongful act, but they felt it was really their parents’ fault because they were not properly taught, or it was society’s fault because they were never given a chance in life. So often they had some reason or excuse for blaming their actions on someone or something else rather than accepting the responsibility for their own actions. They did not act for themselves but were acted upon.</p>

Upon receiving a liver transplant in an effort to save his life, he made an amazing statement. He said, “Don’t use me for a role model.” He also said that he was committing the rest of his life to being a better example. Mickey Mantle finally accepted the responsibility for his mistakes. Unfortunately he died shortly thereafter. In World War II, many of us went through officers’ training. We were taught that the only appropriate answer when we made a life-threatening mistake was, “No excuse, sir.”</p>

When President Joseph F. Smith was a young man, he was faced with this predicament:</p>

He put the gun away, shook Joseph’s hand, and said, ‘Well, you are the pleasantest man I ever met! I’m glad to see a fellow stand up for his convictions.’ He jumped back on his horse and rode off with his companions.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Smith, the danger you young men face is not so much physical; but rather it is the danger of being personally deceived and misled. This danger is, in some ways, more subtle and difficult and requires more strength and courage than facing physical danger.</p>

Occasionally our well-meaning young people want every detail of appropriate and inappropriate conduct to be specified, perhaps so they can feel comfortable in getting closer to the edge. They sometimes seem more concerned with what the gospel prohibits than what it gives. For instance, some young adults were surprised when they learned that it was inappropriate for mixed young single adult groups to be involved together in overnight activities. They said, “Why hasn’t the prophet told us?” The Church counsel in this matter has been clear for many years. It should not have been necessary to tell these young people to avoid the appearance of evil. My strong advice is, if there is any question about your personal conduct, don’t do it. It is the responsibility of prophets to teach the word of God—not to spell out every jot and tittle of human behavior. Our moral agency requires us to know good from evil and choose the good. If we are trying to avoid not only evil, but the very appearance of evil, we will act for ourselves and not be acted upon.</p>

You young, single men who hold the priesthood and are dating the splendid young ladies of the Church have a duty to do everything you can to protect their physical safety and virtue. The priesthood you hold gives you the greater responsibility to see that the high moral standards of the Church are always maintained. The Lord knows that you know better than to approach the edge of sexual enticement. You will lose part of that which is sacred about you if you go beyond the edge and abuse the great powers of procreation. Each of us is accountable for his own actions. How can any of us hope to play a great role in time or eternity if we have no power of self-control?</p>

To ease their consciences, some vainly wait for the Church to “get modern,” “to wake up,” or “to get with the times.” That internal emptiness can be filled only by making our relationship with “God the center of our being,” as President David O. McKay taught.</p>

You may wonder how this can be. You may feel that there is nothing special or superior about you or your ability. Perhaps you feel, or have been told, that you are stupid.

I earnestly entreat your faith and prayers as I address a most important and holy subject: the divine, magnifying, and strengthening power that can come to us through priesthood blessings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p2" pid="Zt_GElJEQkGymBi9bZVVMg" hash="FeuyuA">A priesthood blessing is sacred. It can be a holy and inspired statement of our wants and needs. If we are in tune spiritually, we can receive a confirming witness of the truth of the promised blessings. Priesthood blessings can help us in the small and great decisions of our lives. If, through our priesthood blessings, we could perceive only a small part of the person God intends us to be, we would lose our fear and never doubt again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p3" pid="gq92wJ4hHEagnuctuWIJzw" hash="47R8hg">As a small boy, I remember being intrigued by my grandmother’s magnifying glass, which she used in her old age to read and do needlework. When the glass was in focus, everything I looked at was greatly magnified. But I was most intrigued by what happened when the lens concentrated the sunlight on an object. When it passed through the magnifying glass, the sunlight’s power was absolutely amazing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p4" pid="SsYoXKmYBUafqvulQM90wQ" hash="VDCz_w">This great magnifying effect can be compared to a profound blessing that came to Jacob, who wrestled most of the night for a blessing:</p>

As the Lord said in the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p12" pid="4EjVuQYqBEW7dvdCBftK_g" hash="sGf5MA">Unlike Jacob, we do not need to wrestle physically much of the night for blessings to strengthen and magnify us. In the Church, blessings are available to all who are worthy through those authorized and even appointed to give priesthood blessings. Stake presidents, bishops, quorum presidents, and home teachers are authorized to give blessings. Worthy fathers and grandfathers, as well as other Melchizedek Priesthood holders, may give blessings to members in times of sickness and when important events occur. Such individual blessings are part of the continuous revelation that we claim as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p13" pid="oSq-n61pW0e-oCia5RwXng" hash="pV0nzQ">Elder John A. Widtsoe stated, “Every father, having children born to him under the covenant, is to them as a patriarch, and he has the right to bless his posterity in the authority of the Priesthood which he holds.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p14" pid="kkaOGwgo2kmYxsOJYJnjXw" hash="hgpuZw">We know that the gospel always has and always will operate through families. Since early biblical times, order has been brought into the house of Israel through family units. The family unit had inherently and internally the natural love and concern and the blood ties to bring a governing peace and stability to the peoples of God. The same is true today for essentially the same reasons. No other unit of society is an effective substitute for the ties of love and affection inherent in families. The natural leaders of the family unit are the parents, standing side by side as equals in their loving guidance of their children. Each parent brings a separate enriching influence. The power of the priesthood should be the dominant influence in family affairs. Priesthood blessings do not just involve men. They bless equally and fully the women and children of the family. Whatever diminishes family order is destructive to the family unit and to society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p15" pid="QsJyzXmSqkWCoXu4JhXnbw" hash="a9zWxQ">We are most fortunate some men are specifically ordained and authorized by their priesthood office and calling to give blessings and declare our lineage in the house of Israel. The inspired declaration of lineage is an integral part of the blessing. I pay honor and tribute to the noble, faithful men who are our ordained patriarchs. They have not sought this heavy and lonely responsibility. They are often among the most humble and devoted of our brethren. These chosen men live worthy of the inspiration of heaven. Patriarchs are privileged to bestow blessings, for they are entitled to speak authoritatively under the inspiration of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p16" pid="cDl7sMOFKUerPzyg_HV6Yw" hash="14syJA">The office of patriarch is an office of the Melchizedek Priesthood. It is one of blessing, not of administration. It is a sacred and spiritual revelatory calling which usually continues for much of the patriarch’s life. Our patriarchs devote themselves fully to their callings and do all they can to live in faith and worthiness so that each blessing is inspired. The patriarch’s calling becomes a beautiful, sacred, spiritual, and fulfilling experience. As moved upon by the Holy Spirit, the patriarch declares by inspiration the lineage in the house of Israel of the recipient, together with such blessings, spiritual gifts, promises, advice, admonition, and warnings the patriarch feels inspired to give. The patriarchal blessing is, in essence, a prophetic blessing and utterance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p17" pid="_Qth3Li6wkGYmxcKegMi1g" hash="QJtGUQ">A patriarchal blessing from an ordained patriarch can give us a star to follow, which is a personal revelation from God to each individual. If we follow this star, we are less likely to stumble and be misled. Our patriarchal blessing will be an anchor to our souls, and if we are worthy, neither death nor the devil can deprive us of the blessings pronounced. They are blessings we can enjoy now and forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p18" pid="1D-jjNfW3k6OJQCTS_-mpQ" hash="nhhTag">As with many other blessings, patriarchal blessings should ordinarily be requested by the one desiring the blessing. Responsibility for receiving a patriarchal blessing rests primarily on the individual when he or she has sufficient understanding of the significance of a patriarchal blessing. I encourage all members of the Church having this maturity to become worthy and obtain their blessings. By their very nature, all blessings are conditional on worthiness, regardless of whether the blessing specifically spells out the qualifications. The patriarchal blessing is primarily a guide to the future, not an index to the past. Therefore, it is important that the recipient be young enough that many of the significant events of life are in the future. I recently heard of a person over ninety years of age who received his patriarchal blessing. It would be interesting to read that blessing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p19" pid="Jy2HAXyLBECSqj33u7iPAw" hash="tN0_tA">The patriarch has no blessing of his own to give. We heard Elder LeGrand Richards tell of a patriarch who once said to a woman, “I have a wonderful blessing for you.” But when the patriarch laid his hands on the head of the recipient, his mind went completely blank. He apologized. “I was mistaken. I do not have a blessing for you. It is the Lord who has the blessing for you.” The woman came back the next day, and after the patriarch had prayerfully importuned the Lord, a blessing came that mentioned many concerns known only to this good sister. All blessings come from God. Our Heavenly Father knows His children. He knows their strengths and weaknesses. He knows their capabilities and potential. Our patriarchal blessings indicate what He expects of us and what our potential can be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p20" pid="EKwkckqcEUaGBNe7d8c9Qg" hash="5JKOxA">Patriarchal blessings should be read humbly, prayerfully, and frequently. A patriarchal blessing is very sacred and personal, but it may be shared with close family members. It is a sacred guideline of counsel, promises, and information from the Lord; however, a person should not expect the blessing to detail all that will happen to him or her or to answer all questions. The fact that one’s patriarchal blessing may not mention an important event in life, such as a mission or marriage, does not mean that it will not happen. In order to receive the fulfillment of our patriarchal blessings, we should treasure in our hearts the precious words they contain, ponder them, and so live that we will obtain the blessings in mortality and a crown of righteousness in the hereafter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p21" pid="cFw0eJrzzEeO7bsX-CXWSA" hash="71konQ">My own blessing is short, and it is limited to perhaps three quarters of a page on one side, yet it has been completely adequate and perfect for me. I received my patriarchal blessing as I entered my early teenage years. The patriarch promised that my blessing would “be a comfort and a guide” to me throughout my life. As a boy I read it over and over again. I pondered each word. I prayed earnestly to understand fully the spiritual meaning. Having that blessing early in my life guided me through all of the significant events and challenges of my life. I did not fully understand the meaning of my blessing until I gained more maturity and experience. This blessing outlined some of the responsibilities I would have in the kingdom of God on earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p22" pid="68RaTN9axkm-AcRG54KLRQ" hash="MP40Kg">President Heber J. Grant told of the patriarchal blessing he received: “That patriarch put his hands upon my head and bestowed upon me a little blessing that would perhaps be about one-third of a typewritten page. That blessing foretold my life to the present moment.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p23" pid="weUOdAC6RU-c7JRh2sAUKw" hash="gqs7-g">Elder John A. Widtsoe said: “It should always be kept in mind that the realization of the promises made may come in this or the future life. Men have stumbled at times because promised blessings have not occurred in this life. They have failed to remember that, in the gospel, life with all its activities continues forever and that the labors of earth may be continued in heaven. Besides, the Giver of the blessings, the Lord, reserves the right to have them become active in our lives, as suits His divine purpose. We and our blessings are in the hands of the Lord. But, there is the general testimony that when the gospel law has been obeyed, the promised blessings have been realized.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p24" pid="Jw7qSbA1IU6PaZGHC4Ejzg" hash="gX8_2w">This was well illustrated in my father’s patriarchal blessing. He was told in his blessing that he would be blessed with “many beautiful daughters.” He and my mother became the parents of five sons. No daughters were born to them, but they treated the wives of their sons as daughters. Some years ago when we had a family gathering, I saw my father’s daughters-in-law, granddaughters, and great-granddaughters moving about, tending to the food and ministering to the young children and the elderly, and the realization came to me that Father’s blessing literally had been fulfilled. He has indeed many beautiful daughters. The patriarch who gave my father his blessing had spiritual vision to see beyond this life. The dividing line between time and eternity disappeared.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p25" pid="bhuEbiexSkKIgnWKznKuUA" hash="7xmGVA">The Church is expanding at a tremendous rate. We now have stakes of Zion in a great many countries of the world, and most stakes have at least one patriarch. This growth permits many people across the earth the privilege of receiving patriarchal blessings. As President Joseph Fielding Smith stated, “The great <span class="emphasis">majority</span> of those who become members of the Church are <span class="emphasis">literal descendants</span> of Abraham through Ephraim, son of Joseph.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> However, Manasseh, the other son of Joseph, as well as the other sons of Jacob, have many descendants in the Church. There may be some come into the Church in our day who are not of Jacob’s blood lineage. No one need assume that he or she will be denied any blessing by reason of not being of the blood lineage of Israel. The Lord told Abraham, “And I will bless them through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p26" pid="-_5_VJmgcUqj_u57xyqn2g" hash="8Dk1hA">Nephi tells us that “as many of the Gentiles as will repent are the covenant people of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Therefore it makes no difference if the blessings of the house of Israel come by lineage or by adoption.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p27" pid="u4jTIOmnP0SP3Zyored34A" hash="XkQt5Q">Some might be disturbed because members of the same family have blessings declaring them to be of a different lineage. A few families are of a mixed lineage. We believe that the house of Israel today constitutes a large measure of the human family. Because the tribes have intermixed one with another, one child may be declared to be from the tribe of Ephraim and another of the same family from Manasseh or one of the other tribes. The blessing of one tribe, therefore, may be dominant in one child, and the blessing of another tribe dominant in yet another child. So, children from the same parents could receive the blessings of different tribes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p28" pid="b6gG6zufV0mNFH6aVMFfkQ" hash="QUl7xg">One of the principal reasons for my speaking about this subject is that patriarchal blessings and other blessings testify of the divinity of Christ and the truthfulness of the Church. These sacred blessings also strengthen the lives of those worthy persons who receive such blessings. Thus, father’s blessings, patriarchal blessings, and other blessings are a remarkable privilege which can come to faithful members with sufficient maturity to understand the nature and importance of the blessings. These individualized priesthood blessings are a powerful witness of the love of the Lord Jesus Christ in seeking to bring exaltation to each of us. They are our personal revelation from God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p29" pid="Y3mPyhUubkGqMxgrKrc0ig" hash="BxEMsw">Our blessings can encourage us when we are discouraged, strengthen us when we are fearful, comfort us when we sorrow, give us courage when we are filled with anxiety, and lift us up when we are weak in spirit. Our testimonies can be strengthened every time we read our patriarchal blessings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p30" pid="qi2zuISTA0WEQHZZmALKKw" hash="y9Ls1g">Like the images in my grandmother’s magnifying glass, we can become stronger, our talents and ability can be magnified and multiplied, our understanding can be greatly enlarged, and our spirituality can flower. Moroni taught that “every good gift cometh of Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> But the Lord said, “What doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p31" pid="bBhfLhZosEWl8sUj4dIxoQ" hash="LSIp0A">I humbly and prayerfully urge any who for any reason may not have lived so as to realize a fulfillment of the priesthood blessings pronounced upon them to so order their lives as to reclaim those blessings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p32" pid="gqZ2DXBUekGh5DNxsN0tOQ" hash="vTOk_w">I charge the faithful members of this church to seek to understand the full significance of your blessings. Gifts may have been bestowed upon you of which you are unaware. These gifts can be of both a profoundly spiritual and temporal nature. I pray that we may all receive our gifts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/priesthood-blessings.p33" pid="n_W8Z9OlikK4V_ro57rBGA" hash="PVU7wg">In so doing, our understanding, our faith, and our testimony in the Lord Jesus Christ will be increased. I humbly so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The divine guidance which has directed the affairs of this Church for over 166 years today, since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was legally organized on 6 April 1830. What has happened in this work in this relatively short time is a miracle. As a small boy, I remember hearing my great-uncle William Wetzel tell about walking with his family across the American plains to Salt Lake Valley. His stories of struggle, sacrifice, and faith made an indelible impression on my young heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/the-prophetic-voice.p2" pid="ZkTY_OLX-UyMlXwur-8kmg" hash="xohEdQ">When Great-grandfather’s family arrived in this valley, most of the members of the Church lived in a group of small, dusty settlements in the territory of Deseret. Many had braved the ocean to come to the United States. Then they traveled by wagon and handcart through the searing heat and the intense cold of the American plains and the high mountain peaks to find peace and worship God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/the-prophetic-voice.p3" pid="BcWN9t8a7UGNn6KfWAGNkQ" hash="9nu-9A">In large measure, members of our faith were at that time a despised, persecuted, and driven people. But since then has come the fulfillment of the Lord’s statement, “In this the beginning of the rising up and the coming forth of my church out of the wilderness—clear as the moon, and fair as the sun.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> No one can fully understand how and why the Church has come “out of obscurity”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> and blossomed without knowing some of the fundamental prophetic truths on which the Church rests.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/the-prophetic-voice.p4" pid="5TdlfASeTE-4X3fHr6MPCA" hash="I9I0lg">When I was first named as a General Authority many years ago, I went to see President Hugh B. Brown, then in the First Presidency, and asked him, “President Brown, what advice have you got for a new, young, inexperienced General Authority?” This wise and venerable man responded simply and directly, “Stick with the Brethren.” Who are the Brethren? The Brethren are those who hold the keys of the kingdom of God on earth. They are the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, each of whom is an apostle and prophet; the Seventy; and, in temporal matters, the Presiding Bishopric.</p>

Millions of men and women have followed the prophets of God. I wish to pay special tribute to all of the faithful women since the time of the Restoration who have listened to the prophetic voice of the Church. Their supernal womanly gifts and talents have blessed the work of God in a most important and indispensable way.</p>

Such solid faith is the foundation of the loyalty manifested by the great majority of faithful members who, throughout the history of the Church, have received the confirming witness concerning the reality of continuing revelation. This revelation has come in its time from each of the Presidents of the Church, their counselors in the First Presidency, and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who serve under the direction of the President.</p>

This is in fulfillment of Daniel’s prophecy that “the God of heaven would set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed” nor “left to other people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> President John Taylor affirmed this also when he said: “There is one thing very certain, … and that is, whatever men may think, and however they may plot and contrive, that this Kingdom will never be given into the hands of another people.

Some of those seeking to mislead have done so claiming special endowments of intelligence or inspiration beyond the established order of the Church. As a warning against those so claiming special authority, the Lord made it clear “that it shall not be given to any one … to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

He was ordained with the Prophet Joseph in 1829 under the hands of a heavenly messenger when the priesthood was restored to the earth. Oliver served as a scribe, writing down the translation of the Book of Mormon as it poured forth from the mouth of the Prophet Joseph. He shared with the Prophet Joseph the great visions manifested in the Kirtland Temple in 1836 and witnessed the bestowal of the keys by Moses, Elias, and Elijah.</p>

But beware of pride, lest thou shouldst enter into temptation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Oliver had great intellect and enjoyed marvelous spiritual blessings. However, over time he forgot the Lord’s warning, and pride entered into his heart. Brigham Young later said of this pride: “I have seen men who belonged to this kingdom, and who really thought that if they were not associated with it, it could not progress. One man especially, whom I now think of, … was peculiarly gifted in self-reliance and general ability. He said as much to the Prophet Joseph a number of times as to say that if he left this kingdom, it could not progress any further. I speak of Oliver Cowdery. He forsook it, and it still rolled on, and still triumphed over every opposing foe, and bore off safely all those who clung to it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

Describing this memorable event, George A. Smith wrote of Oliver: “He bore testimony in the most positive terms … and told the people if they wanted to follow the right path, to keep [in] the main channel of the stream—where the body of the Church goes, there is the authority.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

He further stated: “These Priesthoods, with their authority, are now, and must continue to be, in the body of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

This is not a new phenomenon. After the Crucifixion of the Savior, Peter and the Apostles were preaching to a hostile audience. Gamaliel, a man learned in the law, defended their right to preach. After recalling the ill fate of two different groups that had risen up and drawn people away, he presented this sure test of truth. Said he, “If this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:</p>

Every man and young man in the Church who lives in accordance with the Savior’s teachings is ordained to the priesthood. The use of this power, however, is limited. Every father is to his family a patriarch and every mother a matriarch as coequals in their distinctive parental roles. Members, men and women, may receive inspiration by the gift of the Holy Ghost for their personal lives and for their areas of responsibility.</p>

They say that they believe in the principles and ordinances of the gospel and accept the President of the Church as the legal administrator thereof, but claim they have a higher order which the President does not have. This is often done to justify an activity which is not in accordance with the doctrines of the Church. There can be no higher order, however, because the President of the Church both holds and exercises all of the keys of the kingdom of God on earth.

I testify that this revelatory power has directed this work since April 6, 1830. That confirmation is the source of the greatest knowledge I have. I counsel and pray that all will heed the ongoing prophetic voice of this Church, revealing the word of God in our day. Of this I witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

If you will respect his authority, be obedient, humble, teachable, and follow the mission rules, you will be a successful missionary. For instance, one of the hardest rules to follow is to get up in the morning when your mission president directs. Many young men think the best time to sleep is in the morning. I’m grateful to my obedient senior companion, Elder William Grant Bangerter, who would set the alarm clock to get up early. When the alarm went off, it would jangle my nerves. In the winter it was dark, damp, and cold, and we never had any hot water for bathing or showering. He would cheerfully shower in that cold water; I would start to shiver as soon as he got out of the shower. I could not do anything but follow his example, but I have to confess that I was not quite as cheerful because my teeth were chattering.</p>

I do not wish to be insensitive to the natural affections between a fine young man and a lovely young woman. However, if a missionary receives a letter from his girlfriend stating that her affections for him have changed—we used to call that a “Dear John letter”; some of us have gotten those—I commend the good counsel given some years ago by Elder LeGrand Richards, who said, “There’s a new group of girls every year! And the new group is just as good as the old group.”</p>

However, when you are called as a full-time representative of the Lord, you should “serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

        <span class="strong">Fifth, never permit contention in your companionships.</span> Some of your missionary companions will be your life’s dearest friends. Be the kind of companion you would like to be with. Be unselfish in your relationship with your companions. When there is contention, the Spirit of the Lord will depart, regardless of who is at fault.</p>

Each of us has weaknesses. In a harmonious companionship, there is teamwork—where one is weak, the other is strong. As a boy, I learned to drive a team of horses. If one horse was balky, the other could not pull the load alone. So it is in a missionary companionship. Each must pull his share of the load.</p>

        <span class="strong">Sixth, keep your bodies clean and healthy and your living quarters clean.</span> It is very important that you eat properly and get adequate sleep so that you can maintain good health. If you become ill, not only can you not do the work, but you will also become a burden on your companion. Remember, also, that keeping your person and your living quarters neat and clean is conducive to enjoying the Spirit.</p>

He heard a knock at the door one day, and two Mormon missionaries stood before him. He was not the least interested in religion. The only thing that interested him about these two young men was their accent. He had mastered four languages, but English was not one of them.</p>

Speaking of the mysteries reminds me of the man who got up to talk and said, “I will now proceed to expound upon that which the Lord has not yet seen fit to reveal!” Mysteries include those matters that are speculative. They are things which have not been revealed or are beyond our understanding. It is the plain, simple truth confirmed by the Spirit that converts when accompanied by the testimony of a humble servant of the Lord.</p>

        <span class="strong">Ninth, you must know that Lucifer will oppose you, and be prepared for his opposition.</span> Do not be surprised. He wants you to fail. Discouragement is one of the devil’s tools. Have courage and go forward. Recognize that the gospel has been preached with some pain and sorrow from the very beginning of time. Do not expect that your experience will be otherwise. President Wilford Woodruff recounted the difficulties of early missionary work:</p>

In those days we counted it a blessing to go into a place where there was a Latter-day Saint. I went once 150 miles to see one; and when I got there he had apostatized, and tried to kill me. Then, after travelling seventy-two miles without food, I sat down to eat my meal with a Missouri mobocrat, and he damning and cursing me all the time. … In those days we might travel hundreds and hundreds of miles and you could not find a Latter-day Saint.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

        <span class="strong">Tenth, your own personal testimony is the strongest arrow in your quiver.</span> I have often related that in the early days of the missionary work in Brazil, where we now have over half a million members of the Church, we did not have the Book of Mormon, the Pearl of Great Price, or the Doctrine and Covenants translated into the Portuguese language. All we had were the Bible, a few tracts, our personal testimonies concerning the Restoration of the gospel and the Joseph Smith story, and our testimony of the living prophet. The harvest was not great. However, some of those who were baptized have for three generations remained faithful because they were touched by the powerful testimonies of humble missionaries almost 60 years ago. Now, you cannot be responsible for whether or not those you teach will accept your testimony and join the Church. Do not feel that you must obtain a quota of baptisms to be successful. An old saying teaches that you can count the number of seeds in a single apple, but you can’t count the number of apples in a single seed. The harvest is the Lord’s. Your responsibility is to thrust in the sickle. The Doctrine and Covenants clearly records what is required of those who enter into the waters of baptism:</p>

In fact, it is often quite difficult, but the Lord is the greatest paymaster in the world. Dedicated missionary service is one of life’s most fulfilling experiences. This is in large measure because of the divine agency which flows so richly from the Lord to His humble and obedient servants to bless the lives of others. I know this because I have seen it manifested in the lives of thousands and have felt it in my own life.</p>

I thank you for your faith and devotion. I thank you for your example of righteousness. It is marvelous to observe how you handle the many challenges with which you are confronted.

Hinckley, speaking for the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, announced and read the Proclamation on the Family. Because you mothers are the heart and soul of any family, it was appropriate that it was first read in the General Relief Society Meeting.</p>

It is the greatest women’s organization in the world. You are especially privileged to belong to this wonderful organization. My life has been richly blessed because of Relief Society. My great-grandmother was a ward Relief Society president for 33 years. I have been married to both the stake and ward Relief Society president! Both the same woman! Our eldest daughter now serves as ward Relief Society president. One of our daughters-in-law is a stake Relief Society president. As my dear Ruth faithfully attended Relief Society over the years, our home and family was blessed with more of spirituality and peace. Things seemed to go smoother because of the spiritual enrichment she received. I feel well schooled in the benefits of Relief Society. I learned long ago to sustain the priesthood and not get in the way of Relief Society.</p>

But it does include building faith by testimony and example. It includes teaching the doctrines of salvation. It includes following the Savior’s example of love for all mankind. It includes ministering to others, for, as the Prophet Joseph said when the Relief Society was organized, “This is a charitable Society, and according to your natures; it is natural for females to have feelings of charity and benevolence.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> “Let the weight of your innocence, kindness and affection be felt … ; not war, not jangle, not contradiction, or dispute, but meekness, love, purity—these are the things that should magnify you in the eyes of all good men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

This gift is unique to your womanhood. Men are not so richly endowed with these gifts. The highest expression of this gift is motherhood, but it is also manifested in many other ways. One of these is the great intuition enjoyed by women. One of our faithful ward Relief Society presidents recalls a prompting she had:</p>

My first thought was, ‘I’m in charge; I can’t leave.’ But then I thought, ‘What would Christ do?’ Of course He would leave the meeting and go to His lost sheep. So I went. As I arrived at this sister’s home, I told her, ‘I don’t know why I’m here, but are you okay?’ She said she was fine. But I persisted. If the Lord had sent me, I knew I couldn’t just leave.</p>

Inherent in this is the forgetting of self and the serving of others.</p>

Word soon spread throughout her ward, and ward members brought dinners by the dozen so that she had to tell them to stop because her refrigerator was overflowing. One of them was a nearly blind sister who crossed a busy street with a hot dinner on a tray. Another sister volunteered to help clean her apartment. Seeing our friend’s reluctance, she countered, “How else can I show you that I love you?” Another sister who helped with grocery shopping saw the bright side of our friend’s accident as she pointed out, “This opportunity has brought us close to each other again!” These sisters all had the vision of the work the Savior had in mind for them to do.</p>

As the noble daughters of God, the sisters over the years have stood firm and true in the spirit of faith. My wife’s mother, Elizabeth Hamilton Wright, had seven children and was pregnant with her eighth child when her husband was called on a mission. She was left with the responsibility of the family and, with the help of one hired man, seeing that 16 cows were milked every day, that the garden was planted and harvested, the berries picked, and the family taken care of. She was a woman of deep faith and love of the Lord. Her faith never wavered all of the days of her life. It gave her strength to do the work which the Savior had for her to do and to meet the needs of her growing family even in her husband’s absence.</p>

For many years I have been privileged to sit in the Welfare Executive Committee meetings with Sister Elaine Jack and with Sister Jack have enjoyed the presence and contribution of Sister Chieko Okazaki and Sister Aileen Clyde in the General Welfare meetings. Their wisdom is great and their contribution is vital. Their ideas and thoughts are so very much needed and appreciated.</p>

We are mindful of your many challenges, which are often overwhelming and exhausting in this unsettled world. These challenges come in many forms to each of you. There is usually not enough money to make ends meet. Some sisters struggle with health problems. Some do not have spiritual well-being all of the time. Others are diminished by age or other infirmities. You mothers deal with tremendous challenges in meeting the needs of diverse personalities in your families. This is particularly true of single mothers. Some suffer because of wayward children or grandchildren. Others care for disabled members of the family. Others grieve over losses such as the death of a loved one. Some find themselves in a condition of loneliness. Amidst all of this, constant, subtle voices would divert you from your divine destiny.</p>

In my lifetime, the drudgery of caring for a home and family has been greatly reduced. I remember my grandmother’s old washboard, which was used to scrub clothes by hand. She cooked hot meals winter and summer on a wood-burning stove. I remember the coming of electricity to our small town and all of the marvelous advantages that it brought. Women now have never had greater opportunities for education and travel. But in the eternal scheme of things, your role is infinitely more vital, and it carries the promise of spiritual blessings greater than these temporal blessings.</p>

Because they were there each week, they gradually learned the importance of the sacrament; they learned to listen, to be reverent, to recognize the sweet feelings of the Spirit; and their testimonies began to blossom. I recognize that this is a unique and precious time for us when our children are small and need our guidance.

All of us are grateful that our beloved prophet and leader, President Gordon B. Hinckley, is present. We all rejoice that President Hinckley has been able to meet with so many Saints in so many lands since he was called as President of the Church, and he has blessed them greatly. We are grateful for his inspired leadership. I am humbled beyond the power of expression to serve with President Hinckley, President Monson, members of the Quorum of the Twelve, and the other General Authorities of the Church. I have a most profound respect and appreciation for each of them.</p>

I am concerned about its effect upon us as the holders of the priesthood of God. There are so many in the world who do not seem to know or care about right or wrong. The 13th article of faith is known to all of us. I repeat it for emphasis:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/honesty-a-moral-compass.p3" pid="h8kUeXU3yEaAe_pjBGkX3g" hash="TgP-OQ">“We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul—We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.”</p>

Honesty is more than not lying. It is truth telling, truth speaking, truth living, and truth loving. John, a nine-year-old Swiss pioneer child who was in one of the handcart companies, is an example of honesty. His father put a chunk of buffalo meat in the handcart and said it was to be saved for Sunday dinner. John said, “I was so very hungry and the meat smelled so good to me while pushing at the handcart that I could not resist. I had a little pocket knife. … Although I expected a severe whipping when father found it out, I cut off little pieces each day. I would chew them so long that they got white and perfectly tasteless. When father came to get the meat he asked me if I had been cutting off some of it. I said ‘Yes. I was so hungry I could not let it alone.’ Instead of giving me a scolding or whipping, father turned away and wiped tears from his eyes.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Honesty is a moral compass to guide us in our lives. You young men are under great pressure to learn the technology that is expanding and will continue to expand so rapidly. However, the tremendous push to excel in secular learning sometimes tempts people to compromise that which is more important—their honesty and integrity.</p>

My husband had worked hard on his studies and went to attend his first examination. The honor system was expected behavior at the medical school. The professor passed out the examination and left the room. Within a short time, students started to pull little cheat papers out from under their papers or from their pockets. My husband recalled his heart beginning to pound as he realized it is pretty hard to compete against cheaters. About that time a tall, lanky student stood up in the back of the room and stated: ‘I left my hometown and put my wife and three little babies in an upstairs apartment and worked very hard to get into medical school. And I’ll turn in the first one of you who cheats, and <span class="emphasis">you better believe it!’</span> They believed it. There were many sheepish expressions, and those cheat papers started to disappear as fast as they had appeared. He set a standard for the class which eventually graduated the largest group in the school’s history.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

We have the agency to make choices, but ultimately we will be accountable for each choice we make. We may deceive others, but there is One we will never deceive. From the Book of Mormon we learn, “The keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

One cold night at Chanute Field, Illinois, I was given all-night guard duty. As I walked around my post, I meditated and pondered the whole miserable, long night through. By morning I had come to some firm conclusions. I was engaged to be married and knew that I could not support my wife on a private’s pay. In a day or two, I filed my application for Officer’s Candidate School. Shortly thereafter, I was summoned before the board of inquiry. My qualifications were few, but I had had two years of college and had finished a mission for the Church in South America.</p>

Nearly all of them centered upon my beliefs. “Do you smoke?” “Do you drink?” “What do you think of others who smoke and drink?” I had no trouble answering these questions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/honesty-a-moral-compass.p13" pid="puFEzB7qDU-6N_DjZXjr-w" hash="O_KsZQ">“Do you pray?” “Do you believe that an officer should pray?” The officer asking these questions was a hard-bitten career soldier. He did not look like he prayed very often. I pondered. Would I give him offense if I answered how I truly believed? I wanted to be an officer very much so that I would not have to do all-night guard duty and KP and clean latrines, but mostly so my sweetheart and I could afford to be married.</p>

I admitted that I did pray and that I felt that officers might seek divine guidance as some truly great generals had done. I told them that I thought that officers should be prepared to lead their men in all appropriate activities, if the occasion requires, including prayer.</p>

I suspected that the men who were asking me this question did not live by the standards that I had been taught. The thought flashed through my mind that perhaps I could say that I had my own beliefs, but I did not wish to impose them on others. But there seemed to flash before my mind the faces of the many people to whom I had taught the law of chastity as a missionary. In the end I simply said, “I do not believe there is a double standard of morality.”</p>

A few days later when the scores were posted, to my astonishment I had passed. I was in the first group taken for Officer’s Candidate School! I graduated, became a second lieutenant, married my sweetheart, and we have “lived together happily ever after.”</p>

For many, their reasoning seems to be, “What can I get away with?” or “It’s OK to do it as long as I don’t get caught!” Stealing takes many forms, including shoplifting; taking cars, stereos, CD players, video games, and other items that belong to someone else; stealing time, money, and merchandise from employers; stealing from the government by the misuse of the taxpayers’ money or making false claims on our income tax returns; or borrowing without any intention of repayment. No one has ever gained anything of value by theft. In the play <span class="emphasis">Othello,</span> Shakespeare has Iago teach a great truth:</p>

Today I speak to those who have heartrending challenges. I speak to those who suffer, to those who mourn and have heartaches. I speak to those with physical, mental, or emotional pain. I speak to those born crippled or who have become crippled. I speak to those who were born blind or who can no longer see the sunsets. I speak to those who have never been able or who are no longer able to hear a bird sing. I speak to those who have the privileged responsibility of helping others who have mental and physical disabilities. I also speak to those who may be in serious transgression.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p3" pid="Hzy-izNquU-inTK32fiJTA" hash="VRpMog">“Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> The Savior was speaking not just to the sorrowing Mary. He was also speaking to us—men, women, and children and all of mankind ever born or yet to be born, for the tears of sorrow, pain, or remorse are the common lot of mankind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p4" pid="Fhvh2Ezej06sEdiagGM8lw" hash="s_80xg">The complexities of this life at times tend to be very dehumanizing and overwhelming. Some have so much, while others struggle with so very little.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p5" pid="9_DQJGtTjEGm-mvzILCz5w" hash="rfVgiA">It is a joy to meet with the faithful Saints of the Church all over the world. Even though some of them have difficulties and challenges and lack material wealth, yet they seem to find much happiness and are able to walk in faith over the rough cobblestones of life. Their deep faith strengthens ours as we meet with them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p6" pid="S4EtsgFekU2o1HeCPVjs2Q" hash="SLF1aA">Many who think that life is unfair do not see things within the larger vision of what the Savior did for us through the Atonement and the Resurrection. Each of us has at times agony, heartbreak, and despair when we must, like Job, reach deep down inside to the bedrock of our own faith. The depth of our belief in the Resurrection and the Atonement of the Savior will, I believe, determine the measure of courage and purpose with which we meet life’s challenges.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p7" pid="6wA_N2HYWkey-cczclyXfg" hash="XEL7DA">The first words of the risen Lord to His disciples were, “Peace be unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> He has also promised, “Peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> The Atonement and the Resurrection have taken place. Our Lord and Savior suffered that appalling agony in Gethsemane. He performed the ultimate sacrifice in dying on the cross and then breaking the bonds of death.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p8" pid="yM82f1pjKkGD34-6Hc5DvA" hash="o4Nwow">All of us benefit from the transcendent blessings of the Atonement and the Resurrection, through which the divine healing process can work in our lives. The hurt can be replaced by the joy the Savior promised. To the doubting Thomas, Jesus said, “Be not faithless, but believing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Through faith and righteousness all of the inequities, injuries, and pains of this life can be fully compensated for and made right. Blessings denied in this life will be fully recompensed in the eternities. Through complete repentance of our sins we can be forgiven and we can enjoy eternal life. Thus our suffering in this life can be as the refining fire, purifying us for a higher purpose. Heartaches can be healed, and we can come to know a soul-satisfying joy and happiness beyond our dreams and expectations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p9" pid="GXLK3WOhAUq96VdapQ_Rlw" hash="Igq2Yg">The resolution promised by the Atonement and the Resurrection continues in eternity. Physical limitations will be compensated. Alma’s words are comforting: “The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p10" pid="Ia1Ehjb8HEardN-LqnwEZQ" hash="T4II-Q">The resolution is brought about by the Savior’s intercession. As He said in the great intercessory prayer found in the 17th chapter of John, “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Then the Savior prayed for His Apostles and all of the Saints, saying: “I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p11" pid="5C1XiGciWka81uBDuQ5NLg" hash="7teLqg">“And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p12" pid="VpezjJAcLEuSx7fgdTvHXw" hash="rEllng">All of us have made wrong turns along the way. I believe the kind and merciful God, whose children we are, will judge us as lightly as He can for the wrongs that we have done and give us the maximum blessing for the good that we do. Alma’s sublime utterance seems to me an affirmation of this. Said Alma, “And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people and to answer their prayers.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p13" pid="DaETFamxx0uEZK5ioYxP6A" hash="-rnpkA">Of vital importance is resolving transgression, experiencing the healing process which comes of repentance. As President Kimball reminds us: “The principle of repentance—of rising again whenever we fall, brushing ourselves off, and setting off again on that upward trail—is the basis for our hope. It is through repentance that the Lord Jesus Christ can work his healing miracle, infusing us with strength when we are weak, health when we are sick, hope when we are downhearted, love when we feel empty, and understanding when we search for truth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p14" pid="9daUXRFDQ0-2410H6BkVCg" hash="SJSkjQ">One of the tender stories of the Book of Mormon takes place when Alma speaks to his son Corianton, who has fallen into transgression while on a mission to the Zoramites. As he counsels him to forsake his sin and turn again to the Lord, he learns that Corianton is worried about what will happen to him in the Resurrection. There follows a detailed treatment of the probationary state of this life, of justice versus mercy, and God’s plan for our happiness in the hereafter, culminating in this verse:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p15" pid="v3XOYGXLL0SwMolH5ksmoQ" hash="FwsR1w">“… And mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p16" pid="1VSPAU_hy0aiGJdzyU1qaw" hash="vhRzSw">The Savior gives us a profound key by which we can cope with and even surmount the debilitating forces of the world. Said the Savior, “I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> This grand key then is that, regardless of the saturation of wickedness around us, we must stay free from the evil of the world. The Savior’s prayer both commands us to avoid evil and proffers divine help to do so. Through this effort we become one with our Lord. The prayer of the Savior in Gethsemane was, “That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

We must also stand together as families; as members of wards and branches, stakes and districts; and as a people. To our neighbors not of our faith we should be as the good Samaritan who cared for the man who fell among thieves.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> We must gather strength from each other. We must also “succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p18" pid="R72g_H9bx0yERwhxa5bxJQ" hash="cpqlSA">Paul taught well on this subject. Said he to the Corinthians, speaking of the body, or the Church, of Christ: “… there should be no schism in the body; but … the members should have the same care one for another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/woman-why-weepest-thou.p19" pid="1W3zb6tJVkCDWWZbbRh2aw" hash="rFS1MQ">“And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</p>

As we go through travail and difficulty, we may feel sorry for ourselves and despair; but with the love of God and the Saints, unitedly bearing each other’s burdens, we can be happy and overcome evil.</p>

In the eternal plan, no blessing will be kept from the faithful. No woman should question how the Savior values womanhood. The grieving Mary Magdalene was the first to visit the sepulchre after the Crucifixion, and when she saw that the stone had been rolled away and that the tomb was empty, she ran to tell Peter and John. The two Apostles came to see and then went away sorrowing. But Mary stayed. She had stood near the cross.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> She had been at the burial.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> And now she stood weeping by the empty sepulchre.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> There she was honored to be the first mortal to see the risen Lord. After He said, “Woman, why weepest thou?” she was instructed by Him: “Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>

Bedding had become very scarce so I did not disrobe. I slept until, as it appeared to me, about midnight. I was extremely cold. The weather was bitter. I listened to hear if my husband breathed, he lay so still. I could not hear him. I became alarmed. I put my hand on his body, when to my horror I discovered that my worst fears were confirmed. My husband was dead. I called for help to the other inmates of the tent. They could render me no aid; and there was no alternative but to remain alone by the side of the corpse till morning. Oh, how the dreary hours drew their tedious length along. When daylight came, some of the male part of the company prepared the body for burial. And oh, such a burial and funeral service. They did not remove his clothing—he had but little. They wrapped him in a blanket and placed him in a pile with thirteen others who had died, and then covered him up with snow. The ground was frozen so hard that they could not dig a grave. He was left there to sleep in peace until the trump of God shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall awake and come forth in the morning of the first resurrection. We shall then again unite our hearts and lives, and eternity will furnish us with life forever more.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>

I walked some distance from the Temple supposing the crowd would disperse, but on returning I found the house filled to overflowing.</p>

They were humble, new converts to the Church, without wealth or position. Their temple work was their final concern as they were leaving their homes in Nauvoo to come west. It was fortunate that President Young granted the wish of the Saints to receive their temple blessings because John Akerley died at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. He, along with over 4,000 others, never made it to the valleys of the Rocky Mountains.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> William Clayton’s classic Mormon hymn “Come, Come, Ye Saints” captures well their faith: “And should we die before our journey’s through, happy day! All is well!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

President Young made this great proclamation before the Saints even had a roof over their heads and while they were still living in wagons or sleeping on the ground. He drove his cane into the ground and said, “Here we will build the Temple of our God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> This magnificent edifice would require 40 years to build.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/eternity-lies-before-us.p8" pid="TCyRIf9uu0GZNnomvpYenQ" hash="xb6AgQ">Within 10 years of their arrival in the valley, the Saints built the Endowment House, where they could receive some of their temple blessings. This they did, as Brigham Young explained: “In consequence of our having been driven from our homes, and because of our destitute circumstances, the Lord has permitted us to do what we have done, namely, to use this Endowment House for temple purposes.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> It was dedicated May 5, 1855. Here Elsie Ann, the daughter of John and Jane Akerley, was sealed for time and all eternity to her husband, Henry Jacob Faust, on April 2, 1857.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/eternity-lies-before-us.p9" pid="GIt_gsQIxkCFrK8EbGVYcg" hash="vdw02w">There were, however, ordinances that could not be administered in the Endowment House, and the work was under way to build the Salt Lake Temple. Referring to this great building that was to stand through the Millennium, Brigham Young announced: “This is not the only temple we shall build; there will be hundreds of them built and dedicated to the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

In another six years they began building the exquisitely beautiful temples in Manti and Logan, Utah. The work of temple building continued from that time to the present. Forty-nine operating temples grace much of the earth, with more to be dedicated this year and others announced and planned, as President Hinckley has indicated.</p>

Why were all of these temples built at such cost and sacrifice? Why are they still being built at an ever-increasing pace? It is because the deepest questions of our existence are answered in the temple. These answers tell us where we came from, why we are here, where we may go, and how we may cope with the matter of death. This life makes no logical sense unless we think in terms of the eternities. The transcendent blessings of life and eternity are received within the sacred walls of the temple. The Savior’s supernal gift to mankind gave us the opportunity for eternal life, but eternal life without our loved ones would be bleak.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/eternity-lies-before-us.p22" pid="yLbVMO_QykaZgQXIkHC6Xw" hash="g9KrEw">A basic eternal truth of this Church is that families may, if they are worthy, have an eternal relationship; for us it would not be heaven without our parents, our grandparents, our eternal companions, our children, and our posterity. This union of families comes through the sealing power exercised within the hallowed walls of the temples under authorized priesthood authority.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/eternity-lies-before-us.p23" pid="-uVVsF_EVUGHduMJpoXA8g" hash="bastVA">An eternal family begins when a young couple kneels at an altar in the holy temple of God and make covenants with each other and with God and receive His greatest promises. This sealing is preceded by each making and receiving covenants which, if they continue worthy, will bless them in this life as well as in the life to come.</p>

This life is hollow without a belief in and an understanding of immortality. Said Paul, “If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> The Atonement and the Resurrection of the Savior are the grand keys that open the locks of immortality. The greatest fulfillment of these blessings, if we are worthy, comes to us in the holy temples of God. Within their sacred walls, those who hold the power and authority bind in heaven that which is bound in earth. This authority has been delegated by the President of the Church, who holds and exercises all of the keys of the kingdom of God on earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/eternity-lies-before-us.p26" pid="j-WaAgdryESgmnHlMG1hgQ" hash="-vRHgA">Fundamental to temple worship is the principle that “God is no respecter of persons.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Within the hallowed walls of the temples, there is no preference of position, wealth, status, race, or education. All dress in white. All receive the same instruction. All make the same covenants and promises. All receive the same transcendent, eternal blessings if they live worthy to claim them. All are equal before their Creator. Those who are single through no fault of their own, if worthy, will be given the blessings, if they wish, of an eternal family relationship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/eternity-lies-before-us.p27" pid="y3YBnrY5FkyfnybkeSI-yg" hash="fXn9bQ">We are a covenant-making people. These eternal blessings are for all who wish to worthily receive of them, both the living and the dead. In the mercy of God we are privileged to receive these blessings by proxy for our deceased ancestors who did not have this privilege in life. They, of course, may choose whether to accept these blessings. Our duty is to search out our forebears and give them the opportunity to accept and receive these blessings. As the Prophet Joseph Smith said, “The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/eternity-lies-before-us.p28" pid="3OIL2MAcj0mr1W-AaEUDuA" hash="MuOh6w">The opportunity to receive these supernal blessings was given by God in His infinite goodness to the people of this earth through the great prophet of the Restoration, Joseph Smith. He was commissioned to restore the fulness of all things in our time. This is why temple blessings were one of the last yearnings of President Brigham Young and the pioneers as they left Nauvoo. For the same reason, President Young’s thoughts on arriving in the valley of the Great Salt Lake were to again secure these eternal blessings for God’s children by building and operating temples.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/eternity-lies-before-us.p29" pid="k1_DJnqtAkmr0QfmcAIN9w" hash="YXe-Zg">Temple building and temple worship were paramount reasons for the pioneers’ willingness to suffer so greatly and endure so much in their remarkable exodus to the barren, isolated desert of the West. We rejoice that God has, in His divine providence, made possible the building of so many temples in so many countries in our time. No one has dedicated more temples in this dispensation than President Gordon B. Hinckley. Of the 49 operating temples, he has dedicated 24. We hope and pray that temple blessings in time will be available to more of God’s children around the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/eternity-lies-before-us.p30" pid="SYRpKBuUuEugh3i72qKV0A" hash="3QMcbA">There were over 5,600 members who received their blessings in the Nauvoo Temple. The spiritual leaven given in the Nauvoo Temple blesses us today in an ever-increasing measure. It spreads to every house of the Lord in the world so that all who hunger and thirst for the fulness of God’s word may be filled.</p>

They endured much, but their suffering was just beginning. Their temple blessings helped strengthen them for what lay ahead. Separated by death in Winter Quarters, they were able to endure all things because of their faith and the blessings received that cold February night in 1846.</p>

Our challenges are more subtle but equally hard. Maintaining our spiritual strength is also a daily challenge. The greatest source of that spiritual strength comes, as it did in their time, from our temples.</p>

Worlds were created by and through the priesthood. To safeguard this sacred power, all priesthood holders act under the direction of those who hold the keys of the priesthood. These keys bring order into our lives and into the organization of the Church. For us, priesthood power is the power and authority delegated by God to act in His name for the salvation of His children. Caring for others is the very essence of priesthood responsibility. It is the power to bless, to heal, and to administer the saving ordinances of the gospel. Righteous priesthood authority is most needed within the walls of our own homes. It must be exercised in great love. This is true of all priesthood holders—deacon, teacher, priest, elder, high priest, patriarch, Seventy, and Apostle.</p>

I learned great lessons of priesthood caring as a teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood.

I learned to admire everything about him, including his endearing Swedish accent. He taught me the true meaning of the Lord’s instruction to the teachers:</p>

He was very dedicated. Despite the difference in our ages, we became lifelong friends. When he became our ward Sunday School superintendent, he asked for me to be his counselor. I was only 17 years of age. He was a successful contractor, and when I returned home from World War II, he built my first home. When I graduated from law school, I did legal work for him, and when I billed him for my legal services, he paid me more than I asked. That did not happen very often. I cite this experience to emphasize the importance of giving every Aaronic Priesthood holder the opportunity to serve as a junior companion to faithful Melchizedek Priesthood holders.</p>

They need to be caring and willing to serve as the need arises. I know of members of one high priests group who take tools when they go home teaching. We do not expect home teachers to be able to fix everything, such as computers and other highly technical equipment. They can, however, offer their wisdom and experience in assisting their assigned families to find the needed help. Caring home teachers should make appointments in advance, if possible. Aaronic Priesthood home teaching companions can learn lifelong lessons and be greatly blessed by serving with faithful Melchizedek Priesthood senior companions. Brother Robert F. Jex shares his faith-strengthening experience as a junior home teaching companion many years ago:</p>

I cannot recall what I said—it doesn’t really matter—for I was the pupil in the classroom of priesthood duty and responsibility. As I glanced up from my notes at the conclusion of my remarks, my eyes fell upon the tear-stained cheeks of that sweet, sensitive sister.

By that time, I was so overcome by the spirit of the occasion … [and] surprised that I was asked to pray when someone older and more experienced and trusted was present.

I recently reread in the <span class="emphasis">Melchizedek Priesthood Leadership Handbook</span> the responsibilities of the bishop. These responsibilities are heavy and often quite demanding. Some duties the bishop cannot delegate, but others can and should be handled by his counselors, fathers, home teachers, and quorum leaders. Many years ago we were taught by President Harold B. Lee a fuller meaning of the direction from the Lord: “Let every man stand in his own office, and labor in his own calling.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> He said: “It becomes the responsibility of those of us who lead to <span class="emphasis">let,</span> to <span class="emphasis">permit,</span> to <span class="emphasis">give opportunity</span> for every man to learn his duty. … Help is not helpful if we assume the prerogatives that belong to that individual.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> This fuller understanding also means that presiding officers of the Church should be careful not to usurp the responsibilities and duties of those they are called to direct.</p>

Priesthood service requires us to set aside our selfish interests and desires. Brethren, we need to prepare so that we are able to accept priesthood callings should they come. We should try to live providently with respect to our personal lifestyles. Living providently means living well within our means and providing for future needs and events. We should avoid the bondage of crushing, unnecessary indebtedness. We should also try to have some savings to tide us over for a rainy day. In short, we should seek to manage our affairs so that we are better able to accept the calls which might come to us now, as well as in the future.</p>

It cannot be bought or sold. In the book of Acts, we learn that a man called Simon wanted to buy the priesthood power of the Apostles to lay on hands and bestow the Holy Ghost. “But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Many of you watch and admire linebackers, power forwards, and centers, as well as those who wield wealth, fame, and political and military power. Worldly power often is employed ruthlessly. However, priesthood power is invoked only through those principles of righteousness by which the priesthood is governed. The Lord has said:</p>

His physical appearance became shabby and his demeanor sad as he became a drug addict, an alcoholic, and then a chain-smoker. He continued in this destructive lifestyle for many years. However, in time, with the help of a good wife, home teachers, a caring bishop, and our loving Heavenly Father, he eventually started on the long road back. One of the proudest days in his life came when he once again qualified for a temple recommend. Looking back on those bad years, he later admitted, “All I ever wanted was to belong.” Seeking acceptance from the wrong source brought untold misery and pain.</p>

This stirred up the king of Syria, who sent by night “horses, and chariots, and a great host,” and surrounded the city. “And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots.

The Ten Commandments are still a vital thread in the fabric of the gospel of Christ, but with His coming came new light and life which brings a fuller measure of joy and happiness. Jesus introduced a higher and more difficult standard of human conduct.

Where does the responsibility for the making of moral judgments rest? With mature individuals, of course, it rests with each individual. In the case of children, the responsibility of giving moral guidance rests with the parents. They know the disposition, understanding, and intelligence of each child. Parents spend a lifetime seeking to establish and maintain good communications with each of their children. They are in the best position to make the ultimate moral decisions as to the welfare and well-being of their offspring. The higher principles of the gospel—justice, mercy, and faith—are very important in all family relationships.</p>

He felt that the many and frequent activities of the Church made it difficult to have as much family togetherness as he and his wife deemed necessary. The children had the idea that they were not loyal to the Church if they did not participate fully in every recreational activity. I told this caring father that Church activities were to help him and his wife rear their children. They as parents had not only the right but the duty to determine the extent of their family’s involvement in social activities. Family unity, solidarity, and harmony should be preserved. After all, a family is the basic, permanent unit of the Church.</p>

First is the guidance of the Holy Ghost. This is always a sure compass for those who have been baptized and received this supernal gift. The second source is the wise counsel of priesthood leaders whom the Lord has put in place to guide us. Third, the constant demonstration of love should temper all our judgments. Sometimes this means discipline.</p>

It can be enjoyed by young and old. In the early days of the Church, a young boy by the name of Will Cluff, 10 years of age, living in Nauvoo, had a remarkable, pure faith. He had an experience to which many of us can relate.</p>

In the spring of 1842 the cow strayed off. One evening in August his father came home very weary and discouraged. He and Will’s brothers had spent much of the summer looking for the cow. Will said, “Father, if you will let me take Charley (an old horse) I will go and find the cow.” He reluctantly said he could.</p>

Here he had often herded cows with other boys from Nauvoo. He got off the horse and, holding it by the bridle, knelt down and fervently prayed the Lord to direct him which way to go to find the cow. He climbed back on the horse and rode south, a course he was impressed to take even though there were numerous bunches of cattle in every direction.</p>

He dismounted and let down the stake, led his horse in, put up the fence, then rode three miles across the field. He again found himself in the open prairie with numerous bunches of stock in every direction. When he had gone about a quarter of a mile from the field, he rode right on to the cow, feeding alone some distance from any other animals.</p>

When the wood box next to the stove became empty, Grandmother would silently pick up the box, go out to refill it from the pile of cedar wood outside, and bring the heavily laden box back into the house. I was so insensitive and interested in the conversation in the kitchen, I sat there and let my beloved grandmother refill the kitchen wood box. I feel ashamed of myself and have regretted my omission for all of my life. I hope someday to ask for her forgiveness.</p>

This higher gospel requires that we look inward to our own souls, for we cannot deceive the Lord. We are told that “the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span> Those of us who hold the holy apostleship always wish to fulfill our responsibility by testifying of the divinity of the Savior. I feel compelled to do so. I have had a testimony all of my life. Recently, however, there has come into my soul an overpowering witness of the divinity of this holy work. This sure witness is more certain than ever before in my life. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We are especially honored this evening to have President Gordon B. Hinckley and President Thomas S. Monson with us. I commend Sister Nadauld, Sister Thomas, and Sister Larsen for their excellent messages. The music by the young women choir has been outstanding.

In this audience I see some of my beloved granddaughters, and I’m reminded that most of you are about their age. I’m also reminded of what someone once said about grandparents: they are people who are “overindulgent, overanxious, and over fifty.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> This evening I speak to all of you as if you were my granddaughters.

Virtue has many definitions, such as moral excellence, right action and thinking, goodness of character, or chastity in women. The First Presidency has said: “How glorious and near to the angels is youth that is clean; this youth has joy unspeakable here and eternal happiness hereafter. Sexual purity is youth’s most precious possession; it is the foundation of all righteousness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> This implies that the virtue of young women should be equal to the angels.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> You cannot become <span class="emphasis">great</span> women if you are not also <span class="emphasis">good</span> women, “women whose virtue makes them shine in a crowd.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> You will become great women if you are united in the angelic cause of doing good and if you hunger and thirst after righteousness. The Savior said, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> If we do not, then nothing else really matters.</p>

The world seems to have forgotten the proverb “Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> I remind you precious young women that you are daughters of God. He loves you. You are His noblest creation. Your own dignity and self-respect should help you to remember that, as President David O.

Now, for those who may have transgressed, please be assured that God will “remember [their sin] no more”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> if they repent.

Kimball, in speaking of the separate roles of men and women, said: “Remember, in the world before we came here, faithful women were given certain assignments while faithful men were foreordained to certain priesthood tasks. While we do not now remember the particulars, this does not alter the glorious reality of what we once agreed to. You are accountable for those things which long ago were expected of you just as are those we sustain as prophets and apostles. … This leaves much to be done by way of parallel personal development—for both men and women.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

Select two or three of life’s experiences you are absolutely sure you want to have. Do not leave important things to chance. Then think about what you can contribute to society by serving your family, the Church, and the community. Also think of what life will demand from you. Everything has a price. Much is expected of us. Becoming like men is not the answer. Rather, the answer lies in being who you are and living up to your divine potential by fulfilling eternal commitments.</p>

Some of the loudest voices are echoes of those others who are out of harmony with themselves and out of tune with life in general rather than being unhappy with their role as women.</p>

Entreating voices may tell you that what you have seen your mothers and grandmothers do is old-fashioned, unchallenging, boring, and drudgery. It may have been old-fashioned and perhaps routine; at times it was drudgery. But your mothers and grandmothers have sung a song that expressed the highest love and the noblest of womanly feelings. They have been our nurturers and our teachers. They have sanctified the work, transforming drudgery into the noblest enterprises.</p>

Every day brings satisfaction along with some work which may be frustrating, routine, and unchallenging. But it is the same in the law office, the dispensary, the laboratory, or the store. There is, however, no more important job than homemaking. As C. S. Lewis said, “A housewife’s work … is the one for which all others exist.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

My two older sisters were married and living away from home. This left me the oldest at home to take care of the house, my grieving father, and two younger brothers ages 12 and 13.</p>

This sweet father of mine never said an unkind word. He never complained when I turned all his white shirts pink in the laundry or when dinner miserably failed. All my friends in high school were planning for their after-graduation lives. Some were going to Utah State University. … I had considered going to Ricks College, but in light of the family circumstances I chose to stay at home and continue to help.</p>

On our second date, he asked me what I had done with my Saturday. … He was a little surprised when I told him that I’d dusted and vacuumed and grocery shopped and done laundry all day. He thought I was just a real homebody. Six months later, this wonderful man took me to the temple and we started our life together. He was thrilled to have a wife that knew how to cook and handle the budget.</p>

Several of the couples started talking about what a hard time they had had adjusting to marriage. Garry and I looked at each other in disbelief. … Adjusting to marriage? What was that? Our first year had gone so smoothly! As we talked about it later, we determined that the reason was that I had come into the marriage with homemaking skills. … I didn’t have the stress of experimenting with and/or burning dinner, ruining laundry, or budgeting grocery money. I’d done all that experimenting on a sensitive, patient, wise father. Now Garry and I could concentrate on just our relationship, and it was wonderful. Putting my interests aside and thinking about the needs of my family had truly been a blessing for me later.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

        <span class="emphasis">Sequentially</span> is a big word meaning to do things one at a time at different times. The book of Ecclesiastes says: “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under … heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> There are ever-increasing demands on women that challenge their traditional role of caregivers. But as women, the roles of wife and mother are in the center of your souls and cry out to be satisfied. Most women naturally want to love and be loved by a good man and to respond to the God-given, deepest feelings of womanhood—those of mother and nurturer. Fortunately, most women do not have to track a career like a man does. They may fit more than one interest into the various seasons of life.</p>

Today the modern counterparts of Babylon, Sodom, and Gomorrah are alluringly and explicitly displayed on television, the Internet, in movies, books, magazines, and places of entertainment.</p>

Hinckley warned us about moving too far toward the mainstream of society in some areas such as Sabbath day observance, family disintegration, and other matters. He said: “We have moved too far toward the mainstream of society in this matter. Now, of course there are good families. There are good families everywhere. But there are too many who are in trouble. This is a malady with a cure. The prescription is simple and wonderfully effective. It is love.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

The vulgar and the obscene are protected in the name of freedom of speech. The mainstream of society has become more tolerant, even accepting, of conduct that Jesus, Moses, the Prophet Joseph Smith, and other prophets have warned against since the beginning of human history.</p>

We have always been regarded as a peculiar people. However, being spiritually correct is much better than being politically correct. Of course, as individuals and as a people we want to be liked and respected. But we cannot be in the mainstream of society if it means abandoning those righteous principles which thundered down from Sinai, later to be refined by the Savior, and subsequently taught by modern prophets. We should only fear offending God and His Son, Jesus Christ, who is the head of this Church.</p>

I speak of sexual immorality. I speak of wagering for money, which in many places is called gaming rather than gambling. This is typical of how many other evils are masked to make them more acceptable. There is a masking of other conduct which has been condemned throughout the history of mankind, conduct which is destructive to the family, the basic unit of society. In “The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” the First Presidency and Twelve stated: “We … solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.”</p>

How can they do this when so many voices tell our children and grandchildren that evil is good and good is evil? We would hope that all fathers and mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers, would be better examples in keeping the commandments of God. We ask husbands and wives to try a little harder to be loving and kind with each other. If both parents will insulate their family as far as they can from the many influences that prey upon us, their children are more likely to be safeguarded. Daily scripture study, daily prayer, regular family home evening, obedience to priesthood authority in the home and in the Church constitute a great insurance policy against spiritual deterioration.</p>

Few responsibilities weigh heavier than speaking to this great assembly of priesthood holders because the priesthood is the mightiest force on the earth. As B. H. Roberts reminds us: “The priesthood is a solemn thing. To hold power delegated to one by Almighty God—to have authority to speak and act in his name, and have it of the same binding force as if the Deity himself spoke or acted, is both an honor and a responsibility.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> To me, you young men look like Helaman’s stripling warriors, “exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity.” Like them, we hope you are men who are “true at all times in whatsoever thing [you are] entrusted.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p2" pid="Wi0BiU05QUyTs-rUW-P67w" hash="qHiKiw">Tonight I plead for greater consistency between our beliefs and actions. I take as my text the 13th article of faith. “We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul—We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Brethren, does the Spirit of Christ that we have taken upon ourselves spill over into our behavior in the workforce? Brigham Young said: “We want the Saints to increase in goodness, until our mechanics, for instance, are so honest and reliable that this Railroad Company will say, ‘Give us a “Mormon” Elder for an engineer, then none need have the least fear to ride, for if he knows there is danger he will take every measure necessary to preserve the lives of those entrusted to his care.’ I want to see our Elders so full of integrity that they will be preferred by this Company for their engine builders, watchmen, engineers, clerks, and business managers. If we live our religion and are worthy [of] the name of Latter-day Saints, we are just the men that all such business can be entrusted to with perfect safety; if it can not it will prove that we do not live our religion.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> What President Young urged of the priesthood holders in his day is just as important in our day. The Spirit of Christ should permeate all we do, whether at work, at school, or at home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p3" pid="1EmDsAezo0mwytsHOiWFfA" hash="vdQIcw">President Spencer W. Kimball taught us to “make one-time decisions to do right.” He made important decisions early in his life so that he did not have to perpetually remake those decisions. He said, “We can push some things away from us once and have done with them … without having to brood and redecide a hundred times what it is we will do and what we will not do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p4" pid="2xlcjEuqi02xMCyzymQ90Q" hash="jWxpag">During World War II, I observed some very special young men from faithful Latter-day Saint homes lower their standards little by little and lose some of their spirituality. In some places overseas the water was not safe to drink, and the purifying chemicals made the water taste worse. Some started to drink coffee to disguise the taste. From time to time the army gave us cigarettes and a ration of liquor. Some did not take their rations at all. Others took them to trade for goods and money even though they did not smoke or drink. A few took them to experiment and became slaves for the rest of their lives. The habits they acquired during the war robbed them of their spiritual potential and many blessings of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p5" pid="c33EMb6OYE-cZFK2zOhp8A" hash="KN3RQA">Holders of the priesthood of God should be men of impeccable character. I have always admired the integrity of Father Abraham when he returned from Egypt to Palestine. He came with his nephew Lot. Soon there was strife between the herdmen of Abraham’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle. “And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Abraham offered Lot his choice of property, either on his left hand or on his right. Lot chose the more productive land to the east, and so Abraham took the land to the west. In course of time, Lot and all of his household were captured in battle and taken to Dan, over a hundred miles to the north. When Abraham heard of his fate, he armed 318 of his servants and went in pursuit. He not only rescued Lot and his family but also restored to them their property in Sodom. The king of Sodom returned from exile and, in gratitude, offered Abraham the spoils of the victory. But these Abraham declined, saying, “I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and … I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> In these episodes, Abraham demonstrated his fairness, integrity, and faith. And the Lord rewarded him with both spiritual and earthly blessings so that ultimately he prospered far more than Lot.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p6" pid="T2Iyk-phPUOWIQ3_q8spKw" hash="4KuISA">Honesty is a very important part of character. We have all seen men who think they are not accountable to the laws of men or of God. They seem to feel that the rules of human conduct do not apply to them. A popular philosophy is “What can I get away with?” As someone once said, “The difference between a moral man and a man of honor is that the latter regrets a discreditable act even when it has worked.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p7" pid="jsri6O34_kumOW62_V5lRg" hash="3zpODQ">Honesty begins when we are young. When I was 11 years old, I looked forward eagerly to my magical 12th birthday when I could become a deacon and a Scout. My mother helped me learn the Articles of Faith, the Scout Law and Motto, and other requirements so that I would have a good start when that special birthday arrived.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p8" pid="9hPGyeMWYkejh_O-WgmF-Q" hash="p28myw">Since I had no sisters, my brothers and I were given some of the inside chores as well as outside ones, such as milking and taking care of the animals. One day Mother left me to wash the dishes and clean the kitchen while she attended to a sick neighbor. I agreed to do these duties but put off doing the dishes. Time ran out and they didn’t get done. In fact, they didn’t even get started. When Mother came home and saw the kitchen, she put on her apron and went to the sink. She spoke only three words, which stung worse than the sting of a dozen hornets. They were the first three words of the Scout Law: “On my honor.” That day I resolved that I would never give my mother cause to repeat those words to me again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p9" pid="JQecX3oNhEm9ravJrN88HQ" hash="Ygp4gg">Our honor should make us honest in all we do. Some youths fail to honor debts to their parents. “May I borrow five dollars for the show?” That contains an implied promise to repay the debt, but the promise is made so casually that it is forgotten as it is spoken.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p10" pid="KpuOgchCn0SenUr_5RIKeA" hash="BcRiEg">We must be careful of the misuse of credit. The use of credit cards in many places has increased consumer debt to staggering proportions. I am reminded of the story of “an elderly farmer [who] wrote to a mail order house as follows: ‘Please send me one of the gasoline engines you show on page 787, and if it’s any good, I’ll send you a check.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p11" pid="3jjFmgZj_U2dvITJmQxmPA" hash="0C8rgA">“In time he received the following reply: ‘Please send check. If it’s any good, we’ll send the engine.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p12" pid="UNtojDwshUiSqY6AAJYm3A" hash="IT_48w">Contemporary society rushes headlong to accumulate the material goods of this world. This leads many to think they can alter the law of the harvest, reaping rewards without paying the price of honest toil and effort. Wishing to prosper immediately, they speculate in high-risk financial schemes that promote instant wealth. This all too frequently results in economic reverses, sometimes even financial ruin. In Proverbs we read, “A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p13" pid="X0hhYTPcpUSWFmUghOddCA" hash="MZBp0A">As members of the Church and particularly as holders of the priesthood, we believe in being chaste. There is no different or double standard for moral cleanliness for men and women in the Church. In fact, I believe holders of the priesthood have a greater responsibility to maintain standards of chastity before marriage and fidelity after marriage. The Lord has said, “Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> This means being pure in thought as well as in deed. The Prophet Joseph Smith stated, “If we would come before God, we must keep ourselves pure, as He is pure.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> If husband and wife will remain pure and chaste, completely devoted to each other during the storms and sunshine of life, their love for one another will deepen into something of supernal fulfillment. An early LDS Apostle, Parley P. Pratt, said, “From this union of affection, springs all the other relationships, social joys and affections diffused through <span class="emphasis">every</span> branch of human existence.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

We are grateful for the 58,000-plus missionaries who are currently serving. The First Presidency have the opportunity to meet with many ambassadors, prime ministers, rulers, and prominent public and political figures from all over the world. Frequently they say: “We have met your missionaries. We have seen them in many places.” Sometimes these prominent people visit the Missionary Training Center in Provo and see the thousands of missionaries there. These officials always seem to be greatly impressed. The missionaries appear well groomed and dignified. Sometimes they say, “We would like our children to be associated with your young people at one of your schools.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p15" pid="ykD5GxWDDUKvJKBcReFoIg" hash="wRykhA">Being a missionary is a continuing responsibility. Returned missionaries need to be exemplary in living the principles which they taught to others in the mission field. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “Please, you returned missionaries … , please do not abandon in appearance or principle or habit the great experiences of the mission field when you were like Alma and the sons of Mosiah, as the very angels of God to the people you met and taught and baptized. We do not expect you to wear a tie, white shirt, and a dark blue suit every day now that you are back in school. But surely it is not too much to ask that your good grooming be maintained, that your personal habits reflect cleanliness and dignity and pride in the principles of the gospel you taught. We ask you for the good of the kingdom and all those who have done and yet do take pride in you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

Elder Clinton Cutler exemplified how hope, perseverance, and steadfastness call forth the blessings of heaven. He literally became an instrument in the hands of the Lord. Clint and Carma Cutler were high school sweethearts. They began married life by attending college on a basketball scholarship. But they soon became pressed financially, so Clint went to work for the telephone company. His first job was washing, greasing, and maintaining the company trucks. That led to work in the central office as a cable repairman. For three and a half years Clint worked full time and went to college full time. He graduated in December 1960 with honors. By that time he had four children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p17" pid="SUxypCXqQkqerGekS6IdIw" hash="Lc0yYA">A series of transfers and promotions followed. In 1963, while serving in Riverdale, Utah, Clint was called to be a bishop. Three years later they moved to Midvale, Utah, where Clint was called to be the second counselor in the stake presidency.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p18" pid="sj5jqAt11UGCDLIYxowAcg" hash="ilRVYQ">After another three years, Clint was transferred to Denver, where he was called as president of the Littleton Colorado Stake. Other moves followed, one taking them to Boise, Idaho, where he was called to be the president of the Boise Idaho West Stake. Another transfer brought them back to Salt Lake City, where Clint was called as a regional representative. His final promotion, in 1984, was as assistant vice president/director of marketing operations. His company seemed to transfer him where the Lord needed him.</p>

In April 1990 his final call to service came to serve as a General Authority in the Second Quorum of the Seventy. His call to serve ended with his death on April 9, 1994, following a heroic struggle with cancer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p20" pid="DFDaMnuLCUGHdE6-oN9Cpg" hash="74MOlA">I do not wish to imply that presiding callings nor career promotions are the measure of faithfulness and worthiness. They are not and never have been. We have all been richly blessed by the humble, faithful teachers who have taught us the gospel by precept and example. But Elder Cutler’s example shows that faith, hope, and perseverance help our Father in Heaven to strengthen us and enhance our abilities and opportunities, however ordinary they may be.</p>

We do not seek a veneer painted on by a worldly brush but the pure, innate beauty that God has planted in our souls. We should seek after those things that endow higher thoughts and finer impulses. Man, as President John Taylor once said, “is destined, if he improves his opportunities, to higher and greater blessings and glory than are associated with this earth in its present state: … he may stand pure, virtuous, intelligent, and honourable, as a son of God, and seek for, and be guided and governed by his Father’s counsels.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Indeed we may say with President Brigham Young that we hope “to be gentle and kind, modest and truthful, to be full of faith and integrity, … [for] goodness sheds a halo of loveliness around every person who possesses it, making their countenances beam with light, and their society desirable because of its excellency.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p22" pid="G-lxwWtT3kSyrrZpJZCuMA" hash="Iw1kHw">In the history of this Church, we have “endured many things.” As we look forward to the future, we “hope to be able to endure all things.” I am confident that we will do so, even though no one knows fully what may lie ahead. How will we endure all things? The answer is amazingly simple: We shall do so by faith, by unity, and by following the prophets of God. It has been so in the past; it will be so in the future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/we-seek-after-these-things.p23" pid="-MmLkzxC2UKu-6znO7EvtQ" hash="UImaJA">In His infinite wisdom, since the beginning of the earth, God has led His people through prophets. Only one person, however, can exercise all of the keys of authority at one time. In our day, that prophet is President Gordon B. Hinckley. As we see the wondrous worldwide programs of the Church, who can doubt President Hinckley’s prophetic leadership? We all pray that God will continue to bear him up and magnify him in every way. Sustaining fully President Hinckley and those associated with him as prophets, seers, and revelators will help us to endure all things. That we may do so I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Great was the suffering and terrible were the consequences to all involved in that war. Millions lost their lives. Although my father was not killed, he carried mental and physical scars until he died. Despite his terrifying experiences, he prefaced his diary as follows: “If I had to do it again, I would do it because it was my duty.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> As we traveled 80 years later through the beautiful countryside, we visited battle sites and cemeteries of the combatants on both sides. In the military cemetery outside Paris, with my hand resting on Stanford Hinckley’s cross, I called President Hinckley on a cellular phone to express my feelings on that occasion.</p>

We eventually became acquainted with these relatives and found them to be decent, God-fearing Christians. They had nothing to do with the grand geopolitics or causes of the war. Like my father, they were serving their country because it was their duty. World War I and the wars that followed brought such great suffering and caused the deaths of countless innocent people. In its simplest terms, wars are so often caused by a great lust for power.</p>

Power is highly attractive. It can be both good and bad. In your formative years, you young men are attracted to power figures of one kind or another. These often include sports idols, entertainers, people of wealth, and those who have political power. Unfortunately, some young men, particularly those who fall short scholastically, who don’t make the team, or who are not chosen to sing in a specially selected choir may feel rejected and be lured into groups that they think will compensate for their inadequacies. This hunger for acceptance or power draws them like a moth to a flame to street gangs and other associations that can be violent and encourage habits which are dangerous to the body and to the soul.</p>

It is the priesthood of God. In complete contrast to other power sources, the holy priesthood, through its proper exercise, continues to build spiritual and physical strength which endures through the eternities. It is”inseparably connected with the powers of heaven” and can be “handled only upon the principles of righteousness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Regarding the priesthood, the Prophet Joseph Smith stated: “[It] is the channel through which all knowledge, doctrine, the plan of salvation, and every important matter is revealed from heaven. … It is the channel through which the Almighty … has continued to reveal Himself to the children of men to the present time, and through which He will make known His purposes to the end of time.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

As the Prophet Joseph observed, “The Lord gave us power in proportion to the work to be done, and strength according to the race set before us, and grace and help as our needs required.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> As an example, the prophet Elijah, using his priesthood, was able to call forth fire from heaven to demonstrate the power of God.</p>

Brown was a General Authority, he served in England as an officer in the Canadian army and had great power. Men stood at attention before him and called him “sir.” One day Brother Brown received a message that he was wanted in the hospital. When he got there, someone directed him to a little room where a sick young man lay. Brother Brown remembered that he had once been that young man’s Sunday School teacher. “Brother Brown,” said the young man, “would you use your authority in my behalf? The doctors say I cannot live. Will you give me a blessing?” All the pride Brother Brown felt in wearing the uniform of the king disappeared as he laid his hands upon the boy’s head and gave him a blessing. The help that the boy needed was not from any authority of an officer in the king’s army but from the authority of the priesthood.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

Indeed, we can enjoy priesthood power only when we do our duty. The priesthood of this Church has in the past received some hard lessons regarding its duty. The early brethren were untested and untried. Under the Prophet Joseph’s leadership, the Lord taught them and sifted them. They were persecuted and driven unmercifully in learning to do their duty. Many failed. Three times some of the early brethren endured searing, refining trials before they ultimately found refuge in these mountain valleys.</p>

Here I learned to strain wigglers with my teeth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> The next day, an exhausted Solomon Humphrey lay down on the ground and fell asleep. “When he awoke he saw a rattlesnake coiled up within one foot of his head … [lying] between him and his hat, which he had in his hand when he fell asleep. The brethren gathered around him, saying, ‘It is a rattlesnake, let us kill it.’ Brother Humphrey said, ‘No!

Smith recorded: “The Prophet Joseph took a full share of the fatigues of the entire journey. In addition to the care of providing for the Camp and presiding over it, he walked most of the time and had a full proportion of blistered bloody and sore feet, which was the natural result of walking from 25 to 40 miles a day in a hot season of the year. But during the entire trip he never uttered a murmur or complaint, while most of the men in the Camp complained to him of … scanty supply of provisions, poor quality of bread, … maggotty bacon and cheese, &amp;c. … Yet we were the Camp of Zion, and many of us were prayerless, thoughtless, careless, heedless, foolish or devilish … . Joseph had to bear with us and tutor us, like children.

They learned that faith is more important than life itself. At a conference held February 14, 1835, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the Seventy were chosen from the ranks of those who had served in Zion’s Camp.

As a boy I learned a great lesson of faith and sacrifice as I worked on my grandfather’s farm during the terrible economic depression of the 1930s. The taxes on the farm were delinquent, and Grandfather, like so many, had no money. There was a drought in the land, and some cows and horses were dying for lack of grass and hay. One day when we were harvesting what little hay there was in the field, Grandfather told us to take the wagon to the corner of the field where the best stand of hay stood and fill the wagon as full as we could and take it to the tithing yard as payment of his tithing in kind.</p>

I even questioned if the Lord expected that much sacrifice from him. Ultimately, I marveled at his great faith that somehow the Lord would provide. The legacy of faith he passed on to his posterity was far greater than money, because he established in the minds of his children and grandchildren that above all he loved the Lord and His holy work over other earthly things. He never became wealthy, but he died at peace with the Lord and with himself.</p>

Moyle, who lived in my ward when I was serving as a young bishop. One tithing settlement, President Moyle came in and declared, “Bishop, this is a full tithe and a little bit more, because that’s the way we have been blessed.”</p>

Tithing is a principle of sacrifice and a key to the opening of the windows of heaven. In Primary I memorized the tithing poem: “What is tithing? I will tell you every time. Ten cents from a dollar, and a penny from a dime.” But I did not understand it fully until it was taught by Grandfather and President Henry D. Moyle.</p>

You pay 10 percent, and you don’t have to be ashamed if you haven’t earned very much. If you make lots of money, you pay 10 percent. If you make very little, you still pay 10 percent.

I do not see any other solution.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Indeed, I believe it is possible to break out of poverty by having the faith to give back to the Lord part of what little we have.</p>

Through Malachi the Lord asks: “Will a man rob God? … But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> If we will trust in the Lord, He will open the windows of heaven to us as we give back to Him the one-tenth He asks of us.

It is also a great blessing for the bishops to have this experience. I remember a man in our ward who had a large family who would bring all of his children with him when he came to tithing settlement. Starting with the youngest, he would ask each one to report to the bishop as to whether their contributions constituted a tithe. When all of the children had reported, he would report for his wife and his family. This family was abundantly blessed for their faithfulness.</p>

The need for temples all over the world is great. This is because they are spiritual sanctuaries. Those who attend the temples can find protection against Satan and his desire to destroy them and their families. To Church members in isolated communities of the Church who want to have a temple in their midst, I would suggest that you first show your faith by paying your tithing so that you are worthy to receive temple blessings. As the Lord revealed to the elders of the Church in Kirtland, “Now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

He expects us, as a condition of faithfulness, to pay our tithing and our fast offerings to help the poor and the needy. But we are privileged to make other offerings, not by way of assignment, assessment, or ecclesiastical direction. Among these are donations to the General Missionary Fund, Humanitarian Aid Fund, and the Book of Mormon Fund. We are also privileged to voluntarily contribute to building the new temples President Hinckley has announced.</p>

She said: “I decided when I wanted to spend any money on myself I would forgo it and put the money into the temple fund. This meant no new clothes or shoes, books, hair appointments, necklaces, or anything of a personal nature until I reached my goal. I thought this would be a sacrifice, but instead I have found joy in it. It has been a rewarding and fulfilling experience.”</p>

Recently I attended sacrament meeting in my own ward. Before the meeting began, a few people handed contribution envelopes to the members of the bishopric. They came with a smile and a happy countenance. These envelopes contained their tithes and other offerings which they were joyfully paying as a humble expression of their gratitude for the Lord’s blessings. This was a testament of their faith.</p>

To be faithful members of this Church requires sacrifice and consecration. It means that worldly pleasures and earthly possessions should not be our principal aim in life, because the gift of eternal life requires a willingness to sacrifice all we have and are in order to obtain it.</p>

He commanded David to offer a sacrifice at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. When David went to see Araunah, and Araunah found out why he had come, he generously offered to give him whatever was needed for the sacrifice. David’s response was profound: “I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> He bought the threshing floor, offered the sacrifice, and the plague ceased.</p>

If something can be had cheaply, without exertion or sacrifice, people do not mind having a little bit of it. In contrast, the blessings of membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints require both exertion and sacrifice. Receiving the blessings requires the payment of tithes and offerings. Ours is not a Sunday-only religion. It demands exemplary conduct and effort every day of the week. It involves accepting calls and serving with fidelity in those callings. It means strength of character, integrity, and honesty to the Lord and our fellowmen. It means that our homes need to be places of sanctuary and love. It means a relentless battle against the bombardment of worldly evils. It means, at times, being unpopular and politically incorrect.</p>

It is a great time of vast spiritual outreach all over the world. It is marvelous to behold. It is the work of God. It is directed by the head of this Church who is our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ. President Gordon B. Hinckley is His prophet, seer, and revelator. I believe President Hinckley’s inspired leadership blesses all mankind.</p>

From this vantage point, we need to remember that the most significant events in the last 2,000 years were not the marvels of science, technology, and travel. They were the Savior’s Atonement and the restoration of the gospel, with the priesthood keys and authority. These two singular events will continue to be of transcendent importance to mankind as we move forward in time. The past, present, and future pivot on these marvelous divine interventions.</p>

The hundred years just completed were the most momentous in the history of man upon this planet. It would be impossible in a hundred days to make even a brief summary of the notable events, the marvelous developments, the grand achievements and the beneficial inventions and discoveries, which mark the progress of the ten decades now left behind in the ceaseless march of humanity. The very mention of the nineteenth century suggested advancement, improvement, liberty and light. Happy are we to have lived amidst its wonders and shared in the riches of its treasures of intelligence!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

The age of the telephone and electricity was just dawning. There was no air travel, no E-mail, no fax machines, no Internet. There has been an explosion of secular knowledge. I believe that God has opened up these treasures of intelligence to enhance His purposes on the earth. The new century will bring exponential advances in that treasury.</p>

This is our time, and it involves more than just looking at the clock. Some of us are watching our clocks quite anxiously as they tick their way inexorably into the next century. Our awareness of time affects how we think and act. This is illustrated by the story about the clock in a restaurant window. It “had stopped a few minutes past noon. One day a friend asked the owner if he knew the clock was not running. ‘Yes,’ replied the restaurant man, ‘but you would be surprised to know how many people look at that clock, think they are hungry, and come in to get something to eat.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

What are most people hungry for? I believe it is spiritual and moral leadership. Increases in technology, scientific inventions, and medical miracles have been marvelous and incredible. But we must use them properly to bring us joy, and that requires spiritual and moral leadership. Civilization has been around for a long time. While computers are a great convenience and wonderfully helpful in reducing drudgery, we are reminded that the Nephites “lived after the manner of happiness”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> even without computers. Electronic marvels can actually bring some pitfalls. For example, surfing the Internet may draw us into that which, if pursued, can destroy our marriages, our homes, and even our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/this-is-our-day.p9" pid="PManMIvLi0GnOdLcIWQEog" hash="jiM7PQ">Today many people are obsessed with the Y2K problem and worry about the date coming up right because of the way computers measure time. As someone once said about time: “[It] changes with time: in youth, time marches on; in middle age, time flies; and in old age, time runs out.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> We have come to rely on electronics for much of our daily work, and we are naturally concerned about the need to reprogram computers to move into the next century. While some glitches may occur, I am optimistic that no great catastrophic computer breakdown will disrupt society as we move into the next century. I have a far greater fear of the disruption of the traditional values of society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/this-is-our-day.p10" pid="IV1SZ2KyZ0exxq9RrMZ-Lg" hash="9Mq7Yg">Indeed, I am more concerned about the failure of our moral computers of honesty, integrity, decency, civility, and sexual purity. How many people today are truly incorruptible? So many get caught up in waves of popular issues and tides of rhetoric. This breakdown of moral values is happening because we are separating the teachings of God from personal conduct. An honorable man or woman will personally commit to live up to certain self-imposed expectations, with no need of an outside check or control. I would hope that we can load our moral computers with three elements of integrity: dealing justly with oneself, dealing justly with others, and recognizing the law of the harvest.</p>

Growth in membership, the number of new temples, and the inspired organization are all in place to move with strength into the next century. Having the images of technology in our minds is commendable, but in order to move forward spiritually we need to have the Savior’s image in our countenances<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> and in our hearts.</p>

This solitary figure, Jesus of Nazareth, without position or status or wealth, changed the world. So far as we know, during His life He owned no land nor any worldly things except the simple clothes He wore.</p>

He taught of love, the doctrines of hope and salvation, the pathway for peace in this world and the world to come. He spoke of the Resurrection, when spiritual darkness would be removed and the bright light and hope of eternal life given to all mankind.</p>

With their primitive means of travel and communication, this small missionary band went forward boldly with this new message of hope. They did a majestic work in carrying the inspired doctrines of Christ far and wide.</p>

Media referrals are introducing our missionaries to more investigators. Church-produced videos help the missionaries explain the gospel message and the mission of the Church. But are we as individuals doing our part to move this holy work forward? Today the information highway, with all of its means of communication, affords an opportunity for us to carry the mission with a thousandfold greater speed and ease than Peter, James, and John and the other intrepid disciples. Thousands of messengers, their feet shod with the gospel of peace, now go forth with the message of God.</p>

In the late 1950s, as the jet age began, President David O. McKay boarded a jet after dedicating the temple in New Zealand. As he arrived in Los Angeles, he said to Elder Henry D. Taylor and others, “Brethren, next Thursday when the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve meet, I am going to recommend that a stake be organized in New Zealand.” He then said, “With these fast planes it will be possible for the General Authorities to travel swiftly to any part of the world, to visit stakes as they are organized.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> We now have hundreds of stakes outside of the United States.</p>

In this pursuit, we could become technologically wise but spiritually illiterate. Undoubtedly, education unlocks the doors of the future for us. But we should be sure that our computers of faith are working so that we can constantly remain on the course of righteousness. We can do this with daily prayer, scripture reading, family home evenings, and keeping our covenants and ordinances on a daily basis. Our worship needs to go deeper than the outward symbols, embracing the simple, profound principles of human conduct embodied in the Savior’s teachings: “Repent and [turn] unto me with full purpose of heart.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> We should in faith “become as [little children] and be baptized in [His] name.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> The Savior’s injunction to us is, “Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/this-is-our-day.p20" pid="LXxOWJc1X0C-gnSq-HBgCA" hash="XxBaAg">The most difficult of all challenges given to us is, “I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> Perfection is an eternal goal. While we cannot be perfect in mortality, striving for it is a commandment, which ultimately, through the Atonement, we can keep. Remember, the marvels of modern science and technology will not exalt us. Indeed, the great challenge we face as we prepare for the future is to be more spiritually enlightened. All of this new, expanding intellectual property must certainly be mastered through great effort and learning. But technical savvy is not fully useful unless there is a spiritual purpose and meaning to it. I am certain the Lord expects us to apply it to the advancement of His purposes and the blessing of mankind, but we must adopt those lofty ideals as personal goals and desires before we can direct technology to those purposes.</p>

We can do this by following the direction set by President Hinckley, the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the other General Authorities. Much of our work ought to focus on changing our own lives and thinking. It should encompass what the Savior called the new commandment: “That ye love one another.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> To all of us, the feeding of His sheep is a continuing responsibility.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>

I believe the future holds greater blessings for mankind than ever before. I rejoice in this great outpouring of spiritual knowledge, when “the earth [is being] filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> Knowledge and intelligence are dropping “as the gentle rain from heaven”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> to bless all of our lives. We should seize every opportunity to move forward in faith, looking beyond the year 2000 into a future bright with hope, acknowledging that all good gifts come by divine providence. With such increased knowledge comes a higher responsibility. If we work hard, wisely manage our personal stewardships, and live providently, the Lord will prosper us in our use of this heightened knowledge to advance His holy work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/this-is-our-day.p23" pid="DiUpAOafwES5IlWr1R85XA" hash="QY-kZg">President Gordon B. Hinckley is the prophet for our day and time. He is keenly aware of this higher responsibility and is energetically doing all he can to bring about God’s purposes on earth. Each of us needs to do all we can to help move this work forward. As the Psalmist said, “This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span> I have a conviction of this and so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I have prayed for guidance in what I should say because I wish to raise a warning voice. In today’s society, the difference between right and wrong is being obscured by loud, seductive voices calling for no restraints in human conduct. They advocate absolute freedom without regard to consequences. I state unequivocally that such behavior is the high road to personal destruction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p2" pid="NMzfJN8h9k6xfjGymhHm8g" hash="PZ0evw">Tonight I speak to the priesthood of this Church, and particularly to the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, about how to become really free. Obedience leads to true freedom. The more we obey revealed truth, the more we become liberated. President David O. McKay spoke about his horse Dandy, who wanted complete freedom and no restraints. President McKay said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p3" pid="Bzofxr4_eEi6w4GX1NJwTA" hash="KG_rzQ">“Under the saddle he was as willing, responsive, and cooperative as a horse could be. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p4" pid="AQdfTMupyE-EM2bv6gBDOg" hash="jIiEUA">“But Dandy resented restraint. He was ill-contented when tied and would nibble at the tie-rope until he was free. He would not run away, he just wanted to be free. Thinking other horses felt the same, he would proceed to untie their ropes. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p5" pid="fuMJiKq92E6q0OgIHtXE6w" hash="ZDr-Yw">“… His curiosity and desire to explore the neighborhood led him and me into trouble. Once on the highway he was hit by an automobile. …</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p7" pid="xg9Ki3WnJkez6sLjM4n2Ng" hash="CNQlUw">“One day, however, somebody left the gate unwired. Detecting this, Dandy unlatched it and took another horse … with him, and together they … went to an old house used for storage. Dandy’s curiosity prompted him to push open the door. … There was a sack of grain. What a find! Yes, and what a tragedy. The grain was bait for rodents! In a few minutes Dandy and the other horse were in spasmodic pain, and shortly afterwards both were dead.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p8" pid="8kockCCdMEaM3fKzXjEDyw" hash="-1Y62Q">President McKay continued: “How like Dandy are many of our youth! … They are impulsive, full of life, full of curiosity. … They, too, are restive under restraint, but if they are kept busy, guided carefully and rightly, they prove to be responsive and capable; but if left to wander unguided, they all too frequently violate principles of right which often lead to snares of evil, disaster, and even death.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p9" pid="TjSzCxtja0qn7qv15TG5rA" hash="Klqr_Q">Being bridled, or yielding obediently to restraint, is necessary for our personal growth and progression. Recently a nationally broadcast program talked about wild horses that are being tamed by prisoners. As the prisoners formed friendships with the horses, they learned about patience, controlling tempers, respect for others, and the value of working within a system. As they watched the horses learn to be obedient to their commands, they realized how they could have avoided the terrible mistakes that had put them in prison. I add that obedience to righteous principles would have offered them freedom from social diseases, shame, degradation, and feelings of guilt. Like the horses, they could still learn, progress, and achieve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p10" pid="5_gj3vWYCUivnd39CigIdA" hash="F2C5sQ">We hear many persuasive voices demanding freedom from restrictions, particularly from moral restraints. However, we learn from the history of the earth that any successful society has had boundaries. Consider the earth itself. It was formed out of matter and in the beginning was empty, desolate, and dark. Then came order as God commanded that the light should be divided from the darkness. God’s command was obeyed, and the earth had its first day, followed by its first night. Then God ordered the creation of the atmosphere. He organized the sun, the moon, and the stars to shine in their appropriate times and seasons. After a series of commands and obedience to commands, the earth not only became habitable but beautiful.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Recalling the view they had of the enormity of the heavens from the space shuttle <span class="emphasis">Discovery,</span> he commented that to orbit the earth is to recognize that we are all children of God and that the earth operates in obedience to God’s laws. He spoke also of the magnificent beauty of the earth from space and that it is absolutely breathtaking.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p12" pid="823lkW6DwES6LV_ctHNiGQ" hash="P9fQ5g">This earth on which we dwell is an individual planet occupying a unique place in space. But it is also part of our solar system, an orderly system with eight other planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies that orbit the sun. Just as the earth is a planet in its own right, so each of us is an individual in our own sphere of habitation. We are individuals, but we live in families and communities where order provides a system of harmony that hinges on obedience to principles. Just as order gave life and beauty to the earth when it was dark and void, so it does to us. Obedience helps us develop the full potential our Heavenly Father desires for us in becoming celestial beings worthy someday to live in His presence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p13" pid="fh3vxS3s8UmpDptJfYe-tw" hash="XKP8vQ">Now, brethren, another element of freedom is trust. Almost 60 years ago, when I was going on my first mission, President McKay taught us missionaries a great truth. Without a word, he walked over to the blackboard, picked up a piece of chalk, and wrote, “It is better to be trusted than to be loved.” I have pondered that statement and have seen some fine examples of it. I will relate one example from the scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p14" pid="x572WGJ5nkyNf38cSA0Tjg" hash="Y7Io5g">Joseph, the son of Jacob and Rachel, was sold into slavery in Egypt. Because of treachery in the house of Potiphar, Joseph went to prison. Pharaoh had two troubling dreams. Hearing of Joseph’s discernment from the captain of the prison guard, he sent for him to interpret the dreams. Joseph told him, through inspiration, that seven years of plenty would be followed by seven years of famine. Pharaoh not only recognized this true interpretation, but he trusted Joseph and appointed him to be second only to Pharaoh in power. The years passed and the famine came. In time Joseph rescued all of his brothers and his father from starvation.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Because he earned the implicit trust of those who were over him, Joseph enjoyed a great amount of freedom. Like Joseph, you too can be trusted by others, but trust must be earned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p15" pid="gBByNh9CBku1iq32zbDGGw" hash="IzSFyQ">As in all things, the Savior is our pattern. The Apostle Paul wrote, “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> In our own finite way, we too can learn obedience even as Christ did. As young children we learn respect for authority as we obey our parents, thus earning their trust. If we don’t obey, we are like the boy Jack whose father said to him, “Every time you disobey, I get another gray hair.” “Wow, Dad,” Jack answered, “so it was you who gave Grandpa all his gray hair.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Hopefully in the schoolroom we learn other lessons of discipline that help us to get along with others. When obedience becomes our goal, it is no longer an irritation; instead of a stumbling block, it becomes a building block.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p16" pid="VUd9X8VNzEa73fXgGPoQKw" hash="N-htaA">Obedience to the Word of Wisdom keeps us from addictions so we do not become slaves to alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. Our bodies will be healthy and our minds clear because the promise associated with this principle is that “all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p17" pid="8uxzCMi-h02AbH4Ef68I1Q" hash="jZM2rQ">An additional promise in this revelation says we “shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> So by obedience we also gain knowledge. As the Savior said, “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

If we have firmly made up our minds to follow the commandments, we will not have to redecide which path to take when temptation comes our way. That is how obedience brings spiritual safety.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p19" pid="T6qM-4_ErUGwFQPgm6pM5w" hash="f-utlg">Brethren, another aspect of obedience is our obedience to spiritual promptings. This too can be liberating. How many times have we felt regret for ignoring a prompting from a higher source?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p20" pid="9DbWfiNbJkm9YF7nKrY5AA" hash="Qtg8Gg">Ephraim Hanks is a remarkable example of a young man’s obedience to spiritual promptings. In the fall of 1856, after he had gone to bed, he heard a voice say to him, “The handcart people are in trouble and you are wanted; will you go and help them?” Without any hesitation he answered, “Yes, I will go if I am called.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p21" pid="TZM73SoWAU2Yb9zrBv2TPQ" hash="WBCi-g">He rode quickly from Draper to Salt Lake City. As he arrived he heard the call for volunteers to help the last handcart companies come into the valley. Eph jumped up and said, “I am ready now!” He was as good as his word, leaving at once and alone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p22" pid="NM5QtUQ6m0SJRJS9-EPY_w" hash="2VPCiw">A terrific storm broke as he took his wagon eastward over the mountains. It lasted three days, and the snow was so deep that it was impossible to move the wagons through it. So Eph decided he would go on horseback. He took two horses, one to ride and one to pack, and picked his way carefully through the snow to the mountains. Dusk came as he made his lonely camp at South Pass. As he was about to lie down he thought about the hungry Saints and instinctively asked the Lord to send him a buffalo. As he opened his eyes at the end of his prayer, he was startled at the sight of a buffalo standing barely 50 yards away. He took aim, and one shot sent the animal rolling down into the hollow where he was encamped.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p23" pid="r7lujHso6EyjrGxvBXTHnA" hash="HbM0ZA">Early next morning, he took the two horses and the buffalo meat and reached Ice Springs Bench. There he shot another buffalo, even though it was rare to find buffalo in this area this late in the season. After he had cut the meat into long strips, he loaded up his horses and resumed his journey. And now I quote from Eph’s own narrative:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p24" pid="6CCdMT3gh06aKTkh3joAlg" hash="SqTerw">“I think the sun was about an hour high in the west when I spied something in the distance that looked like a black streak in the snow. As I got near to it, I perceived it moved; then I was satisfied that this was the long looked for handcart company, led by Captain Edward Martin. … When they saw me coming, they hailed me with joy inexpressible, and when they further beheld the supply of fresh meat I brought into camp, their gratitude knew no bounds. Flocking around me, one would say, ‘Oh, please, give me a small piece of meat;’ another would exclaim, ‘My poor children are starving, do give me a little;’ and children with tears in their eyes would call out, ‘Give me some, give me some.’ … Five minutes later both my horses had been released of their extra burden—the meat was all gone, and the next few hours found the people in camp busily engaged in cooking and eating it, with thankful hearts.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p25" pid="x7p7rtkSrESH4hUQJLZrJg" hash="ELiocw">Certainly Ephraim Hanks’s obedience to spiritual promptings led him to become a vanguard hero as he forged ahead alone through that devastating winter weather to preserve many pioneer lives. Because he listened to the whisperings of the Spirit and obeyed the counsel of the Brethren, Eph became a notable liberating force in the lives of those desperate, struggling pioneers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p26" pid="8J__BPMSLUWY7C0d6WLh8Q" hash="5GODOQ">Freedom and liberty are precious gifts that come to us when we are obedient to the laws of God and the whisperings of the Spirit. If we are to avoid destruction, which was the fate of President McKay’s horse Dandy and his companion, fences or guardrails must be built beyond which we cannot go. The fences which we must stay within are the principles of revealed truth. Obedience to them makes us truly free to reach the potential and the glory which our Heavenly Father has in store for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/obedience-the-path-to-freedom.p27" pid="pn0GVSbTwkq9gBRZ6w24iA" hash="FL0Q2A">I testify to you of the importance of obedience. I also wish to testify to you, my brethren, of the prophetic mantle which rests upon President Hinckley, which enables him to receive the inspiration and guidance from the head of this Church, the Lord and Savior, which I do in His sacred name, even Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

A wave of comfort fell over me as I realized that I had not come to college with the blessing of just my earthly father. I suddenly felt that one day, not so long ago, my Heavenly Father had held me close in His arms. Perhaps He gave me words of advice and encouragement and told me that He believed in me, just as my earthly father had. And at that moment, I knew that I am never without the perfect love and endless support of my Father in Heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

We visited the small building where the Relief Society was organized with 18 members on March 17, 1842. A few days later, on April 28, 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, “This Society is to get instruction [through] the order which God has established—[through] the medium of those appointed to lead.” Then came this significant and far-reaching, prophetic statement: “And I now turn the key to you in the name of God and this Society shall rejoice and knowledge and intelligence shall flow down from this time—this is the beginning of better days to this Society.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

You younger sisters may feel that you do not have much in common as you meet with your mothers and grandmothers. However, as Bethany Collard, age 19, observed: “What Young Women starts to build … Relief Society continues to build and maintain.” She began to “see the good works that the members of Relief Society do” because good works are common to the sisters of all ages. Indeed, they are the threads that draw the sisters together regardless of age or circumstance. As Bethany said, “All of these things are characteristics of a divine woman who is a righteous daughter of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> As Emily H.

What point is there for me to go to Relief Society each week?” The answer to those questions may best be given by relating the story of a young piano student. His mother, wishing to encourage him, “bought tickets for a performance of the great Polish pianist, Paderewski. The night of the concert arrived and the mother and son found their seats near the front of the concert hall. While the mother visited with friends, the boy slipped quietly away.</p>

Only then did the audience notice the little boy on the bench, innocently picking out ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.’</p>

He whispered to the boy, ‘Don’t quit. Keep playing.’ And then, leaning over, the master reached down with his left hand and began filling in the bass part. Soon his right arm reached around the other side, encircling the child, to add a running obbligato. Together, the old master and the young novice held the crowd mesmerized.</p>

In the Garden of Eden, she and Adam were instructed not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. However, they were also reminded, “Thou mayest choose for thyself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> The choice was really between a continuation of their comfortable existence in Eden, where they would never progress, or a momentous exit into mortality with its opposites: pain, trials, and physical death in contrast to joy, growth, and the potential for eternal life. In contemplating this choice, we are told, “And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, … and a tree to be desired to make her wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and also gave unto her husband with her, and he did eat.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> And thus began their earthly probation and parenthood.</p>

All women have appealing features. I do not refer to model-type appeal, but rather that which comes from your personality, your attitude, and your expressions. I urge you to enhance the natural, God-given, feminine gifts with which you have been so richly blessed. None of you should be so content that you cease to care about how you look or act. In his day, President Brigham Young encouraged women to get an education. This is still good counsel, but I hasten to add: in all your getting, do not lose your sweet femininity.</p>

You sisters enrich all of humanity. All human life begins with you. Each woman brings her own separate, unique strengths to the family and the Church. Being a daughter of God means that if you seek it, you can find your true identity. You will know who you are. This will make you free—not free from restraints, but free from doubts, anxieties, or peer pressure. You will not need to worry, “Do I look all right?” “Do I sound OK?” “What do people think of me?” A conviction that you are a daughter of God gives you a feeling of comfort in your self-worth. It means that you can find strength in the balm of Christ. It will help you meet the heartaches and challenges with faith and serenity.</p>

It is a mistake for women to think that life begins only with marriage. A woman can and must have an identity and feel useful, valued, and needed whether she is single or married. She must feel that she can do something for someone else that no one else ever born can do.</p>

Perhaps she believed in the philosophy: “When fretted by this single life, which seems to be my lot, I think of all the many men whose wife I’m glad I’m not.” In any event, she was one of the first female medical doctors in the state of Utah. When I was a young boy, my brothers and I slept out in the enclosed back porch of our small home. One day I was jumping on the bed, trying to see how high I could go. I jumped too close to the wall and tore part of my face on a nail that was sticking out. I need some excuse for the way I look! Aunt Ada was called to come and sew up the wound. At other times, when we didn’t feel well, she fed us castor oil and milk of magnesia. She came with mustard plasters and burned our chests when we had colds. Today when I have aches and pains, which is becoming more frequent as I get older, I wish Aunt Ada were here to keep me healthy. Every time I look in the mirror and see the scar—a permanent record of my encounter with the nail—a great love for Aunt Ada swells in my consciousness. She filled a precious, loving role in my life.</p>

Temple worthiness affords a great spiritual protection even for sisters who do not have regular access to the blessings of the temple.

Through the miracle of life, we planted the seeds and produced delicious fresh peas, corn, carrots, turnips, onions, and potatoes from our own garden. I clearly remember a most meaningful experience when my grandfather showed us how to sow alfalfa seeds by hand. He had plowed and harrowed the ground to prepare the seedbed. Then he took a handful of seeds, and with a wide swing of his arm he artfully scattered them as he paced across the field in geometric patterns. Although birds ate some of the alfalfa seed, the crop grew, and the stand was rich and plentiful for many years.</p>

He taught that “some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</p>

The Savior also explained the meaning of the parable. The seed that “fell by the way side” represents those who hear the word of God but do not understand it and fall into the clutches of Satan. The second seed, which “fell upon stony places,” describes those who joyfully hear the word and thrive as long as all goes well. But when trials come and they feel peer pressure because of their beliefs, they are offended and do not endure. The third seed, which “fell among thorns,” represents those who hear the word, but worldliness and riches are more important to them, and they fall away from the truth. The last seed, however, which “fell into good ground,” represents those who hear the word, understand it, live it, and reap great eternal rewards.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

One of them was Simonds Ryder, who was ordained an elder on June 6, 1831, by Joseph Smith. After reading the revelation that pertained to him and finding that his name had been spelled “Rider” instead of “Ryder,” he became offended, apparently unaware that Joseph Smith often dictated revelations to his scribes. His disillusionment over the misspelling of his name led not only to his apostasy but ultimately to his infamy in helping to tar and feather the Prophet Joseph.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Like the seed that fell upon stony places, Simonds Ryder joyfully received the word at first but quickly became offended over a trivial matter and lost his place in the kingdom of God.</p>

He stated that he had kept all the Ten Commandments from his youth and asked, “What lack I yet?” Recognizing the young man’s attachment to his riches, Jesus taught him about a higher law of the gospel: “Sell [all] that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.” Matthew records, “When the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> The seed had been planted in this young man, but because of his riches, it had fallen among the thorns and became choked.</p>

We meet wonderful, stalwart members of the Church who are faithful and dedicated. Some of us who have sown seeds as missionaries may have felt that those seeds fell on hard ground. It is not always possible to know the consequences of one single contact. For years William R. Wagstaff, who served in the North Central States Mission from 1928 to 1930, felt disappointed he had not baptized more people.

The miracles of modern technology have brought efficiency into our lives in ways not dreamed of a generation ago, yet with this new technology has come a deluge of new challenges to our morals and our values. Some tend to rely more on technology than on theology. I hasten to add that scientific knowledge, the marvels of communication, and the wonders of modern medicine have come from the Lord to enhance His work throughout the world. As an example, the Church’s FamilySearch® Web site has more than seven million hits a day. But Satan, of course, is aware of this great progress in technology and likewise takes advantage of it for his purposes, which are to destroy and despoil. He delights in the pornography on the Internet and the sleaze in many of our movies and television shows. He has even engineered some of his own satanic messages into some of our modern music. For the seeds of faith to sprout in our lives, we must avoid Satan’s grasp.</p>

To do this we need to plow the soil through daily humble prayer, asking for strength and forgiveness. We need to harrow the soil by overcoming our feelings of pride. We need to prepare the seedbed by keeping the commandments to the best of our ability. We need to be honest with the Lord in the payment of our tithing and our other offerings. We need to be worthy and able to call forth the great powers of the priesthood to bless ourselves, our families, and others for whom we have responsibility. There is no better place for the spiritual seeds of our faith to be nurtured than within the hallowed sanctuaries of our temples and in our homes.</p>

You deacons and teachers do not have to determine your ultimate careers, yet you do need to lay the groundwork in preparation to meet life’s challenges and ultimately to provide for your future wives and families. In a way, young men who do not awaken early to their God-given talents and possibilities are not fully honoring their priesthood. I know that in some parts of the world this is a most difficult challenge, but opportunities for you young men will be enhanced if you will learn well a basic skill. It would benefit you young men if you would also learn another language. If you fail to prepare in your youth, it will be too late to begin preparation when you reach adulthood.</p>

He is a big, handsome, splendid young man who served in the Argentina Buenos Aires South Mission. One night, about 11 months into his mission, some armed robbers accosted Elder Voorheis and his companion. In a senseless act of violence, one of them shot Elder Voorheis in the head. For days he hovered between life and death, unable to speak, hear, move, or even breathe on his own. Through the faith and prayers of a host of people over a long period of time, he eventually was taken off life support and brought back to the United States.</p>

Progress was slow. His parents decided that they should bring their son home and care for him in the loving atmosphere of their own family. However, their modest home lacked the space or equipment to give the needed therapy. Many kind neighbors, friends, and benefactors pitched in to build an addition to the home and provide physical therapy equipment.</p>

He still wears his missionary badge. His parents do not ask, “Why did this happen to our noble son, who was serving at the call of the Master?” No one has a certain answer except perhaps in circumstances where higher purposes are served. We must walk in faith. We recall the Savior’s reply to the question, “Who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?” The Savior answered that no one was at fault but that the works of God might be manifest in him.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Rather than harbor bitterness, the members of the Voorheis family bow their heads and say to the Lord: “Thy will be done. We have been grateful for him every day of his life, and with the help of others we will willingly bear the burden of caring for him.”</p>

Some may ask, “Is there hope for Elder Voorheis in this life?” I believe there is great hope for everyone! Sometimes we ask God for miracles, and they often happen but not always in the manner we expect. The quality of Elder Voorheis’s life is less than desirable, but the influence of his life on others is incalculable and everlasting both here and in Argentina. Indeed, after his accident the Kilómetro 26 Branch, where he served in Argentina, grew rapidly and quickly qualified for the construction of a chapel.</p>

We can all find hope from our personal prayers and gain comfort from the scriptures. Priesthood blessings lift us and sustain us. Hope also comes from direct personal revelation, to which we are entitled if we are worthy. We also have the security of living in a time when a prophet who holds and exercises all of the keys of God’s kingdom is on the earth.</p>

How can we know that Jesus truly is our Savior and Redeemer? In human terms His reality is almost undefinable, but His presence can be known unequivocally by the Spirit if we continually seek to live under the shadow of His influence. In the Book of Mormon we read the account of Aaron expounding the gospel to Lamoni’s father. He told him, “If thou wilt bow down before God … and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> The old king followed this to the letter and received a witness of the truth that Aaron had imparted.

We are especially honored this evening to have President Gordon B. Hinckley, President Thomas S. Monson, and the other General Authorities with us. I commend Sister Nadauld, Sister Thomas, and Sister Larsen for their excellent messages. The music by this choir of young women has been outstanding. We appreciate those who have participated in the video and the hundreds who have written to the general Young Women presidency about how they can stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all places.</p>

She said: “My 5-year-old daughter asked me how many ‘Honeyhives’ I had. After a little discussion, I determined she was talking about Beehives. I counted the young women who were Beehives and told her. She had made a paper airplane for each young woman, and proceeded to count out the appropriate number of airplanes.</p>

Grant, the First Presidency wrote: “The true spirit of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints gives to woman the highest place of honor in human life. To maintain and to merit this high dignity she must possess those virtues which have always, and which will ever, demand the respect and love of mankind … [because] ‘a beautiful and chaste woman is the perfect workmanship of God.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> To occupy the highest place of honor places a responsibility on young women to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all places.</p>

Hopefully you will find joy in your womanhood during all stages of your life.</p>

Some of them were:</p>

Today such physical needs are met much more easily: flipping on a switch to control the light, adjusting the thermostat for heat and for cold. Modern conveniences grant us more free time to focus on spiritual needs and devote more time to personal service. But the basic element which should never change in the lives of righteous young women is giving service to others. Their divine role as caregivers helps noble womanhood gain “the highest place of honor in human life.” Serving others can begin at almost any age. Often the greatest service to others is one-on-one. It need not be on a grand scale, and it is noblest within the family.</p>

The opportunities for you young sisters in today’s world are endless. The recognition of the special gifts of women has been slow in coming. The <span class="emphasis">Woman’s Exponent</span> of 1872 reported that some who would improve women’s status “are so radical in their extreme theories that they would set her in antagonism to man, assume for her a separate and opposing existence; and to show how entirely independent she should be would make her adopt the more reprehensible phases of character which men present, and which should be shunned or improved by them instead of being copied by women.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

One of your unique, precious, and sublime gifts is your femininity, with its natural grace, goodness, and divinity. Femininity is not just lipstick, stylish hairdos, and trendy clothes. It is the divine adornment of humanity. It finds expression in your qualities of your capacity to love, your spirituality, delicacy, radiance, sensitivity, creativity, charm, graciousness, gentleness, dignity, and quiet strength. It is manifest differently in each girl or woman, but each of you possesses it. Femininity is part of your inner beauty.</p>

Do not limit yourselves. As you seek to know the will of our Heavenly Father in your life and become more spiritual, you will be far more attractive, even irresistible. You can use your smiling loveliness to bless those you love and all you meet, and spread great joy. Femininity is part of the God-given divinity within each of you. It is your incomparable power and influence to do good. You can, through your supernal gifts, bless the lives of children, women, and men. Be proud of your womanhood. Enhance it. Use it to serve others.</p>

We see women boxers and wrestlers as we flip through the television channels trying to find something uplifting. I believe the women of our time need to be strong, but not in that sense. In my opinion, these activities demean the nobility of womanhood. Young women need to be strong in righteousness, and, to quote your current theme, “to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

On April 17, 1999, a big van broadsided a car and severely injured 16-year-old Emily Jensen. Her skull was fractured, and she was in a coma for three months, and six months in the hospital. She has had to learn everything again as if from birth. It would have been easy to give up, but giving up is not in Emily’s vocabulary. She works so hard at recovery that she runs the equivalent of a 26-mile marathon every day. Her faith, courage, and perseverance have strengthened and motivated many other hospital patients.</p>

Even so, she fearlessly asks nurses, technicians, and therapists, “Are you a Mormon?” If they reply no, she tells them in her muddled sentences, “You should be. Read the Book of Mormon.” Emily dictated to her mother what she wanted written in five copies of the Book of Mormon that she gave to a doctor, three therapists, and a technician before she left the hospital.</p>

They prayed together in Emily’s hospital room. In language that was difficult to understand, but with a spirit that was strong and clear, Emily told her that she needed to go back to church. That technician later wrote Emily: “I want to thank you so much for the Book of Mormon you gave me. I cried when I read what you wrote. I know someday I will love this book as much as you do.”</p>

The student body picked her as this year’s prom queen in recognition of her extraordinary courage. Her classmates stood and cheered as she struggled to the stage of the packed auditorium, supported on the arm of the student body president. Though she continues to go each day for therapy, Emily’s life is still defined by her spiritual identity, her goodness, her kindness to others, and her strong testimony.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Hopefully the values and standards of Young Women will be increasingly focused on spirituality and service to others. In the future, as in the past, women will find happiness and fulfillment as they respond to the deepest feelings of their souls. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.” We will all have peace in our hearts and a knowledge of our true identity when we know, as Tevye said in <span class="emphasis">Fiddler on the Roof,</span> “who we are and what God expects us to be.”</p>

These goals, among others, should include education and skill training. A young mother whom I love recently told a group of young women that the goals should coincide with the joys of womanhood. But, she said, the goals should not be so rigid and fixed that you do not listen to the whisperings of the Spirit. Keep your hearts and minds open to know the overriding will of the Lord in your lives.</p>

It encompasses the way we act, how we speak, and how we dress. When you are considering a young man as a companion, you would do well to follow the advice given some years ago by President David O. McKay: He must never “attempt to take advantage of [you. If] … he shows [any] inclination to use you as a convenience or as a means of gratification, then you may [be sure] he is not prompted by love.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> It is very natural for young men and women to be attracted to each other, but they should be attracted in God-given ways rather than questionable ways, such as immodest dress. God-given attractions include your innate beauty, charm, decency, and goodness.</p>

Immodesty in women cheapens their image. It causes embarrassment and loss of respect. It is not likely to win them the hand of a worthy, honorable young man who desires to marry a righteous young woman in the temple. You young ladies may have a hard time buying a modest prom dress. May I suggest that you make your own? You may need some help, but plenty of help is available.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p1" pid="GJT1Z3sMYkWNXuQElD9Jqg" hash="SSz43Q">My beloved brothers and sisters, today is historic. This is the first general conference of this century and millennium, and the first one to be held in this great new Conference Center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I join with all of you in expressing admiration, respect, and appreciation for the vision of our great prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. His was the faith and courage to move forward with this great project.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p2" pid="cPda5JU0k02wIZIYdYSRqQ" hash="kgIRPw">With a tear of sadness, we leave our beloved Tabernacle, the traditional site for general conference. As President Hinckley has said, “We have outgrown it.” We pause to pay tribute to the faith, vision, and inspiration of Brigham Young and his associates who in faith built the Tabernacle, the construction of which is truly remarkable. I have been in the ceiling area of the Tabernacle, where the original rawhide bindings are still wrapped around the timbers of the roof structure. Although the timbers have since been reinforced with steel, the creative handiwork of the faithful pioneer Saints still stands as a symbol of their great faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p3" pid="R0uK5vOXoEqwyU6pmA0RCA" hash="VOtywQ">I believe the future will be great and marvelous in many respects. Opportunities for education and learning have increased and will continue to increase dramatically. One person defined it this way: “Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don’t.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Now and in the future, vast amounts of information are becoming more accessible worldwide through electronic devices in the home, the workplace, or the local library. However, great will be the challenges and endless the problems, because with this wave of knowledge, life actually becomes more complicated. Brigham Young said, “It was revealed to me in the commencement of this Church, that the Church would spread, prosper, grow and extend, and that in proportion to the spread of the Gospel among the nations of the earth, so would the power of Satan rise.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p4" pid="BkMI40ICfkWvaxW0FoaJBA" hash="YmZ09A">As we move into a new era, we have only one safe course: to press forward in faith. Faith will be our strong shield to protect us from the fiery arrows of Satan. Values should not change with time, because faith in Jesus Christ is indispensable to happiness and eternal salvation. The greatest century of advancement in science and technology has just ended. Yet a spirit of darkness prevails in our day as it did many centuries ago when Jesus Christ was about to be crucified. Even so, as the Prophet Joseph Smith said: “Great blessings await us at this time, and will soon be poured out upon us, if we are faithful in all things, for we are even entitled to greater spiritual blessings than they were, because they had Christ in person with them, to instruct them in the great plan of salvation. His personal presence we have not, therefore we have need of greater faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Faith is the first principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ as set forth by the Prophet Joseph: “We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> This faith will be the sanctuary for our souls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p5" pid="s04pmmGzMEiScmG-NiVY0Q" hash="6X6xJg">Never before in the history of the world has the need for faith in God been greater. Although science and technology open up boundless opportunities, they also present great perils because Satan employs these marvelous discoveries to his great advantage. The communication highway that spans the globe is overloaded with information for which no one bears responsibility for its truth or its source. Crime has become much more sophisticated and life more perilous. In war, killing has become far more efficient. Great challenges lie ahead unless the power of faith, judgment, honesty, decency, self-control, and character increases proportionately to compensate for this expansion of secular knowledge. Without moral progress, stimulated by faith in God, immorality in all its forms will proliferate and strangle goodness and human decency. Mankind will not be able to fully express the potential nobility of the human soul unless faith in God is strengthened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p6" pid="L9pys6XeJkmF4b0VUxWJGQ" hash="CNgg3g">In our time the belief that science and technology can solve all of mankind’s problems has become a theocracy. I would despair if I thought our eternal salvation depended on scientific, technical, or secular knowledge separate from righteousness and the word of God. The word of God as spoken by His prophets through the centuries justifies no other conclusion. Many believe that the transcendent answers to life’s questions lie in the test tube, in the laboratories, in the equations, and in the telescopes. This theocracy of science leaves out the ultimate answer to the overarching question, “Why?” Knowing cause and effect is fascinating but does not explain why we are here, where we came from, and where we are going. As Albert Einstein said, “I shall never believe that God plays dice with the world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p7" pid="zl-DpJVHNUihmUUEnZZgcg" hash="UKBw-A">President Harold B. Lee once said: “No matter what his progress in science, man must always be subject to the will and direction of Divine Providence. Man has never discovered anything that God has not already known.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p8" pid="nyhHcZMDmka4RNghyOcgKw" hash="pHuI6A">I do not believe that this great outpouring of knowledge happened by chance. All of this secular knowledge did not come solely from the creative minds of men and women. Mankind has been on the earth a long time. Over the centuries, knowledge came at a snail’s pace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p9" pid="_-G2bt9tPEmWk2-azb6F2w" hash="INni3A">I believe that the appearance of God the Father and His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, in 1820 to Joseph Smith unlocked the heavens not only to the great spiritual knowledge revealed in this dispensation but also to secular knowledge. “Anthropologists inform us that for thousands of years the average human being could expect to live about 25 to 30 years.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> But since the late 19th century, life expectancy worldwide has risen to 64 years.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> New ideas, including scientific inventions and discoveries of better ways of doing things, were being produced annually at 39 a year from 4,000 <small>B.C.</small> to <small>A.D.</small> 1, contrasted to 3,840 new ideas a year in the 19th century, while today they are created at the rate of 110,000 a year.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p10" pid="JOk1wWn3NUybCYDR0NXv2A" hash="RSTdtg">Now comes the challenge to prevent the scientific, technical, and intellectual from stifling the spiritual enlightenment in our lives. As someone once said, “The greatest of undeveloped resources [in our country] is faith; the greatest of unused power is prayer.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Technology may help us communicate with each other and the world, but not with God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p11" pid="GvDr-c8cQEWJH1PDs6JcuA" hash="tAlb9Q">I wish to sound a voice of warning to this people. I solemnly declare that this spiritual kingdom of faith will move forward with or without each of us individually. No unhallowed hand can stay the growth of the Church nor prevent fulfillment of its mission. Any of us can be left behind, drawn away by the seductive voices of secularism and materialism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p12" pid="nj0Tnrxk2EGZEw7-AYC8Yw" hash="_HmSmw">To sustain faith, each of us must be humble and compassionate, kind and generous to the poor and the needy. Faith is further sustained by daily doses of spirituality that come to us as we kneel in prayer. It begins with us as individuals and extends to our families, who need to be solidified in righteousness. Honesty, decency, integrity, and morality are all necessary ingredients of our faith and will provide sanctuary for our souls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p13" pid="P1NfFg8MIEODgjY8PRCVZw" hash="zW-zKg">Simple faith in God the Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost is like a supercharger operating in our lives. As Elder Charles W. Penrose said: “Some people will not believe anything they cannot grasp with their human reason or cannot see with their natural eyes. But blessed is the man of faith, blessed is the woman of faith! For by faith they can see into things that cannot be discerned by the natural eyes. They can reach out to the regions of immortality, grasp eternal realities and lay hold upon the things of God!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> This is so because through faith, our natural gifts and powers of achievement are increasingly enhanced.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p14" pid="8wqTareGJkKx6WV-lLApSw" hash="Ysx9sQ">Faith intensifies and magnifies our gifts and abilities. There is no greater source of knowledge than the inspiration that comes from the Godhead, who have all understanding and knowledge of that which has been, is now, and will be in the future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p15" pid="wz-oSTXmMUGNgBtnm69MYg" hash="-jzstw">At Haun’s Mill, a heroic pioneer woman, Amanda Smith, learned by faith how to do something beyond her abilities and the scientific knowledge of her time. On that terrible day in 1838, as the firing ceased and the mobsters left, she returned to the mill and saw her eldest son, Willard, carrying his seven-year-old brother, Alma. She cried, “Oh! my Alma is dead!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p16" pid="ryQ2DvmNjk-LyH50_FWBsw" hash="kx4ybA">“No, mother,” he said, “I think Alma is not dead. But father and brother Sardius are [dead]!” But there was no time for tears now. Alma’s entire hipbone was shot away. Amanda later recalled:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p17" pid="MMUPbq258UWXQhDoMcsKYw" hash="xOHzvA">“Flesh, hip bone, joint and all had been ploughed out. … We laid little Alma on a bed in our tent and I examined the wound. It was a ghastly sight. I knew not what to do. … Yet was I there, all that long, dreadful night, with my dead and my wounded, and none but God as our physician and help. ‘Oh my Heavenly Father,’ I cried, ‘what shall I do? Thou seest my poor wounded boy and knowest my inexperience. Oh, Heavenly Father, direct me what to do!’ And then I was directed as by a voice speaking to me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-shield-of-faith.p18" pid="Wj720Ku1wEWFKWYvAOhjNw" hash="slhYbg">“… Our fire was still smouldering. … I was directed to take … ashes and make a lye and put a cloth saturated with it right into the wound. … Again and again I saturated the cloth and put it into the hole … , and each time mashed flesh and splinters of bone came away with the cloth; and the wound became as white as chicken’s flesh.</p>

Near by was a slippery-elm tree. From this I was told to make a … poultice and fill the wound with it. … The poultice was made, and the wound, which took fully a quarter of a yard of linen to cover, … was properly dressed. …</p>

We are convened in the largest of all priesthood meetings ever held in any dispensation. We rejoice in the attendance of all of those beyond the great Conference Center numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Meeting for the first time in this new, grand edifice is a great moment in the history of humanity. We are indebted to the Lord, who inspired President Gordon B. Hinckley with the prophetic vision that brought about its construction and made it all possible. We thank Bishop H. David Burton, Bishop Richard C. Edgley, Bishop Keith B. McMullin, and all who have had anything to do with its construction. Now that we have it, we must use it to strengthen the faith of our people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-power-of-self-mastery.p2" pid="cMGu8eLxU0yjO2JxeOwsrg" hash="lhuoKA">Tonight, brethren, I should like to speak about the power of self-mastery in its larger sense. Self-mastery is essential to invoke the power of the priesthood of God. This is because this great, divine agency can only be exercised in righteousness. Self-mastery requires self-determination and strength of character. It enhances our own gifts and talents in a remarkable way. It is the power of noble manhood.</p>

One of these may be a bad temper. When I was a boy, I had red hair. At times my mother accused me of having a temper to go with it. They used to call me “Red.” Those were fighting words. I think I have learned to control it. Those with red hair are not the only ones that must learn to control an unruly temper. Willpower is necessary so that irritations do not take over our emotions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-power-of-self-mastery.p4" pid="NajCh2YYtUm1tbmp7KRccQ" hash="fjc0fA">A local newspaper recently reported on a phenomenon accompanying the increased traffic on our roads: “It is the normal scenario of rush-hour traffic: honking, tailgating, obscene gestures. Even outright violence is on the increase in our driving.” Sometimes tempers get out of control, and we call it “road rage.” I have often wondered why some men’s personalities change when they get behind the steering wheel of their car, secured by glass and metal. In some way this seems to excuse their rude behavior. Road rage is not caused by traffic congestion but by attitude. As some drivers become impatient and overaggressive, they may lose control and cause serious injury, even death, to others on the highway.</p>

Only we can control our appetites and passions. Self-mastery cannot be bought by money or fame. It is the ultimate test of our character. It requires climbing out of the deep valleys of our lives and scaling our own Mount Everests.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/04/the-power-of-self-mastery.p6" pid="ekMrVDsowki39VS8t4ptbg" hash="ul-dlw">As full-time missionaries we learn great lessons in self-mastery. We learn to get up when we should get up, to work when we should work, and to go to bed when we should go to bed. Full-time missionaries are generally admired and even respected, though their message may not be as well received as we would like. The First Presidency and others of the General Authorities meet with many heads of state, ambassadors, and ministers from all over the world. Frequently, when the subject comes up, these men of great power and influence speak with admiration and respect for the missionaries they have seen in their homelands.</p>

When they come home, some are criticized as being self-righteous for maintaining a decent appearance and keeping their hair trimmed neatly. I cannot understand why a returned missionary is considered self-righteous if he tries to live the standards and principles he has taught as a representative of the Lord to the people where he has served. Of course returned missionaries are not expected to wear white shirts and ties all of the time. But wearing sloppy clothes and weird hairstyles to supposedly look trendy is not proper for one who holds the divine commission of the priesthood. Returned missionaries are an example to the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, who will be the future missionaries. Often that which is <span class="emphasis">seen</span> by the Aaronic Priesthood is more powerful and persuasive than what is <span class="emphasis">said.</span></p>

Such peer pressure may cause them to do things they would not otherwise do. This is acting out of weakness, not strength. The Lord promises us through Moroni: “And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

It requires strength, willpower, and honesty. As the traffic on the communications highway becomes a parking lot, we must depend more and more on our own personal moral filters to separate the good from the bad. Marvelous as it is in many ways, there is something hypnotic about using the Internet. I refer specifically to spending endless time in chat rooms or visiting the pornography sites.</p>

In this realm, conscience is the only referee that can blow the whistle when we get out of control. If not bridled, our thoughts can run wild. Our minds are a part of us that really require discipline and control. I believe reading the scriptures is the best washing machine for unclean or uncontrolled thoughts. For those who are eligible and worthy, the sanctity of the holy temple can lift our thoughts above the earthy.</p>

If, as Samuel Johnson suggested, “language is the dress of thought,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> then the language we are hearing on television, in the movies, and even in our schools is a poor commentary on our current thinking. I worry about young people becoming desensitized as they continually hear or use this bad language. I believe that the young man of character is not coarse in his speech. Holders of the holy priesthood of God should never use foul language or obscene gestures.</p>

These might in one sense be called the “thorn in the flesh.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Harry Emerson Fosdick provides an important context for self-control: “Self-denial … is not the negative, forbidding thing that often we shake our heads about.

Alfred, Lord Tennyson, captured this when he penned, “My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> With all my heart I urge you wonderful young people not to take a secret shame with you to your marriage. You may never be able to forget it. You will want to go through life with the strength that comes from a clear conscience, which will permit you one day to stand before your Maker and say, “My soul is pure.” Self-denial is not restrictive. It is liberating. It is the pathway to freedom. It is strength. It is an essential element of purity. Shakespeare expressed it well through his character Hamlet:</p>

Grant was the first President of the Church I had the privilege of meeting. He was truly a great man. We admired him because part of his strength was his great determination for self-mastery. His father died when he was only a year old, and his widowed mother struggled to raise him. He was conscientious in helping her and trying to take care of her.</p>

His teammates teased him so much that … he … made up his mind that he was going to play with the nine who would win the championship of the Territory of Utah. He purchased a baseball and practiced hour after hour, throwing at a neighbor’s old barn. Often his arm would ache so much he could hardly … sleep at night.

His penmanship was so bad that when two of his friends looked at it, one said, “That writing looks like hen tracks.” “No,” said the other, “it looks as if lightning has struck an ink bottle.” This, of course, touched young Heber Grant’s pride. While he was still in his teens as a policy clerk in the office of H. R. Mann and Co., “he was offered three times his salary to go to San Francisco as a penman. He later became a teacher of penmanship and bookkeeping at the University of [Utah]. In fact, with a specimen he had written before he turned seventeen, he took first prize in a territorial fair against four professional penmen.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

As a small child, he could not carry a tune. When he was 10, a music instructor tried to teach him the simplest song and finally gave up in despair. At age 26, when he became an Apostle, he asked Professor Sims if he could teach him how to sing. After listening to him, Professor Sims replied, “Yes, you can learn to sing, but I would like to be forty miles away while you are doing it.” This only challenged him to try harder.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

Golden Kimball, President Grant “asked them if he could sing one hundred songs on the way. They thought he was joking and said, ‘Fine, go right ahead.’ After the first forty, they assured him if he sang the other sixty they would both have a nervous breakdown. He sang the other sixty.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

Even though our circumstances may be challenging, we can all strive for self-mastery. Great blessings of personal satisfaction come from doing so. Self-mastery is related to spirituality, which is the central quest of mortality. As President David O. McKay once said: “Spirituality is the consciousness of victory over self, and of communion with the Infinite. Spirituality impels one to conquer difficulties and acquire more and more strength. To feel one’s faculties unfolding and truth expanding the soul is one of life’s sublimest experiences.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> As a hopeless cripple, William Ernest Henley courageously looked beyond his outward physical condition to triumph in his heart and mind when he wrote “Invictus”:</p>

We are grateful for all you do to move this holy work forward in all of the world. I am humbled and honored to be one of you.</p>

Satan is still the captain of the hosts of evil. He is still tempting us just as he did Moses, saying, “Son of man, worship me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> As priesthood holders we are marshaled into the great army of righteousness to combat the forces of Lucifer. Each of us needs to train ourselves to be bold, disciplined, and loyal men of the priesthood who are prepared with the proper weapons to fight against evil and to win. Paul said these weapons are “the breastplate of righteousness,” “the shield of faith,” “the helmet of salvation,” and “the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p3" pid="f-cZs5FUl0W-HhtFEcZ9tg" hash="pLsx_w">Tonight I should like to speak about the battle that each of us has to wage within ourselves. President Joseph F. Smith taught us: “Our first enemy we will find within ourselves. It is a good thing to overcome that enemy first and bring ourselves into subjection to the will of the Father, and into strict obedience to the principles of life and salvation which he has given to the world for the salvation of men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> In simple terms, this means that we need to strengthen the good within us and to overcome the temptations of Satan. The direction finder is sure. Alma tells us, “Whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p4" pid="n3KFKwPVnUS_U0EM0jwI_Q" hash="iknvbg">Robert Louis Stevenson captured this constant struggle between good and evil in the classic novel about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The story tells us that in the beginning “Dr. Jekyll is a highly respected London physician, a good and kindly man, who in his youth had showed inclinations toward evil which, however, he succeeded in suppressing. Interested in drugs, the doctor now chances upon one which enables him to change his external form to that of a repulsive dwarf, the very embodiment of evil, whom he calls Mr. Hyde. A similar dose permits him to return to the form and personality of the benevolent doctor. Many times the doctor becomes Mr. Hyde, thereby giving this side of his nature more and more power. Jekyll finds it increasingly difficult to regain his virtuous entity and also finds himself occasionally becoming Hyde without the use of the drug.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> In the character of Mr. Hyde, he commits murder, and when the drug will no longer restore him to the kindly Dr. Jekyll, the truth is discovered and Hyde kills himself. The misuse of drugs destroyed his life. So it can be in real life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p5" pid="5w1VJntk80y7WdWhOGgT7g" hash="u1O-5w">Now the key to never turning into an evil, wicked Mr. Hyde is to determine not to yield to destroying temptations. Never, never experiment with any addictive substance. Do not ever use tobacco in any form or take any other enslaving substances. Stay away from intoxicating liquor. Addictions bring tragic consequences that are hard to overcome.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p6" pid="QS9k--8wIkS-iD5RoJMVyg" hash="YlqnNQ">Blessings come from holding true to our principles. When I was the president of the Cottonwood stake, one of our stake patriarchs was Dr. Creed Haymond. He would occasionally bear strong testimony of the Word of Wisdom. As a young man he was the captain of the University of Pennsylvania track team. In 1919 Brother Haymond and his team were invited to participate in the annual Inter-Collegiate Association track meet. The night before the track meet his coach, Lawson Robertson, who coached several Olympic teams, instructed his team members to drink some sherry wine. In those days, coaches wrongly felt that wine was a tonic for muscles hardened through rigorous training. All the other team members took the sherry, but Brother Haymond refused because his parents had taught him the Word of Wisdom. Brother Haymond became very anxious because he did not like to be disobedient to his coach. He was to compete against the fastest men in the world. What if he made a poor showing the next day? How could he face his coach?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p7" pid="OqbhVSyCtki0KHaKw8n9LA" hash="FxX_iw">The next day at the track meet the rest of the team members were very ill and performed poorly or were even too sick to run. Brother Haymond, however, felt well and won the 100- and 220-yard dashes. His coach told him, “You just ran the two hundred and twenty yards in the fastest time it has ever been run by any human being.” That night and for the rest of his life, Creed Haymond was grateful for his simple faith in keeping the Word of Wisdom.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p8" pid="y5nMflBaFUGyEylerRmjgg" hash="_8oIBQ">In the military service during World War II, I associated with some fine young men of great promise. But little by little, I saw some of them turn from the decent, God-fearing qualities of Dr. Jekyll and revert to the baseness of a Mr. Hyde. For some, it began by drinking coffee because the water was foul, and the water decontamination pills had such an unpleasant taste. The coffee led some to take an occasional drink of beer. Every soldier serving overseas was allocated a ration of cigarettes and an occasional bottle of whiskey, which were worth considerable money.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p9" pid="2psd7c2r00emQXLFbLWyCg" hash="DfzFtw">President George Albert Smith once gave this advice: “If you cross to the devil’s side of the line one inch, you are in the tempter’s power, and if he is successful, you will not be able to think or even reason properly, because you will have lost the spirit of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Some soldiers stayed on the safe side of the line and never experimented with nor trafficked in these addicting substances, even though they were given to us free. But others would sample the cigarettes or alcohol as a diversion to the challenges of the war. A few were even drawn away into immorality, believing that the stress of war justified lowering their standards and letting the Mr. Hyde side of their personalities take over.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p10" pid="8t3ukm9-REWXqUsQL0Bd-Q" hash="xg4-qw">After the war, those who had become addicted to tobacco, alcohol, and immorality found that they could not readily shake off these bad habits. The young men who had started out with such potential crossed that line inch by inch, robbing themselves and their families of the promised happiness and experiencing instead divorce, broken families, and heartaches.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p11" pid="B3qX8hNtK0auzibfNCGRxQ" hash="qiJ8XQ">Those who never lowered their standards did not succumb to these addictions. They came through that stressful period of their lives stronger and more prepared to lead productive, exemplary, and happy lives as faithful fathers and grandfathers of righteous families. They have also served as honored and respected leaders in the Church and in the community.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p12" pid="mZsDmQLhTUqCV35nWr0FZQ" hash="RE103A">Another false philosophy that appeals to the Mr. Hyde side of our natures is that peeking into pornography is harmless. This is a terrible deception. Pornography is as addictive as cocaine or any illegal drug. I recently received a heartbreaking letter from an excommunicated man whose soul is filled with sorrow and regret. With his permission, I quote the following from his letter: “I hope that this letter will confirm to any who have doubt that the path of destruction only reaps sorrow and grief and no sin is worth this price.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p13" pid="Hwg7xsex5kOAU3rcoLrDvg" hash="0Q7GZw">He goes on to state: “I have brought grief and sorrow upon myself. Only now do I fully realize the great destruction that I have brought upon myself. No selfish or lustful desire is worth losing your Church membership for. I have brought terrible grief to my wife and two wonderful children. I am grateful for my wife’s great efforts to help me overcome my sins. My wife has been a victim of my sins and had to endure great sorrow and suffering. I long for the day that I can again be a member of the Lord’s Church and for our family to be an eternal family.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p14" pid="dxsyFj_0hEil8IoNCnZhRg" hash="nTZVFA">The letter goes on to admit: “My sins are a direct result of my early childhood addiction to pornography. Without a doubt, pornography is addictive and is poison. Had I learned early in my life to apply the power of self-mastery, I would be a member of the Church today.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p15" pid="_1vPdv4QlEKuZAOHQPwlTg" hash="SK1t-A">One of Mr. Hyde’s deceptions is what some erroneously call “premeditated repentance.” There is no such doctrine in this Church. This may sound subtly appealing, but it is in fact pernicious and a false concept. Its objective is to persuade us that we can consciously and deliberately transgress with the forethought that quick repentance will permit us to enjoy the full blessings of the gospel, such as temple blessings or a mission. True repentance can be a long, painful process. This foolish doctrine was foreseen by Nephi:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p16" pid="TxizcSL5BkCGT2P-91Jujg" hash="0s59Jw">“And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God—he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p17" pid="Yu9AAgo1BEWJPCe2TyUDkA" hash="gSKvvw">Of all those who teach this doctrine the Lord says, “The blood of the saints shall cry from the ground against them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> This is because all of our covenants must not only be received through ordinances but to be eternal must also be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> This divine stamp of approval is placed upon our ordinances and covenants only through faithfulness. The false idea of so-called premeditated repentance involves an element of deception, but the Holy Spirit of Promise cannot be deceived.</p>

James said, “A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> In the Book of Mormon we read the account of Corianton, who went on a mission to the Zoramites with his father and brother. His double life caused him to forsake his ministry and his father to lament, “O my son, how great iniquity ye brought upon the Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

Such were the scribes and Pharisees who came to the Savior pretending to be troubled in conscience and to be seeking His wise counsel. “Master,” they said in flattering tone, “we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p20" pid="_zJu5rRQKEiLoZeVgSOcFw" hash="uvnzHw">With this devious approach they hoped to catch Him off guard as they asked: “Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?”</p>

If He had answered, “Yes,” the Pharisees could have painted Him as disloyal to the Jews. If His answer had been “No,” He could have been denounced for sedition. “But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p22" pid="jEaKqQQb9ku69i8ddhHJ_w" hash="HXKMdA">He asked them to show Him a penny and then asked, “Whose is this image and superscription?” They answered, “Caesar’s,” and He silenced the hypocritical Pharisees with that classic reply, “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> We are in the world but we should not be overcome by the hypocrisy and deceit that are in it.</p>

The Lord has given us this sober reminder: “For their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Because we live in a morally desensitized environment, we find it hard to say to ourselves and to others that our actions are not right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/the-enemy-within.p24" pid="0U5CcA6lJUOcqZF103-Elg" hash="FMJX8A">Brethren, we can shield ourselves against the enemy within each of us by using the protective mantle of the priesthood of God. Individually, we need to put the great powers of the holy priesthood to work in our lives. This means using this divine agency daily to bless the lives of others as we do our home teaching, perform ordinances, or hold family home evening. Collectively, we have the mission to bring the message of salvation to the world, which mission we carry out under the direction of our President, Gordon B. Hinckley, who holds all of the keys of the priesthood on earth at this time. But we cannot fulfill this mission unless each of us wins the battle within ourselves. In so doing, we will be able to put on the whole armor of God and receive the blessings contained in the oath and covenant of the priesthood. The Lord has promised that “all they who receive this priesthood receive me …</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p1" pid="G-_CB16HyUq8EqkgByb-Tg" hash="VD3t_g">My beloved brothers and sisters and friends, I have lived a long time. As I look back over my life, I recognize one source of singular strength and blessing. It is my testimony and knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. I am profoundly grateful that all of my life I have had a simple faith that Jesus is the Christ. That witness has been confirmed to me hundreds of times. It is the crowning knowledge of my soul. It is the spiritual light of my being. It is the cornerstone of my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p2" pid="A74xlclUFEyZ8U9PevalvA" hash="HpEW6w">As one of the least among you but in my calling as one of His Apostles, I testify of the Christ as our Savior and the Redeemer of the world. Since this testimony has been forged by a lifetime of experiences, of necessity this requires my relating experiences which are very personal in nature. But this testimony is mine, and I feel that the Savior knows that I know that He lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p3" pid="uumthVQUT0eSLgvBjy18iw" hash="9NDZ6Q">The first cornerstone of my testimony was laid a long time ago. One of my early recollections was having a frightening nightmare as a small child. I still remember it vividly. I must have screamed in fright during the night. My grandmother woke me up. I was crying, and she took me in her arms, hugged me, and comforted me. She got a bowl of some of my favorite rice pudding that was left over from dinner, and I sat on her lap as she spoon-fed me. She told me that we were safe in our house because Jesus was watching over us. I felt it was true then, and I still believe it now. I was comforted in both body and soul and went peacefully back to bed, assured of the divine reality that Jesus does watch over us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p4" pid="jH0F98LuuEuoK_k-DoQDqw" hash="rZjM_w">That first memorable experience led to other strong confirmations that God lives and that Jesus is our Lord and Savior. Many of these came in response to earnest prayer. As a child, when I lost things such as my precious pocketknife, I learned that if I prayed hard enough, I could usually find it. I was always able to find the lost cows I was entrusted with. Sometimes I had to pray more than once, but my prayers always seemed to be answered. Sometimes the answer was no, but most often it was positive and confirming. Even when it was no, I came to know that, in the Lord’s great wisdom, the answer I received was for my best good. My faith continued to grow as building blocks were added to the cornerstone, line upon line and precept upon precept. There are far too many of these to be chronicled individually; some are too sacred to utter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p5" pid="1MP45tXB3E2IbnZBwq7AsA" hash="Y1Wf0Q">These early seeds of faith sprouted still further when, as a young Aaronic Priesthood boy, I received a firsthand confirmation of the remarkable testimony of the Three Witnesses concerning the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. My stake president was President Henry D. Moyle, and his father was James H. Moyle. In the summertime Brother James H. Moyle would visit his family, and he would worship with us in our little ward in the southeast of the Salt Lake Valley.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p6" pid="mkaLlZsZ4Eifmf7aaFUTWg" hash="MUG1Yg">One Sunday, Brother James H. Moyle shared with us a singular experience. As a young man he went to the University of Michigan to study law. As he was finishing his studies, his father told him that David Whitmer, one of the witnesses of the Book of Mormon, was still alive. The father suggested to his son that he stop on his way back to Salt Lake City to visit with David Whitmer face-to-face. Brother Moyle’s purpose was to ask him about his testimony concerning the golden plates and the Book of Mormon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p7" pid="Scrv_A7FekeIdiKcuntrpA" hash="Wesn4Q">During that visit, Brother Moyle said to David Whitmer: “Sir, you are an old man, and I’m a young man. I have been studying about witnesses and testimonies. Please tell me the truth concerning your testimony as one of the witnesses of the Book of Mormon.” David Whitmer then told this young man: “Yes, I held the golden plates in my hands, and they were shown to us by an angel. My testimony concerning the Book of Mormon is true.” David Whitmer was out of the Church, but he never denied his testimony of the angel’s visitation, of handling the golden plates, or of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. Hearing with my own ears this remarkable experience directly from Brother Moyle’s lips had a powerful, confirming effect upon my growing testimony. Having heard it, I felt it was binding upon me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p8" pid="8pvv3bqEfU-61Ush9GojCg" hash="ryGKQA">One of the foundation stones of my testimony came when I served my first mission in Brazil as a young man. At that time our labors were unfruitful and difficult. We could not envision the great outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord which has come in that country and its neighboring countries of South America, Central America, and Mexico in the intervening years. Sixty years ago there was only one stake in all of these countries. Now there are 643 stakes in Latin America. I believe it is only the beginning. What has happened is beyond my wildest hopes and dreams. It is one of the many miracles we have seen. It is my witness that all of this could not have happened without the divine intervention of the Lord, who is watching over this holy work, not only in Latin America but in all of the countries of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p9" pid="5AF7_Pa0h0CY3QwNzZjNjg" hash="eBhK_A">In my long life I have found peace, joy, and happiness beyond my fondest hopes and dreams. One of the supreme benedictions of my life has been my marriage to an elect daughter of God. I love her with all my heart and soul. Upon the wind of her spirit have my wings been carried.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> We were married in the Salt Lake Temple 57 years ago when I was a soldier in World War II and did not know if I would come back alive. Her strong, unwavering faith and support have strengthened my own testimony in times of challenge and difficulty. My inevitable eternal journey, if I am so favored, will be wonderful with her at my side.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p10" pid="hYeIAnNkuESpIa1QZZS1Hw" hash="hL_4Xg">Another great blessing in my life has been to have children come into our family even though we thought we might never have any. Our joy has increased with our grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Only by the power of a priesthood blessing did this come about.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p11" pid="rQv6wd4xQk2UTfmCU4vCYg" hash="GC5-lg">Along with the blessings, however, I have known some difficult challenges and heartaches. I am grateful for the lessons learned in these adversities. As a young man, I lived through the Great Depression, when banks failed and so many lost their jobs and homes and went hungry. I was fortunate to have a job at a canning factory that paid 25 cents an hour. That may have been all I was worth! But it helped me get my education. I served three long years in the military in World War II. One time when we were in peril of our ship capsizing in a horrendous storm in the Pacific, I put myself in the Lord’s hands and fervently promised Him that if I survived I would try to serve Him all of the days of my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p12" pid="npF3SM5og0aDa7G2WtCW9g" hash="0kk8bQ">At times I have stumbled and been less than I should have been. All of us experience those wrenching, defining, difficult decisions that move us to a higher level of spirituality. They are the Gethsemanes of our lives that bring with them great pain and anguish. Sometimes they are too sacred to be shared publicly. They are the watershed experiences that help purge us of our unrighteous desires for the things of the world. As the scales of worldliness are taken from our eyes, we see more clearly who we are and what our responsibilities are concerning our divine destiny.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p13" pid="1BlTfDNoGECMB0iDSU2fnA" hash="6xVNrQ">I humbly acknowledge that these many experiences have nurtured a sure knowledge that Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer. I have heard His voice and felt His influence and presence. They have been as a warm, spiritual cloak. The wonder of it is that all who conscientiously strive to keep the commandments and sustain their leaders can receive this same knowledge in some measure. The privilege of serving in the cause of the Master can bring great satisfaction and inner peace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p14" pid="PJ2iAymCPUiEtX5LbhItkg" hash="WhsOuw">The united testimonies and faith of the early Church members brought them from Palmyra to Kirtland, and from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley. Eventually that faith will establish this work all over the world. That strength of testimony and faith moves the work of God forward in such a marvelous way. The power of the Lord is in this work, as evidenced in the wonderful happenings of our time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p15" pid="1zhAQT8K5Uqi5yDNhGXZ6w" hash="tDFviA">President Gordon B. Hinckley presides over what is possibly the greatest number of faithful people who have ever lived upon the face of the earth. I testify that he is a truly great prophet. He needs faithful followers. The great strength of this Church comes from our collective and individual testimonies, born of our own trials and faithfulness. The faithfulness of the Saints has permitted this great Conference Center to be built and dedicated in the name of the Lord on this historic day. It is unique in all the world. So wondrous and great are the works of the Lord in our time. As a people, we are not as yet what we ought to be—far from it. However, I hope we will strive harder to become a more righteous people, worthy to continue to receive the blessings of heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p16" pid="MPkAt851DkKxA5tzLpEoUg" hash="3kzwZg">The acceleration of temple building in our time has been marvelous. Through the prophetic vision of President Hinckley, we now have many temples that dot many lands on the earth. This remarkable achievement has been made possible because of faithful tithe payers. This in turn has caused the Lord to redeem His promise spoken through Malachi: “And prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> All of these exquisite holy edifices are a testimony of our belief that the Savior broke the bonds of death and opened up the way for us to enter into covenants which will be binding in another world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/a-growing-testimony.p17" pid="GCd5RzpxhUybrVPue1X_Fg" hash="MDh4lg">Like Alma, I can testify, “All things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Perhaps on that basis alone, I can qualify. This truth has been made known to me by the unspeakable peace and power of the Spirit of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

        <span class="strong">The first is reverence for Deity.</span> I am grateful that the Lord has blessed us as a people with temporal blessings unequaled in the history of the Church. These resources have been given us to do good and to permit our work on earth to accelerate. But I fear that through prosperity many of us have been preoccupied with what Daniel called “gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> These, of course, are idols.</p>

During most of the world’s history, mankind has labored much in idolatry, either worshiping false gods or becoming preoccupied with acquiring the material opulence of this world.</p>

Peter announced to them that he was going fishing. The disciples agreed to go with him. They seemed to have forgotten that they were called to be fishers of men. They fished through the night but caught nothing. In the morning Jesus, standing on the shore, told them to cast their nets on the right side of the ship, and the nets were filled with fish. Jesus told them to bring in the fish they had caught; Peter and his associates landed 153. When they came ashore they saw fish being cooked on a fire of coals, and the Savior invited them to eat the fish and some bread. After they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Lovest thou me more than these?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Peter was an ardent fisherman. Catching fish was the livelihood from which the Savior called him to become a fisher of men.</p>

The first commandment given unto the ancient Israelites was “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> The Savior Himself amplified this command when He told the lawyer who asked Him which was the greatest commandment, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

Reverence and respect for sacred things all flow from the first commandment, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

        <span class="strong">The second is to respect and honor family relationships. </span>This should begin with reverence for Mother’s sacred love. All mothers go down into the valley of the shadow of death as they labor in birth to give us life. My mother has now been dead many years. I miss her sweet, loving influence in my life. I miss her general counsel and reproof. But mostly I miss her unconditional love. The yearning to be with her is at times almost overpowering. Most of us could say, with Abraham Lincoln, “All that I am or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> My mother cooked, sewed, patched and remodeled clothes; she did without so that the limited amount of money could stretch to give her sons more opportunities than she ever had. But more important was her unwavering faith that she desired to plant deep into our souls.</p>

A father should be many things. He should magnify his priesthood and be an example of righteousness. In companionship with his wife, he should be the source of stability and strength for the whole family. He should be the protector and the provider and the champion of the members of his family. Much of his love for his children should flow from his example of love, concern, and fidelity for their mother. By his uncompromising example he should instill character into his children.</p>

Richards, said to him and his brother, George F. Jr., “I would trust you two to go anywhere I would go myself.” Their hearts swelled with love and pride in his words.

In 1989 there was a terrible earthquake in Armenia that killed over 30,000 people in four minutes. A distraught father went in frantic search of his son. He reached his son’s school only to find that it had been reduced to a pile of rubble. But he was driven by his promise to his son, “No matter what, I’ll always be there for you!” He visualized the corner where his son’s classroom would be, rushed there, and started to dig through the debris, brick by brick.</p>

But he tenaciously carried on digging. Night came and went, and then, in the 38th hour of digging, he thought he heard his son’s voice. “Armand!” he called out. Then he heard, “Dad!?! It’s me, Dad! I told the other kids not to worry. I told ’em that if you were alive, you’d save me and when you saved me, they’d be saved. …</p>

        <span class="strong">The third is respect for and obedience to the ordinances and covenants of the priesthood. </span>Anciently, those who participated in priesthood ordinances wore priestly attire.

        <span class="strong">The fourth is to respect yourself as a son of God. </span>Those of us who have served missions have seen the miracle in the lives of some we have taught as they have come to realize that they are sons and daughters of God. Many years ago an elder who served a mission in the British Isles said at the end of his labors, “I think my mission has been a failure. I have labored all my days as a missionary here and I have only baptized one dirty little Irish kid. That is all I baptized.”</p>

Brigham Young said: “When I look upon the faces of intelligent beings I look upon the image of the God I serve. There are none but what have a certain portion of divinity within them; and though we are clothed with bodies which are in the image of our God, yet this mortality shrinks before that portion of divinity which we inherit from our Father.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> Being aware of our divine heritage will help men young and old to grow and magnify the divinity which is within them and within all of us.</p>

I was eight years of age. My parents taught me and my brothers the significance of this great ordinance. My mother told me that after my baptism I would be held accountable for the things I did that were not right. I remember the day of my baptism very vividly. I was baptized in the baptismal font in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. Those who were being baptized put on white coveralls and one by one were gently taken down the steps into the water. One of the children baptized that day was not totally immersed, and so the ordinance was repeated. This was necessary because, as the scriptures indicate, “baptism symbolizes death, burial, and resurrection, and can only be done by immersion.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> It also follows the pattern set by the Savior, who was baptized in the river Jordan, where there was much water. As Matthew records, “And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

They have been baptized in frozen lakes, the ocean, or ponds, some of which were dug for that purpose. One such pond has great historic significance. In 1840 Wilford Woodruff, then one of the Twelve Apostles, was serving a mission in England and felt impressed to go to a rural district near Ledbury. There he met John Benbow, who had a large farm and a small pond. John introduced him to a congregation of United Brethren who were eager to hear the gospel message. He later recorded in his journal that with no other help at hand on March 7, 1840, “I spent most of the … day in clearing out a pool of water and preparing it for baptizing, as I saw that many would receive that ordinance. I afterwards baptized six hundred persons in that pool of water.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

One day they went to the hut of Atiati in the village of Sasina in Samoa. There they found an unshaven, unkempt, misshapen man lying on a bed. He asked them to come in and introduce themselves. He was pleased to know they were missionaries and wanted to hear their message. They presented the first discussion, bore witness to him, and then left. As they walked away, they discussed Atiati’s condition; he had had polio 22 years before that had left him without the use of his arms or legs, so how could he ever be baptized, being so completely disabled?</p>

He was bright and clean-shaven; even his bedding had been changed. “Today,” he said, “I begin to live again, because yesterday my prayers were answered and you [came] to me. … I have waited for more than twenty years for someone to come and tell me that they have the true gospel of Christ.”</p>

He asked them to fast with him so that he would have the strength to go down into the water and be baptized. The nearest baptismal font was eight miles away. So they carried him to their car, drove him to the chapel, and set him on a bench. Their district leader opened the service by bearing a strong testimony about the sacred ordinance of baptism. Then Elder Peters and his companion picked up Atiati and carried him to the font. As they did so, Atiati said, “Please, put me down.” They hesitated, and he said again, “Put me down.”</p>

I know without a doubt in my mind that this is the only way to eternal salvation. <span class="emphasis">I will not be carried to my salvation!</span>” So they lowered Atiati to the ground. After a huge effort, he managed to pull himself up. The man who had lain 20 years without moving was now standing. Slowly, one shaky step at a time, Atiati went down the steps and into the water, where the astonished missionary took him by the hand and baptized him. He then asked to be carried from the font to the chapel, where he was confirmed a member of the Church.</p>

He told Elder Peters that he knew that he would be able to walk on the morning of his baptism. He said, “Since faith can move a stubborn mountain, I had no doubt in my mind that it would mend these limbs of mine.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> I believe we can say that Atiati was truly born again!</p>

As Nephi said, baptism is the gate, “and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> The baptismal gate opens the way for additional covenants and blessings through priesthood and temple blessings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/born-again.p21" pid="enXiLbBqAkafWLgUtRhfRw" hash="ZkWktQ">The transcendent gift of the Holy Ghost, along with membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is bestowed by confirmation, by the laying on of hands by those having priesthood authority. This was made clear by Paul to the Ephesians when he asked: “Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</p>

Through this power sincere investigators acquire a testimony of the Book of Mormon and the principles of the gospel before baptism. However, administrations of the Holy Ghost are limited without receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/born-again.p29" pid="lHYJjMoFREKi14Zxs9ktOw" hash="cj9ltg">Those who possess the gift of the Holy Ghost after baptism and confirmation can receive more light and testimony. This is because the gift of the Holy Ghost is “a permanent witness and higher endowment than the ordinary manifestation of the Holy Spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> It is the higher endowment because the gift of the Holy Ghost can act as “a cleansing agent to purify a person and sanctify him from all sin.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>

The doctrine of baptism of the living for the dead in the temple was understood and practiced in the early Christian church. Paul, in his great discussion about the Resurrection, reasoned: “Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span> Doing something so vital for those who cannot do it for themselves is truly Christlike. By laying down His life to atone for the sins of all mankind, Jesus did that for us which we cannot do for ourselves. The prophet Malachi referenced this concept when he spoke of the coming of the prophet Elijah, who would “turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest [the Lord] come and smite the earth with a curse.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span> This is accomplished in large measure through vicarious work for the dead.</p>

At great expense and effort the Church is now the custodian of the greatest treasure of family records in the world. The Church now has 660 million names on the FamilySearch™ Internet Web site.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span> These records are freely shared with anyone who wishes to research them.</p>

That singular event was the incomparable Atonement of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ. This was the most transcendent act that has ever taken place, yet it is the most difficult to understand. My reason for wanting to learn all I can about the Atonement is partly selfish: Our salvation depends on believing in and accepting the Atonement.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Such acceptance requires a continual effort to understand it more fully. The Atonement advances our mortal course of learning by making it possible for our natures to become perfect.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> All of us have sinned and need to repent to fully pay <span class="emphasis">our</span> part of the debt. When we sincerely repent, the Savior’s magnificent Atonement pays the <span class="emphasis">rest</span> of that debt.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

With His divine sonship, His sinless life, the shedding of His blood in the Garden of Gethsemane, His excruciating death on the cross and subsequent bodily Resurrection from the grave, He became the author of our salvation and made a perfect Atonement for all mankind.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

Literally, the Atonement means to be “at one” with Him. The nature of the Atonement and its effects is so infinite, so unfathomable, and so profound that it lies beyond the knowledge and comprehension of mortal man. I am profoundly grateful for the principle of saving grace. Many people think they need only confess that Jesus is the Christ and then they are saved by grace alone. We cannot be saved by grace alone, “for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, <span class="emphasis">after</span> all we can do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

As the Only Begotten Son of the Father in the flesh, Jesus inherited divine attributes. He was the only person ever born into mortality who could perform this most significant and supernal act. As the only sinless Man who ever lived on this earth, He was not subject to spiritual death. Because of His godhood, He also possessed power over physical death. Thus He did for us what we cannot do for ourselves. He broke the cold grasp of death. He also made it possible for us to have the supreme and serene comfort of the gift of the Holy Ghost.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span></p>

By forgiving “those who trespass against us” (JST, Matt. 6:13) the Atonement brings a measure of peace and comfort to those who have been innocently victimized by the sins of others. The basic source for the healing of the soul is the Atonement of Jesus Christ. This is true whether it be from the pain of a personal tragedy or a terrible national calamity such as we have recently experienced in New York and Washington, D.C., and near Pittsburgh.</p>

She said: “Our divorce … did not release me from the obligation to forgive. I truly wanted to do it, but it was as if I had been commanded to do something of which I was simply incapable.” Her bishop gave her some sound advice: “Keep a place in your heart for forgiveness, and when it comes, welcome it in.” Many months passed as this struggle to forgive continued. She recalled: “During those long, prayerful moments … I tapped into a life-giving source of comfort from my loving Heavenly Father. I sense that he was not standing by glaring at me for not having accomplished forgiveness yet; rather he was sorrowing with me as I wept. …</p>

Some injuries are so hurtful and deep that they cannot be healed without help from a higher power and hope for perfect justice and restitution in the next life. Since the Savior has suffered anything and everything that we could ever feel or experience,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_35">35</span> He can help the weak to become stronger.

The free gift of His great atoning sacrifice for each of us is the only way we can be exalted enough to stand before Him and see Him face-to-face.

It is a love which is full of mercy, patience, grace, equity, long-suffering, and, above all, forgiving.</p>

This evening I would like to challenge the priesthood of the Church to be more committed in doing those things which build faith, character, and spirituality. These are the routine priesthood obligations we should be doing daily, weekly, monthly—year in and year out. The work of the Church depends upon basics such as paying tithes; taking care of family and priesthood duties; caring for the poor and the needy; having daily prayer, scripture study, and family home evening; home teaching; participation in quorum activity; and attending the temple. If called upon by the President of the Church, we would be ready, able, and willing to do “some great thing,” such as working on the Nauvoo temple, but many are not quite so anxious to do some of these basics.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p2" pid="U1gYXaLCykuoL1KrivSDYg" hash="AmSbFw">We are all familiar with the Old Testament story of Naaman, the captain of the Syrian hosts, who was a leper. A little Israelite servant told Naaman’s wife that there was a prophet in Israel who could heal him. Naaman came with his chariot and horses to the house of Elisha, who sent a messenger to instruct Naaman, “Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p3" pid="25X9qXPCw0e7G3fmbLYvEg" hash="t-PQeA">You younger boys know how it is when you show your hands to your mother: she’ll tell you to go and wash! But Naaman was not a young boy. He was the captain of the Syrian hosts, and he was offended by Elisha’s instruction to wash in the Jordan. So he “went away in a rage.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> One of Naaman’s servants with a wise head remonstrated with him and said: “If the prophet had bid thee [to] do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Naaman then repented and followed the counsel of the prophet. The leprosy disappeared, and “his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> “Some great thing” in this instance was extraordinarily simple and easy to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p4" pid="nNjNrJ2kd0qBa2JPW4rvUQ" hash="m5k4Bw">We have in the modern history of the Church contrasting examples of men who were highly favored of the Lord. One, Hyrum Smith, remained totally faithful and committed, even to the giving of his life, while the other, Oliver Cowdery, despite having witnessed “some great things” in the history of the Restoration, became blinded by his personal ambition and lost his exalted place in the leadership of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p5" pid="iFmJtmgw_EKmhcEg_EwDTQ" hash="0MqP7A">Oliver Cowdery shared with the Prophet Joseph Smith many of the profound events of the Restoration, such as their baptism under the authority of John the Baptist, the conferral of the Aaronic Priesthood, the marvelous appearances in the Kirtland Temple, and writing with his own pen “the entire Book of Mormon (save a few pages) as it fell from the lips of the Prophet [Joseph Smith].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> No one except the Prophet Joseph was more honored with the ministering of angels than Oliver Cowdery.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p6" pid="ba5XNEcTzEmDiAkxltc07Q" hash="BRHvHQ">But when the Prophet Joseph fell upon hard times, Oliver was critical of him and became estranged from him. Despite the efforts of the Prophet to reach out the hand of fellowship to him, he became hostile to the Prophet and the Church and was excommunicated 12 April 1838.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p7" pid="G9t_lyhTw0idn5xsmWo5-Q" hash="tDDY0g">A few years after the death of the Prophet, Oliver repented and expressed interest in coming back to the Church. In response, Brigham Young wrote on 22 November 1847, inviting him to “return to our father’s house, from whence thou hast wandered, … and renew thy testimony to the truth of the Book of Mormon.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Oliver appeared before the high priests quorum and said: “Brethren for a number of years I have been separated from you. I now desire to come back. I wish to come humbly and be one in your midst.—I seek no station. I only wish to be identified with you.—I am out of the church. I am not a member of the church. I wish to become a member of the church again. I wish to come in at the door. I know the door. I have not come here to seek precedence. I come humbly and throw myself upon the decision of this body—knowing as I do that their decisions are right and should be obeyed.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p8" pid="Ve1SR5FEcEGAOqtOSTRt2g" hash="MuOH7w">He also bore his testimony in these words: “Friends and brethren my name is Cowdery, Oliver Cowdery. In the early history of this church I stood identified with [you]. … I … handled with my hands the gold plates from which [the Book of Mormon] was translated. I also beheld the interpreters. That book is true. Sidney Rigdon did not write it. Mr. Spaulding did not write it. I wrote it myself as it fell from the lips of the prophet.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Even though Oliver came back, he lost his exalted place in the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p9" pid="hQQm12APskycx9uvuqW8JA" hash="04vQ5A">In contrast, President Heber J. Grant said of Hyrum Smith: “There is no better example of an older brother’s love than that exhibited in the life of Hyrum Smith for the Prophet Joseph Smith. … They were as united and as affectionate and as loving as mortal men could be. … There never was one particle of … jealousy … in the heart of Hyrum Smith. No mortal man could have been more loyal, more true, more faithful in life or in death than was Hyrum Smith to the Prophet of the living God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p10" pid="6uwrGsnMbkKBXEkBqzbeZw" hash="M6_juA">He responded to every need and request from his younger brother, Joseph, who led the Church and received the revelations which we have today. Hyrum was steadfast day to day, month by month, year in and year out.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p11" pid="J0RVS-MLIkCYIPYifDtRfA" hash="t-z4eQ">After their brother Alvin’s death, Hyrum finished building the white frame home for their parents. After Joseph had received the golden plates, Hyrum provided the wooden box to store and protect them. When the plates had been translated, Joseph entrusted Hyrum with the printer’s copy of the manuscript. Hyrum, often accompanied by Oliver Cowdery, carried pages to and from the typesetter daily.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p12" pid="-KkBZy-edkuvq9-9y-McHg" hash="lwTMCg">Hyrum worked as a farmer and laborer to support his family, but after the Church was organized in 1830 he accepted the call to preside over the Colesville Branch. He took his wife and family and went to live with the Newel Knight family, spending much of his time “preaching the gospel wherever [he] could find any who would listen.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Ever a good missionary, he not only preached near his home but also went to the eastern seaboard and southward in the United States. In 1831 he went with John Murdock to Missouri and back, preaching along the way.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p13" pid="LGyUKUlnpU22O_C_9HG2og" hash="lpKpOg">When the construction of the Kirtland Temple was envisioned in 1833, Hyrum immediately took his scythe and cleared weeds from the temple site and began digging the foundation. In 1834 when Zion’s Camp was organized, Hyrum assisted Lyman Wight in recruiting members of the camp and led a group of Saints from Michigan to Missouri.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p14" pid="2SYm8o-OtUWDrrW19lO2zA" hash="4bsLcQ">Being thus proved in the little things, Hyrum became an Assistant President of the Church in December of 1834. He served under the direction of his younger brother, the Prophet Joseph. He was ever a source of strength and comfort to his brother, whether in Church service or in the Liberty Jail. As persecutions came and Joseph fled the mob at Nauvoo in 1844, Hyrum went with him. As they stood on the bank of the river, contemplating whether to return, Joseph turned to Hyrum and said, “You are the oldest, what shall we do?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p15" pid="q5K5OPrMO0iLrkyS9kwmRA" hash="rtzVog">“Let us go back and give ourselves up and see the thing out,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Hyrum replied.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p16" pid="izE9dkU5skOFrrAI1U9Vcw" hash="riEuww">They returned to Nauvoo and were taken to Carthage, where they died as martyrs within minutes of one another. Hyrum had been faithful to his trust even to the laying down of his life. In all respects he was a disciple of the Savior. But his day-to-day striving made him truly great. In contrast, Oliver Cowdery was great when handling the plates and being attended to by angels, but when called upon to faithfully endure day-to-day trials and challenges, Oliver faltered and fell away from the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p17" pid="WRhRtoY_ZUO7ydksSKmHfg" hash="jvNJLw">We do not prove our love for the Savior only by doing “some great thing.” If the prophet personally asked you to go on a mission to some strange and exotic place, would you go? You would probably make every effort to go. But what about paying tithing? What about doing your home teaching? We show our love for the Savior by doing the many small acts of faith, devotion, and kindness to others that define our character. This was well demonstrated by the life of Dr. George R. Hill III, former General Authority, who died a few months ago.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p18" pid="VEd_PSVoGE6G-sDe6evOuA" hash="7BfNnA">Elder Hill was a world authority on coal and a renowned scientist. He received multiple awards and honors for his scientific achievements. He was dean of the College of Mines and Mineral Resources and Envirotech professor of engineering at the University of Utah. But as a person, Elder Hill was humble, self-effacing, and totally dedicated. He served as the bishop of three different wards and as a regional representative before being called as a General Authority. After his release as a General Authority, he became a counselor in a ward bishopric. His last callings, at a time when he was in failing health, were as stake cannery director and member of a ward choir. He filled these last callings with the same commitment as he had all the others. He did whatever he was called upon to do—it did not have to be “some great thing.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p21" pid="z-VvaizAWUumYHn78mKzFw" hash="FSMegg">A story shared by our beloved associate, Elder Henry B. Eyring, illustrates this principle of commitment still further. This story is about his father, the great scientist Henry Eyring, who served on the Bonneville Stake high council. He was responsible for the welfare farm, which included a field of onions that needed to be weeded. At that time, he was nearly 80 and suffering from painful bone cancer. He assigned himself to do weeding even though the pain was so great that he pulled himself along on his stomach with his elbows. The pain was too great for him to kneel. Yet he smiled, laughed, and talked happily with the others who were there that day weeding that field of onions. I now quote what Elder Eyring said of this incident:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/some-great-thing.p22" pid="y47MkMf2q0qH5PmzJhC5Jw" hash="Rr7NUw">“After all the work was finished and the onions were all weeded, someone [said to] him, ‘Henry, good heavens!

This 14-year-old boy was doing ordinary day-to-day work when this extraordinary idea came to him.

Too many think that they are men of steel, strong enough to withstand any temptation. They delude themselves into thinking, “It cannot happen to me.” Borrowing a thought from Bertrand Russell, “We are all like the turkey who wakes up [Thanksgiving] morning expecting lunch as usual. Things can go wrong at any time.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Brethren, it <span class="emphasis">can</span> happen to any of us at any time.

Penrose used to tell the story of an officer on the <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span> who stated that there was no fear of “God, man or devil,” because the <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span> was built so solidly that it could readily withstand collision with other ships or contact with any other force, including icebergs.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> The <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span> was in fact three football fields in length, 12 stories high, and built of the finest steel. On that fateful night of April 14, 1912, other ships warned of ice ahead. Yet the <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span> continued to increase her speed, cutting through the cold Atlantic Ocean. By the time the lookouts sighted the iceberg, it was too late. The <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span> could not turn out of its way in time, and the iceberg scraped along the starboard side of the ship, creating a series of punctures. Two hours and 40 minutes later the brand-new <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span> sank to the bottom of the ocean. Over 1,500 people were drowned.</p>

The ice in the cold core is very compact, and keeps seven-eighths of the iceberg under water. As it was when the <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span> encountered the iceberg, so it is with us.

King David is a tragic example. As a youth he was handsome, brave, and full of faith. He slew the frightening giant, Goliath. He became king. He had everything a man could desire. Yet when he saw Bathsheba, he wanted her even though she was another man’s wife. He had her husband, Uriah the Hittite, sent to the front of the hottest battle so that he would be killed. Uriah died in battle, and David married Bathsheba. As a consequence of this evil deed, David lost his spiritual inheritance.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> For all the good David accomplished, much of it was negated because he allowed himself to succumb to a serious personal flaw.</p>

Kimball’s counsel: “Develop discipline of self so that, more and more, you do not have to decide and redecide what you will do when you are confronted with the same temptation time and time again. You need only to decide some things once. How great a blessing it is to be free of agonizing over and over again regarding a temptation.

Access to our Creator through our Savior is surely one of the great privileges and blessings of our lives. I have learned from countless personal experiences that great is the power of prayer. No earthly authority can separate us from direct access to our Creator. There can never be a mechanical or electronic failure when we pray. There is no limit on the number of times or how long we can pray each day. There is no quota of how many needs we wish to pray for in each prayer. We do not need to go through secretaries or make an appointment to reach the throne of grace. He is reachable at any time and any place.</p>

Second, it is a sincere confession of sin and transgression and a request for forgiveness. Third, it is recognition that we need help beyond our own ability. Fourth, it is an opportunity to express thanksgiving and gratitude to our Creator. It is important that we frequently say: “We thank Thee … , “ “We acknowledge before Thee … ,” “We are grateful unto Thee …” Fifth, it is a privilege to ask Deity for specific blessings.</p>

I hasten to say I was not a hero. But I did my duty. I endured and survived. I was assigned to a British liberty ship sailing from San Francisco to Suez. I was on that ship for 83 consecutive days except for a brief stop in Auckland, New Zealand. I was the only member of our faith on board. On Sundays I would go alone to the bow of the ship with my little set of servicemen’s scriptures and songbook. Amid the howling of the wind, I would read the scriptures, pray, and sing all by myself. I did not try to bargain with the Lord, but I did pray fervently that if I could survive the war and go home to my wife and family, I would earnestly try to remain true to the sacred covenants I had made at baptism, to the oath and covenant of the priesthood, and to my temple vows.</p>

The tanker had no power and was wallowing helplessly in the ocean. Although we never saw them, we knew enemy submarines were lurking near us. While we were pulling that ship, we were caught in a violent storm, which we later learned sank many vessels. Because of the load we were pulling, we did not have enough power to go into the giant waves head on, and our ship was thrown from side to side in the trough of the pounding seas. It would creak and groan and roll from side to side, almost capsizing on every roll. Of course I prayed, as I imagine others did. In time the storm moved away from us. I am grateful for the sustaining influence and comfort my prayers gave me then and since in other times of peril.</p>

Joseph was at that time unlearned, but that prayer, which was to a considerable extent in behalf of those who accused him of having gone astray and fallen into sin, [was] that the Lord would forgive them and open their eyes that they might see aright—that prayer, I say, to my humble mind, partook of the learning and eloquence of heaven. There was no ostentation, no raising of the voice as by enthusiasm, but a plain conversational tone, as a man would address a present friend.

We gratefully acknowledge the presence of President Hinckley and President Monson. The choir’s music has lifted us greatly. Sister Sainz’s prayer was an invitation for the Divine to be with us. The inspired messages of Sister Bonnie Parkin, Sister Kathleen Hughes, and Sister Anne Pingree have been exceptional. President Hinckley, President Monson, and I participated in setting apart and blessing these three sisters as the general presidency of the Relief Society. Their inspired charge is to lead this great organization of sisters under the direction of the priesthood. The blessings pronounced upon these three sisters collectively and individually were profound. As President Hinckley set apart Sister Parkin, he reminded the sisters, “The Prophet Joseph outlined the work of the Relief Society to reach out, to minister to the needs of the poor, the needy, the troubled and distressed, and to bless women.”</p>

This Church could not have achieved its destiny without the dedicated, faithful women who, in their righteousness, have immeasurably strengthened the Church.

The Relief Society curriculum is focused on basic doctrine and will give you the opportunity to study the gospel and increase your spirituality.

There are several ladies who like to give me a hug and ask me where I am working and what I am doing during the summer. They always make me feel like I am important and special to them. As I have associated with the grandmothers and great-grandmothers in my ward, I have developed new and unique friendships which have enriched and blessed my life. I also like the lessons the older sisters give. They have lived in different locations and their individual experiences have given me better insight on how to handle life’s challenges and problems.

This is where she wanted to be, but some 28 years ago, with four children ages 5 to 14, she was forced to take on employment outside the home in order to provide for us as a suddenly single parent. While we know this is not the ideal situation for raising a family, Mom worked diligently to continue nurturing us in the gospel and tending to all family duties while working full-time to support us financially. Only now as a parent myself, blessed to have my wife at home to care for our children, have I begun to understand the scope of Mom’s situation and trials in caring for us at that time. It was difficult and trying and I wish that I had done more to make things easier for her. I will be eternally grateful for her sacrifice in setting an example by teaching us how to work and how we should live. The wisdom of the proclamation on the family rings especially true to me now because of the experiences we shared as a family.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

These wonderful women have a distinct errand of influence as angels of mercy to parents, sisters, brothers, nieces, and nephews, as well as other family members and friends. In the Church there are endless opportunities to love and nurture. The single sisters, who may have more time, serve so superbly well.</p>

For many years, she lovingly cared for her aged mother, her aunt, and her disabled sister. She guided and influenced hundreds of children as an elementary school teacher. Now retired, she continues to volunteer each week, helping children learn to read. Her acts of service have been a special blessing to the members of her ward. One young lady commented: “When I was little, Margaret would make me a birthday cake every year. She would decorate the frosting with the activities that I had done the previous year, such as dancing or playing soccer.” Not one missionary leaves from her ward without one of Margaret’s leatherwork wallets. She is a valuable resource as a gospel scholar, particularly in Relief Society. For her neighbors and friends, she has willingly run errands, and driven them to the temple. Margaret is a gracious hostess. She makes delicious candies and paints beautiful pictures, which she enjoys sharing with others. She truly has blessed the lives of countless individuals.</p>

They will be able to enjoy that blessing forever in the next world. “On occasions when you ache for that acceptance and affection which belong to family life on earth, please know that our Father in Heaven is aware of your anguish, and that one day he will bless you beyond your capacity to express.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

I asked the sisters if they had gone to the red brick store in Nauvoo where the Prophet Joseph established the Relief Society on March 17, 1842, with only 20 members present. Sister Parkin responded that they indeed had.</p>

I cannot trace my lineage to the pioneers. But like the majority of Church members around the world, I can deeply connect with all my heart to the Saints of Nauvoo and their journey to Zion. The continuing effort of blazing my own religious trail to a Zion of ‘the pure in heart’ makes me feel close to the 19th-century pioneers. They are my spiritual ancestry, as they are for each and every member of the Church, regardless of nationality, language, or culture. They have established not only a safe place in the West but also the spiritual foundation for the building of the kingdom in all the nations of the world.”</p>

In a very substantial way, you sisters make our homes a refuge of peace and happiness in a troubled world. A righteous husband is the bearer of the priesthood, which priesthood is the governing authority of the home. But he is not the priesthood; he is the holder of the priesthood.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> His wife shares the blessings of the priesthood with him. He is not elevated in any way above the divine status of his wife. President Gordon B. Hinckley in last April’s general priesthood meeting stated: “In the marriage companionship there is neither inferiority nor superiority. The woman does not walk ahead of the man; neither does the man walk ahead of the woman. They walk side by side as a son and daughter of God on an eternal journey.”</p>

They serve behind the scenes quietly but effectively, supporting the family and home while their husbands are ministering to the Saints.

In addition, she is a mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother of a large family. Some time ago, as she was struggling to meet the demands of these multiple roles, she said, “What I need is a wife!” Of course, what she meant was that she felt the need for support from someone who would take care of the countless details a righteous, caring wife handles so well.</p>

This means being prepared. We all remember the parable of the ten virgins who had been invited to a wedding supper. Five were wise and prepared, with oil in their lamps, to meet the bridegroom; the other five were not. All ten trimmed their lamps, but five had not taken enough oil with them and had run out. We all need the light of our lamps to get us through the darkness. We all want to meet the Bridegroom and attend the wedding feast.</p>

Kimball clarified this tragedy of unpreparedness. He said the five foolish virgins in the parable “had been taught. They had been warned all their lives.” During the day both wise and foolish seemed alike, but “at the darkest hour, when least expected, the bridegroom came.” The five whose lamps had gone out rushed out to get the needed oil, but by the time they reached the banqueting hall, the door was shut. It was too late.</p>

In our lives the oil of preparedness is accumulated drop by drop in righteous living. Attendance at sacrament meetings adds oil to our lamps, drop by drop over the years. Fasting, family prayer, home teaching, control of bodily appetites, preaching the gospel, studying the scriptures—each act of dedication and obedience is a drop added to our store. Deeds of kindness, payment of offerings and tithes, chaste thoughts and actions, marriage in the covenant for eternity—these, too, contribute importantly to the oil with which we can at midnight refuel our exhausted lamps.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

We are all heaven sent, but what we are able to accomplish in the Lord’s work depends to a large extent on our willingness and ability.</p>

This divinely inspired organization has not only blessed her life but also the lives of each of our family members. Involvement in Relief Society can help you replenish the oil in your lamps. It can provide for you much of the stability and stamina you will need as you weather the storms of life and journey through mortality.</p>

We had been friends for many years and found it mutually beneficial to help one another. One day, one associate sought our help on a complex matter. As soon as the issue had been explained, the first thing the other associate said was, “What’s in it for me?” When his old friend responded so selfishly, I saw the look of pain and disappointment on the face of the one who had invited our help. The relationship between the two was never quite the same after that. Our self-serving friend did not prosper, as his selfishness soon eclipsed his considerable gifts, talents, and qualities. Unfortunately, one of the curses of the world today is encapsulated in this selfish response, “What’s in it for me?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/whats-in-it-for-me.p3" pid="HF_7OmW-Lk-z03YdOkFK9Q" hash="laHk8A">During my professional career, I helped the heirs of a noble couple settle their estate. The estate was not large, but it was the fruit of many years of hard work and sacrifice. Their children were all decent, God-fearing people who had been taught to live the saving principles of the Savior. But when it came to dividing up the property, a dispute developed about who should get what. Even though there was nothing of great value to fight about, feelings of selfishness and greed caused a rift among some of the family members that never healed and continued into the next generation. How tragic that the legacy offered by these wonderful parents turned out to be so destructive of family unity and love among their children. I learned from this that selfishness and greed bring bitterness and contention; on the other hand sacrifice and giving bring peace and contentment.</p>

In contrast, Satan, who had been highly regarded as “a son of the morning,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> countered that he would come and “redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Satan had two conditions: the first was the denial of agency, and the second, that he would have the honor. In other words, something had to be in it for him. And thus he became the father of lies and selfishness.</p>

Selfishness is one of the baser human traits, which must be subdued and overcome. We torture our souls when we focus on getting rather than giving. Often the first word that many little children learn to say is <span class="emphasis">mine.</span> They have to be taught the joy of sharing. Surely, one of the great schoolmasters for overcoming selfishness is parenthood. Mothers go into the valley of the shadow of death to bring forth children. Parents work hard and give up so much to shelter, feed, clothe, protect, and educate their children.</p>

For a while he did well as far as the Church and its activities were concerned, and he prospered financially. However, he became so caught up in his possessions that he forgot about his purpose in coming to America. The bishop visited him and implored him to become active as he used to be. The years passed and some of his brethren visited him and said: “Now, Lars, the Lord was good to you when you were in Denmark. He has been good to you since you have come here. … We think now, since you are growing a little older, that it would be well for you to spend some of your time in the interests of the Church.

Because he had been studying the story of the Good Samaritan<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> and didn’t just want to learn about the Good Samaritan but wanted to know what it felt like to be one by doing what a Good Samaritan would do. … Only after careful questioning by his father about his activities”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> did he admit, “But, Dad, every time I help my friend, I feel I’m becoming more like the Good Samaritan. Besides that, I want to help my classmates who aren’t as fortunate as I. It’s not that big of a thing I am doing. I read about it in my seminary manual and felt it was the thing I ought to do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> The boy did not ask, “What’s in it for me?” before performing this kindness. In fact, he did it without any thought of recompense or recognition.</p>

He was in his office when “the first plane struck the north tower at 8:48 <small>A.M.</small> … He took a call from the 71st floor reporting the fireball in One World Trade Center, and he immediately ordered an evacuation of all 2,700 employees in Building Two,” as well as 1,000 more in Building Five. Using his bullhorn, he moved up the floors, working through a bottleneck on the 44th and going as high as the 72nd, helping to evacuate the people from each floor.

As President of the Church, President Gordon B. Hinckley has accomplished an insurmountable group of tasks. Yet he was once a young Aaronic Priesthood holder like many of you. You young men of the Aaronic Priesthood are going to be the future leaders of the Church. This evening I wish to address my remarks mainly to you. You need to understand that success—both for yourself and the Church—will depend on your determination to accomplish the work of the Lord. Each of you will need to have faith and confidence to move forward.</p>

It is the power to act righteously in the name of the Lord to build up the kingdom of God on earth. I remind you “that the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Priesthood is divine agency, and the Lord will hold us accountable for our use of this great authority.</p>

As a child, I was interested in the story because the train cars were filled with toy animals, toy clowns, jackknives, puzzles, and books as well as delicious things to eat. However, the engine that was pulling the train over the mountain broke down. The story relates that a big passenger engine came by and was asked to pull the cars over the mountain, but he wouldn’t condescend to pull the little train. Another engine came by, but he wouldn’t stoop to help the little train over the mountain because he was a freight engine. An old engine came by, but he would not help because, he said, “I am so tired. … I can not. I can not. I can not.”</p>

The little engine responded, “I’m not very big. … They use me only for switching in the yard. I have never been over the mountain.” But she was concerned about disappointing the children on the other side of the mountain if they didn’t get all of the goodies in the cars. So she said, “I think I can. I think I can. I think I can.” And she hooked herself to the little train. “Puff, puff, chug, chug, went the Little Blue Engine. ‘I think I can—I think I can—I think I can—I think I can—I think I can—I think I can—I think I can.’” With this attitude, the little engine reached the top of the mountain and went down the other side, saying, “I thought I could. I thought I could. I thought I could. I thought I could. I thought I could. I thought I could.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

I’m reminded of President Theodore Roosevelt’s quip, “I am only an average man but, by George, I work harder at it than the average man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> We develop our talents first by thinking we can. We are all familiar with the parable of the talents. The Master gave one five talents, another two, and another one, “every man according to his several ability. …</p>

We stand back in the “eat, drink, and be merry” mode when opportunities for growth and development abound. We miss opportunities to build up the kingdom of God because we have the passive notion that someone else will take care of it. The Lord tells us that He will give more to those who are willing. They will be magnified in their efforts, like the little blue engine as it pulled the train up the mountain.

He became convinced that the main body of the Saints should not settle in the Rocky Mountains but should go on to California. So he traveled east and encountered the first party of emigrants under the leadership of Brigham Young in Green River, Wyoming. He used all of his persuasive powers trying to convince Brigham Young to take advantage of the opportunities which he felt California offered. Brigham Young responded, “Let us go to California, and we cannot stay there over five years; but let us stay in the mountains, and we can raise our own potatoes, and eat them; and I calculate to stay here.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Brannan stayed with the main body of the Saints for a few days, but then, because he was headstrong and self-centered, in August of 1847 he headed back to California.</p>

Instead he was directed toward business and making money. He became the first millionaire in California, with numerous business ventures and extensive land holdings. Because he had been the leader of that group of Saints, President Young asked him to account for the tithing that he had collected from the members of the Church in California, including those involved in the gold rush, but he did not do so. Nor did he use those funds to establish the Church or to help the members there.</p>

Eventually it was placed in San Diego’s Mount Hope Cemetery.

We can conceive of the power of Priesthood as being potentially existent as an impounded reservoir of water. Such power becomes dynamic and productive of good only when the liberated force becomes active in valleys, fields, gardens and happy homes; so the principle of power is manifested only as it becomes active in the lives of men, turning their hearts and desires toward God, and prompting service to their fellow men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> If we aren’t serving others, then the priesthood really doesn’t benefit us because it is not a passive power.

Many people do not fully understand the meaning of <span class="emphasis">virtue.</span> One commonly understood meaning is to be chaste or morally clean, but <span class="emphasis">virtue</span> in its fuller sense encompasses all traits of righteousness that help us form our character. An old sampler found in a museum in Newfoundland, stitched in 1813, reads: “Virtue is the chiefest beauty of the mind, the noblest ornament of humankind. Virtue is our safeguard and our guiding star that stirs up reason when our senses err.”</p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is “the foundation of all righteousness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> I promise you sweet young ladies if you will strive to live the commandments, your faith will continue to grow.

We become co-creators with God in having family and posterity. Chastity before marriage followed by fidelity after marriage is a sacred passport to self-respect and happiness for everyone. President N.

For example, when you receive a compliment, receive it graciously, but don’t let it go to your head. You young ladies have learned much, but you have more to learn. A person who is humble is teachable. Indeed, the Lord has promised, “For my Spirit is sent forth into the world to enlighten the humble and contrite.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> One of my favorite sayings is this: “Learn to say, ‘I don’t know.’ If used when appropriate, it will be often.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

It was shaped something like an upside-down plate that went round and round. Most of us tried to get to the middle so we wouldn’t be thrown off by the centrifugal force as the saucer picked up speed. Sometimes those on the edge would grab a friend who was closer to the middle, but that would pull them both completely off the saucer. I soon recognized that the centrifugal force was far less powerful in the middle. I was quite safe in the center even though the saucer was still spinning. But it was risky when someone on the fringe latched on to me. I learned that safety comes from staying close to the center.</p>

When the Jews were in captivity, Esther was married to King Ahasuerus. The king signed a decree that all Jews were to be put to death. Esther’s cousin Mordecai urged her to intercede with the king on behalf of her people by saying to her, “Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> Esther, at the peril of her own life, pled with the king that her people should be spared. The king listened to her entreaty, and they were saved. One woman can make a great difference, even for a nation.</p>

I believe your spirits may have been reserved for these latter days; that you, like Esther, have come to earth “for such a time as this.” It may be that your most significant, everlasting achievements will be your righteous influence on others, that your divine feminine inner beauty and intuition will find expression in your quiet strength, gentleness, dignity, charm, graciousness, creativity, sensitivity, radiance, and spirituality. Enhance these sublime feminine gifts. They will make you appealing and even irresistible as you serve others as the handmaidens of God.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p1" pid="8asGmJDbrUSJItLaAmVXXA" hash="CAZngg">My dear brethren of the priesthood, tonight I address my remarks to all of you, but in particular to the young men. My purpose is to instruct and warn you of dangers that lie ahead, but I also want to express my love for you and the great confidence I have in you as the rising generation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p2" pid="na_VaFlQrkOzWSQ6EUwMYw" hash="BXhDLg">As a young man I served a mission to Brazil. It was a marvelous experience. One of the wonders of the world in that great country is Iguaçu Falls. In the flood season, the volume of water spilling over the brink is the largest in the world. Every few minutes, millions of gallons of water cascade into the chasm below. One part of the falls, where the deluge is the heaviest, is called the Devil’s Throat.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p3" pid="gtHEj_-fpUitVZdkdVYigQ" hash="jKK8Gw">There are some large rocks standing just above, before the water rushes down into Devil’s Throat. Years ago, reckless boatmen would take passengers in canoes to stand on those rocks and look down into the Devil’s Throat. The water above the falls is usually calm and slow moving, and the atmosphere tranquil. Only the roar of the water below forewarns of the danger lurking just a few feet away. A sudden, unexpected current could take a canoe into the rushing waters, over the cliff, and down into the Devil’s Throat. Those foolish enough to leave the canoes to stand on these treacherous wet rocks could so easily lose their footing and be swept away into the swirling currents below.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p4" pid="VcRu7ynNa02n-SjxNwuzAg" hash="5fDD5g">I recognize that some of you think of yourselves as daredevils, ready to take on almost any challenge. But some of these excursions for excitement will inevitably take you down into the Devil’s Throat. The only safe course is to stay well away from the dangers of the Devil’s Throat. President George Albert Smith strongly cautioned, “If you cross to the devil’s side of the line one inch, you are in the tempter’s power, and if he is successful, you will not be able to think or even reason properly, because you will have lost the spirit of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p5" pid="J2YXtXQoW0K0SMX7NmQAjg" hash="aDJ-Lg">Some of you young men may be letting others set your standards. You defend yourselves by saying, “Who said we shouldn’t do this or we shouldn’t do that?” There are so many shades of right and wrong that each of you has to decide where the line will be. I strongly urge you that if there is any question in your minds or hearts about whether your personal conduct is right or wrong, don’t do it. Each of us has moral agency, and the gift of the Holy Ghost will sharpen our impressions of what is right and wrong, true and false. It is the responsibility of the prophets of God to teach the word of God, not to spell out every jot and tittle of human conduct. If we are conscientiously trying to avoid not only evil but the very appearance of evil, we will act for ourselves and not be acted upon.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p6" pid="0pVmy9t7N0uHCxFH7GGqtg" hash="bZJDqQ">Much of what comes from the devil is alluring and enticing. It glitters and is appealing to the sensual parts of our nature. His message sounds so reasonable and easy to justify. His voice is usually smooth and intriguing. If it were harsh or discordant, nobody would listen, nobody would be enticed. Some of Satan’s most appealing messages are: Everyone does it; if it doesn’t hurt anybody else, it’s all right; if you feel there is no harm in it, it’s okay; it’s the “cool” thing to do. Satan is the greatest imitator, the master deceiver, the arch counterfeiter, and the greatest forger ever in the history of the world. He comes into our lives as a thief in the night. His disguise is so perfect that it is hard to recognize him or his methods. He is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p7" pid="w1ngz-YgAUmNzues2Fx7Kw" hash="EhHvWQ">There have always been two great competing forces in the world. These began before the world was created. These opposing forces are the forces of good and evil. Between these two powerful forces each of us is caught in a tug of war. In simple terms, that which is good comes from God, and that which is evil comes from the devil.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> You can’t have it both ways and find true happiness; some have tried, but in the long run all have failed. If any of you young men think you can have it both ways, you are only deceiving yourselves. It doesn’t work that way. It never has. It never will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p8" pid="AZGTQPuL5UKHsHAvlzwMHA" hash="BbnSFg">My dear young friends, there is another great truth that you young men must learn. It is that everything has a price. There is a price to pay for success, fulfillment, accomplishment, and joy. There are no freebies. If you don’t pay the price that is needed for success, you will pay the price of failure. Preparation, work, study, and service are required to achieve and find happiness. Disobedience and lack of preparation carry a terrible price tag. As priesthood holders of this Church, part of the price we need to pay is by living differently from the world. We are the possessors and custodians of these commanding powers which can and do roll back the power of Satan on the earth. With all my heart I urge you to please help us push back the world. We must stand against the wind. Sometimes we must be unpopular and simply say, “This is not right.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p9" pid="LUtNPmOWPEqwTTGkjZl_Xw" hash="EOE3-w">All of us want to find out who we really are and what our place is in the world. Some of you young people are trying to find your identity by being different from your parents and families in what they stand for. God made each of us to be different from anyone else in the world, as our DNA and fingerprints prove. You don’t have to work at having a separate identity; you already have one.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p10" pid="dcJm-qfdA0izxeU_E6uqHg" hash="2cpsZA">Some young people want to rebel against restraints. Some of you think it isn’t “cool” to be obedient to your parents or to follow the counsel of your bishop or quorum president. Bishop Richard C. Edgley shared an experience he had as a young boy about the consequences of being reckless and disobedient:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p11" pid="ZnKUxpdiqESPj6u_jCc0kg" hash="AKqXLg">“When I was a young boy, our garage and the neighbor’s garage were about five feet apart. The neighbor’s garage was very old and dilapidated, and some of the boards were breaking. I, on occasion, would climb onto our garage and jump from one garage to the other and play on top of them. My father had told me, ‘Stay off the garages,’ but I didn’t. One time when I was playing on them, I jumped from our garage and fell through the roof of the neighbor’s garage, scraping my back and legs badly. Because I had been disobedient, I foolishly decided not to tell anyone that I had hurt myself. I went in the house and washed the scrapes and scratches as well as I could, but I couldn’t reach the ones on my back to put antiseptic on them or even wash them clean. I bore the burden of pain, worry over infection setting in, and guilt for several days while the healing process took place.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p12" pid="orUb6asThkW96JVlPS0gRg" hash="eNukXQ">As someone once said, “One of the best things in the world to be is a boy; it requires no experience, but needs some practice to be a good one.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p13" pid="j1KC3-P9uEq-Y7vA9XL3nw" hash="KraFaA">Some of you may have been deceived by thinking that you can find excitement by dabbling in drugs, alcohol, pornography, and illicit sex. I warn you that such enticements as these are slippery and dangerous like the rocks by the Devil’s Throat, and they will only lead you into Satan’s territory. The way out of that kind of danger is difficult and will leave you with far more than a few scrapes and scratches.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p14" pid="D8_ufA8ghkKOlLMfQdSRNw" hash="YyDJcw">You young men will be working out your eternal destiny at an interesting time. In the future there will continue to be an increase in scientific discoveries and inventions which will make life more comfortable and easier for many. No doubt medical science will continue to find new treatments and cures not available now. In contrast, the worldly influences of evil will likely increase, and more people will become vulnerable to the deceit and enticement of Satan. You young men will need to become stronger spiritually and morally in order to withstand the temptations and snares of the world. Perhaps this is why such special spirits have been reserved for this time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p15" pid="aFX21SumPk2AyeuIDnSFuA" hash="85I_6Q">I also believe that in the future the opposition from Satan will be both more subtle and more open. While in some ways it may be more blatant, it will be masked with greater sophistication and cunning. We will need greater spirituality to perceive all the forms of evil and greater strength to resist it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p16" pid="jNp_FrQEVk2XCuBIqrN_0Q" hash="-hMZQA">Many countries now face the dangers of terrorism. War exposes people to bodily harm, but there is also exposure to moral harm. Those of us who have served in the military in wartime have experienced the disruption in life that comes from being uprooted from home and family, wholesome associations, and the influence of the organized Church. I warn those who are now serving in the military, or who may do so, against the pitfalls of these disruptions. They can take us into the very jaws of the Devil’s Throat.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p17" pid="rQRNwgDuQEmbSPlFn2m7Yw" hash="GEh_TQ">Many of the activities you will be engaged in are group situations where you cannot always choose your own company. But you can choose your standards. In the military you belong to an outfit where part of its strength comes from the unity of its members. You need to be loyal to the members of your unit because the fellow who is next to you may save your life tomorrow! But that doesn’t mean you have to lower your moral standards. In any association there needs to be one or more who stand up and say, “What we are doing is not right.” It takes moral courage to do this!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p18" pid="vWEPUuJpm06bSFMDj9LzkA" hash="I_CrEg">The Church recently republished the servicemen’s edition of <span class="emphasis">Principles of the Gospel</span> for members of the Church serving in the military anywhere in the world. While it is now only available in English, it will be translated into other languages. This excellent resource contains instructions for Church activity and the wearing of the garment in the military, priesthood ordinances and blessings, gospel topics, and a few selected hymns. We had a similar resource available to those of us who served in the military in World War II. I found it to be invaluable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/the-devils-throat.p19" pid="0g8fG8jzrE2AfOQLGtbjqQ" hash="rg6mBw">There is a continuing sifting process going on. We are reminded of the parable of the wheat and the tares. In that parable the Lord said, “The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field,” but while he slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the grain, so that when the blades of wheat sprouted, so did the weeds. The man’s workers did not understand how weeds got into the field and asked if they should go and pull the weeds. The owner of the field said no, because while you pull the weeds, you also pull up the grain. So he counseled that the grain and the weeds grow together until the time of harvest, when the wheat would be bundled separately from the weeds.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

We will be strengthened and preserved if we follow the counsel and direction of President Gordon B. Hinckley, who is at the helm. I have a special witness that he is our prophet, seer, and revelator. He is the mouthpiece of God on the earth today. I pray the Lord’s blessings to be with us all, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In contemplating your deep anguish, I am reminded of the words of Jeremiah, “A voice was heard in Ramah, … Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted.” To this the Lord gave this welcome reassurance, “Refrain thy voice from weeping, … for thy work shall be rewarded … ; they shall come again from the land of the enemy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/dear-are-the-sheep-that-have-wandered.p2" pid="dYkz3r38aEmhXH9nY0ezvA" hash="6i4iIQ">I must begin by testifying that the word of the Lord to parents in this Church is contained in the 68th section of the Doctrine and Covenants in this remarkable instruction: “And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Parents are instructed to “teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> As a father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, I accept this as the word of the Lord, and as a servant of Jesus Christ, I urge parents to follow this counsel as conscientiously as they can.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/dear-are-the-sheep-that-have-wandered.p3" pid="CNSTOVrb4E-T9asvnU7Lxg" hash="_Zhu5Q">Who are good parents? They are those who have lovingly, prayerfully, and earnestly tried to teach their children by example and precept “to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> This is true even though some of their children are disobedient or worldly. Children come into this world with their own distinct spirits and personality traits. Some children “would challenge any set of parents under any set of circumstances. … Perhaps there are others who would bless the lives of, and be a joy to, almost any father or mother.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Successful parents are those who have sacrificed and struggled to do the best they can in their own family circumstances.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/dear-are-the-sheep-that-have-wandered.p4" pid="Tpu1ptDOZ0-dSY6XdUyZGg" hash="m5YcTA">The depth of the love of parents for their children cannot be measured. It is like no other relationship. It exceeds concern for life itself. The love of a parent for a child is continuous and transcends heartbreak and disappointment. All parents hope and pray that their children will make wise decisions. Children who are obedient and responsible bring to their parents unending pride and satisfaction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/dear-are-the-sheep-that-have-wandered.p5" pid="QdC2wO8aB0WyG2TiPvd4TQ" hash="k6AiKg">But what if the children who have been taught by faithful, loving parents have rebelled or been led astray? Is there hope? The grief of a parent over a rebellious child is almost inconsolable. King David’s third son, Absalom, killed one of his brothers and also led a rebellion against his father. Absalom was killed by Joab. Upon hearing of Absalom’s death, King David wept and expressed his sadness: “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

When his rebellious son returned home after having squandered his inheritance in riotous living, the father killed the fatted calf and celebrated the return of the prodigal, saying to his obedient, if resentful, son, “It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

Though some of the sheep may wander, the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold. Either in this life or the life to come, they will return. They will have to pay their debt to justice; they will suffer for their sins; and may tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last, like the penitent Prodigal, to a loving and forgiving father’s heart and home, the painful experience will not have been in vain. Pray for your careless and disobedient children; hold on to them with your faith. Hope on, trust on, till you see the salvation of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

There he was welcomed back into the family, but his inheritance was spent.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Mercy will not rob justice, and the sealing power of faithful parents will only claim wayward children upon the condition of their repentance and Christ’s Atonement. Repentant wayward children will enjoy salvation and all the blessings that go with it, but exaltation is much more. It must be fully earned. The question as to who will be exalted must be left to the Lord in His mercy.</p>

My love for my father deepened profoundly when he was kind, patient, and understanding. When I damaged the family car, he was gentle and forgiving. But his sons could expect strong discipline if there was any shading of the truth or continued breaking of the rules, particularly showing disrespect for our mother. My father has been gone for almost half a century, but I still sorely miss being able to go to him for wise and loving counsel. I admit I questioned his counsel at times, but I could never question his love for me. I never wanted to disappoint him.</p>

If we do not discipline our children, society may do it in a way that is not to our liking or our children’s. Part of disciplining children is to teach them to work. President Gordon B.

If parents misbehave and stray even temporarily, some of their children may be prone to take license from that example.</p>

I make a plea for children who are estranged from their parents to reach out to them, even if they have been less than they should have been. Children who are critical of their parents might well remember the wise counsel of Moroni when he said, “Condemn me not because of mine imperfection, neither my father, because of his imperfection, neither them who have written before him; but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

Fortunate are the couples who have children and grandchildren who bring them comfort and satisfaction. We should be considerate of those worthy, righteous parents who struggle and suffer with disobedient children. One of my friends used to say, “If you have never had any problems with your children, just wait awhile.” No one can say with any degree of certainty what their children will do under certain circumstances. When my wise mother-in-law saw other children misbehaving, she used to say, “I never say my children would not do that because they might be out doing it right while I am speaking!” When parents mourn for disobedient and wayward children we must, with compassion, “forbid the casting of the first stone.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>

He got involved in drugs. He resisted all efforts at control and discipline. He was deceitful and defiant. Unlike the prodigal, this errant son did not come home of his own accord. Instead he got caught by the police and was forced to face the consequences of his actions. For two years his parents supported Bill’s treatment program, which brought about his eventual recovery from drugs. In summary, Bill’s sister observed: “I think my parents are extraordinary. They never wavered in their love for Bill, though they disagreed with and even hated what he was doing to himself and to their family life. But they were committed enough to their family to support Bill in any way necessary to get him through the tough times and onto more solid ground. They practiced the deeper, more sensitive, and extensive gospel of Christ by loving one who had gone astray.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>

Many of us are at times like the father who asked the Savior to heal his child with the “dumb spirit.” The father of the child cried out, “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> To all those with lingering doubts and questions, there are ways to help your unbelief. In the process of accepting and rejecting information in the search for light, truth, and knowledge, almost everyone has—at one time or another—some private questions. That is part of the learning process.</p>

The gospel as restored by Joseph Smith is either true or it is not. To receive all of the promised blessings we must accept the gospel in faith and in full. However, this certain faith does not usually come all at once. We learn spiritually line upon line and precept upon precept.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/lord-i-believe-help-thou-mine-unbelief.p4" pid="_pBWxLhqtUuf77uYrc2G0A" hash="muwD5g">Joseph Hamstead, a lecturer at London University, had talked about the Church and its youth and family programs to fellow lecturers at that great university. One of them said: “I like all of this, what is being done for families, etc. If you could take out that bit about an angel appearing to Joseph Smith, I could belong to your church.” Brother Hamstead replied, “Ah, but if you take away the angel appearing to the Prophet Joseph, then I couldn’t belong to the Church because that is its foundation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

They appreciate what the Church can do for its believers. However, they lack the spiritual confirmation that Joseph Smith actually saw in vision the Father and the Son and that an angel delivered to Joseph Smith the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. Coming to know God is the principal spiritual gift that can come to any man or woman. Joseph Smith received this knowledge of God firsthand. Many years later, still pondering the impact of that and other happenings in his life, Joseph himself said: “I don’t blame any one for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I would not have believed it myself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Yet even those who do not believe it happened may find it difficult to explain away. Too much has happened since it occurred to deny that it ever took place.</p>

However, there are two indispensable elements. One must “ask with a <span class="emphasis">sincere heart,</span> with <span class="emphasis">real intent,</span>” and then God “will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

To begin with, the Three Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses, who handled the plates and saw the engravings, testified that the Book of Mormon was translated by the power of God. Members of Joseph Smith’s family, who knew him best, also accepted and believed his message. Among the believers were his parents, his brothers and his sisters, and his uncle John Smith. His older brother Hyrum proved his complete faith in Joseph’s work by giving his life along with Joseph. These reliable witnesses all confirm the Prophet’s testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/lord-i-believe-help-thou-mine-unbelief.p9" pid="lRK1_URCF0OsO3fhx2q5gQ" hash="C5sTBA">His closest associates were absolute in their belief in Joseph Smith’s divine mission. Two of them, Willard Richards and John Taylor, were with Joseph and Hyrum when they were killed. Joseph asked Willard Richards if he would be willing to go with them. Willard unequivocally said: “Brother Joseph you did not ask me to cross the river with you—you did not ask me to come to Carthage—you did not ask me to come to jail with you—and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

President Hinckley said, “Every temple, be it large or small, old or new, is an expression of our testimony that life beyond the grave is as real and certain as is mortality.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Those who cherish their family have a compelling reason to claim the transcendent blessing of being sealed for eternity in the temples of God. For all grandparents, parents, husbands, wives, children, and grandchildren, this sealing power and authority is a crowning principle, a pinnacle in the restoration “of all things”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Sealings bind forever. This blessing can be extended to those now living and also vicariously for those who have died, thus binding families for eternity.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

It is a unique institution. Nothing quite compares to it. As Gamaliel reasoned when Peter and the early Apostles were testifying of the divinity of Jesus Christ:</p>

To those who say, “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief,” may I suggest that “you look forward with an eye of faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> To those who do this, the Lord has promised, “I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

But from 1833 to 1834 he was influenced by some dissidents in Kirtland. He was once in the home of Joseph Smith. Joseph came out of the room where he had been translating the word of God and immediately began to play with some children. “This convinced [Brother Wakefield] that [Joseph] was not a man of God and that [therefore] the work was false.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> In due course Joseph Wakefield apostatized, was excommunicated, and became a persecutor of the Church and of the Saints.</p>

Comparing herself to others whose impressive conversion stories she had heard, she asked herself, “Why are these people converted so powerfully, and I, with my pioneer heritage, remain unconverted?” She began to read the Book of Mormon even though she doubted its worth and found it boring. Then a friend challenged her. She said, “You say you believe in prayer. Well, why don’t you pray about it?”</p>

It was no longer boring. The more she read, the more fascinated she became with it and thought, “Joseph Smith couldn’t have written that—these words were from God!” She finished reading it and wondered how God would tell her that it was true. She said: “A power strong, beautiful, and joyful moved completely through my body. … I knew that Jesus Christ was resurrected, … that Joseph Smith was a prophet who saw God and Jesus Christ. I knew that he miraculously translated ancient records with God’s guidance. I knew that Joseph Smith received revelations from God.” It changed her life because now she too was a convert!<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith said, “I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> One cannot successfully attack true principles or doctrine, because they are eternal. The revelations that came through the Prophet Joseph Smith are still correct! It is a mistake to let distractions, slights, or offenses pull down our own house of faith.</p>

But when you pick up a stick you pick up both ends. And so it is with the gospel. As members of the Church we need to accept all of it. Even limited spiritual assurance of some of the aspects of the gospel is a blessing, and in time the other elements of which you are uncertain can come through faith and obedience.</p>

As prophesied by Isaiah, many today “call evil good, and good evil.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> Revelations from the prophets of God are not like offerings at the cafeteria, some to be selected and others disregarded. We are greatly indebted to the Prophet Joseph Smith for the many great revelations which came through him.

Spiritual knowledge always requires an exercise of faith. We acquire a testimony of the principles of the gospel by obediently trying to live them. Said the Savior, “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> A testimony of the efficacy of prayer comes through humble and sincere prayer. A testimony of tithing comes by paying tithing. Do not let your private doubts separate you from the divine source of knowledge. Prayerfully go forward, humbly seeking eternal light, and your unbelief will be dispelled. I testify that if you continue in the purposeful process of searching for and accepting spiritual light, truth, and knowledge, it will surely come. By going forward in faith, you will find that your faith will increase. Like a good seed, if it is not cast out by your unbelief, it will swell within your breast.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>

No one can successfully dispute or challenge it because it is so personal a gift to the one to whom it has been given. It will be as an ever-recharging spiritual energizer to keep our spiritual light running to show us the way to eternal happiness. But I testify that it can be more—much, much more. By covenanting with “God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days,” our “hearts are changed through faith on [Christ’s] name.” Thus we may be “born of him and … become his sons and his daughters.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span> I have a certain knowledge of this, which I declare in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p2" pid="NtqHfsrIz0moo4lPos8QKA" hash="mv43FA">Picture with me a little six-year-old orphan girl traveling across the plains of America. Her name is Elsie Ann. Her mother died when she was two. Her father remarried, and so for a time she had a stepmother. Then her father died at Winter Quarters when she was five. Her stepmother remarried and moved away, leaving this little orphan behind with Peter and Selina Robison, who were related to her stepmother. Elsie Ann left Winter Quarters with the Robisons in July of 1849 to come west. As she watched Selina care for her 10-month-old baby girl, she no doubt ached for the love of her own mother. Sometimes she would even ask, “Where is my mother?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p3" pid="Lsjq44136EegfYf9Hj95jg" hash="M27Rzw">My heart goes out to this little girl when I think of her facing her uncertain future with no blood relatives to comfort and help her. Elsie Ann was my great-grandmother, and only recently did we find out who her mother really was. For years we thought Elsie Ann was Jane Robison’s daughter. Careful research discovered her true parentage, and after all these years Elsie Ann now has been sealed to her father, John Akerley, and her mother, Mary Moore.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p4" pid="PNJDjNedjkq1CQgzo1VeMw" hash="fMWrrA">My grandparents have had a great influence on my life. Even though they have been dead for many years, I still feel their confirming love. One grandfather, James Akerley Faust, died before I was born. I knew him only through the stories my grandmother and my parents told about him. However, I feel a strong kinship with him because I am in part what he was. Among other things, he was a cowboy, a rancher, and a postmaster in a small town in central Utah. On one occasion Grandfather took a trip in the winter to Idaho, where he met an acquaintance who had fallen on hard times. It was cold, and Grandfather’s friend had no coat. Grandfather took off his coat and gave it to him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p5" pid="TnyceMMKjEazFjxCPDyT5Q" hash="tXpTqw">This evening I encourage you young men to begin to unlock the knowledge of who you really are by learning more about your forebears. Alex Haley, the author of the book <span class="emphasis">Roots,</span> said: “In all of us there is a hunger, marrow-deep, to know our heritage—to know who we are and where we have come from. Without this enriching knowledge, there is a hollow yearning. No matter what our attainments in life, there is still a vacuum, an emptiness, and the most disquieting loneliness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> We can have exciting experiences as we learn about our vibrant, dynamic ancestors. They were very real, living people with problems, hopes, and dreams like we have today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p6" pid="VmQeXi_F9kabJ9HrWteNZA" hash="0P5kow">In many ways each of us is the sum total of what our ancestors were. The virtues they had may be our virtues, their strengths our strengths, and in a way their challenges could be our challenges. Some of their traits may be our traits. I noticed a while ago that one of my great-grandsons, a toddler, seemed to have an interesting kind of a walk. My wife said, “He walks just like you do!” Now I wonder from whom I inherited this characteristic.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p7" pid="6v8pschMe0evJK3zu1ir1A" hash="0jGgMQ">It is a joy to become acquainted with our forebears who died long ago. Each of us has a fascinating family history. Finding your ancestors can be one of the most interesting puzzles you young men can work on.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p8" pid="VPbubWB5ZUOCslCG8Vy60w" hash="K5ZwbA">Each of us has to begin this work somewhere, and it can be done by young or old. This summer 170 children of the Accra Ghana Lartebiokorshie Stake worked on their four-generation family trees during a two-hour program, with more than 74 completing and displaying their trees.</p>

Packer has said, “If you don’t know where to start, start with <span class="emphasis">yourself.</span> If you don’t know what records to get, and how to get them, start with what you have.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> You will learn about the phenomenon that is you. It can be more fascinating than any movie you might see or any computer game you might play. You will need to find out who your grandparents and great-grandparents were and what temple work has been done for them. If you don’t know how to get this information, ask people in your ward who do know how.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p10" pid="NMAlX0O5SEKz3-mvooootw" hash="wvJ8Ow">Ask living members of your family what they know about your extended family. Look at records close at hand, such as family Bibles, to find more details about your forebears. Then you can reach out to other sources such as vital records, church records, census records, and military records. If you have access to a computer, you can put your computer skills to work and log on to the Church’s FamilySearch.org Web site. Family history has become a sophisticated activity where computers provide immense resources for your search. You can easily access a vast collection of family history records using the Internet on your home computer or at your nearest family history center.</p>

They are part of an unequaled record-keeping system that helps preserve the heritage of families all over the world. In the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, patrons are constantly corresponding and submitting information about their family histories. One person wrote, “We are sending you five children in a separate envelope.”</p>

We do this work for a purpose, which is to redeem our dead ancestors. Temple work is essential for both us and our kindred dead who are waiting for these saving ordinances to be done for them. It is essential because “we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> They need the saving ordinances, and we need to be sealed to them. For this reason it is important that we trace our family lines so that no one is left out.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p13" pid="ofd1DkAAckqgDi9neMQefw" hash="OWyxbQ">Searching for our kindred dead isn’t just a hobby. It is a fundamental responsibility for all members of the Church. We believe that life continues after death and that all will be resurrected.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> We believe that families may continue in the next life if they have kept the special covenants made in one of the sacred temples under the authority of God. We believe that our deceased ancestors can also be eternally united with their families when we make covenants in their behalf in the temples. Our deceased forebears may accept these covenants, if they choose to do so, in the spirit world.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith explained the terrible dilemma which would face God’s children without temple work for our dead. Said he: “One dies and is buried, having never heard the Gospel of reconciliation; to the other the message of salvation is sent, he hears and embraces it, and is made the heir of eternal life. Shall the one become the partaker of glory and the other be consigned to hopeless perdition? Is there no chance for his escape?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Fortunately our ancestors will have the opportunity to receive and accept the saving ordinances as we identify them and complete these sacred ordinances for them by proxy. We do for them what they cannot do for themselves. It is a very satisfying experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p15" pid="8wwZsuSfS0i0S1sSjjkNfA" hash="8HZjeQ">In the great vision in the Kirtland Temple, Elijah the prophet appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and committed the keys of temple work and the sealing power into Joseph Smith’s hands.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> This fulfilled Malachi’s prophecy that Elijah would be sent “to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

To turn our hearts to our fathers is to search out the names of our deceased ancestors and to perform the saving ordinances in the temple for them. This will forge a continuous chain between us and our forefathers eventually all the way back to Father Adam and Mother Eve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p17" pid="FrhcGMn_KUeUki2tq2v0Kg" hash="s0zrEQ">The heart of an 11-year-old boy was turned to his fathers during a family home evening when the children assembled personal books of remembrance. Young Jeff wanted to accompany his mother to the National Archives. She was afraid he might disturb the other researchers there. But he persisted, and she relented and took him with her. Four hours into their research, he exclaimed, “Mama, I’ve found Grandpa!” Indeed, he had found his great-great-great-grandfather.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> However, it doesn’t always work that way. In a letter to the Family History Department, someone wrote: “We lost our grandmother. Will you please send us a copy?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p18" pid="q4te9pcyDUWCIi9K3wO2zg" hash="Jm3nsw">The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us that the celestial family organization will be “one that is <span class="emphasis">complete,</span>” that is, “an organization linked from father and mother and children of one generation, to the father and mother and children of the next generation, thus expanding and spreading out down to the end of time.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

This was the case of a university student in Provo, Utah, who caught the vision of this linking of generations. He was walking through the library one evening and remembered hearing someone in the Searing family tell about a town in New York State that had been named after an ancestor. So he decided to look up the town. He stumbled across a very old copy of a gazetteer of New York and read about a man named Simon Searing who helped settle Long Island in the mid-1600s. Could Simon be his ancestor? He had to know. He began research in earnest and traced his line back several generations. But still he needed to bridge the gap between the 1800s and the 1600s. Then a miracle occurred. He unexpectedly located a history of a <span class="emphasis">Syring</span> family. The families in the Syring book ended in the same generation he had reached in his own research. Not only was he able to connect many generations, but he also linked himself to the early settler Simon Searing.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p20" pid="1QlsydddEUKXwodtwzOFBw" hash="nPlNVQ">Some who are interested in family history try to enhance their own image by linking up with prominent people. In my own experience it has been quite different. I have been fascinated by learning of some of the unknown, ordinary people whose records tell of heroic lives. Arthur R. Bassett once said: “Who among us wants to throw stones at their own ancestors? I, for one, am intrigued by their battles—their victories as well as their defeats. … I am fascinated by what may seem the most commonplace of lives, because I have come to realize the excitement that is concealed in the commonplace.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

But if you do, it is important that their temple work be done, because we believe in repentance for the dead also:</p>

We often feel spiritual guidance as we go to the sources which identify them. Because this is a very spiritual work, we can expect help from the other side of the veil. We feel a pull from our relatives who are waiting for us to find them so their ordinance work can be done. This is a Christlike service because we are doing something for them that they cannot do for themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p25" pid="gNMlmzsRLkSSkKHXS8mqKA" hash="lvymcA">Many of you young men have already had a taste of temple work as you have participated in baptisms for the dead. When we go early to the temple, we often see young people dressed in white, ready to take part in this satisfying experience before going to school. You are to be commended for your dedication in performing this vital work. In so doing you have already felt the peace and serenity found within the walls of our temples.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-phenomenon-that-is-you.p26" pid="bWeRoHQLsEmhOW1Ke7SZxA" hash="ir7iFQ">I testify that God is a just God, and He will not give privileges to us and withhold them from our forebears. But we will need to do the baptisms, the endowments, and the sealings for them by proxy here on earth in order for us and them to be linked together for eternity “and have part in the first resurrection.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p2" pid="pP1_JW76-kmvgFdFGLCsDQ" hash="wHBcFA">In this life we have to make many choices. Some are very important choices. Some are not. Many of our choices are between good and evil. The choices we make, however, determine to a large extent our happiness or our unhappiness, because we have to live with the consequences of our choices. Making perfect choices all of the time is not possible. It just doesn’t happen. But it is possible to make good choices we can live with and grow from. When God’s children live worthy of divine guidance they can become “free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p3" pid="abdD9jYhUkmS6lfncThTFg" hash="QyLxzA">Sometimes we make poor choices when we yield to peer pressure. Kieth Merrill had such an experience when he was a young man. He and his friends were diving from sheer rock walls at the East Canyon Reservoir, northeast of Salt Lake City. It inevitably turned into a teenage contest when one young man climbed up to the top of the dam and dived 50 feet into the deep water of the reservoir. The rest of the young men all went to the top of the dam and made the same high dive. One boy wasn’t satisfied with that, so he said, “All right, I’ll do one better!” He climbed 60 feet up the side of the cliff. Not wanting to be outdone, Kieth climbed up beside him. After the other boy had dived into the water and seemed to be all right, Kieth took courage and made his dive. The contest was now down to these two boys. Kieth’s friend then climbed up to 70 feet and dived. He came up from the water laughing, rubbing his shoulders and his eyes. He then challenged Kieth, “Well, are you going to do it?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p4" pid="Sd4Jh3L9ME-T-qDvzrY9mA" hash="Iz7kwA">“Of course, I’m going to do it!” And everybody on the shore said, “Of course, he’s going to do it!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p5" pid="v08aj_YCBUyiIU-sR5y6-w" hash="Pt9tzg">So Kieth swam back to the shore and climbed up the rocks. He knew if he jumped from the same height of 70 feet that his friend would want to go higher, so he scrambled up 80 feet to the very top of the cliff. No one could go any higher than the top. As Kieth looked down, he was terrified to see the water so very far away. He had made a rash decision. It was not what he wanted to do nor what he felt was right. Instead he had based his decision on the prodding and dares of a half dozen young men whose names he cannot now even remember.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p6" pid="DhTyZK8wNEm97nWnOZIy5Q" hash="DmtYUg">He backed up and ran as hard as he could toward the edge. He found the mark he had carefully laid at the edge of the rock and sprang out into space. On the way down he remembered his parents teaching him to be careful when making decisions, because a wrong one could kill him. And now he thought, “You have done it, because when you hit the water you’ll be going so fast that it might as well be concrete.” When he hit the water, it even felt like concrete. How grateful he was when his head finally popped above water.</p>

The young men who dared him didn’t care and probably don’t even remember that foolish act. But Kieth realized afterward that he had made what could easily have been a fatal decision. He had yielded to the pressure of friends expecting him to do what he didn’t want to do. He knew better. He said: “I was living in the world, and at that moment I was of the world because I was not in control of myself. I was not making decisions about my own life. The world made the decisions for me, … and [I] had barely avoided being in the world about six feet deep.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p8" pid="XV0q5hV0zk-HKAWYA-ToaA" hash="GJNHRw">It takes a certain kind of courage to stand back rather than leaping forward, foolishly allowing someone else to make our choices for us. We can more readily take firm stands when we have a clear idea of our identity as sons of God and bearers of the holy priesthood, having a bright potential for a meaningful future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p9" pid="6pKRVmJpnEuzqZ2qHalW4A" hash="xfmD9w">Unfortunately, some of our poor choices are irreversible, but many are not. Often we can change course and get back on the right track. Getting back on the right track may involve the principles of repentance: first, recognizing the error of our ways; second, forsaking the wrongful conduct; third, never repeating it; and, fourth, confessing<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> and making restitution where possible. Learning by experience has value, but the “school of hard knocks” is deserving of its name. Progression comes faster and easier by learning from our parents, those who love us, and our teachers. We can also learn from the mistakes of others, observing the consequences of their wrong choices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p10" pid="9yAUCEI4DkCGbLMJKncxOQ" hash="2FvVDA">Some choices present good opportunities no matter which road we take—for example, when deciding which career path to follow or which school to attend. I know one bright and able young man who wanted to become a doctor, but the opportunity did not open up for him; so he chose to follow the law. He has become a very successful lawyer, but I am satisfied he would have been equally successful as a doctor.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p11" pid="vbBbYmi5DU26dUmo5bl3_g" hash="iKIQdA">Some of our important choices have a time line. If we delay a decision, the opportunity is gone forever. Sometimes our doubts keep us from making a choice that involves change. Thus an opportunity may be missed. As someone once said, “When you have to make a choice and don’t make it, that in itself is a choice.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

A psychiatrist once said to a patient, “Do you ever have any trouble making up your mind?” The patient said, “Well, yes and no.” My hope and prayer is that we can be as resolute as Joshua when he proclaimed, “Choose you this day whom ye will serve; … but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p13" pid="7sPozNa2FEmYj9X12NNDTA" hash="xE1V7Q">Some choices have greater consequences than others. We make no greater voluntary choice in this life than the selection of a marriage partner. This decision can bring eternal happiness and joy. To find sublime fulfillment in marriage, both partners need to be fully committed to the marriage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p14" pid="MC4g1C4lkEet0PgRlQA0vQ" hash="DFt8MQ">Some important choices for fulfillment and happiness should be made only once and then, having been made, never have to be made again. For example, we need only once to make the firm and unequivocal resolution not to smoke tobacco, not to drink alcoholic drinks, nor use mind-changing drugs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/choices.p15" pid="DCW_rLBV7EewryUq1hhpng" hash="FKLWnw">In 1976 Elder Robert C. Oaks, then a colonel in the United States Air Force, was a member of the Incidents at Sea negotiating team. They were guests at a dinner hosted by the Leningrad Naval District. About 50 senior officers of the Soviet Union and the United States were present as the host led the group in toasts before dinner. They stood for the first toast and raised their glasses, most of which were filled with Russian vodka. Brother Oaks had pink lemonade in his glass, which was immediately noticed by the admiral leading the toast. He stopped and demanded that Brother Oaks fill his glass with vodka, stating that he would not proceed until he had done so. Brother Oaks declined, explaining that he was happy with what he had in his glass.</p>

Brother Oaks’s Soviet escort hissed in his ear, “Fill your glass with vodka!” Brother Oaks uttered the shortest prayer of his life: “God, help me!”</p>

Elder Oaks was convinced that more harm would have come to him if he had compromised a tenet of his faith than the harm that would have come from drinking the vodka. Incidentally, adhering to his religious principles did not hurt his career. After this incident he went on to become a four-star general.</p>

We often hear as a justification for wrong behavior, “Well, everybody is doing it.” This evil distorts the truth, and its author is Satan.

To make an intelligent decision we need to evaluate all available facts on both sides of an issue. But that isn’t enough. Making correct decisions involves prayer and inspiration. The 9th section of the Doctrine and Covenants gives us the grand key. The Lord said to Oliver Cowdery:</p>

May we all use our God-given agency wisely as we make these eternal choices. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We live in the marvelous age of the information highway. The amount of information sent by e-mail, fax, cellular phones, and other means is phenomenal. In fact, there is a glut of messages. The volume is so vast that it is easy to miss a vital message, and missing messages can have serious consequences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/did-you-get-the-right-message.p2" pid="z6ZstLcnp0Kh8kKSR1QIUA" hash="yR5wsg">For example, in wartime missed messages between commanders and soldiers at the front have resulted in great confusion and serious loss of life. In World War I the 308th Infantry was ordered to the front in a desperate attempt to take and hold part of the Argonne Forest at any cost. The battle was so fierce that the supporting troops on the right and the left of one battalion withdrew, and the battalion was surrounded and isolated. Because headquarters lost communication with them, they became known as the Lost Battalion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/did-you-get-the-right-message.p3" pid="CLtnZqwu9kiHfN6HzICYcQ" hash="-N5lYA">The battalion communicated with headquarters by carrier pigeons that flew from the battalion’s location to headquarters with messages. However, as soon as these pigeons were released, they were shot down by the opposing forces. The Lost Battalion’s own artillery, not knowing where they were, opened fire on their position and inflicted heavy casualties. The battalion ran out of food and water, but they held their ground and did not surrender despite their great losses. Finally, one carrier pigeon called Cher Ami, even though it was shot, got through to headquarters carrying the message that identified the battalion’s location. The survivors of the battalion were rescued because that one crucial message got through.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Throughout the world’s history God has sent messages in various ways. Moses was tending his father-in-law’s sheep in the desert when he came upon “a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> He was curious and wanted to know why the bush was not consumed.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> As Moses turned to see, “God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> God told him, “Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> God chose to speak with Moses out of a burning bush. He told Moses that He had a work for him to do—specifically to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt “unto a land flowing with milk and honey.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/did-you-get-the-right-message.p5" pid="RTbbxxFbLEOqWxCFMZFCHQ" hash="pIWsiQ">The word of the Lord came only once through a bush that burned but was not consumed. The prophet Elijah had a different experience. He waited as “the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

For example, the word of the Lord called Jonah to go to Nineveh and declare repentance. But Jonah ignored the message and ran away to Joppa, where he boarded a ship to Tarshish to get away from the presence of the Lord. However, the Lord caused a mighty tempest to come upon the sea. The mariners were frightened, and in an effort to appease the Lord, they threw Jonah into the sea. A great fish swallowed Jonah, and he was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights. Jonah prayed for forgiveness and deliverance, and the fish vomited him onto dry land. The second time the word of the Lord came to Jonah, he listened and went to call the people of Nineveh to repentance.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

In such an experience the essential nature of something—a person, a situation, an object—is suddenly perceived. We understand this to be inspiration. To be able to perceive by inspiration the common and ordinary things of life in their true meaning is a special gift. Many people fail to perceive inspiration because God’s “great power … looks small unto the understanding of men”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> or because they are “less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

When I was in junior high school I was taking a difficult class where most of what was being taught went over my head. One day the teacher asked me a question. I didn’t understand the question, let alone the answer. Out of nowhere a response came into my mind, which I repeated to the teacher. It was the right answer, but I knew it had not come from me.</p>

Enos stated, “While I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> The voice of the spirit of revelation is not necessarily audible, but it gives us divine confirmation through our thoughts and feelings. As we are told in the Doctrine and Covenants, “I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> We must cultivate our sensitivity to that divine voice.</p>

It was hard to tune to the frequency of a particular radio station. I had to literally scratch the receiving wire whisker over the top of the rough crystal to find the right pinpoint, a little valley or peak on the crystal where the signal was received. Just a millimeter off on either side of that point and I would lose the signal and get scratchy static. Over time, with patience and perseverance, good eyesight, and a steady hand, I learned to find the signal point on the crystal without too much difficulty.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/did-you-get-the-right-message.p12" pid="ObpqWmI7NEecAyF1VApBOQ" hash="VyZaoQ">So it is with inspiration. We must attune ourselves to the inspiration from God and tune out the scratchy static. We have to work at being tuned in. Most of us need a long time to become tuned in. When I was a newly called General Authority, President Marion G. Romney, who was in his 70s at the time, told us, “I know when I am working under the Spirit and when I am not.” To be able to recognize when one is being guided by the Spirit is a supernal gift.</p>

With advanced technology, cellular phones are used for much of the communication in our time. Occasionally, however, we find dead spots where the signal coming to a cell phone fails. This can happen when the cell phone user is in a tunnel or a canyon or when there is other interference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/did-you-get-the-right-message.p14" pid="jZhofZWgDU2PGDDwZn7upA" hash="vc3cZQ">So it is with divine communication. The still, small voice, though still and small, is very powerful. It “whispereth through and pierceth all things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> But like my old crystal set, the message may be there but we fail to pick it up. Perhaps something in our lives prevents us from hearing the message because we are “past feeling.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> We often put ourselves in spiritual dead spots—places and situations that block out divine messages. Some of these dead spots include anger, pornography, transgression, selfishness, and other situations that offend the Spirit.</p>

Also of great importance are the messages that come to us from our parents and grandparents. Parental messages may not be wanted. But with experience and the passage of time, we come to realize that inspired messages from our father and mother are messages of love. To follow parental counsel is one way of fulfilling the commandment “Honour thy father and thy mother.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/did-you-get-the-right-message.p16" pid="KpEd32in-kii57DL8cCQaA" hash="mF5otQ">One message missed by so many in our time is the word of the Lord commanding us to “keep [ourselves] unspotted from the world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> We are told that many are called, “but few are chosen,” and the reason is that “their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/did-you-get-the-right-message.p17" pid="3E0aE4Fwn0uuha9u26RT1A" hash="AjYvPg">The Savior’s transcendent message in the Sermon on the Mount is of burning bush importance to all of us: “But seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> This message needs to penetrate into our hearts and souls. As we accept this message, we are taking our personal stand in this life. Regular temple attendance will help us to constantly seek to build up the kingdom of God. Now with 117 temples in the world, never before have so many had access to the sacred houses of the Lord.</p>

Far too many families are breaking up. This heartbreaking trend has an endless train of consequences. Happiness in marriage begins with husband and wife living together in love, kindness, and mutual respect, walking righteously and humbly before the Lord. It is contingent on being faithful to all vows and covenants. When families do break up for whatever reason, the parents need to try especially hard to sustain and help innocent family members.</p>

We need to pay an honest tithe, live within our means, and save for a rainy day. Debt is bondage because “the borrower is [the] servant [of] the lender.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> Some debt may be necessary, such as to acquire a home and get an education. The Lord’s counsel on the subject is to “pay the debt … [and] release thyself from bondage.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>

Often this is to prepare us for a specific task. This was the case with Moses in the message of the burning bush. We should keep our lives in order so that when we receive a burning bush type of message telling us what the Lord wants us to do we will be able to respond. We need to be sure we are in a position to recognize it and pursue it.</p>

How can we determine the ones that are most vital to us? I suggest that we may look at the source of the messages and the motivation behind them. The Lord has given us a guide through the prophet Alma: “Whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> We must strive to be worthy so that we do not miss the profound messages that come from God.

One such was a 19th-century writer who achieved both success and wealth with his dazzling wit and writing style. His wife came from a religious family, and he wanted to have faith in God but wasn’t really sure God existed. Then he was hit by a series of crushing blows. In 1893 a national financial crisis left him deeply in debt. His oldest daughter died while he was on a speaking tour. His wife’s health failed, and she died in 1904. His youngest daughter died in 1909. His own health declined. His writing, which had formerly been so full of sparkle, now reflected his bitterness. He became progressively depressed, cynical, and disillusioned and remained so until his death in 1910. With all his brilliance, he lacked the inner strength to deal with adversity and simply resigned himself to his misfortunes.</p>

That reminds me of a passage from Alma. After a long war “many had become hardened,” while “many were softened because of their afflictions.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> The same circumstances produced opposite responses. The writer who lost so much was not able to draw from the well of faith. Each of us needs to have our own storehouse of faith to help us rise above the troubles that are part of this mortal probation.</p>

He was a miner, and while he was digging coal in the mine, a large piece of coal hit him on the head and inflicted a wound nine inches long. The doctor who examined him said the injured man would not live longer than 24 hours. But then the elders came and administered to him. He was promised that he would get well, and that “even if he would never see again, he would live to do much good in the Church.” Brother Giles did indeed live but was blind the rest of his life. Within a month of his injury “he was out traveling through the country attending to his ecclesiastical duties.”</p>

At Council Bluffs he joined a handcart company and headed west. “Though blind he pulled a handcart from Council Bluffs to Salt Lake City.” While crossing the plains his wife and two children died. “His sorrow was great and his heart almost broken, but his faith did not fail him. In the midst of his grief he said as did one of old, ‘The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the name of the Lord.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> When Brother Giles arrived in Salt Lake City, President Brigham Young, who had heard his story, loaned Brother Giles a valuable harp until his own arrived from Wales. Brother Giles “traveled from settlement to settlement in Utah, … gladdening the hearts of the people with his sweet music.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

Some of our choices have unforeseen results, which may be good or bad. But often we know in advance that some of our choices will have detrimental or even harmful consequences. I call these “informed choices” because we know our acts will have disastrous results. These informed choices include illicit sexual relations and the use of drugs, alcohol, or tobacco. Such poor informed choices may prevent a person from going on a mission or receiving temple blessings. We may make incorrect informed decisions because the lures of the world distort reality and make us vulnerable. In dating relationships with the opposite sex, making a wrong choice early may limit making the right choice later.</p>

As we demonstrate our devotion to God by our daily acts of righteousness, He can know where we stand. For all of us this life is a time of sifting and refining. We all face trials. Individual members in the early days of the Church were tested and refined when they had to decide if they had the faith, like Brother Giles, to put their belongings in a wagon or a pioneer handcart and travel across the American plains. Some did not have the faith. Those who did traveled “with faith in every footstep.” In our time we are going through an increasingly difficult time of refining and testing. The tests are more subtle because the lines between good and evil are being eroded. Very little seems to be sacred in any of our public communication. In this environment we will need to make sure where we stand all of the time in our commitment to eternal truths and covenants.</p>

Job was rich and had seven sons and three daughters, but his property and children were all destroyed. What effect did this have on Job? Said he, speaking of the Lord, “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> and, “He also shall be my salvation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Job attested, “For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> Job completely trusted the Lord to take care of all of the other concerns.</p>

A modern example of this is taken from the life of Elder John B. Dickson of the Seventy. He recalls:</p>

My father gave me a blessing in which I was told that I would serve my mission in Mexico, serve in the Church all my life, and have a family. My right arm had to be amputated above the elbow, but my life was spared, and the promises I was given have all been fulfilled.</p>

I thought about asking Mom to help me. But I couldn’t take her with me on my mission just to tie my ties. So I decided I had to learn how to do it myself. I finally figured it out by using my teeth.

When my mission call came, I served, and my mission became like the North Star to guide me into the other pursuits of my life.

Some of them went on to achieve success in life, but too many of those gifted and able young people did not persevere and failed to achieve their potential. In contrast, several less visible young men and women at the same school worked diligently, persevered, and continued with their education and became outstanding doctors, engineers, educators, lawyers, scientists, businessmen, artisans, electricians, plumbers, and entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p5" pid="r_6ffWlCbkWMwmUKGcvH1A" hash="4Fmdlw">Success is usually earned by persevering and not becoming discouraged when we encounter challenges. Paul Harvey, the famous news analyst and author, once said: “Someday I hope to enjoy enough of what the world calls success so that someone will ask me, ‘What’s the secret of it?’ I shall say simply this: ‘I get up when I fall down.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p6" pid="PsWf2ng2OkaZFGBxsR6loA" hash="I1ZOIg">An outstanding example of perseverance is Madame Marie Curie, who worked together with her French physicist husband, Pierre Curie, “in an old abandoned leaky shed without funds and without outside encouragement or help, trying to isolate radium from a low-grade uranium ore called pitchblende. And after their 487th experiment had failed, Pierre threw up his hands in despair and said, ‘It will never be done. Maybe in a hundred years, but never in my day.’ Marie confronted him with a resolute face and said, ‘If it takes a hundred years, it will be a pity, but I will not cease to work for it as long as I live.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> She was eventually successful, and cancer patients have benefited greatly from her perseverance.</p>

Benson and Lorenzo Snow, along with Elders Alma Smith and William W. Cluff, on a mission to the Hawaiian Islands. From Honolulu they took passage on a small boat to the little harbor of Lahaina. As they approached the reef, the surf was running high and a heavy swell struck the boat, carrying it about 50 yards and leaving it in a trough between two huge waves. When the second swell struck, the boat capsized into the foaming sea.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p8" pid="Gv5fQSOCaUG2b9D-nCUz9Q" hash="K3lBUg">The people on the shore manned a lifeboat and picked up three of the brethren, who were swimming near the submerged boat. But there was no sign of Brother Snow. Hawaiians accustomed to the surf swam in every direction to search for him. Eventually one of them felt something in the water, and they pulled Brother Snow to the surface. His body was stiff, and he looked like he was dead as they hauled him into the boat.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p9" pid="d8J-od6uTE6n7SvyiLGRbw" hash="WeVVvA">Elder Smith and Elder Cluff laid Brother Snow’s body across their laps and quietly administered to him, asking the Lord to spare his life that he might return to his family and home. When they reached the shore, they carried Brother Snow to some large empty barrels lying on the beach. Laying him face downwards on one of them, they rolled him back and forth to expel the water he had swallowed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p10" pid="k0KJfVSYvUydp1chV8Ua_g" hash="jdKgBQ">After the elders worked over him for some time, without any indication of life, the bystanders said that nothing more could be done for him. But the determined elders would not give up. So they prayed again, with the quiet assurance that the Lord would hear and answer their prayers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p11" pid="UnYf68QSf0alpqlEH4j6Kg" hash="TO40Mg">They were impressed to do something rather unusual for that day and time. One of them placed his mouth over Brother Snow’s in an effort to inflate his lungs, alternately blowing in and drawing out air, imitating the natural process of breathing. Taking turns, they persevered until they succeeded in inflating his lungs. A little while later they perceived faint indications of returning life. “A slight wink of the eye, which, until then, had been open and death-like, and a very faint rattle in the throat, were the first symptoms of returning vitality. These grew more and more distinct, until consciousness was fully restored.” With their perseverance and the smile of merciful Providence, all four of the Lord’s servants survived and were able to complete their missions.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p12" pid="rXjJr-dqhEah2oewyT-Jig" hash="pluNpw">Elder Snow went on to become the President of the Church. While serving in that office, he stabilized the Church’s funds by urging the members to pay their tithes and offerings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p13" pid="ESP1Uhg4lEWYboSzcZAhKw" hash="uKT5ww">You brethren will be interested to know that the Alma Smith in this story was the boy who was shot in the hip at Haun’s Mill, destroying the hip joint and socket. His mother dressed the terrible wound with some balsam and then was inspired to have him lie on his face for five weeks. A flexible gristle grew in place of the missing joint and socket so that he was able not only to live a normal life but also to serve a mission to Hawaii and give a lifetime of service to the Church.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p14" pid="_mUOHKtff0ajt44TP3BQRA" hash="bzFzeg">Our latter-day prophets are all examples of determination through priesthood, prayer, and work. Joseph Smith’s perseverance made possible the Restoration of all things. All of his life he was treated with contempt and ridicule—from the time he first related the account of the First Vision to a preacher of a prominent religion. But he never faltered and left with us his unwavering testimony:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p15" pid="n5H8PDUSEU2Jr0Vw-VzcSA" hash="83Cadw">“I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; … I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p16" pid="ypQBXecvw0a2u6mX7-qfOA" hash="AaOQyg">Brigham Young’s life was the very essence of perseverance. He was always faithful and resolute. After Joseph Smith’s death he had the bold determination to bring 60,000 people from the comfort of their homes and productive lands to a barren wilderness. This great exodus was unlike any other in modern history. They came in wagons, on foot, and pulling handcarts. He and his followers made the desert blossom as a rose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p17" pid="OHAC8zMZl0qyG20_WeSgZw" hash="yIGtPw">At the first press conference when President Gordon B. Hinckley was introduced to the press as the President of the Church in 1995, he was asked what his focus would be. He answered: “Carry on. Yes. Our theme will be to carry on the great work which has been furthered by our predecessors.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> This is a great theme for all of us. We need to carry on and endure to the end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p18" pid="lfLosJ9NDkW5Z8LKAMhIug" hash="XZEdbQ">One of the great accomplishments of President Hinckley’s administration has been his extraordinary perseverance in building temples. Since he became the President of the Church, 87 temples have been dedicated, rededicated, or announced. This remarkable achievement in temple building is unequaled in the entire history of the world. Temples have a great effect for good and are increasingly blessing the world. As President George Q. Cannon said, “Every foundation stone that is laid for a Temple, and every Temple completed according to the order the Lord has revealed for his holy Priesthood, lessens the power of Satan on the earth, and increases the power of God and Godliness, moves the heavens in mighty power in our behalf, invokes and calls down upon us the blessings of the Eternal Gods, and those who reside in their presence.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p19" pid="lOZLMQS5ZUSHC_nWZqI10A" hash="ywWJLQ">Each of us should serve faithfully and diligently in our priesthood callings until the end of our days. Some might wonder, “How long do I have to be a home teacher?” My answer is that home teaching is a priesthood calling. To serve in the calling of a home teacher is a privilege as long as our bishop and priesthood leaders feel we are able to do so. Some of us knew Brother George L. Nelson, a prominent attorney in Salt Lake City who served as a bishop, stake president, and patriarch. He was completely committed to the Church. He was a home teacher at age 100. He said at that time: “I like being a home teacher. I hope I can always be a home teacher.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> He died at age 101 and was faithful to the end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/perseverance.p20" pid="RSal-2KDW0aDY75vlopQVw" hash="19cx6w">Those who desire to be baptized into the Church are required by the Lord to have “a determination to serve him to the end.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> President Joseph Fielding Smith, at age 94, said, “I have sought all my days to magnify my calling in that priesthood and hope to endure to the end in this life and to enjoy the fellowship of the faithful saints in the life to come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> As the Lord said, if we are to be His disciples, we must continue in His word.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> The Lord has blessed the Church and its members in remarkable ways because of their faithfulness and perseverance. I testify of the divinity of the holy work of the priesthood and do so in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p1" pid="9KcCW2pJ706EXVAFsSN4Qg" hash="der4dQ">My dear brethren, sisters, and friends all over the world, it is a joy and a great responsibility to address you. I express my love, respect, and appreciation for each of you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p2" pid="fghn_gc4k0qT8sSN6-CiRw" hash="BORZPw">We are bombarded on all sides by a vast number of messages we don’t want or need. More information is generated in a single day than we can absorb in a lifetime. To fully enjoy life, all of us must find our own breathing space and peace of mind.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> How can we do this? There is only one answer. We must rise above the evil that encroaches upon us. We must follow the counsel of the Lord, who said, “It is my will, that all they who call on my name, and worship me according to mine everlasting gospel, should gather together, and stand in holy places.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p3" pid="t9QQAZDtxkOZUVAZcjZdUw" hash="KMF9Zw">We unavoidably stand in so many unholy places and are subjected to so much that is vulgar, profane, and destructive of the Spirit of the Lord that I encourage our Saints all over the world, wherever possible, to strive to stand more often in holy places. Our most holy places are our sacred temples. Within them is a feeling of sacred comfort. We should seek to be worthy to take our families to the temple to be sealed together for eternity. We should also search for the records of our kindred dead so that they too can be sealed to us in one of the temples. We must strive for holiness by being “an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> In this way we can maintain and strengthen our own individual relationship with our God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p4" pid="RFHBybyJ1EeAT2uO5MuV3w" hash="ujEyqA">Holiness is the strength of the soul. It comes by faith and through obedience to God’s laws and ordinances. God then purifies the heart by faith, and the heart becomes purged from that which is profane and unworthy. When holiness is achieved by conforming to God’s will, one knows intuitively that which is wrong and that which is right before the Lord. Holiness speaks when there is silence, encouraging that which is good or reproving that which is wrong.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p5" pid="tUPQXNbLlE2M-MzxHkg1uQ" hash="_XAv8w">Holiness is also a standard of righteousness. In some remarks by President Brigham Young in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, February 16, 1862, he used the expression “Holiness to the Lord.” He then further explained what “Holiness to the Lord” meant to him. I quote: “Thirty years’ experience has taught me that every moment of my life must be holiness to the Lord, resulting from equity, justice, mercy and uprightness in all my actions, which is the only course by which I can preserve the Spirit of the Almighty to myself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p6" pid="Pd78NRIw-0Opspk31sWUOQ" hash="nMFvZg">Last year one of my grandsons took his wife to New York City with their parents to attend the beautiful new Manhattan temple. The hustle and bustle and noise of the thousands of people outside was deafening. As the taxi pulled up in front of the temple, Katherine, my grandson’s wife, began to cry. Even on the outside of the temple she felt its sacredness. They entered, left the noisome world, and worshiped in the house of the Lord. It was a sacred and unforgettable experience for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p7" pid="60dxcK8kD0uT3AAaPyHD3w" hash="U_A3Fw">As President Gordon B. Hinckley taught us: “There is need occasionally to leave the noise and the tumult of the world and step within the walls of a sacred house of God, there to feel His Spirit in an environment of holiness and peace.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Truly, Joseph Smith’s prayer at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple has been answered: “And that all people who shall enter upon the threshold of the Lord’s house may feel thy power, and feel constrained to acknowledge that … it is thy house, a place of thy holiness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p8" pid="sG5FI2s6VU2SRoLLU97FsQ" hash="yWPnEQ">At the funeral of Patriarch Joseph Smith Sr., his feelings about the temple were described in these words: “To dwell in the house of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple, was his daily delight; and in it he enjoyed many blessings, and spent many hours in sweet communion with his heavenly Father. He has trod its sacred aisles, solitary and alone from mankind, long before the king of day has gilded the eastern horizon; and he has uttered his aspirations within its walls, when nature has been asleep. In its holy enclosures have the visions of heaven been opened to his mind, and his soul has feasted on the riches of eternity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p9" pid="KV6COoU9qU-VKKv-py31HA" hash="tI-Qgw">I am grateful that our temples all bear the words “The House of the Lord, Holiness to the Lord.” This reminder of holy places has roots that go back to the Old Testament. Zechariah reminds us that the day will come when “there [shall] be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD. … Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> I greatly admire the door handles in the Salt Lake Temple. They are so artfully designed, each bearing that reminder “Holiness to the Lord.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p10" pid="pF3WgCz5jUyTQvc32HRHqw" hash="H82kOQ">As a boy in southern Utah over 65 years ago, I used to feel a thrill when the words “Holiness to the Lord” would appear on some of the buildings in the little towns. Those golden words were often a central adornment for most important buildings, such as the co-op store and the bishops’ storehouse. I have in my possession some stock certificates of ZCMI, a pioneer mercantile institution. They bear the signatures of John Taylor, Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff, Joseph F. Smith, Lorenzo Snow, Heber J. Grant, George Albert Smith, and David O. McKay. Printed on every stock certificate are the words “Holiness to the Lord.” I wonder what has become of these mottoes of holiness? Have they vanished with so many other reminders of faith and devotion?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p11" pid="TKBHQWebX0mxBAGza4o0VA" hash="la86bg">The days of our lives will be greatly blessed as we frequent the temples to learn the transcending spiritual relations we have with Deity. We need to try harder to be found standing in holy places. Temple ceremonial covenants and observances are means to help secure holiness of character. In our desire to create in our people more commitment to the holy work of the temples, we must urge them to look deeper to the profound spiritual meaning to be found there. As Paul reminded us, “For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p12" pid="4WscXCtUHUuRjyhc-phBpg" hash="DxUiCw">In our day President Gordon B. Hinckley has told us: “If every man in this church who has been ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood were to qualify himself to hold a temple recommend, and then were to go to the house of the Lord and renew his covenants in solemnity before God and witnesses, we would be a better people. There would be little or no infidelity among us. Divorce would almost entirely disappear. So much of heartache and heartbreak would be avoided. There would be a greater measure of peace and love and happiness in our homes. There would be fewer weeping wives and weeping children. There would be a greater measure of appreciation and of mutual respect among us. And I am confident the Lord would smile with greater favor upon us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p13" pid="2tDJXUObSES4INXO7UyjjQ" hash="JkE5XA">The Saints should do their family research and attend the temple because they are moved by the Holy Spirit to do so. We should go to the temple, among other reasons, to safeguard our personal holiness and that of our families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p14" pid="0MjuPVRa-EekaOK-g2K37g" hash="lmNohg">In addition to temples, surely another holy place on earth ought to be our homes. The feelings of holiness in my home prepared me for feelings of holiness in the temple. Before I went on my first mission to Brazil, my mother lovingly hand made a piece of temple clothing for me to wear when I went to the temple. It is now old and frayed, but it is a special, sacred symbol of Mother’s love for that which is holy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p15" pid="5S8ZG4PWW0WI9Et8RRF0Lw" hash="eGlW7w">Thanks to my dear wife, Ruth, I can say that our home has been a place where we have sought to honor the spirit of holiness to the Lord. We did not always succeed. Of course not. But we tried. When I was overwhelmed as a young father with the responsibility of providing temporally for my family, taking care of my Church callings and many other civic duties, Ruth would lovingly and gently bring me back to my parental responsibility in our home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p16" pid="ukcLcIOJMUC6rQHAKaeFuQ" hash="-4FEvQ">For example, she would remind me when it was time for home evening and then tenderly suggest what we might appropriately study in our home evenings. She would also help me keep track of important family events such as birthdays and activities of the children when they needed my time and support. She still does that important and appreciated service. If we really want our homes to be places of holiness, we will try harder to do those things that are conducive to the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p17" pid="yjf7hEogH0qyUh0rBEU8Ug" hash="uGFoJg">Our chapels are dedicated to the Lord as holy places. We are told we should go to the house of prayer and offer up our sacraments upon His holy day.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Partaking of the sacrament is a solemn and sacred privilege. In our chapels we are instructed in principles of the gospel, children are blessed, members are confirmed and given the gift of the Holy Ghost, and testimonies of the truthfulness of the gospel are borne. A convert in Texas said, when she walked through the chapel door, there was a feeling of holiness that she had never before experienced in her life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p18" pid="1H7He1k7IkO6cIdzSEIbPw" hash="chHhfw">We must try harder to be a holy people. We live in the fulness of times. So much has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. This places upon us a special relationship to the Lord. We are the beneficiaries, guardians, and caretakers of these responsibilities under the delegation, authority, and direction of President Hinckley, who holds all the keys. As children of the Lord we should strive every day to rise to a higher level of personal righteousness in all of our actions. We need to guard constantly against all of Satan’s influences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/standing-in-holy-places.p19" pid="gv5Y1BssuUmeQo5PMT_JnQ" hash="DrkkeA">As President Brigham Young taught, “Every moment of [our lives] must be holiness to the Lord, … which is the only course by which [we] can preserve the Spirit of the Almighty to [ourselves].” May the Lord bless each and all of us in our special responsibility to find holiness to the Lord by standing in holy places. That is where we will find the spiritual protection we need for ourselves and our families. That is the source of help to carry forth the word of the Lord in our time. Standing in holy places will help us rise above the evil influences of our time and draw us closer to our Savior. I testify that if we do this, the Lord will bless us forever and we will be made mighty “in faith and in works.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We have been edified and uplifted by the short video presentation by President Hinckley. We are grateful that President Hinckley and President Monson are here with us this evening. We are strengthened by their support and influence. Sister Parkin, Sister Hughes, and Sister Pingree have inspired us. The choir has touched our hearts. As I look into your faces I can feel your goodness. I commend each of you for your day-to-day works of righteousness. Even though your works may be known to only a few, they are recorded in the Lamb’s book of life,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> which one day will be opened to witness of your dedicated service, devotion, and deeds as “instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Maxwell said: “We know so little … about the reasons for the division of duties between womanhood and manhood as well as between motherhood and priesthood. These were divinely determined in another time and another place. We are accustomed to focusing on the men of God because theirs is the priesthood and leadership line. But paralleling that authority line is a stream of righteous influence reflecting the remarkable women of God who have existed in all ages and dispensations, including our own. Greatness is not measured by coverage in column inches, either in newspapers or in the scriptures. The story of the women of God, therefore, is, for now, an untold drama within a drama.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Motherhood and parenting are most challenging roles. You also have Church callings that you fulfill so capably and conscientiously. In addition, many of you, besides all this, have to work as well as care for your family. My heart goes out to the widows and the single-parent sisters who bear so much of the responsibility of parenting. In general you noble sisters are doing a much better job of holding it all together and making it work than you realize. May I suggest that you take your challenges one day at a time. Do the best you can. Look at everything through the lens of eternity. If you will do this, life will take on a different perspective.</p>

I think many of you try very hard to keep up with all of your responsibilities. I do not wish to offend anyone. I am reluctant to mention a matter but feel it should be said. Sometimes we carry unhappy feelings about past hurts too long. We spend too much energy dwelling on things that have passed and cannot be changed. We struggle to close the door and let go of the hurt. If, after time, we can forgive whatever may have caused the hurt, we will tap “into a life-giving source of comfort” through the Atonement, and the “sweet peace” of forgiveness will be ours.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Some injuries are so hurtful and deep that healing comes only with help from a higher power and hope for perfect justice and restitution in the next life. Sisters, you can tap into that higher power and receive precious comfort and sweet peace.</p>

Your influence for good is incalculable and indescribable. President Brigham Young said: “The sisters in our Female Relief Societies have done great good. Can you tell the amount of good that the mothers and daughters in Israel are capable of doing? No, it is impossible. And the good they will do will follow them to all eternity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> I truly believe you are instruments in the hands of God in your many roles, especially that of motherhood.</p>

God entrusts women to bear and nurture His children. No other work is more important. Motherhood is such an important role for women. Sacred blessings and righteous influence have flowed into my own life and my family’s lives from my beloved wife, her mother, my own mother, grandmothers, my precious daughters, and granddaughters. The treasured relationship of each woman in my life is beyond expression. This is especially true of my eternal companion, Ruth.</p>

You can be powerful instruments in the hands of God to help bring about this great work. You are valued and needed. Other women, even though married, may not be mothers. For those in either of these circumstances, please be assured that the Lord loves you and has not forgotten you. You can do something for another person that no one else ever born can do. You may be able to do something for another woman’s child that she may not be able to do herself. I believe some compensatory blessings will come in this life and in the hereafter to sisters in those circumstances. These blessings and a comforting peace will come to you if you can love God “with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> You can still be highly successful in whatever you do as instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work.</p>

In some measure, wives and mothers control the flow of blessings that come into their homes. As you sustain the priesthood callings of your husband and encourage your sons in their priesthood activities, your homes will be richly blessed. You should also urge your children to help others who are in need. Our home has been blessed because of my wife’s involvement in Relief Society all of our married life. She was a ward and then a stake Relief Society president during a period of some years. As she went about her duties and attended her meetings, our home was blessed with the sweet spirit of service she brought home with her.</p>

My wife toiled all summer in lending her aid towards its accomplishment. She had a hundred pounds of wool, which, with the assistance of a girl, she spun in order to furnish clothing for those engaged in the building of the Temple, and although she had the privilege of keeping half the quantity of wool for herself, as a recompense for her labor, she did not reserve even so much as would make her a pair of stockings; but gave it for those who were laboring at the house of the Lord. She spun and wove and got the cloth dressed, and cut and made up into garments, and gave them to those men who labored on the Temple; almost all the sisters in Kirtland labored in knitting, sewing, spinning, etc. for the purpose of forwarding the work of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

These are gifts you use to make our lives more pleasant. Often when you sisters prepare and give a lesson you put an attractive cloth and flowers on the table, which is a wonderful expression of your caring and conscientious nature. In contrast, when the brethren give a lesson they don’t even decorate the table with as much as a shriveled dandelion! Occasionally, however, you are too hard on yourselves. You think that if your offering is not quite perfect, it is not acceptable. I tell you, however, that if you have done your best, which you usually do, your humble offering, whatever it may be, will be acceptable and pleasing to the Lord.</p>

Twelve years ago, Suzy was called to be Dora’s visiting teacher. A widow with no children, Dora had a difficult personality and was almost a recluse. When Suzy first began visiting Dora, she was met at the doorstep but never invited in. Several months later, Suzy took a treat to Dora, but Dora said she could not accept it. When Suzy asked why not, she answered, “Because you’ll want something in return.” Suzy assured her, “All I want is your friendship.” After that, visiting became easier. Gradually, Suzy found ways to do things for Dora and to listen when listening was needed. She would also tell her about the wonderful people in the ward, the lessons, and the conferences, thus making her feel a part of the ward. As Dora’s health began to deteriorate, Suzy’s visits were daily, and they became close friends. When Dora died, Suzy was able to eulogize the woman others called “unapproachable” as a “remarkable woman” and “a cherished friend.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> She knew her as few others could because of her service as a visiting teacher.</p>

As President Hinckley has often said, we all need friends. Friendship fills us with warmth and love. It is not confined to the young or the old, the rich or the poor, the little known or the public figure. Whatever our circumstances, we all need someone who will listen to us with understanding, pat us on the back when we need encouragement, and nurture in us the desire to do better and to be better. Relief Society is designed to be such a circle of friendship, brimful with understanding hearts that generate love and accomplishment because, above all, it is a sisterhood.</p>

It’s good to think of sisters gathering in various locations to share the same messages we are hearing and to be together as friends.

It was regarding the lease for the land on which the Brigham Young University’s Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies was later built. Before this lease could be signed, President Ezra Taft Benson and Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, then president of Brigham Young University, agreed with the Israeli government on behalf of the Church and the university not to proselyte in Israel. You might wonder why we agreed not to proselyte. We were required to do so in order to get the building permit to build that magnificent building which stands in the historic city of Jerusalem. To our knowledge the Church and BYU have scrupulously and honorably kept that nonproselyting commitment. After the lease had been signed, one of our friends insightfully remarked, “Oh, we know that you are not going to proselyte, but what are you going to do about the light that is in their eyes?” He was referring to our students who were studying in Israel.</p>

          <p pid="770pu8w-ZUuBJjv7zCoaAQ" hash="z_AUJQ">The ennobling of womanhood. Women have full equality with men before the Lord. By nature, the roles of women differ from those of men. This knowledge has come to us with the Restoration of the gospel in the fulness of times, with an acknowledgment that women are endowed with the great responsibilities of motherhood and nurturing. More opportunities have come to women since 1842, when the Prophet Joseph Smith, in the name of God, turned the key in their behalf than from the beginning of humankind on the earth.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>

The woman refused medical help because she had had a negative experience with someone at the hospital. She was afraid and had become something of a recluse. The first time Constance dropped by, the injured woman ordered her out. On the second try, she did let Constance in. By now the woman’s leg was covered with large ulcers, and some of the flesh was rotting. But still she didn’t want to be treated.</p>

She took some foaming hydrogen peroxide with her for the next visit. As this was painless, the old woman let her use it on her leg. Then they talked about more serious treatment at the hospital. Constance assured her the hospital would make her stay as pleasant as possible. In a day or two the woman did get the courage to enter the hospital. When Constance visited her, the woman smiled as she said, “You convinced me.” Then, quite unexpectedly, she asked Constance, “What church do you belong to?” Constance told her she was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The woman said: “I knew it. I knew you were sent to me from the first day that I saw you. There was a light in your face that I had noticed in others of your faith. I had to put my trust in you.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p1" pid="kr98Yperd0SrMVOTU0iohQ" hash="rE--uA">My dear brethren of the priesthood, please accept our appreciation for all you do to carry forward the Lord’s work worldwide. I desire to speak about the sacred offices of those priesthood leaders who have been “called and chosen”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> to guide the Church in this day. This is a special year for at least two reasons: first, we are celebrating the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith this December, and second, President Gordon B. Hinckley celebrated his 95th birthday this past June. I testify that the Prophet Joseph Smith was called and chosen as the first prophet of this dispensation and that President Gordon B. Hinckley is the present prophet, seer, and revelator of this Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p2" pid="vuwdHxU2C0-E6kd3HkAydw" hash="OlUlww">When Mike Wallace interviewed President Hinckley some years ago for the television program <span class="emphasis">60 Minutes,</span> he said, “[People will say] this is a church run by old men.” To this, President Hinckley replied, “Isn’t it wonderful to have a man of maturity at the head—a man of judgment who isn’t blown about by every wind of doctrine?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> So if any of you think the present leadership is too old to lead the Church, President Hinckley may need to give you some further counsel about the wisdom that comes with age!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p3" pid="pduwN3nIAU2TqHrIiwHP5A" hash="DhzSFw">Of the 102 Apostles called in this dispensation, only 13 have served longer than President Hinckley. He has served longer as an Apostle than Brigham Young, President Hunter, President Lee, President Kimball, and many others. It is wonderful to have his inspired leadership. Please forgive me for saying that I myself feel at times that I am standing on the edge of eternity. At age 85, I am the third oldest of all the living General Authorities. I have not sought this honor. I have just lived for it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p4" pid="xI1aM4cGxU2qCMV_VvJGGg" hash="Al6QBg">I believe that never before in the history of the Church has there been more unity than exists among my Brethren of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the other General Authorities of the Church, who have been called and chosen and who are now guiding the Church. I believe there is ample evidence of this. The present leadership of God’s earthly kingdom has enjoyed the Savior’s guiding inspiration longer than any other group. We are the oldest group ever to lead the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p5" pid="aB0pqLtl40mR-4fllR9YGw" hash="x27LBg">My association with some of these men for almost half a century qualifies me, I think, to state with confidence that my Brethren, without exception, are good, honorable, and trustworthy men. I know their hearts. They are the servants of the Lord. Their only desire is to labor in their great callings and build up the kingdom of God on earth. Our Brethren who are serving in this day and time are proven, tried, and true. Some are not as physically strong as they used to be, but their hearts are so pure, their experience so great, their minds so sharp, and their spiritual wisdom so deep that it is a comfort just to be in their presence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p6" pid="IICrO04Ub0iQLolHHgmgFg" hash="zwDd_Q">I was humbled and overwhelmed to be called as an Assistant to the Twelve Apostles 33 years ago. A few days later President Hugh B. Brown counseled me that the most important thing I should do is to always be in harmony with my Brethren. President Brown did not elaborate. He just said, “Stick with the Brethren.” I interpreted that to mean that I should follow the counsel and direction of the President of the Church, the First Presidency, and Quorum of the Twelve. That resonated as something I wanted to do with all my heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p7" pid="P2jx_P8EWkiuCv4GJCIelg" hash="cGsPUA">Others may not agree with that counsel, but it warrants some consideration. I have concluded that spiritual guidance in large measure depends upon being in harmony with the President of the Church, the First Presidency, and the Quorum of the Twelve—all of whom are sustained, as they were today, as prophets, seers, and revelators. I do not know how we can expect to be in full harmony with the Spirit of the Lord if we are not in harmony with the President of the Church and the other prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p8" pid="O8NdXUWNZUioRg3dSopetQ" hash="kU5-iA">When I was a deacon, my father took me and my older brother to general priesthood meeting in the Tabernacle. I remember how thrilled I was to be in the presence, for the first time, of the prophet of God, President Heber J. Grant, and the other prophets and apostles. I listened intently to their messages and took the things they said into my heart. Over the years their subjects have been repeated many times. I expect that some of them will be repeated yet again in this conference. They are essential for our salvation, and we need the repetition.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p9" pid="BsLkOgszTk6hBwdbTHAGNQ" hash="rJgPeg">Since the beginning of the world, history has recorded many examples of those who have not been in harmony with the prophets. In the early days of our dispensation, several of the Twelve, to their regret, did not stay loyal to the Prophet Joseph Smith. One of these was Lyman E. Johnson, a member of the original Quorum of the Twelve who was excommunicated for unrighteous conduct. He later lamented his spiritual downfall. He said: “I would suffer my right hand to be cut off, if I could believe it again. Then I was full of joy and gladness. My dreams were pleasant. When I awoke in the morning my spirit was cheerful. I was happy by day and by night, full of peace and joy and thanksgiving. But now it is darkness, pain, sorrow, misery in the extreme. I have never since seen a happy moment.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> He died in a sleighing accident in 1856 at the age of 45.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p10" pid="6LlEDkuDlkWuS0Bx19K3lw" hash="d2HDFg">Luke S. Johnson was also called to the original Quorum of the Twelve in 1835. His spiritual resolve weakened over some financial speculation in 1837. Looking back later he said: “My mind became darkened, and I was left to pursue my own course. I lost the Spirit of God, and neglected my duty; the consequence was, that at a Conference held in Kirtland, September 3, 1837, … I was cut off from the Church.” By December 1837 he joined the apostates in publicly denouncing the Church and was excommunicated for apostasy in 1838. For eight years he had a medical practice in Kirtland. Then in 1846 he and his family returned to the fellowship of the Saints. Said he: “I have stopped by the wayside and stood aloof from the work of the Lord. But my heart is with this people. I want to be associated with the saints; go with them into the wilderness and continue with them to the end.” He was rebaptized in March 1846 and came west with the original company of pioneers in 1847. He died in Salt Lake City in 1861 in full fellowship at the age of 54.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p11" pid="mf9ER8BD_E6vLEuvQhPkUA" hash="66KfXA">My counsel to the members of the Church is to support the President of the Church, the First Presidency, Quorum of the Twelve, and other General Authorities with our whole hearts and souls. If we do, we will be in a safe harbor.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p12" pid="Wm7n_dGvgkuJ2vdM25JQAw" hash="rIfnmA">President Brigham Young said he recollected many times the Prophet Joseph Smith saying that he “had to pray all the time, exercise faith, live his religion, and magnify his calling, to obtain the manifestations of the Lord, and to keep him steadfast in the faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> All of us may expect some challenges to our faith. These challenges may come in different ways. You may not always like the counsel that the Church leaders give to you. They are not trying to be popular. They are trying to help us avoid the calamities and disappointments that come through disobedience to God’s laws.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p13" pid="J2eHHRCyUEOqNlpOuUDzqw" hash="tYUITQ">We also need to support and sustain our local leaders, because they also have been “called and chosen.” Every member of this Church may receive counsel from a bishop or a branch president, a stake or a mission president, and the President of the Church and his associates. None of these brethren asked for his calling. None is perfect. Yet they are the servants of the Lord, called by Him through those entitled to inspiration. Those called, sustained, and set apart are entitled to our sustaining support.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p14" pid="q6QY3UTdjk6Q1YDoc6NswQ" hash="O8XX0Q">I have admired and respected every bishop I have ever had. I have tried not to question their guidance and have felt that in sustaining and following their counsel I was protected against the “sleight of men, and cunning craftiness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> This was because each of these called and chosen leaders was entitled to the divine revelation that comes with the calling. Disrespect for ecclesiastical leaders has caused many to suffer spiritual weakening and downfall. We should look past any perceived imperfections, warts, or spots of the men called to preside over us, and uphold the office which they hold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p15" pid="M8fjR1vq80iRTIEGGjZK-Q" hash="5A0nrQ">Many years ago we used to have money-raising events in our wards to pay for the utilities and other local expenses and activities now paid by the general Church funds and the local unit budget allowance. We used to have bazaars, fairs, dinners, and other fund-raising activities. At that time my ward had a wonderful, devoted, committed bishop.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p16" pid="MZR2p-DkTkSwb80OAOx91g" hash="R9xJ4A">A member of a neighboring ward found that a dunking machine was a successful money-raising activity. Participants would pay to throw baseballs at a marked mechanical arm. Hitting the bull’s-eye would trigger a release, plunging the person sitting on the seat of the machine into a big basin of cold water. Our ward decided to use this machine, and someone suggested that more people would pay for balls to throw if the bishop would be willing to sit on the dunking seat. Our bishop was a good sport, and because he was responsible for raising the money, he willingly consented to sit on the dunking seat. Soon some began to buy balls and to throw them at the target. Several hit the mark, and the bishop was drenched. After half an hour of this, he began to shake with the cold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p17" pid="k72BvkXq1UqQc24zhhotWg" hash="NCOUHg">While some of the people thought this was great fun, my father was very offended that the office of the bishop had been so belittled and held up to ridicule or even contempt. Even though the money raised was intended for a good cause, I can still remember feeling ashamed that some of our people did not show more respect for both the office and the man who had by night and day served us so well as our good shepherd. As holders of the priesthood of God, we should set the example of sustaining the leadership of the Church to our families, our friends, and our associates.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p18" pid="mpwSzVQqo0m3fXE-ArvhJQ" hash="4p-F1A">The holy scriptures as well as the local and General Authorities of the Church provide a safety net of counsel and guidance for the people of the Church. For example, all my life the Brethren have from this and other pulpits urged our people to live within their incomes, stay out of debt, and save a little for a rainy day, for rainy days always come. I have lived through times of great economic difficulty, such as the Great Depression and World War II. What I have experienced makes me afraid not to do what I can to protect myself and my family against the consequences of such catastrophes. I am grateful to the Brethren for this wise counsel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p19" pid="OoHJCj6qVkaWhFNksKGqMw" hash="YdFCxA">The President of the Church will not lead the people of the Church astray. It will never happen. President Hinckley’s counselors sustain him fully, as do the Quorum of the Twelve, the Quorums of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. As a result, as I have said before, a special love and harmony exist in the presiding councils of the Church for our President and for each other.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p20" pid="QGGtLvPNikmxIcoPKVxU3g" hash="_dljuw">The priesthood of God is a shield. It is a shield against the evils of the world. That shield needs to be kept clean; otherwise, our vision of our purpose and the dangers around us will be limited. The cleansing agent is personal righteousness, but not all will pay the price to keep their shields clean. The Lord said, “For many are called, but few are chosen.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> We are called when hands are laid upon our heads and we are given the priesthood, but we are not chosen until we have demonstrated to God our righteousness, our faithfulness, and our commitment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/called-and-chosen.p21" pid="9lcLWrYNeEa0cd_Lid06oA" hash="hwwKCA">Brethren, this work is true. Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son, and he heard and followed Their instruction. That was the beginning of this great work, the responsibility for which now rests upon us. I bear solemn witness of its divinity, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

It was 1833, and an angry mob roared through the streets of Independence, burning property and wreaking havoc. In their path was the home of Brother William W. Phelps, where the printing press was kept. He had been printing revelations received by the Prophet Joseph Smith. The mob demolished the printing press and threw the wreckage into the street. However, they stacked up the printed pages in the yard so they could burn them later.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p5" uuid="320359db-dccb-4ecc-8e06-f61b643a1da7" pid="NgyYkr1QNkekWQe-VQD4iw" hash="ih-CrA">Mary Elizabeth and Caroline had been hiding by the fence, frightened spectators to all this destruction. Even though she was terrified, Mary Elizabeth’s eye was fixed on those precious pages. She and her sister ran out from their hiding place, gathered up the scriptures, and bolted. Some of the mob saw them and ordered them to stop. But the brave girls ran into a large cornfield, where they dropped breathlessly to the ground. They carefully laid the pages of revelations between the tall rows of corn and then covered the pages by lying on them. The relentless mobsters looked and looked for the girls, coming quite close at times, but never did find them. Eventually they gave up their search to see what further damage they could do to the town.</p>

Sisters, that light shines for you, and it will guide you as it did the Rollins girls. It will keep you safe even when danger lurks. As the Master promised, “I will also be your light … ; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; … ye shall know that it is by me that ye are led.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

As you do so, you will grow in spiritual strength. Cherish spirituality, and you will learn how sweet it is.</p>

With age, experience, and faith, you will have the wisdom to make good decisions and also to make the right ones. I believe you young people know where to go to get the right answers.

Young Joan of Arc, one of the great heroines in history, became the unlikely standard-bearer for the French army in the Dark Ages, long before the gospel was restored. Joan had the Light of Christ and also the courage to follow its promptings and make a difference. Joan was a peasant girl who could neither read nor write, but she was bright. Long years of war with the English had impoverished and divided her country. At 17, sensing her life had a purpose, she left home, determined to help liberate her oppressed country. Naturally, people scoffed at her ideas and thought she was a little crazy, but in the end she persuaded them to let her have a horse and an escort to go and see the king.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p10" uuid="ff314770-c21f-4b73-8eba-deca47401ef4" pid="KExiPEQ1ZU-H7iwNg15p3Q" hash="iS7aVw">Young King Charles VII of France had heard about Joan and decided to test her. He slipped into the ranks of the army and let one of his trusted associates occupy the throne. When Joan came into the room, she barely acknowledged the man on the throne, but promptly walked up to Charles and curtsied to him as her king. This so impressed the king that he gave her command over his 12,000 troops. At first the French soldiers did not want to obey her, but when they saw that all who followed her succeeded and all who disregarded her failed, they came to look upon her as their leader.</p>

Twice she was wounded, but each time she recovered and went on fighting. Her orders seemed to be those of a military genius. She marched into the city of Reims and stood with sword and banner in hand while Charles was crowned king. She fought in the Battle of Paris until she was captured at Compiègne by English allies, who sold her to the English for 16,000 francs. She was imprisoned, tried as a heretic, and then burned at the stake in 1431.</p>

She was courageous enough to follow the personal inspiration to which all of us are entitled. As the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith, “I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Sisters, don’t be afraid to be different in our century! Sometimes we have to be different in order to maintain Church standards. So I repeat, don’t be afraid to be different, but be as good as you can be. Many girls are concerned about their friends’ conduct and style of dress. Such conduct may be motivated by a desire to be accepted by the peer group. Joan of Arc did not worry about what her friends did, but rather about what she knew she should do.</p>

It may be as simple as a smile. I recently read the account of a man in the northwest United States who used to drive past a bus stop on his way to work. He began to notice a young girl among some children waiting for the school bus. Even when it was raining, she would smile and wave as he drove by. He said: “The young girl was tall and slim and about 13 years old. She wore a mouthful of braces and I could see them glisten in the glare of my car lights.” Her effort to be friendly gave his day a good start and was something he looked forward to.</p>

One day Cheryl asked her parents’ permission to attend an activity at a local church. A neighbor girl, Vicki, had invited her to attend. The activity was MIA, the forerunner to the Young Women program! Cheryl enjoyed MIA and after a while told her parents that Vicki was a Mormon. It wasn’t long before Cheryl came home from school and said that Vicki was sending two young men over—missionaries—to tell the family about her Church.</p>

As a family they began to read these new scriptures and were soon captivated by them. Mr. Hankins finally met Vicki. She was the smiling girl he had seen so many times at the bus stop. She was present when he and two other members of his family were baptized.</p>

They relied upon the referrals and good example that the youth supplied. Vicki—the girl at the bus stop who smiled every day, even when it was raining—changed their lives forever.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

Like Vicki, you can let the sunshine that is in your heart show in your face. The Apostle John wrote of “a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Similarly, you young women can be bearers of light. In the Savior’s parable of the ten virgins,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> each young woman had a lamp. Clearly, this parable has both a temporal and a spiritual application. Oil can be purchased at the market. But another kind of oil, spiritual oil that is not for sale, can be accumulated only by our daily good works.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/your-light-a-standard-to-all-nations.p20" uuid="a125bae2-d51c-4e5a-bc7e-686fcf75a5ae" pid="SGLhYu4cGEWla1lMWZIAPg" hash="MxrzXQ">The parable tells what happened as all ten young women waited for the bridegroom. The bridegroom came at the darkest hour, when least expected. It was midnight, and the foolish five had run out of oil. You might wonder why the five wise virgins could not share their oil with the other five. It was not selfishness on their part. Spiritual preparedness cannot be shared in an instant because we each fill our lamps drop by drop in our daily living.</p>

Possibly this is the largest gathering of priesthood in the history of the world. I should like to speak to you young men about how blessed you are to hold the Aaronic Priesthood, which is also known as the “lesser priesthood.” But the word <span class="emphasis">lesser,</span> however, does not in any way take away from its importance. There’s nothing small about it—especially when I see how big some of you young men are!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/a-royal-priesthood.p2" uuid="1d042159-7e36-4498-b50a-653a2279d8d1" pid="QQaQG4mSj0CzFpjS3TChcQ" hash="9iYC7A">I’m sure you remember how excited you were the first time you passed the sacrament. As you Aaronic Priesthood holders assist in preparing, blessing, administering, and passing the sacrament, you help all members who partake thereof to recommit themselves to the Lord and to renew their faith in the Savior’s atoning sacrifice. Members who take the sacrament are reminded to take upon themselves the name of the Son, always remember Him, keep His commandments, and seek to have His Spirit to be with them. I hope that you will value the priesthood you hold and always honor your priesthood duties.</p>

They began to think of it as a chore, something that no one else wanted to do. They often came in late, and sometimes they didn’t dress appropriately. One Sunday their priesthood adviser told them: “You don’t have to worry about the sacrament today. It’s been taken care of.”</p>

They slipped in casually during the opening hymn and sat in the congregation. That’s when they noticed who was sitting on the deacons’ bench—their adviser and the high priests of the ward, who included men who had served as bishops and stake president. They were all dressed in dark suits with white shirts and ties. But more than that, their bearing was one of total reverence as they took the sacrament trays from row to row. Something was deeper and more significant about the sacrament that day. Those deacons who had become so perfunctory in their duties learned by example that passing the sacrament was a sacred trust and one of the greatest of honors.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> They began to realize that the priesthood is, as the Apostle Peter called it, “a royal priesthood.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

In our home ward here in Salt Lake City, we have a good number of faithful, older members but few of Aaronic Priesthood age. Over the years I have watched these high priests and elders, men of faith and great accomplishments, humbly and reverently pass the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. For a while this group of priesthood holders included a senior federal judge, a candidate for the office of governor of the state of Utah, and other prominent men of stature. Yet they were honored and obviously felt privileged to perform this sacred priesthood duty.</p>

In ancient and modern times angels have appeared and given instruction, warnings, and direction, which benefited the people they visited. We do not consciously realize the extent to which ministering angels affect our lives. President Joseph F. Smith said, “In like manner our fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and friends who have passed away from this earth, having been faithful, and worthy to enjoy these rights and privileges, may have a mission given them to visit their relatives and friends upon the earth again, bringing from the divine Presence messages of love, of warning, or reproof and instruction, to those whom they had learned to love in the flesh.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Many of us feel that we have had this experience. Their ministry has been and is an important part of the gospel. Angels ministered to Joseph Smith as he reestablished the gospel in its fulness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/a-royal-priesthood.p8" uuid="f5cd265f-0080-4026-81fc-4594b3a48516" pid="OsbeoLS0pkSFfhvDizl8Aw" hash="1Mt7Hg">Alma the Younger had a personal experience with ministering angels. As a young man, he was numbered among the unbelievers and “led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.” One day, “while he was going about to destroy the church of God” in company with the sons of Mosiah, an “angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake.” The angel then cried out, “Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/a-royal-priesthood.p9" uuid="e55f0ffe-0e15-4588-870e-cbc90aa407d0" pid="cYFa7mnLlUG37YFb6K0q_g" hash="xrXhMA">Alma was so overcome by this experience that he fainted and had to be carried to his father. Only after his father and others had fasted and prayed for two days was Alma restored to full health and strength. He then stood up and declared, “I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Alma went on to become one of the greatest missionaries in the Book of Mormon. Yet in all his many years of missionary service, he never spoke of the angel’s visit. Instead, he chose to testify that the truth had been made known to him by the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/a-royal-priesthood.p10" uuid="6af16f96-4468-4e19-a0ad-5a3cb253de92" pid="tcXKFewxH0mb_rq5rLuRJg" hash="ho-zkg">To be instructed by an angel would be a great blessing. However, as Alma taught us, his final and lasting conversion came only after he had “fasted and prayed many days.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> His complete conversion came from the Holy Ghost, which is available to all of us if we are worthy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/a-royal-priesthood.p11" uuid="fa82fc39-0c98-4ebf-b4a6-833eec568bb1" pid="RgtM3fKXVEi0AYkRZeMbcg" hash="V-f2Hw">Miraculous events have not always been a source of conversion. For example, when Laman and Lemuel physically mistreated their younger brothers, an angel appeared and warned them to stop. The angel also reassured all of the brothers that Laban would be delivered into their hands. Nephi, on the one hand, believed and claimed the brass plates from Laban. Laman and Lemuel, on the other hand, did not believe, nor did they change their behavior as a result of the angelic visit. As Nephi reminded them, “How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel of the Lord?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

For example, those of you who are priests still have authority to do everything you did as deacons and teachers. Indeed, even when you are ultimately ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood, you will still keep and act in the offices of the Aaronic Priesthood. The late Elder LeGrand Richards, who was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve for many years, understood this principle well. He often used to say, “I’m just a grown-up deacon.”</p>

At this time Satan and his followers are enslaving some of our choicest young people through addiction to alcohol, all kinds of drugs, pornography, tobacco, gambling, and other compulsive disorders. Some people seem to be born with a weakness for these substances so that only a single experimentation will result in uncontrollable addiction. Some addictions are actually mind-altering and create a craving that overpowers reason and judgment. These addictions destroy the lives not only of those who do not resist them but also their parents, spouses, and children. As the prophet Jeremiah lamented, “The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/a-royal-priesthood.p19" uuid="12ffb1f3-80ed-41c5-876d-4ad56211056d" pid="qZEEghRB8kCJXBEA1CI2DQ" hash="WoeepQ">The Lord in His wisdom has warned us that substances that are not good for us should be totally avoided. We have been warned not to take the first drink, smoke the first cigarette, or try the first drug. Curiosity and peer pressure are selfish reasons to dabble with addictive substances. We should stop and consider the full consequences, not just to ourselves and our futures, but also to our loved ones. These consequences are physical, but they also risk the loss of the Spirit and cause us to fall prey to Satan.</p>

I have lived under its spiritual influence all my life—in my grandfather’s home, in my father’s home, and then in my own home. It is humbling to use the transcending power and authority of the priesthood to empower others and to heal and bless. May we live worthy of holding the priesthood authority to act in the name of God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

To the Thessalonians, Paul wrote concerning this event, “Let no man deceive you by any means: for <span class="emphasis">that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

This falling away was foreseen by the Apostle Peter, who declared that “heaven must receive [Jesus Christ] until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Restitution would only be necessary if these precious things had been lost.</p>

Some of them suffered greatly for their beliefs, in what came to be called the Reformation, a sixteenth-century movement that aimed at reforming Western Christianity. This resulted in the separation of the Protestant churches from the main Christian church.</p>

Incidentally, the Prophet Joseph Smith was descended from John Lathrop. In 1623 the Reverend Lathrop resigned his position because he questioned the authority of the Anglican church to act in the name of God. As he read the Bible, he recognized that apostolic keys were not on the earth. In 1632 he became the minister of an illegal independent church and was put in prison. His wife died while he was in prison, and his orphaned children pleaded with the bishop for his release. The bishop agreed to release Lathrop on condition that he leave the country. This he did, and with 32 members of his congregation he sailed to America.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

The Apostle John saw in vision the time when “another angel [would] fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> This prophecy has been fulfilled. Because we believe the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in our time by the Prophet Joseph Smith, we wish to give all people an opportunity to know and accept this message.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-restoration-of-all-things.p11" uuid="c8d89625-82e7-4a51-a1a0-0386f43feab8" pid="3lqsTzaOrEmxtaE8TKuklw" hash="MQgqwg">We now have in the restored Church apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists, as spoken of by Paul to the Ephesians.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> These priesthood offices were established by the Savior when He organized His Church in the meridian of time. We recognize the two orders of the priesthood and the offices contained within them: the lesser priesthood is the Aaronic Priesthood, named after Aaron; and the greater priesthood is the Melchizedek Priesthood, named after Melchizedek, to whom Abraham paid tithes. The Aaronic Priesthood was restored on May 15, 1829, under the hands of John the Baptist, and the Melchizedek Priesthood within a month under the hands of the ancient Apostles Peter, James, and John to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Thus those possessing the priesthood today claim the power to act in the name of God through the priesthood, “which power commands respect both on earth and in heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>

After this, Elias appeared and committed the gospel of Abraham, that in “our seed all generations after us should be blessed.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> After this, Elijah the prophet appeared and gave to them the keys of this dispensation, including the sealing power, to bind in heaven that which is bound on earth within the temples.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> Thus, prophets of previous gospel dispensations presented their keys to the Prophet Joseph Smith in this, the “dispensation of the fulness of times” spoken of by the Apostle Paul to the Ephesians.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-restoration-of-all-things.p14" uuid="297d37f0-c6b7-421d-8a60-ed45c4ea04c9" pid="VsXWv2Dx1ka27d5HdlcPKQ" hash="1ohwFA">Through the earth’s long history, temple worship has been a significant part of the Saints’ worship, by which they show their desire to come closer to their Creator. The temple was a place of learning for the Savior when He was on the earth; it was very much a part of His life. Temple blessings are available once again in our day. A unique feature of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is its teaching concerning temples and the eternal significance of all that occurs within them. Our majestic and beautiful temples now dot much of the earth. In them the most sacred work is done. President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated of these temples, “There are only a few places on earth where man’s questions about life receive the answers of eternity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> The solemn mysteries of where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going are answered more fully in the temples. We came from God’s presence and are here on earth to prepare to return to His presence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-restoration-of-all-things.p15" uuid="505a4dd3-109d-4ef1-a7aa-298db0a2a00c" pid="gGknRPL1Mkuqa90ihaQhug" hash="ZPQZ4w">Of transcendent significance is that within the sacred walls of the temple, husbands and wives make eternal covenants. These covenants are sealed by priesthood authority. Children of that union, if they are worthy, may enjoy an eternal relationship as part of a family and as children of God. As the Apostle John wrote: “What are these which are arrayed in white robes? … Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-restoration-of-all-things.p16" uuid="ce47f90a-0d03-4993-bb53-fbbcd16f2e49" pid="P88CUSthY0aXplmlZ1E5MA" hash="jatpoQ">The Lord has said that His work is “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> It follows then that all mankind, living and dead, should have the opportunity of hearing the gospel either in this life or in the spirit world. As Paul said to the Corinthians, “Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span> This is the reason we do ordinance work in temples for our deceased ancestors. No person’s choice or agency is taken away. Those for whom the work is done may accept it or not, as they choose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-restoration-of-all-things.p17" uuid="8da121bf-58d4-4be1-b8c5-2ab2e93e63df" pid="XnILYStKYECxLCWjzmkxUw" hash="rJHK5w">The Apostle John saw in vision the time when an angel would come to the earth as part of the Restoration of the gospel. That angel was Moroni, who appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. He directed Joseph to the place where golden plates containing ancient writings were deposited. Joseph Smith then translated these plates by the gift and power of God, and the Book of Mormon was published. This is a record of two groups of people who lived centuries ago on the American continent. Little was known about them before the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. But more importantly, the Book of Mormon is another testament of Christ. It restored precious truths concerning the Fall, the Atonement, the Resurrection, and life after death.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-restoration-of-all-things.p18" uuid="3436a3bc-f1b9-4407-a275-eae342131946" pid="sD0ya2cxuE2xPcZJ8wjmJg" hash="qsfjKA">Prior to the Restoration, the heavens had been closed for centuries. But with prophets and apostles upon the earth once more, the heavens were opened once again with visions and revelations. Many of the revelations that came to the Prophet Joseph Smith were written down in a book that came to be known as the Doctrine and Covenants. This contains further insights about principles and ordinances and is a valuable source concerning the structure of the priesthood. In addition, we have another canon of scripture called the Pearl of Great Price. It contains the book of Moses, which came by revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the book of Abraham, which he translated from a purchased Egyptian scroll. From these we learn not only a great deal more about Moses, Abraham, Enoch, and other prophets but also many more details about the Creation. We learn that the gospel of Jesus Christ was taught to all of the prophets from the beginning—even from the time of Adam.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-restoration-of-all-things.p19" uuid="0f5234c4-e086-448f-a342-1bf6186e8fca" pid="gmhLRQhsWEi5-usZ8LF0uA" hash="4u-LfA">We believe The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a restoration of the original Church established by Jesus Christ, which was built “upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span> It is not a breakoff from any other church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-restoration-of-all-things.p20" uuid="1a2bfa5b-b231-48e2-ab75-9cd8321b4011" pid="CL_kBde-tE2XbwrXTrPShA" hash="rZ25IQ">We believe that the fulness of the gospel of Christ has been restored, but this is no reason for anyone to feel superior in any way toward others of God’s children. Rather, it requires a greater obligation to invoke the essence of the gospel of Christ in our lives—to love, serve, and bless others. Indeed, as the First Presidency stated in 1978, we believe that “the great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God’s light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span> Thus, we have respect for the sincere religious beliefs of others and appreciate others extending the same courtesy and respect for the tenets we hold dear.</p>

This assurance has been with me all of my life. I am grateful that the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel has taken place in our time. It contains the pathway to eternal life. May the strength, peace, and concern of God the Father and the abiding love and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with us all, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="20"></span>A large crowd followed the Savior as He ministered by the shore of the Sea of Galilee. So that more could hear Him, He got into Peter’s fishing boat and asked to be taken a little way out from the shore. After He had finished speaking, He told Peter, who had fished all night without success, to go out in the lake and let down his nets in the deep water. Peter obeyed, and he caught so many fish that the nets broke. Peter called to his partners, James and John, to come and help. All were amazed at the number of fish that were caught. Jesus said to Peter, “Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.” Luke then tells us, “When they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> They became the Lord’s disciples.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/discipleship.p2" pid="6SxUbbEugUqQhdTwj0dVMA" hash="U08mYg">The word for <span class="emphasis">disciple</span> and the word for <span class="emphasis">discipline</span> both come from the same Latin root—<span class="emphasis">discipulus,</span> which means pupil. It emphasizes practice or exercise. Self-discipline and self-control are consistent and permanent characteristics of the followers of Jesus, as exemplified by Peter, James, and John, who indeed “forsook all, and followed him.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/discipleship.p3" pid="LOP9xHxPkUq1DIPgFeJ8kA" hash="ZHYpmQ">What is discipleship? It is primarily obedience to the Savior. Discipleship includes many things. It is chastity. It is tithing. It is family home evening. It is keeping all the commandments. It is forsaking anything that is not good for us. Everything in life has a price. Considering the Savior’s great promise for peace in this life and eternal life in the life to come, discipleship is a price worth paying. It is a price we cannot afford <span class="emphasis">not</span> to pay. By measure, the requirements of discipleship are much, much less than the promised blessings.</p>

To carry the cross means to follow His commandments and to build up His Church on the earth.

On July 17, 1915, they were apprehended by the Zapatistas. They were told they would be spared if they would give up their weapons and renounce their strange religion. Brother Monroy told his captors that he did not have any weapons and simply drew from his pocket his Bible and Book of Mormon. He said, <span class="pageBreak" page-number="22"></span>“Gentlemen, these are the only arms I ever carry; they are the arms of truth against error.”</p>

But there were no arms. They were then taken under guard to the outskirts of the little town, where their captors stood them up by a large ash tree in front of a firing squad. The officer in charge offered them freedom if they would forsake their religion and join the Zapatistas, but Brother Monroy replied, “My religion is dearer to me than my life, and I cannot forsake it.”</p>

Brother Rafael requested that he be permitted to pray before he was executed. There, in the presence of his executioners, he kneeled down and, in a voice that all could hear, prayed that God would bless and protect his loved ones and care for the little struggling branch that would be left without a leader. As he finished his prayer, he used the words of the Savior when He hung upon the cross and prayed for his executioners: “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> With that the firing squad shot both Brother Monroy and Brother Morales.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

The faithfulness of Edward Partridge, the first bishop of the Church, is noted in the Doctrine and Covenants.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> On July 20, 1833, Edward was sitting at home with his frail wife, who had just given birth. Three mobsters burst in and dragged him into the bedlam of the street and then into the square, where they had already taken Charles Allen. A mob of about 300 demanded through their spokesman that Edward and Charles either renounce their faith in the Book of Mormon or leave the county. Edward Partridge responded: “If I must suffer for my religion, it is no more than others have done before me. I am not conscious of having injured anyone in the county and therefore will not consent to leave. I have done nothing to offend anyone. If you abuse me, you are injuring an innocent man.” The mob then daubed Edward and Charles from head to foot with hot tar containing pearl ash, a flesh-eating acid, and then they threw feathers that stuck to the burning tar.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/discipleship.p16" pid="oaImFPj0cECMbjQVb-_stQ" hash="DY7h6Q">The Prophet Joseph Smith characterized Edward’s death a few years later at age 46 in these words: “He lost his life in consequence of the Missouri persecutions, and he is one of that number whose blood will be required at their hands.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> Edward Partridge left a legacy that lives on in a large and righteous posterity.</p>

For many, living a Christlike life every day may be even more difficult than laying down one’s life. I learned during a time of war that many men were capable of great acts of selflessness, heroism, and nobility without regard to life. But when the war was over and they came home, they could not bear up under the ordinary daily burdens of living and became enslaved by tobacco, alcohol, drugs, and debauchery, which in the end caused them to forfeit their lives.</p>

I am new in the Church. My talents and abilities are limited. My contribution is little.” Or they may say: “I am too old to change. I have already lived my life. Why should I try?” It is never too late to change. Discipleship does not come from positions of prominence, wealth, or advanced learning. The disciples of Jesus came from all walks of life. However, discipleship does require us to forsake evil transgression and enjoy what President Spencer W. Kimball has called “the miracle of forgiveness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> This can come only through repentance, which means that we forsake sin and resolve each day to be followers of truth and righteousness. As Jesus taught, “What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="53"></span>My grandfather used to graze his cattle each summer in the beautiful, lush, high mountain valleys east of our town in central Utah. However, the cattle craved and needed supplemental nutrients from licking rock salt. The rock salt came from a salt mine some distance away. Grandfather replenished the salt at the salt licks by putting a packsaddle on a sturdy horse and filling the packsaddle with rock salt. I called the packhorse Slowpoke for good reason. Grandfather put me on Slowpoke with the saddle loaded with rock salt. He gave me the reins so I could guide the horse up the mountain following Grandfather on his horse.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p2" pid="om04YyC1FkWMYryktAfjmA" hash="0yIqwA">My horse Slowpoke was slow, but I didn’t push him because he carried such a heavy load. It took a full day to ride up the mountain to the salt licks and to unload the rock salt from the pack animal. As the day got warmer, my sweaty legs would sting as they rubbed against the lumps of rock salt in the packsaddle. It was a joy when we crossed a stream and I could get off the horse and get rid of the sting by washing and drying my legs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p3" pid="JTXC5h2gkUqzZBpHH2Qr5g" hash="uCZykA">Grandfather would sing most of the day. Mostly he sang the songs of Zion. But one song he sang that impressed me greatly was “Show me your companions, and I will tell you what you are.” Looking back on it, taking salt to the mountain valley was an enjoyable experience, while the additional nutrients from the rock salt fortified the cattle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p4" pid="fajW4Ez2hk2Rxb1UxOGYGw" hash="gLTIPw">A nutrient furnishes nourishment that promotes growth and healing both in animals and humans. Grandfather’s cattle craved the nutrients in the rock salt, but human beings need something more. They need to be replenished spiritually because “life is more than meat”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> and “there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> The human spirit needs love. It also needs to be “nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p5" pid="qPaY_8FfhUiRhqAyefB4Zg" hash="89vN4w">Spiritual nourishment prepares us for baptism. This preparation includes humbling ourselves before God, having “broken hearts and contrite spirits,” repenting of all our sins, being “willing to take upon [us] the name of Jesus Christ,” and manifesting “by [our] works that [we] have received of the Spirit of Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p6" pid="hflKZUMrUU-7fA3fPdcG9g" hash="4Jeu_Q">Our most important spiritual nutrient is a testimony that God is our Eternal Father, that Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer, and that the Holy Ghost is our Comforter. This testimony is confirmed to us by the gift of the Holy Ghost. From this testimony we derive the spiritual nutrients of faith and trust in God, which bring forth the blessings of heaven. Spiritual nutrients come to us from various sources, but because of time constraints I would like to mention just three.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p7" pid="J72ferGOsEu0ehWhCJuyiA" hash="_g1S8Q">A few years ago, a young man who was starting his senior year in high school resolved to nourish himself by studying the scriptures for half an hour each day. As he began reading the New Testament, he hit a stumbling block. He didn’t feel the anticipated spiritual high, and he wasn’t getting any insight. So he asked himself, “What am I doing wrong?” Then an episode at school came into his mind. He and some friends had been sharing jokes—some of which were not so funny, and downright shameful. He not only had joined in but had even added some off-color comments of his own. Just as he thought this, his eye fell on these words in Matthew: “But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> He knew that the Spirit had directed him to these words at this time. He turned from his Bible and offered up a prayer of repentance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p8" pid="SImBBgv940G55OsPHmBWgw" hash="uYysug">The answer to his question “What am I doing wrong?” was simple. He was reading the scriptures, marking the scriptures, and even enjoying the scriptures, but he was not living the counsel given in the scriptures. As he renewed his scripture reading and tried to live by Christ’s example, he soon noticed how different areas of his <span class="pageBreak" page-number="54"></span>life began to blossom.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> By incorporating the scriptures into his life, he had added an important spiritual nutrient.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p9" pid="4LbRbWqCuk-AMWlTl5ot_A" hash="Uns2WQ">In our uncertain physical environment, we need to increase our spiritual nutrients—nutrients that come from the knowledge of the fulness of the gospel and the powers of the holy priesthood. When such knowledge penetrates our souls, we not only draw closer to God but we also want to serve Him and our fellowmen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p10" pid="fjmtZJhXakuztaxhCkdV1w" hash="j5gyOw">Some years ago a priests quorum decided to gather food for the needy as a service project. Jim, one of the priests, was excited to participate and was determined to collect more food than anyone else. The time arrived when the priests met at the chapel. They all went out at the same time and returned at a specified time later in the evening. To everyone’s surprise, Jim’s cart was empty. He seemed rather sober, and some of the boys made fun of him. Seeing this and knowing that Jim had an interest in cars, the adviser said, “Come outside, Jim. I want you to look at my car. It’s giving me some trouble.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p11" pid="tAXy49EHA0icAxxKLJuV_A" hash="2EwiRQ">When they got outside, the adviser asked Jim if he was upset. Jim said, “No, not really. But when I went out to collect the food, I really got a lot. My cart was full. As I was returning to the chapel, I stopped at the home of a nonmember woman who is divorced and lives within our ward boundaries. I knocked on the door and explained what we were doing, and she invited me in. She began to look for something to give me. She opened the refrigerator, and I could see there was hardly anything in it. The cupboards were bare. Finally, she found a small can of peaches.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p12" pid="1ByIPuonpkGa1XwlkEvjMg" hash="OcClhg">“I could hardly believe it. There were all these little kids running around that needed to be fed, and she handed me this can of peaches. I took it and put it in my cart and went on up the street. I got about halfway up the block when I just felt warm all over and knew I needed to go back to that house. I gave her all the food.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p13" pid="5UWXktuv4U-IqR1LB3y-mg" hash="d9b2MQ">The adviser said, “Jim, don’t you ever forget the way you feel tonight, because that’s what it is all about.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Jim had tasted the nutrient of selfless service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p14" pid="Ngon4b8NbkuwbOpX8S6wAQ" hash="Y7Q98w">Many spiritual nutrients come while serving on a mission—from being totally involved in the work of the Master. They come from helping people become spiritually awake so that they can accept the gospel. Over a century ago when Elder J. Golden Kimball presided over the Southern States Mission, he called for a meeting of the elders. They were to meet in a secluded spot in the woods so they would have privacy. One of the elders had a problem with one of his legs. It was raw and swollen to at least twice the size of his other leg. But the elder insisted on attending this special priesthood meeting in the woods. So two of the elders carried him to this meeting place.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p15" pid="8S55wGy4hECPTvotlifr5A" hash="M6Kzhw">Elder Kimball asked the missionaries, “Brethren, what are you preaching?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p16" pid="W-vf9Cn4l0O3hlYAbqqY3A" hash="1r3leA">They said, “We are preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p17" pid="FRKqXJuQPUKMAHFtGPWn0Q" hash="864ZYw">“Are you telling these people that you have the power and authority, through faith, to heal the sick?” he asked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p18" pid="Yn7RgraKxUGFyx5umNsyYA" hash="Mmh6SQ">They said, “Yes.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p19" pid="vPfyf7FWXUGraK4pq2g6ug" hash="EFEf-Q">“Well then,” he continued, “why don’t you believe it?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p20" pid="KDwK9zzKZ0qqhP66c-6GyA" hash="kpcqeQ">The young man with the swollen leg spoke up and said, “I believe it.” <span class="pageBreak" page-number="55"></span>Here is the rest of the story told in Elder Kimball’s words: “[The elder] sat down on a stump and the elders gathered around him. He was anointed and I administered to him, and he was healed right in their presence. It was quite a shock; and every other elder that was sick was administered to, and they were all healed. We went out of that priesthood meeting and the elders received their appointments, and there was a joy and happiness that cannot be described.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Their nutrient of faith had been replenished and their zeal for missionary work revived.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p21" pid="-ar9P0BKSUGBHP41imH7bA" hash="4Zyjnw">Spiritual nutrients, which keep us spiritually healthy, can lose their potency and strength if we do not live worthy of the divine guidance we need. The Savior has told us: “Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> We need to keep our minds and bodies clean from all forms of addiction and pollution. We would never choose to eat spoiled or contaminated food. In the same selective way, we should be careful not to read or view anything that is not in good taste. Much of the spiritual pollution that comes into our lives comes through the Internet, computer games, television shows and movies that are highly suggestive of or graphically portray humanity’s baser attributes. Because we live in such an environment, we need to increase our spiritual strength.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p22" pid="68-iajvP2UePBprayo_zsQ" hash="-pEvhg">Enos speaks of his soul hungering and crying all day and also into night in supplication for his soul.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> He craved the spiritual nutrients that quench the thirst for spiritual truth. As the Savior of the world told the woman at the well in Samaria, “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p23" pid="r3oi4QKIu0-7ucWgLWZm3Q" hash="vQkS-w">This evening we have met as the priesthood of God in this vast congregation, both seen and unseen, hopefully because we want to be spiritually nourished. I hope that we will always hunger and thirst for the word of the Lord through His servants, the prophets, and that we may be filled each week as we attend our sacrament meetings and renew our covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p24" pid="Raroke_NQUmoadj6WZOUcA" hash="mMjB8Q">Each of you young men of the Aaronic Priesthood has inside of you all of the essential elements for your eternal destiny. These elements, some of them dormant, need to be strengthened and nourished from the outside. Some of them are physical; some of them are spiritual. The human spirit needs to know about its eternal journey—to know where it came from, why it is here in mortality, and where it must ultimately go to receive joy and happiness and fulfill its destiny. Replenishing our spirits with spiritual nutrients can be everlasting and will go with us into the eternities. As Amulek taught, “That same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p25" pid="qx-HySycL0m6CqUh_NEhWA" hash="z0Pdcw">Brethren, we appreciate your devotion and righteousness. You carry out your callings in the quorums, branches, wards, and stakes so well that the Church grows, and the whole work of God goes forward throughout the world. Through your priesthood you are able to bless in the name of the Lord your families and others you may be called upon or assigned to bless. This comes from the divine agency entrusted to us by the Lord, for He has promised, “Whomsoever you bless I will bless.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/spiritual-nutrients.p26" pid="B6V1qb5tFk6wZpwGJIzAhA" hash="TodnuA">Brethren, I hope we will be faithful and true to all of our covenants. I pray that we can be totally committed in all of our family relationships, especially to our spouses, but also to our parents, our children, and grandchildren. May we be found bearing our personal testimonies of the truthfulness of this work all the days of our lives. May we go forward in righteousness as the humble servants of the Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We acknowledge any and all who have had anything to do with the great work that has been done in this building. We especially thank the Presiding Bishopric—Bishop H. David Burton, Bishop Richard C. Edgley, and Bishop Keith B. McMullin—for their excellent leadership in directing the work of updating and restoring the Salt Lake Tabernacle.</p>

I was baptized here. When I became a deacon, my father brought me here to attend general priesthood meeting. We came 15 minutes early and were easily able to get a seat in the balcony.</p>

Both were built according to revelation. The first recorded Church-constructed building designated as a meetinghouse was also intended to be used as a schoolhouse. It was built of logs in Missouri in 1831.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith regretfully recorded that the building would not accommodate more.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> However, as violence against the Saints and their leaders escalated in Kirtland, the main body of the Church moved to Missouri in 1838, leaving this precious building behind.</p>

However, before the Nauvoo Temple was completed in 1846 the Saints would meet outside, often near the temple, to hear Joseph and the other Church leaders speak. Sometimes thousands attended those meetings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p6" pid="bndbrAMpDUOaeKahAKFI3g" hash="jJsOJw">As George A.

It was in a little grove of trees near the site of the temple. In company with my mother I listened here to such men as Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, the Prophet Joseph and the Patriarch Hyrum. I remember quite well attending one meeting in this grove, that a wagon had been drawn up in front of the audience and the Prophet Joseph stood in the box speaking, when it began to rain. Some one or two persons got up and held umbrellas over him, to shield him from the wet. Many of the people had no umbrellas, and it was very annoying and disagreeable to sit there, but I remember very well, though but a little boy, that there was no one went away from the ground while he spoke.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

In 1845, as the temple was nearing completion, Elder Orson Hyde of the Quorum of the Twelve was sent back East to raise funds and to buy “about four thousand yards” of canvas to build what Brigham Young referred to as “the Tabernacle of the congregation in Zion.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p11" pid="7mrnExOMGkCtzNIPvI4JLw" hash="5bbdyg">“It is intended to erect a tabernacle of canvass in front of, and joining the Temple on the west. The form of this tabernacle will be that of an ellipse. … The area of its base will be sufficient to contain eight or ten thousand persons; its seats will gradually rise one above another in the form of an amphitheatre.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

However, because of the intense persecution from their enemies, the Saints had to leave Nauvoo, so the canvas tabernacle was never built. Orson Hyde “loaded the canvas into wagons in 1846 and headed west with it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Some have speculated that “the canvas was put to good use for such things as tents, tent ends and wagon covers” for the Saints in the exodus to the Salt Lake Valley.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

As with other matters, such as the great migration to the West, Joseph Smith envisioned a great tabernacle, and Brigham Young made it a reality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p14" pid="5hhHKNqDE0mucejCaRliew" hash="vjjoSw">So the tabernacle contemplated for Nauvoo, although never built, was a prototype for this historic building. When I was a boy, we listened to general conference on the radio; now with the use of satellites and modern electronic equipment, we broadcast from Salt Lake City to whole countries worldwide at one time—as we’re doing now—using downlinks to buildings all over the world. This came about because of the inspiration that came to the Brethren to meet the needs of the people in our day and time. This is a good example of how the Lord makes it possible to meet the needs of the members of the Church. I testify that the Lord will continue to reveal through His prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, the ways and means to meet the needs of all members in an ever-growing Church.</p>

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="54"></span>Brethren, tonight I would like to talk to you as I would to my grandsons. I hope that what I have to say will apply to all young priesthood holders everywhere. As I think of this large congregation and also the many thousands more who have joined us by satellite, I am reminded that the great blessing of holding the priesthood of God is one that is reserved for the relatively few, considering the billions of people in the world. To hold the priesthood is a signal honor; yet any worthy man or boy over the age of 12 in the Church may receive it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p2" pid="IE7iv3aGh0K74g_G7Z06Lg" hash="s23UoA">Priesthood is the authority delegated to man to minister in the name of God. It is a power that no one can assume on his own initiative. As Paul said, “No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> It is an authority beyond all human power to create.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p3" pid="O-16sTwGo0ilTtRTrzdzWA" hash="jgtS8A">Peter, a young priest, wrote of an experience that taught him that priesthood power is very real. A young convert in his ward in Ontario, Canada, was sustained as a teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood, and Peter was asked to be the “voice” in the ordination. Peter wrote, “I had never laid my hands on anybody’s head before, and I felt so inadequate. But then the Spirit reassured me that it would be fine for me to do it. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p4" pid="jNw1BQujQ0e7c8YaiC14PQ" hash="cJ6h9w">“The young man to be ordained sat down in the chair, and I stood directly behind him. [Our Young Men president] guided me through the ordinance prayer and I repeated every word he said. After we had finished the ordination and said, ‘… and we wish to pronounce a blessing on your head at this time …’ [the Young Men president] looked at me and indicated that I was on my own.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p5" pid="Gb_jX4QGj0KUstDoo7NKFw" hash="cwTpfw">“At that point, the priesthood entirely changed its meaning for me. It was no longer just a title, but the actual authority to act in God’s name, and I was giving that authority to someone else. I paused and waited for the Spirit to whisper to me what I was to say. It is difficult for me to describe the feelings I had that day during the blessing, but I can say that I now have a stronger testimony that the power of the priesthood is real.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p6" pid="W-r__hg0zUOZ68_cXY_mSw" hash="WitQMA">You young men are no doubt looking forward to receiving the higher or Melchizedek Priesthood. Of this higher priesthood the Prophet Joseph Smith said, “Its institution was prior to ‘the foundation of this earth, or the morning stars sang together, or the Sons of God shouted for joy,’ and is the highest and holiest Priesthood, and is after the order of the Son of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p7" pid="c4yprJI7rECrJGmcTPqJvw" hash="7JgUeQ">As priesthood holders we are agents of the Lord. The Lord spoke of this sacred agency to the elders of the Church in Kirtland in 1831: “Wherefore, as ye are agents, ye are on the Lord’s errand; and whatever ye do according to the will of the Lord is the Lord’s business.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p8" pid="jweunjhjA0SR2Te5zYMUig" hash="4NXXuQ">President Hinckley has often reminded us that missionary work is essentially a priesthood responsibility. It is a great honor and responsibility to be called to serve the Lord in missionary work. This service brings lasting joy, even though it also can be challenging and discouraging at times. My mission changed the course of my life. It was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had. Serving a mission prepares us for the rest of our life’s work and our eternal work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p9" pid="fCjLqAlYWkmyiyH6dthIwA" hash="fALM5A">I hope each one of you becomes a man of God. You will become a man of God through righteous works. You will honor and magnify your priesthood and, as the Apostle Paul said, “follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p10" pid="9SRI4dvtI0yZ4p3UidWfPQ" hash="YsftKg">It is not always easy to follow a righteous plan and be obedient to the laws of society and the laws of the Lord. In the long run, however, following the rules is still the best pathway to obtaining all the things the Lord has promised.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p11" pid="xz-UtwUmSE-yYkFj-qercg" hash="RAbIUw">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="55"></span>We are all accountable for our actions. My experience as a lawyer taught me that those who follow a life of crime frequently blame their father or mother or society when they are imprisoned. Yet they willfully chose to act “contrary to the nature of God” and consequently are “in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Some of them even claim, “The devil made me do it!” The truth in that statement is that the devil entices us to do evil.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> The falsehood is because we have agency. The devil can’t make us do anything we choose not to do.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p12" pid="dCmysnSMBk-Y8g3PG4JpTg" hash="-UkXHQ">Snares and pitfalls can come to all of us, whether in our youth, middle age, or old age. As someone once observed, “In youth we run into difficulties; in old age difficulties run into us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> The increased permissiveness of our society will require us to hold very tightly to the iron rod of righteousness in order to receive the blessings and protection of the Lord. There is great danger in trifling with Satan’s temptations. We will need to guard against all forms of evil all of the days of our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p13" pid="PHIZLusuD0yofBnHWWtCGQ" hash="va5jdA">All you young men who hold the priesthood have the duty to respect womanhood. As you date the lovely young women of the Church, you have a duty to protect their physical safety and virtue. The priesthood you hold gives you the greater responsibility to see that the high moral standards of the Church are always maintained. You know better than to approach the edge of sexual enticement. You will lose part of that which is sacred about yourself if you go beyond the edge and abuse the great powers of procreation. How can any of us hope to play a great role in time or eternity if we have no power of self-control? To be married to a righteous woman who loves the Lord, loves you, and respects the priesthood is one of the greatest of blessings of life and eternity. I have learned this from over 60 years of marriage to my wife, Ruth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p14" pid="qJpJWx8INkmSAm7lKkUZ2A" hash="bfAPCw">Friends and acquaintances add much to the richness of life, but these relationships can be temporary. No one loves you more or has greater concern for your welfare than your parents. You may question what they tell you, but you cannot question their love for you and interest in your well-being.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p15" pid="vKISKrahw0WEuQyMRu5SCA" hash="Orsd3Q">The time will come when you young men will have the responsibility of caring for a wife and children, who will depend upon you. When you marry, you will be responsible for your wife’s welfare and ultimately for the welfare of your children as you start a family. Marriage and fatherhood can bring great eternal happiness and joy. As President Joseph F. Smith said, it is “family life, on which the government of the Church is based and perpetuated.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> To find sublime fulfillment in <span class="pageBreak" page-number="56"></span>the home, both partners need to be fully committed to the marriage. President David O. McKay once said, “When one puts business or pleasure above his home, he that moment starts on the downgrade to soul-weakness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p16" pid="N-UxJ-9F60GwnVU0r96xag" hash="R16Pcw">Some of you are well on your way to successfully meeting some of your goals in life. We are proud of you. My father once told me that he thought he would have it made when he graduated from law school. He said that really in a sense his graduation was only the beginning of greater challenges. We do not have it made, nor will we be free from worldly challenges in this life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p17" pid="BAMVdBYKGEuuOd1_VHH_Bw" hash="gxi8Cg">We live in an age of specialization. When I was a boy, many people had Model T Fords. Compared to modern cars, they were relatively simple mechanically. Many people were able to fix their own cars by grinding the valves, changing the rings on the pistons, putting in new brake bands, and using a generous supply of baling wire. Nowadays automobiles are so sophisticated that the average person knows very little about how to repair them. The mechanics of today use a computer to diagnose engine problems. I mention this example to encourage you young men to get training and education in order to keep up. Technical education is very important, and the same thing is true in fields of higher education. Any kind of skill requires specialized learning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p18" pid="VI9KRkis20-Vi7kdgNK6rQ" hash="bvFmeA">I do not care what vocation you choose to follow in life so long as it is honorable. How you provide for your family is your decision. Acquiring a skill is a good way to pay the bills, but there really ought to be something more in terms of personal involvement. Do not become so preoccupied with the material things of life that you lose the essence of your humanity. You may recall Dickens’s character Jacob Marley, who lamented his obsession with work when he exclaimed: “Business? … Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Each of us ought to play some role in strengthening society, especially in doing the work of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p19" pid="RYkf7Bpcg0-yAhoqJCAx4Q" hash="HLsGAA">I have learned that for those of us who hold the priesthood, the best formula for success is “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Success will not come immediately because it requires preparation and hard work. There really are no shortcuts to success.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p20" pid="0moUC2G42EK0JDo1Rtlnqg" hash="aZoxQw">Each of us is a unique creation of our Heavenly Father. No two of us are completely alike. No one else has exactly the same gifts and talents that we have been given. We should increase those talents and gifts and use them to leverage our uniqueness. For example, when I was growing up, there was a fine young man in our neighborhood who was not a scholar but made beautiful furniture with his hands. He and I were drafted into the military the same day. He could not learn to make his bed so it would pass inspection, but he could make pieces of wood into exquisite art. As President Howard W. Hunter said: “Some persons have the idea that talent, creativity, moral stability, or greatness are not in the realm of youth, but are reserved to those who are older. This is not so.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p21" pid="AZZaV4B_VkeYxu0P0Y_cHg" hash="pPy5Jw">You young men have a future with great promise. You are the beneficiaries of knowledge the world has never known before. This knowledge will allow you to contribute to the future of modern business, industry, agriculture, and the professions. You may be among those who will defend a way of life on the battlefields. You will be among those who spread the principles of the gospel in the world and help the Church grow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/message-to-my-grandsons.p22" pid="GnNuddrdpECzwgSecc0Euw" hash="iwaVvg">Now, my dear grandsons and all special young men within the sound of my voice, go forward. Go forward in faith and righteousness, following the leadership of our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. If you do, the Lord will strengthen and magnify you so that you will accomplish great things. I testify of the great and profound influence the priesthood has been in my life. In all my long years of life I have tried not to hide who I am and what I believe. I cannot recall a single instance when it hurt my career or I lost valued friends by humbly acknowledging that I was a member of this Church. I leave my testimony and blessing with you today in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

They work hard and live quiet, peaceful lives separate from the world. Most of their food comes from their own farms. The women sew and knit and weave their clothing, which is modest and plain. They are known as the Amish people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-healing-power-of-forgiveness.p3" pid="JV1_SFbP8kODUZa0PnZ7Ag" hash="9zfPcg">A 32-year-old milk truck driver lived with his family in their Nickel Mines community. He was not Amish, but his pickup route took him to many Amish dairy farms, where he became known as the quiet milkman. Last October he suddenly lost all reason and control. In his tormented mind he blamed God for the death of his first child and some unsubstantiated memories. He stormed into the Amish school without any provocation, released the boys and adults, and tied up the 10 girls. He shot the girls, killing five and wounding five. Then he took his own life.</p>

There was hurt but no hate. Their forgiveness was immediate. Collectively they began to reach out to the milkman’s suffering family. As the milkman’s family gathered in his home the day after the shootings, an Amish neighbor came over, wrapped his arms around the father of the dead gunman, and said, “We will forgive you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Amish leaders visited the milkman’s wife and children to extend their sympathy, their forgiveness, their help, and their love. About half of the mourners at the milkman’s funeral were Amish. In turn, the Amish invited the milkman’s family to attend the funeral services of the girls who had been killed. A remarkable peace settled on the Amish as their faith sustained them during this crisis.</p>

And, yes, a language of forgiveness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> It was an amazing outpouring of their complete faith in the Lord’s teachings in the Sermon on the Mount: “Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

It was because of their faith in God and trust in His word, which is part of their inner beings. They see themselves as disciples of Christ and want to follow His example.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="68"></span>Hearing of this tragedy, many people sent money to the Amish to pay for the health care of the five surviving girls and for the burial expenses of the five who were killed. As a further demonstration of their discipleship, the Amish decided to share some of the money with the widow of the milkman and her three children because they too were victims of this terrible tragedy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-healing-power-of-forgiveness.p12" pid="1oCmWidWcUmOhZYW94mCCw" hash="3KbtCg">Forgiveness is not always instantaneous as it was with the Amish. When innocent children have been molested or killed, most of us do not think first about forgiveness. Our natural response is anger. We may even feel justified in wanting to “get even” with anyone who inflicts injury on us or our family.</p>

It is rediscovering the strengths we always had and relocating our limitless capacity to understand and accept other people and ourselves.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-healing-power-of-forgiveness.p15" pid="2LXFywclME2gCcMFAM2CdA" hash="8aahcg">Most of us need time to work through pain and loss. We can find all manner of reasons for postponing forgiveness. One of these reasons is waiting for the wrongdoers to repent before we forgive them. Yet such a delay causes us to forfeit the peace and happiness that could be ours. The folly of rehashing long-past hurts does not bring happiness.</p>

Such faith “enables people to withstand the worst of humanity. It also enables people to look beyond themselves. More importantly, it enables them to forgive.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

We cannot understand or explain them. We may never know why some things happen in this life. The reason for some of our suffering is known only to the Lord. But because it happens, it must be endured. President Howard W. Hunter said that “God knows what we do not know and sees what we do not see.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

Some recent studies show that people who are taught to forgive become “less angry, more hopeful, less depressed, less anxious and less stressed,” which leads to greater physical well-being.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Another of these studies concludes “that forgiveness … is a liberating gift [that] people can give to themselves.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/the-healing-power-of-forgiveness.p23" pid="4dKAZArg6E2QPzDmmeoavw" hash="wo9HPA">Here in Salt Lake City in 1985, Bishop Steven Christensen, through no fault of his own, was cruelly and senselessly killed by a bomb intended to take his life. He was the son of Mac and Joan Christensen, the husband of Terri, and the father of four children. With his parents’ consent, I share what they learned from this experience. After this terrible deed, the news media followed members of the Christensen family around relentlessly. On one occasion this media intrusion offended one of the family members to the point that Steven’s father, Mac, had to restrain him. Mac then thought, “This thing will destroy my family if we don’t forgive. Venom and hatred will never end if we do not get it out of our system.” Healing and peace came as the family cleansed their hearts from anger and were able to forgive the man who took their son’s life.</p>

Gary Ceran, whose wife and two children were killed on Christmas Eve when their vehicle was hit by a truck, immediately expressed his forgiveness and concern for the alleged <span class="pageBreak" page-number="69"></span>drunk driver. Last February, when a car crashed into Bishop Christopher Williams’s vehicle, he had a decision to make, and it was to “unconditionally forgive” the driver who had caused the accident so that the healing process could take place unhampered.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

We need to recognize and acknowledge angry feelings. It will take humility to do this, but if we will get on our knees and ask Heavenly Father for a feeling of forgiveness, He will help us. The Lord requires us “to forgive all men”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> for our own good because “hatred retards spiritual growth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> Only as we rid ourselves of hatred and bitterness can the Lord put comfort into our hearts, just as He did for the Amish community, the Christensens, the Cerans, and the Williams family.</p>

But it does not relieve us of consequences.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> When tragedy strikes, we should not respond by seeking personal revenge but rather let justice take its course and then let go. It is not easy to let go and empty our hearts of festering resentment. The Savior has offered to all of us a precious peace through His Atonement, but this can come only as we are willing to cast out negative feelings of anger, spite, or revenge. For all of us who forgive “those who trespass against us,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> even those who have committed serious crimes, the Atonement brings a measure of peace and comfort.</p>

In the words of one of my favorite hymns, “Oh, forgive as thou wouldst be e’en forgiven now by me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> With all my heart and soul, I believe in the healing power that can come to us as we follow the counsel of the Savior “to forgive all men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
