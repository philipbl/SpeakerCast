      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p1" pid="zkoHMfehxEqgkAkztbgVWw" hash="n3RIlA">With Moroni of old, I believe in a God of miracles. Moroni wrote to the people of our dispensation, “Behold, I will show unto you a God of miracles, … and it is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.11" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 9:11</a>). Moroni proclaimed that Jesus Christ did many mighty miracles, that many mighty miracles were wrought by the hands of the Apostles, and that a God who is the same yesterday, today, and forever must be a God of miracles today (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.18" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 9:18</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.9" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 9:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p2" pid="nFf7UHPrwku_9dJ5n-Sx_A" hash="KCmnYg">Think of the miracles of the Old Testament. Remember Moses and the parting of the Red Sea. For all future generations of Israelites, the great miracles that led to their deliverance from Egypt provided undeniable proof of God’s existence and His love for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p3" pid="Q5yQWtFZD0ion20m1dn3WQ" hash="jbSHxw">Many Book of Mormon prophets, including Nephi, pointed to the story of Moses to encourage faith and belief in a God who could deliver His people in their distress (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.1-3" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 4:1–3</a>). Other Book of Mormon prophets reminded the people that they themselves had witnessed miracles that should convince them of God’s power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p4" pid="dgs1eXaK-UGR69TfGtlF4w" hash="u2mmcA">In the New Testament, the Apostle John shared his reason for recording many of the Savior’s miracles—namely, “that [we] might believe that Jesus is the Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.31" class="scriptureRef">John 20:31</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p5" pid="3uU26JOEpkaKEtPrVNcZmQ" hash="1hdhJQ">In this dispensation we witness the great miracle of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth. It began when a young boy entered a grove of trees near Palmyra, New York, and poured out his heart and his questions to a God he believed could answer him—the God of miracles. And miracles have followed in this dispensation—mighty miracles—including the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, which is itself another testament of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p6" pid="boEhfRPGmkuZ06Gbm6QJBQ" hash="qeKbtw">Just as important as these “mighty miracles” are the smaller “private miracles” that teach each of us to have faith in the Lord. These come as we recognize and heed the promptings of the Spirit in our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p7" pid="D5MRl10d_0CPpx-MvaALbQ" hash="7VOarw">I am grateful for a teacher who encouraged his students to keep a journal of the whisperings or promptings of the Spirit in their lives. He directed us to note what we felt and what resulted. Little things became evident. One day I was frantically trying to complete some assignments and prepare for a trip. I had just been down to the laundry area of the dorm to move my clothes from the washer to the dryer. Unfortunately, all the dryers were in use, and they all had many minutes to go. I went back upstairs discouraged, knowing by the time those dryers finished, I had to be on the road. I had barely returned to my room when I felt prompted to go back downstairs and check the laundry again. <span class="emphasis">Foolishness,</span> I thought—I had just been there, and I didn’t have time. But because I was trying to listen, I went. Two of the dryers were empty—and I was able to meet all my commitments. Could the Lord possibly have been concerned about smoothing my way in such a small but, to me, important matter? I have learned since through many such experiences that the Lord will help us in every aspect of our lives when we are trying to serve Him and do His will.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p8" pid="lO6ReuKIkkKB09QVCa9y5g" hash="LF1lMg">I believe that all of us can bear witness to these small miracles. We know children who pray for help to find a lost item and find it. We know of young people who gather the courage to stand as a witness of God and feel His sustaining hand. We know friends who pay their tithing with the last of their money and then, through a miracle, find themselves able to pay their tuition or their rent or somehow obtain food for their family. We can share experiences of prayers answered and priesthood blessings that gave courage, brought comfort, or restored health. These daily miracles acquaint us with the hand of the Lord in our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p9" pid="Y3YTeCCz1kWyFsqkUfKMXA" hash="uY3H8w">My mind has been much on this topic because of an experience our family has had in the last few months. Our daughter and her husband took a while to find each other and then, though they wanted children with all their hearts, over a number of years had difficulty realizing that dream. They prayed and they sought priesthood blessings and medical help, and eventually were thrilled to learn they were expecting twins.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p10" pid="MPzInaKSk0iA02Jx17FWzQ" hash="xz-haQ">Things did not go smoothly, however, and three and a half months before the babies were due to arrive, the mother-to-be found herself in the labor and delivery section of the hospital. The doctors at first were hopeful that they could stop the labor for a few more weeks. Quickly, however, the question became, would they even have the 48 hours necessary for medication to prepare the babies’ immature lungs to function?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p11" pid="ecUQ-RmwNECers9surEeQw" hash="7Olxag">A nurse came in from the newborn intensive care unit to show the couple pictures of the machines the babies would be hooked up to if they were born alive. She explained the risks for eye damage, for lung collapse, for physical impairment, for brain damage. The couple listened, humbled yet hopeful, and then, despite all the doctors could do, it was obvious that these babies were coming.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p12" pid="Mz_eXoAgXkK7RriuB2UYug" hash="3y1iLw">They were born alive. First the baby girl and then the baby boy—weighing less than four pounds together—were rushed to the intensive care unit and put on ventilators, with umbilical tubes and intravenous lines and constant attention. They can’t have too much light, they can’t have too much noise, their chemical balances need constant monitoring, as the hospital, with millions of dollars of equipment and many wonderful doctors and nurses, attempted to replicate the miracle of a mother’s womb.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p13" pid="UbG52T_eH0qTMVy60aw7fw" hash="-Sxv_Q">There are multitudes of little miracles every day: a collapsed lung heals and then, despite the odds, continues to function properly; pneumonia is beaten back; more deadly infections invade and are overcome; IV lines go bad and are replaced. After two and a half months, the baby boy has gained two pounds and can breathe with an oxygen supplement. His ventilator is gone, he learns to eat, and his grateful parents take him home with monitors attached.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p14" pid="ofUBtm72qEefTeu2kyUR4A" hash="ekykYA">The baby girl keeps pulling her ventilator tube out, setting off alarms across the nursery. Maybe she wants to keep up with her brother, we think, but her throat closes off each time, and she just can’t breathe on her own. Her throat is so inflamed that at times the respiratory therapists have great difficulty reinserting the tube, and she almost dies. Her normal progress is stymied by her continued dependence on the ventilator.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p15" pid="GVaLe1OlH0Kc_ZLod0zagA" hash="bUasHA">Finally, after her baby brother has been home for two months, the doctors feel they are forced to suggest surgery for her—a surgery that will allow her to breathe by opening a hole in her throat, a surgery that might solve the stomach problems by opening a hole in her side, but a surgery that will impact her little body for many more months and maybe for the rest of her life. As the parents wrestled with this decision, a beloved aunt sent a message to all the family. She explained the situation—the critical issue of timing, the importance of getting off the ventilator—and suggested that we join our faith once again, and in prayer and fasting ask for one more miracle—if it was the Lord’s will. We would culminate our fast with a prayer the evening of December 3.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p16" pid="fYG3lqnUtkCR36LTRYo3wg" hash="04bmmg">Let me read from a letter that was sent to the family the morning of December 4. “Dearest Family, Wonderful news! Blessings from the Lord. Our heartfelt thanks for your prayers and fasting in behalf of our little girl. Yesterday morning she came off the ventilator and has been off for 24 hours at this writing. To us, it is a miracle. The medical staff are still guarded about predicting the future, but we are so grateful to the Lord and to you. We are praying that this will mark the beginning of the end of her hospital stay. And we even dare to hope that she’ll be home for Christmas.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p17" pid="Oltz31nS6kKm54HvQmGM8w" hash="09Bc4g">She did make it home for Christmas, and both babies are currently doing “just fine.” Our family has had its own “parting of the Red Sea,” and we are prepared to testify that there is today, as there was yesterday and will be forever, a “God of miracles” who loves His children and desires to bless them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p18" pid="r6DPEP3PbE6eHWbubHXt1A" hash="q2MprQ">Now, we know, as you do, that all petitions to the Lord and all fasts do not receive this same hoped-for answer. Our extended family also has faced the death of loved ones, serious illness, the trial of divorce, and children who are choosing another path. We do not always understand the reasons behind the tests that come with mortality. But our faith has grown, and perhaps yours has too, as we have watched loved ones, friends, and people we know only by reputation endure with faith in the Lord the most severe trials. They, too, know the God of miracles and witness in their extremity that whatever the future holds for them, the Lord knows them and loves them and is blessing them. They are sealed to Him and to each other forever, and they are willing to submit their wills to His.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p19" pid="3gWKjANd0EWzP9zkyrdEqA" hash="k4aaSA">How have they come to such a point? How do we access the quiet miracle that the Lord works as He transforms us, His children, into worthy heirs of the kingdom of God? I believe it is made possible because “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16</a>). I believe it comes as we yield to the enticings of the Spirit, put off the natural man, and are filled with the love of God (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>). “Through the Atonement of [Jesus] Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.3" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:3</a>). All mankind—that includes me, that includes you—we can each have part in the Atonement, the greatest of all God’s miracles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/a-god-of-miracles.p20" pid="2-6I4EJKI0CWAEm-BpfgWg" hash="DBUU9g">God did part the Red Sea, and He did give us the Book of Mormon. He can heal us of our sins, and He can and will bless us, His children, in our daily lives. I know that He lives and loves us and is today a God of miracles, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p1" pid="C6Km_nX7TkCr6TEXRYPiYA" hash="3Zi-OQ">Joseph Smith at age 14 had to be one of the least conspicuous human beings on the earth, and yet the God of heaven knew him and called him by name in the Sacred Grove. I believe the Lord knows my name and your name as well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p2" pid="Iw5mHO6plUefM3OPUGmeJQ" hash="Mlf4cA">In Primary we teach the children that each is a child of God and that their Heavenly Father knows them and loves them. Primary and priesthood leaders model what the Savior would do when they call a child by his or her name. Jesus said, “I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> The scriptures testify, “He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p3" pid="GBxnzoNKmkqjgQBUdi0FwQ" hash="qsUNyA">The Lord not only knows who we are, He knows where we are, and He leads us to do good. One day a mother I know felt impressed to call her daughter. (This kind of thing happens to mothers all the time.) It was the middle of the day, and Mom was at work, which made the call out of the ordinary. To her surprise, her son-in-law answered the phone—he’s not usually home on a workday either. As he handed his wife the phone, he said, “It’s your mother with her usual inspiration.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p4" pid="9W1HG3NACkGPTxHR4xDwUA" hash="xyqW2g">They had just been to the doctor. She came on the phone, close to tears, and said, “The ultrasound shows the cord is double-wrapped around the baby’s neck. The doctor says we have no choice but to do a C-section and soon.” Then came the real cause for the distress: “And he says I can’t lift anything heavier than the new baby for four weeks!” She needed reassurance before going into the surgery that the Lord knew her need and loved her—and that there would be help tending the three little ones at home, who were scarcely more than babies themselves. When mothers—and fathers—pray for the Lord to bless and strengthen their families, He often shows them the way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p5" pid="kHLpsTpPZkC5LxONrA41GQ" hash="kypI2g">Sister Gayle Clegg of the Primary general presidency and her husband lived for a number of years in Brazil. Recently she had a Primary assignment in Japan. As she came into the chapel on Sunday, she noticed among the Japanese Saints a Brazilian family. “They just looked Brazilian,” she said. She only had a minute to greet them and found the mother and children very enthusiastic but noticed that the father was rather quiet. “I’ll have a chance to talk with them after the meeting,” she thought as she was quickly ushered to the stand. She delivered her message in English, which was translated into Japanese, and then she felt impressed to bear her testimony in Portuguese as well. She hesitated as there were no translators for Portuguese, and 98 percent of the people would not understand what she said.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p6" pid="xS8HHkCURkyc7J8sy2qQ8g" hash="45u5SA">After the meeting the Brazilian father came up to her and said, “Sister, the customs are so different here, and I have been lonely. It is difficult to come to church and not understand anything. Sometimes I wonder if I would be better off just reading my scriptures at home. I told my wife, ‘I’ll give it one more chance,’ and I came today for what I thought would be the last time. When you bore your testimony in Portuguese, the Spirit touched my heart, and I knew that this was where I belonged. God knows I am here, and He will help me.” And he joined the others in putting away the chairs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p7" pid="sRzEz7DGkU66g5Jn74i3UQ" hash="4Ff6Qg">Was it a coincidence that the only Portuguese-speaking member of the Primary presidency was sent to Japan instead of to Portugal? Or was it because the Lord knew someone there needed what only she could give—and she had the courage to follow a prompting of the Spirit? One of the great blessings of having a calling in the Church is that the Lord, through His Spirit, will inspire us to help those we are called to serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p8" pid="fV5C2RrgdEmAu7AnYXW7gQ" hash="IWxm7Q">Each of us who pays a full tithe can testify that the blessings of the Lord come to us personally and meet our individual needs. The Lord has promised that if we pay our tithing, He will open the windows of heaven and pour us out a blessing so great that we will scarcely have room enough to receive it.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

He was administered to, and some of the vision was restored to his right eye, but he was completely blind in his left. Because he couldn’t see well, he lost his job. He tried to get employment with his wife’s family, but their business failed due to the depression. He was forced to go door-to-door seeking odd jobs and handouts to pay for food and rent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p10" pid="Wpz_V1v2LkyhWUpEyQzYBQ" hash="TSC6xA">One year he did not pay any tithing and went to talk to the branch president. The branch president understood the situation but asked John to make it a matter of prayer and fasting so that he could find a way to pay his tithing. John and his wife, Alice, fasted and prayed and determined that the only thing of value they owned was her engagement ring—a beautiful ring bought in happier times. After much anguish they decided to take the ring to a pawnbroker and learned it was worth enough to pay their tithing and some other outstanding bills. That Sunday he went in to the branch president and paid his tithing. As he left the office, he happened to meet the mission president, who noticed his damaged eyes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/he-knows-us-he-loves-us.p11" pid="I-uxcixeDkaqeh1bjx-ieA" hash="_XqIxQ">Brother Orth’s son, now serving as a bishop in Adelaide, later wrote: “We believe that [the mission president] was an eye doctor, for he was commonly called President Dr. Rees. He spoke to Dad and was able to examine him and offer suggestions to help his eyesight. Dad followed his advice, … and in due course sight was restored—15 percent sight to his left eye and 95 percent sight to his right eye—and with the help of glasses he could see again.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> With his vision restored, John was never unemployed again; redeemed the ring, which is now a family heirloom; and paid a full tithing for the rest of his life. The Lord knew John Orth, and He knew who could help him.</p>

Generations were blessed because a family decided they would pay their tithing regardless of the difficulty—and then met a man who “happened by” and “happened” to be an eye surgeon who was able to make a great difference in their life. While some may be tempted to believe these are just coincidences, I have confidence that even a sparrow cannot fall to the ground but He knows it.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

He wants you to be successful. His greatest desire is to bless you.” I have heard you testify to a grieving friend: “I know there is a life after this one. I know your child still lives and that there is a way for you to see him and be with him again.” I have watched many of you tell a discouraged young mother: “Let me help you—what you are doing is the most important work in the world.” I have seen those you touch not only recognize your love but feel the Lord’s love and power as His Spirit bears witness to them that what you have said is true.</p>

He knows our joys and our sorrows. He knows my name and your name. When we covenant with Him at baptism, we promise to keep His commandments, to always remember Him, and to take His name upon us. Ultimately, His is the name by which we want to be called, for “there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> I bear my witness that He lives and loves us and calls us by name to come unto Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
