        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="41"></span>One morning some years ago, I received a telephone call from Brother Omar Alvarez, who at the time served as one of my counselors in the bishopric. His three-year-old daughter had died in a tragic accident.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/faith-in-adversity.p2" pid="gpAE7AxgLUyGlZMUwRxyVA" hash="3uajSQ">He related the account of what happened that day as follows:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/faith-in-adversity.p3" pid="iyG1no_nRUSTxBDjZe_NfQ" hash="VRkuFA">“As soon as we arrived at one of the beautiful Venezuelan beaches, our children begged us to let them go out and play in a small river near the beach. We allowed them to go. Then we started to get some things out of the car. Two minutes later we noticed that our children were starting to get too far from the shore.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/faith-in-adversity.p4" pid="sgcT95Q-bUStU5aAlWmA3A" hash="sUH9JA">“As we went toward them to bring them closer, we noticed that our three-year-old daughter was not with the other children. We looked for her desperately, only to find her floating near the place where the other children were. We quickly pulled her out of the water. Some people came to try to help save her, but nothing could be done. Our youngest daughter had drowned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/faith-in-adversity.p5" pid="XAhRAEIARkCwzUGIdzPjMw" hash="gmuP5w">“The moments that followed were extremely difficult, filled with anguish and pain for the loss of our youngest daughter. That feeling soon turned into an almost unbearable torment. However, in the midst of the confusion and uncertainty, the thought that our children had been born under the covenant came to our minds, and through that covenant, our daughter belongs to us for eternity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/faith-in-adversity.p6" pid="zLomcSigM0iHbFR_1OM2_w" hash="8gu7_w">“What a blessing it is to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ and to have received the ordinances of His holy temple! We now feel that we are much more committed to be faithful to the Lord and endure to the end because we want to be worthy of the blessings that the temple provides in order to see our daughter again. At times we mourn, but ‘we do not mourn as those without hope’ (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</span> [Melchizedek Priesthood and Relief Society course of study, 2007], 177).”</p>

Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>).</p>

Several members of the Quero family had died in a terrible car accident. Brother Abraham Quero lost his parents, two sisters, his brother-in-law, and his niece in that accident.</p>

Kimball</span> [Melchizedek Priesthood and Relief Society course of study, 2006], 18) and that the important thing is not how a man died but how he lived.</p>

There is no infirmity, affliction, or <span class="pageBreak" page-number="42"></span>adversity that Christ did not feel in Gethsemane.</p>

I bear witness of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

One common factor that I have often found in these faithful members is the perspective that they have of eternity.

In our home our children liked to do jigsaw puzzles. We have probably all had the opportunity to do a puzzle. Some are made up of many small pieces. I remember that one of our children (I won’t give his name in order to protect his identity) used to focus on the individual pieces, and when one did not fit in the place where he thought it should, he would become angry and assume it was no good and want to throw it away. He finally learned to do the puzzle when he understood that each small piece had its place in the final picture, even when he did not know where it fit at a given moment.</p>

We do not have to concern ourselves with each of its parts separately but rather to try to bring the entire picture into focus, keeping in mind what the final result will be.

Maxwell taught: “Though ‘anchored’ in grand and ultimate hope, some of our tactical hopes are another matter. We may hope for a pay raise, a special date, an electoral victory, or for a bigger house—things which may or may not be realized. Faith in Father’s plan gives us endurance even amid the wreckage of such proximate hopes. Hope keeps us ‘anxiously engaged’ in good causes even when these appear to be losing causes (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27</a>).”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

They had all suffered much difficulty and numerous afflictions; however, their attitudes toward them were very different. Nephi said, “And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

And they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Not knowing or disregarding “the dealings of … God” is one way of losing eternal perspective, and murmuring is just one of the symptoms. Even though Laman and Lemuel witnessed many miracles along with Nephi, they exclaimed, saying: “And we have wandered in the wilderness for these many years; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne children in the wilderness and suffered all things, save it were death; and it would have been better that they had died before they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered these afflictions.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Obviously, their perspectives were different.</p>

Kimball wrote the following: “If we looked at mortality as the whole of existence, then pain, sorrow, failure, and short life would be calamity. But if we look upon life as an eternal thing stretching far into the premortal past and on into the eternal post-death future, then all happenings may be put in proper perspective.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

Haight told a story about the sculptor Michelangelo to illustrate the importance of seeing everything in proper perspective: “As the sculptor was chiseling a block of marble, a boy came every day and watched shyly. When the figure of David emerged and appeared from that stone, complete for all the world to admire, the boy asked Michelangelo, ‘How did you know he was in there?’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
