      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p1" pid="WUKREMSsr0eEI3TFglu-gg" hash="akODVA">My dear sisters, you cannot imagine my joy at being here—seeing your faces before me, feeling surrounded by song, and sensing the network of electronic and satellite systems that link us to other congregations of women all over the world. But these are the visible connections. Invisible but just as tangible are the connections of spirit and sisterhood that unite us now and during this coming year in which we celebrate the sesquicentennial of Relief Society. Wherever you are, whatever you are wearing, whatever language you are hearing, you are part of a powerful force of joy, peace, and goodness. We are here to rejoice together “in every good thing.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/26.11" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 26:11</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p2" pid="EtuBg1U2g0iSPYgn7S_BJA" hash="dQnmPQ">It is the strength and joy from a Christ-centered and Christlike life that gives us reason to rejoice.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.35" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:35</a>.) Let me name three blessings from our faith in Christ for which we can rejoice: (1) Let us rejoice in our sisterhood. (2) Let us rejoice in our diversity. And (3) let us rejoice in our charity!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p3" pid="C4m6Z_DeCkWJUDDuyAX4Qg" hash="luksmw">First, let us rejoice in our sisterhood. Look around the room you are in. How many are with you? There may be thousands, as there are in this tabernacle. If you are one of many, give thanks to our Father. If you are one of few, praise him! There were only twenty in Nauvoo in 1842. Be the Nauvoo generation in your ward or branch. Remember you are not alone. You are one of a sisterhood of three million women. As one women’s history scholar has commented:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p4" pid="-Y8QXaTUMEqBRM295pHWmw" hash="epjlpw">“Sisterhood [is] the bonding among women on both personal and public levels, from simple friendships to massive organizations. In this sense Mormon women have a complex and vital heritage of sisterhood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p5" pid="1lm32OSqq0KU2ectahcGXA" hash="JMGUDQ">“Within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, women have been a crucial part of one another’s lives—spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, socially.” (Jill Mulvay Derr, “Strength in Our Union: The Making of Mormon Sisterhood,” in <span class="emphasis">Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective,</span> Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1987, pp. 154-55.) Let us rejoice in the unified sisterhood we share.</p>

I grew up a Buddhist, the daughter of a Japanese plantation laborer in Mahukona, a tiny village which no longer exists, on the big island of Hawaii. My first exposure to Christianity came during the annual Christmas pageant organized by Captain Beck, who was in charge of the plantation. Every year, there was a little nativity play, the singing of Christmas carols, and wonderful presents from a mysterious fat man in a red suit and a white beard.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p7" pid="Zsrg2dFZtUGx9oiKk9EtnQ" hash="8osUEA">When I was about seven, Captain Beck asked me to be the angel in the nativity play. I didn’t know what an angel was, but I was proud to be chosen and worked hard on my speech. And it <span class="emphasis">was</span> hard work. My native language was a combination of Japanese and pidgin, and here I had to memorize strange, seventeenth-century King James English. I was just a skinny little seven-year-old in a white cheesecloth costume with crooked tinsel wings and a wobbly tinsel halo on my head. But when the big night came, I was ready.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p8" pid="COB9oYA-_0W3A4jxbN9G7Q" hash="ZkQUwA">“Fear not,” I said. “For, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy. … For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.10" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:10</a>.) I didn’t know who David was or Christ. I only knew Buddha. I didn’t know what swaddling clothes were or why the baby was in a manger. I didn’t know what shepherds were or why they were afraid or what good tidings were. It was only later, when I became acquainted with the Church at age eleven and joined the Church at age fifteen, that I realized that baby was the Son of God and that the good tidings were those of the gospel. Then I understood my “reason to rejoice” in Christ, the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p9" pid="Gya0uSEw40CIsUHDydGp4A" hash="DC2oIw">Again, look around the room you are in. Do you see women of different ages, races, or different backgrounds in the Church? Of different educational, marital, and professional experiences? Women with children? Women without children? Women of vigorous health and those who are limited by chronic illness or handicaps? Rejoice in the diversity of our sisterhood! It is the diversity of colors in a spectrum that makes a rainbow. It is the diversity in our circumstances that gives us compassionate hearts. It is the diversity of our spiritual gifts that benefits the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p10" pid="nnnPsouVdkKjtLNu-dt1uw" hash="5Ct35Q">When I was on the Primary General Board, Patricia Kelsey Graham, a friend and a former board member, wrote a song for the new children’s songbook that I just love, called “We Are Different.” Listen to its message about knowing, helping, and loving, as Kerstin Larson and Maryanne Featherstone sing it for us, accompanied by Sister Graham:</p>

Elaine, Aileen, Carol, and I are married and single, homemakers and professionals, far travelers and homebodies, converts and fifth-generation members, high school graduates and graduate-degree holders. We have given service to our community and to the Church. But we know each other, we help each other, and we love each other. That’s the way it’s supposed to be. We rejoice in our diversity and enjoy a unified sisterhood. Do the same in your own wards and stakes.</p>

I do! Our callings give us many opportunities for service. The sesquicentennial this next year will see many compassionate service and community service projects. Make these personal! Get involved! Don’t leave all of the decisions to the ward and stake leaders. I want you to remember that the Relief Society began because one woman—a Miss Cook—we don’t even know her full name—talked to her employer, Sarah M. Kimball, and the two of them devised a way to provide shirts for the men working on the Nauvoo Temple. Be a Miss Cook! See a need. Talk to your sisters in the Relief Society. Combine your strengths. Find collective ways to serve that you individually feel good about. Service should be as different as the needs of your community and the talents of your sisters.</p>

The gift of the Holy Ghost is ours by right of confirmation. We don’t need to check it out of the meetinghouse library. We don’t need a bishop’s assignment to be kind. We don’t need to sign up to be thoughtful. We don’t need to be sustained by our wards to be sensitive. Rejoice in the power you have within you from Christ to be a nucleus of love, forgiveness, and compassion.</p>

Mother Teresa says, “I’m a little pencil in the hands of God. He does the thinking. He does the writing. He does everything—and it’s really hard—sometimes it’s a broken pencil. He has to sharpen it a little more. But be a little instrument in His hands so that He can use you anytime, anywhere. … We have only to say Yes to Him.” (“Love: A Fruit Always in Season,” <span class="emphasis">Daily Meditations,</span> San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1987, p. 243.)</p>

There is strength in our sharing. There is power in our commitment to righteousness.

You know, it was Joseph Smith who made that prophecy about the angels. (See <span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:605.) I am calling on all of us to make this prophecy come true by increasing our personal spirituality, by uniting in a mighty sisterhood, and by serving others with Christlike love.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Kigatsuku</span> means “an inner spirit to act without being told what to do.” First, we can do great good when we act as an organized group. One hundred and fifty years of Relief Society speaks for itself. One stake in Denver, Colorado, is making quilts—dozens of thick, warm, comforting quilts—which they will donate to the homeless and those in need. Second, we can do great good when we act in small, informal groups. The Relief Society general board volunteered to clean a littered highway, pulled on their gloves, and discovered that it doesn’t take a long time to make a big difference. And third, we can do great good on our own—just as individuals who care enough to serve. Think of Sister Julia Mavimbela in South Africa, teaching children who had never had a real home to tend the earth by planting gardens. It is the desire in individual hearts that powers not only small, individual acts of service, but also the great acts that become mass movements and even revolutions. You have that power, too.</p>

He didn’t transport the man to an exotic medical facility, organize a cornea transplant team, or didn’t make it into a media event. Sometimes we think we can’t serve because we’re not rich enough, not educated enough, not old enough, or not young enough. Remember, if we have the desire to serve, then our bare hands, a little spit, and a little dirt are enough to make a miracle.</p>

He gave that man a way to exercise faith and strengthen the faith he had by asking him to participate in his own healing. It was a simple thing—washing in the pool of Siloam. But what if the man had refused? Jesus took that risk and let the man participate in his own miracle.</p>

It’s just an ordinary piece of string—not very interesting. When I was growing up on the big island of Hawaii, all of us kids used to keep a piece of string like this handy to play with. Now a string doesn’t look like much, but look what you can do with it!</p>

Do you see how complex and beautiful it is? Do you see how each part supports the other parts and is connected to them? You cannot pick one part out without destroying the whole pattern. It is the same with our lives. We meet many people. With some, the association lasts for years. With others, the association is very brief. But in either case, we can make the pattern a beautiful one by making our encounter a kindly one, filled with the desire to serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/cats-cradle-of-kindness.p4" pid="OFKdlUGlDkaJAQD8e5RCZg" hash="PFSWpw">President Hinckley said something that I just love about our patterns of interconnectedness in the Church. He said: “To those of the Church, all within the sound of my voice, I give the challenge [to] … never lose sight of the whole majestic and wonderful picture of the purpose of this, the dispensation of the fulness of times. Weave beautifully your small thread in the grand tapestry, the pattern for which was laid out for us by the God of heaven.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1989, p. 54.)</p>

We may not understand the pattern that our lives make as they intersect, connect, separate, and intersect again, but God does. Of course, it was no accident that the angel who rebuked the erring Alma the Younger in a “voice of thunder” was the same angel who returned to Alma, now twenty years a missionary, to say, “Blessed art thou, Alma; … for thou hast been faithful.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.11" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 27:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/8.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 8:15</a>.)

Sister Rosetta Colclough, a missionary in Hawaii, came to my junior high when I was eleven and invited all the students to a special religion class taught at the little Mormon chapel near the school. Three other Japanese girls and I, all Buddhists, accepted the invitation. That was the beginning of my Christian instruction, and four years later, I joined the Church.</p>

I was very disappointed there were so few. … [But] near the close of the period, we stood in the little chapel with bowed heads and closed eyes, repeating in unison the Lord’s Prayer. The soft Hawaiian sun filtered through the windows. As we prayed, I suddenly felt a bright light envelop us, coming from above like an inverted cone. A wonderful feeling of peace and joy filled my heart. I led the prayer very slowly as the bright light enfolded us. I was sure the girls felt it also, as their faces shone with an expression of deep reverence. We almost whispered ‘good-bye’ so as not to break the spell, and they tiptoed out. I thought, ‘One or more of those girls will join the Church and become a great influence for good.’”</p>

There was one, Chieko Nishimura, that lingered in my mind, and I often looked at the picture I had taken of them.</p>

Yes, it was my little Chieko. … Chieko and I had a joyous reunion after the meeting. We marveled that out of all the many wards in that big city, they should have come to speak at my ward. We were sure the Lord had a hand in it.”</p>

That afternoon she sat down at her typewriter in Arizona and began her letter to me. She said: “[When] I heard your name announced by Sister Jack … I sat up straight and watched the TV screen eagerly and saw your name appear on the screen. Then you started to speak. The dark hair has turned to silver, but that sweet face was easily recognized. Yes, this is my little Chieko whom I taught at the Honomakau chapel in Kohala so many years ago. As I listened to your voice, tears of joy ran down my cheeks. …</p>

Even while she was writing that letter, my husband, Ed, was being taken to the hospital, stricken down by a cardiac arrest on the afternoon of the sesquicentennial broadcast. Her letter reached me with a special compassion and love when my sons and I were struggling to accept the fact that Ed would not recover. I did not see the light she felt while we four little Buddhist girls repeated the Lord’s Prayer with her, phrase by phrase. But I know the Spirit whispered to me again during that experience, reminding me of my true identity as a daughter of God and prompting me to let those teachings sink deep into my heart so that I could also become a daughter of Christ in the waters of baptism.</p>

Rosetta brought me the gospel, she rejoiced with Ed and me after our baptisms, and she brought me great comfort by reminding me of Heavenly Father’s profound love for me when I was suffering such pain while Ed lay dying. I needed that reassurance and love. I needed to remember that Heavenly Father, fifty years earlier, had reached down and laid his hand on a skinny little Buddhist girl and said, “You are my beloved child.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/cats-cradle-of-kindness.p15" pid="5uZjZWGGDkSs_PcuBjin7w" hash="XKEx1Q">I’ve shared this story with you because it illustrates so beautifully how our lives weave together in ways we cannot guess or plan. Because Rosetta acted with faith, with kindness, and with love, the pattern created by her life encountering mine is a beautiful one. I know that she has woven shining strands into the lives of many others.</p>

We can never afford to be cruel or indifferent or ungenerous, because we are all connected, even if it is in a pattern that only God sees. I am part of this pattern. Rosetta is part of this pattern. You are part of this pattern. And the Savior is part of the pattern. In fact, I like to think that the Savior is the spaces in the pattern, for there would be no pattern at all without them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/cats-cradle-of-kindness.p17" pid="5itfhkrTnE606_Fx6oZJfw" hash="Qlfx-g">May we all deal kindly with one another, seeking in our lives the blessing of the Apostle Paul, that our “hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/col/2.2" class="scriptureRef">Col. 2:2</a>), I pray humbly and sincerely in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

If I were to ask you what the Church teaches about strengthening families, I know that you would say things like “spend time together, have family prayer, hold family home evening, and regular scripture study.” In addition to these important things, I want to talk about building stronger families by building a stronger you—strong in your faith of the Savior. <span class="emphasis">That’s</span> where strong families come from—from strong individuals.</p>

Both are handmade, beautiful, and delightful to snuggle down in or wrap around a grandchild. Now look at this quilt. It’s a Hawaiian quilt with a strong, predictable pattern. We can look at half of the quilt and predict what the other half looks like. Sometimes our lives seem patterned, predictable in happy ways, in order.</p>

Some pieces are the same color, but no two pieces are the same size. They’re odd shapes. They come together at odd angles. This is an unpredictable quilt.

Both of these quilts will keep us warm and cozy. Both are beautiful and made with love.

All of us need strength in dealing with them. This strength comes from faith in the Savior’s love and in the power of his atonement. If we trustingly put our hand in the Savior’s, we can claim the promise of the sacramental prayer to always have his Spirit with us. All problems are manageable with that strength, and all other problems are secondary in urgency to maintaining a strong spiritual life.</p>

We will have the sensitivity to serve compassionately. We will have the wisdom that we need for our Church callings. We can build a loving and respectful partnership with our husbands, children, parents, and friends. If we always have Christ’s Spirit with us, we will have a wise consultant when we are perplexed by our children’s needs. We will receive help in making correct decisions and strength in carrying them out. We will give and receive loyal friendship, and feel in ourselves when the advice we receive from others is truly suited to our needs. We will hold a clear vision of gospel ideals and aspire toward them even as we deal patiently with the limitations of reality. Through faith in the Savior, we can magnify our opportunities, cope with our problems, and keep both of them in perspective.</p>

He was the first priesthood holder in the Okazaki family, and I, of course, had no relatives who were priesthood holders. Priesthood was something we talked about and worked to understand together. How grateful I was for Ed’s goodness and the many opportunities that the Church gave him to bless others. Ed never took his priesthood for granted. It was always a privilege to him, one exercised with thanksgiving and humility. Supporting Ed in his callings and feeling his support for me in mine were part of the partnership of our marriage.</p>

We suspected that a calling might be in the offing, so Ed, who had had a stroke about two years earlier that affected his heart, went to the doctor first so that he would know if he could accept an assignment. The doctor was absolutely firm that Ed must not leave the country. Thus, when Ed was asked if he could accept an overseas assignment, he was very disappointed to report the doctor’s instructions. I would have supported Ed wholeheartedly in his calling, but it was not to be.</p>

All three of us sustained each other and consulted with each other, but I saw Ken take the lead in working with the doctors and the hospital. Then when Ed died, Bob took the lead in making funeral arrangements and dealing with the legal procedures that had to be followed. In planning the funeral service, I took the lead. As each of us passed through different stages in our shock and grief, we had the others for support. When one of us needed to rise to an occasion, we could.

We are met as women with a purpose, as sisters in the Relief Society, which is the Lord’s organization for women. I, with this wonderful choir, plead that we may all come to Christ and find rest in his eternal love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p2" pid="nnghOcHJFEGmwCYSUZxcNA" hash="NTP_jA">May I share with you some thoughts on the power of learning and its relation to self-reliance. To the Saints of this dispensation, the Lord gave important instructions to seek balanced learning. The terms in the scriptures are <span class="emphasis">study</span> and <span class="emphasis">faith.</span> For example, in <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:118</a>, the Lord invites us: “Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.” This same invitation is repeated twice more in the Doctrine and Covenants (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.7,14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 109:7, 14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p3" pid="jet8lwa1_kuyVu0zCDuCdg" hash="9G-j8w">To me, the terms <span class="emphasis">learning by study</span> and <span class="emphasis">learning by faith</span> say that self-reliance comes from both efforts. Everyone involved in the Relief Society literacy effort knows that literacy takes both study <span class="emphasis">and</span> faith. We need to cultivate both of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p4" pid="SZdbkpSSLEaB5zLBzQhRKQ" hash="suzbDQ">Let me give you an example. Suppose you want to know how the human body works. Faith tells us that our bodies were created through an inspired process, that they were made in the image of our Heavenly Parents, that we have a stewardship over them to keep them sacred and healthy during our mortal probation, and that we will reclaim them as perfect after the resurrection. That is the message of faith. That’s like one oar on a boat.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p5" pid="ZTse3cKlgE--3_f-J5n1SQ" hash="tlQ8vg">But to understand their workings—whether an illness is caused by a chemical imbalance or through a fever, how to set a broken bone properly, or how to replace an improperly functioning valve in the heart by surgery—that requires intense and detailed study. Study is the other oar by which we can seek and obtain knowledge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p6" pid="ujWpowpabEGEJHhHah_prg" hash="ONyTbQ">What happens if you try to paddle a boat using only one oar? You go around and around in circles. If you paddle hard, you go fast. If you paddle slowly, you turn gently. But you still just go around in circles. It’s the same with trying to make study replace faith or trying to exercise faith but without study. We can often find ourselves just going around in circles. I think that the Holy Ghost cannot give us some answers until we are actively seeking knowledge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p7" pid="DB03K-AapUGw38N-KXhQHw" hash="JV2-PA">Think what great progress has been made in medicine by those who use both oars in their training. For example, Elder Russell M. Nelson, a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, used both oars in his former profession as a heart surgeon. With the trained skills of his hands, the knowledge stored in his mind from his study and his experience, and the faith in his heart that he would be sustained by the Holy Ghost as he operated, he has performed modern miracles that have spared the lives and prolonged the vigor and energy of so many people, including Presidents of the Church and many General Authorities. If he had relied only on faith, he still would have been a great man, but he would not have been a great surgeon. If he had relied only on study, he might have been a great surgeon, but I think there are many assignments that the Lord would not have entrusted to him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p8" pid="GTiW0tXY4US7TUKfIGiGiA" hash="OZ_Uaw">It is the same with us. Each woman needs to develop both gifts, the gift of faith and the gift of study, to the utmost of her capacity. We need to exercise both study and faith to become self-reliant. We need to understand their relationship to each other and to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p9" pid="wMj0ueI9r0GfyUVMsYsQAQ" hash="u9XkMA">There are many kinds of self-reliance. According to the Church’s welfare guidelines, <span class="emphasis">Providing in the Lord’s Way,</span> “as we work toward self-reliance, we should prepare ourselves in the following areas: education; health; employment; home storage; resource management; and social, emotional, and spiritual strength.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Let’s look at one aspect of self-reliance—employment—and see how learning by both study and faith relates to this topic.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p10" pid="HdiGcn9nykOrkBjK8B_0kw" hash="pGmzOg">We have faith in our prophets. They have counseled us that mothers with young children are especially needed at home. They remind us of the great needs of our children and their vulnerabilities during their growing years. The importance of the mother in building a secure, loving, stimulating environment in which children can grow up as healthy and self-reliant individuals is very important. The ideal family for raising children, we believe, is a stable, loving, two-parent family where young children receive full-time parenting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p11" pid="ctQrdp8cZUqQhOJ4WoMeQg" hash="cKpO3A">But not all situations are ideal. Not all women are mothers, and not all mothers have children at home. Furthermore, not all mothers can make the choice to be home with their children all of the time. Often circumstances constrain their choices. At other times, other responsibilities and opportunities require that difficult decisions be made. Women and families will be happier with these decisions if they are made using both study and faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p12" pid="mQAw9dM_vkmde5qESTKjgw" hash="RkHdng">Perhaps our study and faith may be resources for a searching sister, but let us never judge another. We do not know her circumstances.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p13" pid="wovzUTiF8k2zXYPn5KPrww" hash="ujZDLQ">We do not know what soul-searching went into her decisions. Whether she is a sister alone; whether she and her husband, if she is married, went jointly to the Lord for guidance; or whether she was responsible, largely alone, to make decisions about the financial and emotional security of her children, let us be accepting and supportive as sisters. Let us trust the Lord, trust ourselves, and trust each other that we are trying to do the best we can. We need all the strength we can find for our daily trials. Let us not add our disapproval to a sister’s burdens. And as we struggle with our own burdens, let us not diminish our strength by accepting the perhaps thoughtless judgments of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p14" pid="ZPiz3ewe2UG8v2arafIYyQ" hash="iD3U2A">Let our Relief Societies be supportive and sharing. We are all in the Relief Society boat, and it needs all of us to paddle just as hard as we can. Let us value everyone’s contributions. Let us not exclude a sister, whatever her life choices and whatever her circumstances. Let us express trust that she used both study and prayer in making her decisions, and provide a supportive environment in which she can carry out those decisions, evaluate them for their success, and modify them if necessary. If change is necessary or desirable, it will be easier in a nurturing, supportive atmosphere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p15" pid="bY9YGmD1QUy650Pz0vzCyw" hash="p9dMyw">Each year it becomes increasingly important for women to improve their abilities to take care of themselves and their children economically, if circumstances should require it. Elder Howard W. Hunter, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, addressed this point specifically in 1975: “There are impelling reasons for our sisters to plan toward employment also. We want them to obtain all the education and vocational training possible before marriage. If they become widowed or divorced and need to work, we want them to have dignified and rewarding employment. If a sister does not marry, she has every right to engage in a profession that allows her to magnify her talents and gifts.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> If anything, his counsel has become even more relevant in the almost twenty years that have passed as the national economy has made it increasingly difficult for one wage to support a family, as more mothers are left alone to raise their children, and as more women spend lengthy portions of their lives single. He is telling all of us to use the oar of study to prepare ourselves professionally for worthy and rewarding activities, including paid employment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p16" pid="Z5iHYggoC0GPovhmKnMgDg" hash="0pp5qg">But President Hunter’s example also shows us the importance of faith. He describes his first career as “glamorous in some respects”; however, it required him to associate with some people whose standards made him uncomfortable, so he changed to another line of work.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> This example shows that we should seek work in which we can be attended by the Spirit of the Lord. In other words, row, row, row your boat and use both oars!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p17" pid="Wf7sbZW4AUebvyRB8vl7YA" hash="c4XgrA">Learning by study was a very high priority in my family. My parents were plantation laborers on the “big island” of Hawaii. Both of them had been obliged to leave school at about the sixth grade. High school was out of the question for both of them, and college was an impossible dream. But they desperately desired an education for their children. Perhaps because I was their only child for five years, they dreamed that dream for me, even though it is unusual for a daughter to receive more advantages than a son in traditional Japanese families. They made many sacrifices so that I could go to high school and more so I could graduate from college. They did the same for my brothers with their chosen professions, although my brothers did not pursue academic interests. Neither one of my parents ever set foot on a college campus until my graduation. The only college graduate they knew socially was one teacher in our village.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p18" pid="Q5KZ1GGTUEifdUNE1pDyIw" hash="WzDkaA">But they gave me my tools, and they gave me trust. What do I mean by tools? They taught me to be curious, to ask questions, to observe nature closely, to watch people—especially in a new environment—to treat people respectfully and learn how to make connections with them, to work very hard, and to always do my best. They believed that no matter what I chose to do with my life, these skills would help me. And they were right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p19" pid="KcnJzkMBcEOv75-WFKKMKg" hash="1BEGkg">And what do I mean by trust? They sent me away to high school at age fifteen. They let me know in dozens of little ways that they trusted my decisions, trusted me to stay focused on my goal, and trusted me to lead an upright life. It is one of the great joys of my life that I did not disappoint my parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p20" pid="PYfzea8Su0q6wfJxRTYmfA" hash="gEi8Ug">Because I was willing to study the gospel of Jesus Christ, I became a member of the Church and developed great faith in the Savior. My faith gave me more strength to seek knowledge by study. I cannot separate learning by study and learning by faith. Both of them touch my heart, enlighten my mind, and encourage me in service.</p>

These oars have helped me row my professional boat, make a good marriage, raise my sons, and serve in the Church. I need them both as I strive for self-reliance. You need them both as you strive for self-reliance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/rowing-your-boat.p22" pid="z706XnjCBE6uBNA0oevajQ" hash="4Wcyeg">Peter’s last recorded words to the Saints of his day are counsel to “grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/3.18" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 3:18</a>), and King Benjamin urged his people to “grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.12" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:12</a>).</p>

Part of our mortal responsibility is to increase in learning and wisdom. We need to use the two oars of study and faith so that our boats will not be swamped by the storms of life. We need to teach our children to use these same oars. Let’s encourage them to value education and to increase in learning and wisdom through study and faith.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p2" pid="x9b0xxyL6E2Uk842zjD2Qg" hash="_hdfmg">This is a net, a fisherman’s net that my father, Kanenori Nishimura, made in Hawaii many years ago. It has been mine since he died thirty years ago, and I have cherished it for his sake. For me, that moment of casting the net is a supremely beautiful one. I loved seeing my father standing on a rocky point on the beach, the net close-gathered in his hands, then with a strong, graceful gesture, like a dancer, flinging the net up and out. It would unfold in flight, opening like a fan or an umbrella, then fall over the fish that were darting like silver arrows through the surf. The lead sinkers around the edge of the net would make it sink gently to the bottom, completely enclosing the fish.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p3" pid="xNr_Egh4NU617AIR-84OXg" hash="flCZmg">Then my father would jump down into the water and gather the net from the bottom, pulling the outer edges into his hands, until he had scooped it up like a bag. He would walk up on the beach holding the dripping net full of twisting fish in his arms, spread it out, quickly pick out the first for our supper and for the next day—very often a fish or two for several of our neighbors—then release the rest into the sea.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p4" pid="d0Y5_Py1206sVlgGiMwk1g" hash="HpOz5Q">I want to compare our sisterhood in the Relief Society to this net. Our living prophet is the net caster, directing the Relief Society in its mission. Then there are three ways in which the Relief Society itself functions as a net. First, every single person is important, just as every single strand is important. Second, a net needs to be tended. And third, the purpose of a net is to bring up abundance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p5" pid="Tv7oLV3bzEWlCKNCvZpuxw" hash="UNjCww">My father sorted out the fish that he wanted and put the rest back; but the gospel teaches us that each individual is a precious and cherished child of heavenly parents. We are literally all spiritual sisters. Each Relief Society should be a gathering of sisters who cherish each other, not choosing some to keep and throwing some back. All of us are worth keeping.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p6" pid="nJemrT5ZbkWQG-zdQCUEbA" hash="1L72sw">In the case of my father’s fish, the net took them out of their native element into alien air where they died. But the gospel brings us together in an environment where we experience some of the cherishing, the kindness, the love, the service, the instruction, and the watching over each other that give us glimpses of what heaven can be like. In fact, we are the fish, we are the net, and we are the fisher simultaneously.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p7" pid="YDQcYxI0mE2jJPCxfH9c2g" hash="4St7Mg">The second point about the net that holds true for our sisterhood is that it didn’t happen accidentally or spontaneously. It took work. My father <span class="emphasis">made</span> this net with his own hands. He bought the hard-twist, double-ply twine at our local general store. Then he spent many hours in the evenings after work and on weekends patiently working. He started with this square right here where it would become the middle of the net. Then he worked outward in a circle, patiently knotting these other squares of a size that he could just get his thumb through. At every corner, he made a square knot so that each square of the mesh was solid and strong. If one strand caught on a rock or ripped through because it was weak, the squares next to it would not unravel. They would hold strong and firm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p8" pid="iu3I3ZLoeU2LSAbHsZNOFQ" hash="Oh8yrQ">And every time my father used this net, he took care of it. When he got home, he would rinse it thoroughly in fresh water so that the salt water would not weaken and eat through the fibers. Then he would hang it on the fence, shaking out the folds carefully so that it would dry quickly and evenly. When it was dry, before he folded it up and put it away, he went over the net minutely, inspecting the mesh. If a knot seemed to be loosening or if a string was frayed, he repaired it immediately, before it became serious. A net like this would last for many years. It would stay strong because he always took care of it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p9" pid="3_84ZEAVqku5zyzQfoYNtw" hash="l2vL3w">This is also what happens when we cherish each other, watching over and taking care of each other. We can’t prevent rips and damage any more than my father could always keep the net away from rocks when he cast; but we can make sure that we tend and mend our own network, every time we use it, and every time there is damage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p10" pid="h15_h1uIh0SgVf_on7fdqw" hash="OLtBEA">Look around the room at the sisters who are watching the broadcast with you. You are a portion of the Church sisterhood—endowed with many strengths and blessings. These strengths include thousands of happy marriages, strong testimonies, partnership in the home with a worthy priesthood holder, children who are learning the gospel and loving it, thousands of hours of compassionate service willingly and sensitively rendered, vibrant testimonies of gospel principles, regular scripture study, concerned bishops and other priesthood leaders, opportunities to serve in ward and stake callings, and the blessing of hearing the inspired words of our beloved prophet, President Hinckley, especially on this occasion tonight. We all have a clear vision of the ideal, gospel-centered home; and the women in the Church work toward that ideal, yearn for it, pray for it, and rejoice in it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p11" pid="btgDdouJL0-YW95g-FLMfQ" hash="Nc3ljg">But mortality is designed as part of the gospel plan to bring us mingled experiences with good and evil, that we may learn from experience to make wise choices. And many of these experiences are painful. In most congregations of sisters, even in hearts and homes in apparently ideal circumstances, there are hidden heartaches and taxing challenges. At least some among you are survivors of abuse and other crimes of personal violence. Death or divorce can visit any home. Suffering comes from wasted potential, faltering faith, the decisions of a loved one who has used his or her free agency to make terrible choices that have wounded himself or herself and others. In your family, or in the family of someone close to you, is someone dealing with chronic mental, physical, or emotional illness; chemical dependency; financial insecurity; loneliness, sorrow, or discouragement? Many sisters are in second marriages, with the triple challenges of healing from the loss of a first marriage, working to build a strong second marriage, and compassionately providing part-time mothering to children of the husband’s earlier marriage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p12" pid="FltfyHa78UKdc_sjZxItww" hash="i96BKg">Every family, whether struggling with problems that seem perennial or whether blessed by ideal circumstances, is a valuable, cherished, and beloved family. The Savior wants you to succeed. Heavenly Father loves you. We love you. We pray that you may be strengthened, that you may receive the help you need, and that you may extend help to others in need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p13" pid="3HAIVRGda0G2gmqH00MX0A" hash="e-g1OA">The third point of comparison I want to stress is that our network, like my father’s net, is designed to bring you abundance—overflowing blessings, bounteous love, unimaginable grace. My father’s net was designed to be used from the beach, but remember that wonderful story in Luke when the Savior told Peter, after a night of fruitless effort, “Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/5.4" class="scriptureRef">Luke 5:4</a>). Do you remember what happened? The nets were filled with such an enormous number of fish that the nets were breaking. They called for help in hauling in the nets, and both boats almost swamped. The scriptural account doesn’t say what Jesus did while these amazed fishermen were making the catch of their life, but I imagine he watched, smiling.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p14" pid="ZF8E3BaE90C92NGo_-l0Ig" hash="fmDmYA">You know, the great thing about a beach is all the activity there. You can see people sunning themselves or playing volleyball or having barbecues. You can see crabs scuttling sideways on their fragile little legs and sea anemones blooming in tide pools. You can see gulls following the cresting waves to see if any fish become visible for a second. In other words, you can spend your whole life on the beach and it would always be beautiful and interesting and exciting because interesting, beautiful, and exciting things are going on all the time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p15" pid="juhISpfJkkel0PjOEa5Y0Q" hash="gZEwpQ">But the Savior wants us to pull for the deep, to launch into the deep water, because he has treasures for us that simply don’t exist and can’t exist in the sand, the froth, and the constant activity of the beach. The Savior says, “If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things—that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.61" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:61</a>). And the experience of Peter, James, and John tells us that we need partners in pulling in this abundance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p16" pid="yk9PXCMaIEqQcQ020KWXwQ" hash="pMotmA">But as Psalm 42:7 [<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/42.7" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 42:7</a>] says, “deep calleth unto deep.” The deeps are not just the deep knowledge of the gospel but also the deeps in you. I hope you have a beach part of your personality where there’s a lot of scrambling and laughing and sunning. But I hope there’s also a part of you that wants to leave the shallow, sandy self and go into the deep. And sometimes, even when we do not want to, powerful currents of mortality carry us into the deeps—into the deeps of sorrow and suffering and soul-searching. There in the deeps, we discover who we really are and who the Savior really is.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p17" pid="0WWIn9xwFUmChg4VwkkLkA" hash="ktNqcA">Sisters, we in the Relief Society presidency are mindful of the burdens that you carry. We pray in every meeting that each of you will be strengthened as individuals so that you can, in turn, provide strength to family members, friends, your wards, and your communities. We thrill to your gallant courage and cheerfulness. We sorrow with your pain. We are humbled by your faith. And we are nourished by your love. Share your courage, your faith, and your love with each other. Strengthen yourselves and strengthen each other. Weave a living network.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p18" pid="NptbHitQ4kiPN78VyTYtiw" hash="KiB0jg">Everyone has days when it is possible to carry the burden; there are other days when the burden seems to have a crushing weight. Some of you already know the enormous strength that comes from sharing your burdens with someone else who cares for you. Some of you are trying to carry these burdens alone or are struggling with the even heavier burden of denial and pretense that there is no burden.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p19" pid="-2JiW3KVyEiwDzhct0OeyA" hash="oM0G6Q">Please, sisters, recognize that no one can carry your burdens for you except the Savior, but also recognize that each one of us can make a burden lighter by sharing it. Please, don’t try to carry your burdens alone, and don’t make a sister do it alone. Recognize that we are here in mortality as a free choice to have experiences with both joy and sorrow. There is a line of appropriateness between sharing your sorrow and broadcasting complaints. I ask you to be sensitive to the struggles of your sisters, to offer a hand to lift a burden where you can, to be a listening ear when speaking will ease an overburdened heart, to seek that compassionate friend who will understand and reassure and strengthen you at times that are difficult for you. In this way, we tend our nets, strengthen each strand, and keep our sisterhood whole, healthy, and healing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p20" pid="4WZxWPzex0SEEKp5Ajl72w" hash="mk8lEg">Sisters, in conclusion, remember my father’s net and build a living network in your Relief Societies. All family situations take courage, faith, and love. Our relationships as parents and children are based on deeper, older relationships as eternal brothers and sisters, children of a Heavenly Father who loves us and watches over us and yearns that our faith may increase, that our courage may uplift others, and that we may enfold others in our love as he enfolds us in his. In the words of the Apostle Paul:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p21" pid="FH5okGvsykygoCTHEk_YQA" hash="DwWmxQ">“The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all … even as we do toward you:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-living-network.p23" pid="1Rg4cwuqGUCNkD7yEOVOtA" hash="xthUuQ">So may it be, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In February, I rejoiced with you when the number of members outside the United States edged ever so slightly past the number of members inside the United States. That slight shift is an important symbol of the international nature of the Church. I thought of Paul’s statement to the Galatians: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/3.28" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 3:28</a>). This week I celebrate the 54th anniversary of my baptism. People like me who are converts know the promise of Paul: “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 12:13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/baskets-and-bottles.p2" pid="uM9MA9Tl5kGqyAK10movkQ" hash="p6HJiA">Brothers and sisters, today I want to talk about the beautiful oneness that we share in the gospel. I just returned from the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, and Fiji three weeks ago, where Sister Susan Warner and I participated in leadership training. Earlier assignments have taken me to Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Samoa, Korea, and Japan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/baskets-and-bottles.p3" pid="avHl07FBo0-gxVx03yNpvQ" hash="mqi-Gg">In all these places we worked hard and long. People have said, “Oh, you must have been so tired.” On the contrary, there was a feeling of being borne up “as on eagles’ wings” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:18</a>), because we have seen the daughters of Zion “awake, and arise … and put on [their] beautiful garments” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.31" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:31</a>) in response to the good news of the gospel. We taught but—and this is the point I want to stress—we also learned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/baskets-and-bottles.p4" pid="9tAQ0jDpJEevouuB2u_YwQ" hash="ih-vwQ">The most important lesson was that we are truly all one in Christ Jesus. We are one in our love of the Savior. We are one in our testimonies of the gospel. We are one in faith, hope, and charity. We are one in our conviction that the Book of Mormon is the inspired word of God. We are one in supporting President Hinckley and the other General Authorities. We are one in loving each other.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/baskets-and-bottles.p5" pid="vCQYqqqfWEOQL0pkraohBg" hash="OtVK6w">Are we perfect in any of these things? No. We all have much to learn. Are we exactly the same in any of these things? No. We are all at different points on our journey back to our Father in Heaven. Did the Jews and Greeks whom Paul addressed in his epistle to the Galatians stop being Jews and Greeks when they were baptized? Did the men stop being men and the women stop being women? No. But they had all “been baptized into Christ” and had “put on Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/3.27" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 3:27</a>).</p>

Our challenge as members of the Church is for all of us to learn from each other, that we may all love each other and grow together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/baskets-and-bottles.p8" pid="5URfVYPP4UOgDcNKHD7pqg" hash="OqnWiA">The doctrines of the gospel are indispensable. They are essential, but the packaging is optional. Let me share a simple example to show the difference between the doctrines of the Church and the cultural packaging. Here is a bottle of Utah peaches, prepared by a Utah homemaker to feed her family during a snowy season. Hawaiian homemakers don’t bottle fruit. They pick enough fruit for a few days and store it in baskets like this for their families. This basket contains a mango, bananas, a pineapple, and a papaya. I bought these fruits in a supermarket in Salt Lake City, but they might have been picked by a Polynesian homemaker to feed her family in a climate where fruit ripens all year round.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/baskets-and-bottles.p9" pid="ugS9nZpTa0C-o-nGOrK5MQ" hash="mjgI8Q">The basket and the bottle are different containers, but the content is the same: fruit for a family. Is the bottle right and the basket wrong? No, they are both right. They are containers appropriate to the culture and the needs of the people. And they are both appropriate for the content they carry, which is the fruit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/baskets-and-bottles.p10" pid="bN-gl5WTl0eveGXRq090yg" hash="xSlGIg">Now, what is the fruit? Paul tells us: “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, [and] temperance” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/5.22-23" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 5:22–23</a>). In the sisterhood of Relief Society, in the brotherhood of priesthood quorums, in the reverent coming together to partake of the sacrament, the fruit of the Spirit unites us in love, joy, and peace whether the Relief Society is in Taipei or Tonga, whether the priesthood quorum is in Montana or Mexico, and whether the sacrament meeting is in Fiji or the Philippines.</p>

Our unity grows from what we have in common all around the world. They are the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel, our faith in the Savior, our testimonies of the scriptures, our gratitude for guidance from living prophets, and our sense of ourselves as a people striving to be Saints. These are the principles of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/baskets-and-bottles.p12" pid="cVny3Bwzo0WYFN7Vb0dS1w" hash="RrdplA">Let us be sensitive to the unchanging and powerful core principles of the gospel. Let us understand that they matter most. Let us build firm foundations on these principles.

I have learned from all of them. I have learned from divorced mothers who are struggling to raise their children alone. I have learned from women who long to be married but are not, from women who yearn for children but cannot bear them, from women who are at risk from emotional and physical abuse in their homes. I have learned from women who work in their homes and women who work outside their homes. I have learned from women who endure chemical dependencies, experiences of childhood sexual abuse, and chronic illness.</p>

You will be recognized as one who represents those beyond the borders of the United States and Canada and, as it were, an outreach across the world to members of the Church in many, many lands. They will see in you a representation of their oneness with the Church.” He gave me a blessing that my tongue might be loosed as I spoke to the people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/baskets-and-bottles.p17" pid="jnExydR-_kyqG84wLge4hw" hash="7H0yeA">President Hinckley, I want to bear witness to the Lord before you and this congregation that your counsel and your blessing have been literally fulfilled.</p>

But when I received my assignment to go among the Relief Society sisters and their priesthood leaders in lands where those languages were spoken, I was filled with a great desire to speak to them in their own language. I drew strength from President Hinckley’s words of comfort and blessing. With the help of the Church Translation Department and good coaches who spent hours working with me, I was blessed to deliver my addresses in Spanish, Korean, and Tongan as I went among those people. I could feel the Spirit carrying my words to their hearts, and I could feel “the fruit of the Spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/5.22" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 5:22</a>) bringing back to me their love, their joy, and their faith. I could feel the Spirit making us one.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p2" pid="epivsVjz3kuWwmcEFhcrmA" hash="6ytg1w">The sisterhood of the Relief Society, as it embodies these virtues, will help us lift and strengthen one another with love, testimony, faith, and service to each other. I think of hope as a modest but very tough everyday virtue, an ordinary but resilient virtue that is both gentle and beautiful. It is an unassuming but powerful force for good that will greatly increase our ability to do good and to be good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p3" pid="f0zx7w9zfUOrdweSVFNI6w" hash="l6bVuQ">Let me compare it to this ingenious fan-hat that was given to me in Tonga as a present from the Relief Societies when I was visiting the stakes there earlier this year. If it’s hot and muggy, you can use this fan to provide a cooling breeze, and its curved ribs provide an even greater current of air than a flat fan. But if it should start to rain, the fan can quickly become a hat and provide shelter from the storm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p4" pid="AXEwqkWYMEmMqpI85pkH4g" hash="KvbuwA">In much the same way, hope is a virtue for all seasons and all adversities, whether the problem is a storm or too much pleasant weather.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p5" pid="uNHanjJF2kWF4Jx-QaZ_Tg" hash="pS088g">What is the opposite of hope? Despair, of course, but despair comes when we feel powerless to influence events and when the sources of meaning in our life disappear. Despair is a kind of disorientation so profound that we lose contact with the sources of life itself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p6" pid="qp7qfZu2xEmEQD0wMtzk5A" hash="mb_6lg">I’m not a very good gardener (my husband, Ed, was the one who enjoyed that part of our home), and I recently noticed that a carelessly placed brick had squashed a pansy flat. But part of the pansy was still peeking out from under the edge of the brick; and over the next few weeks, that pansy put its energies into creeping sideways around the edge of the brick, pushing its short shoots into the air and sunlight, and blossoming in its friendly purple and gold. When I moved the brick, the pansy’s stem was crooked; but, oh, its flower was as glorious as those next to it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p7" pid="1VyE8qu2pk2he4KsfK1uAQ" hash="KNeP0g">This pansy chose life. It experienced adversity, but it chose life. It experienced crippling, but it chose life. It could not have been blamed or faulted for giving up under the brick, but it chose life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p8" pid="_w1bLBcfAEasfp0W21jt3w" hash="xvk5DA">Sisters, the sources of hope are the sources of life itself. That’s why hope persists, even when experience, reason, and knowledge all say there is no reason to hope. Hope does not calculate odds. It is a double-sided virtue. Like this fan-hat, it is prepared for either sunny or stormy weather. To choose hope is to choose life. To choose hope is to choose love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p9" pid="IuxqwWPFjkKn6Fvix1xvpQ" hash="kPGJ0Q">The Lord told the ancient Israelites, after giving them the laws and commandments of Deuteronomy: “I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore <span class="emphasis">choose life,</span> that both thou and thy seed may live:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p10" pid="VxzH1IWUMUGZKUdImmW9Vg" hash="iuWtEg">“That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/30.19-20" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 30:19–20</a>; emphasis added).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p11" pid="POBKUCLwNEeRp25S44brGg" hash="9wJeGQ">Why is this so? Why is hope so intimately tangled with the roots of life itself? The Book of Mormon tells us that we are “free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all … might be miserable like unto himself” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p12" pid="U68phznYfES9DMdnrIsdHg" hash="FdjKkw">Hope is one of the three great Christian virtues because Christ Himself is the master of life and therefore the master of hope. We are free to choose because we were made free from the beginning, and He honors our agency and our right and ability to choose. The choice He offers is life, and life offers hope. Any other choice is a choice of spiritual death that will bring us into the power of the devil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p13" pid="ruYbTioMiU2PA676SRKLXA" hash="e-bsDw">And now, I hope it is clearer why part of that hope in Christ is hope in the future, a future that includes resurrection and salvation and exaltation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p14" pid="Ypw19Jhw1UWaKspeZ8WGJA" hash="kJZd_Q">Paul explained to the Romans that Christ submitted Himself to death but, “being raised from the dead[,] dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 6:9</a>). Jesus Christ, our Savior, has always been the master of life, but through His atoning sacrifice, He also became the master over death. Physical death has no dominion over Him; and ultimately, it has no dominion over us because of Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p15" pid="VI2yWh9j-k-z3xbRgm1Qfg" hash="XhniMg">Think what this means! Because of our Savior’s victory, we too can be victorious. In the face of this good news, this triumphant shout from the battlefield of ultimate victory, then we can see why our everyday sacrifices, our ordinary hope, is so tough, so versatile, so difficult to turn into meaninglessness and despair.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p16" pid="ffNUT11Rf0OzmA8TYfkT9Q" hash="OKYifA">In fact, it cannot happen—we literally cannot despair—unless we choose to. But because we are mortal, death is entangled with life. We can choose to feed the darkness and death in our lives, or we can choose to feed the brightness of hope in our lives. We can worry. We can deny the light. We can refuse to ally ourselves with Jesus Christ, the already triumphant master of life. We can give our lives piece by piece into captivity until we no longer have the power to wrench it away again. We can cooperate with the killing of our spirits and the strangling of our hopes until meaninglessness and despair overcome us. The death of the body is nothing—for Christ’s Resurrection guarantees our own—but He cannot rescue us from the death of the spirit unless we choose to ally ourselves with Him, with His hope, with the inexhaustible and irrepressible life that is His.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p17" pid="Ek0WFUAnikmbL1tTRYCraw" hash="duCftg">But sisters, I testify that the forces of life are <span class="emphasis">always</span> stronger than the forces of death. If we choose, if we even desire to choose, if we even hope for the desire to choose, we set in motion powerful forces for life that are led by Jesus Christ himself. He responds to those tender tendrils of crippled life with the force and energy that will bring them to flowering. Listen to these promises of love and yearning desire for us. Feel the hope they bring that with Him we can overcome the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p18" pid="iJShGfYCpUmOOqLcvZtpFw" hash="5torfQ">“I am the door,” He said. “By me if any [one] enter in, he shall be saved.” In contrast to the thief of life, which He says is come only to steal, and to kill, and to destroy, Jesus “[is] come that [we] might have life, and that [we] might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd,” He assures us. “The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.9-11" class="scriptureRef">John 10:9–11</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p23" pid="dsk27wg6N0qqCfhEDPDgPg" hash="cjYJfA">And in our own day, Jesus Christ spoke through Joseph Smith to us all: “And as I said unto mine apostles, even so I say unto you, … ye are they whom my Father hath given me; ye are my friends” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.63" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:63</a>). And “[ye] shall be mine in that day when I shall come to make up my jewels” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/raised-in-hope.p24" pid="_zJQF8n1FEu_HPTPGi7cuA" hash="pNzsug">Oh sisters, dearest sisters, choose life even though the forces of death seem strong! Choose hope even though despair seems close! Choose to grow even though circumstances oppress you! Choose to learn even though you must struggle against your own ignorance and that of others! Choose to love, even though ours are days of violence and vengeance. Choose to forgive, to pray, to bless another’s life with simple kindness. Choose to build the sisterhood of the Relief Society by lifting and strengthening one another with love, testimony, faith, and service. I promise that you will feel the abundant love of the Savior.</p>
