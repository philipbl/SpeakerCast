      <title>Increase in Faith</title>
      <link>http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith?lang=eng</link>
      <description>Three of my granddaughters are young women. They think it’s amazing that I can actually remember when I was their age. I really do remember many things—some hard things and some really good things. I especially remember a time when I was very happy. </description>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p1" pid="I0kHB45_8EeCetScsVvfnA" hash="K6Sf1w">Three of my granddaughters are young women. They think it’s amazing that I can actually remember when I was their age. I really do remember many things—some hard things and some really good things. I especially remember a time when I was very happy. I was seventeen years old. My friends and I went to a fireside where the speaker taught us about our Savior’s love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p2" pid="5As78HXiG0KbjECNNUIsQQ" hash="bnpQzg">He told us that we could have confidence in the Savior, that He would lead us, that He would be there for us, that our faith in Him could increase and we could feel greater happiness than we had ever known.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p3" pid="wd8UJnAr_Um7Bn0_9t63lw" hash="YfrKQw">But we needed to participate. We needed to do something. We needed to choose to believe in the Savior and His love; we needed to ask for His help, and then we needed to practice thinking about Him all through the day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p4" pid="llxfgbnw4EG1yCvx04wjvQ" hash="r9Ohiw">The speaker suggested that to help us remember to think about the Savior, we could listen to the school bell that rang often during the day. Each time we heard the bell, we were to say a silent prayer, even with our eyes open, even walking down the hall. We could thank our Heavenly Father for our blessings, especially for our Savior. We could tell Him of our love and ask for His help. He taught us that in just a few seconds, many times during the day, we could practice thinking about our Heavenly Father and Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p5" pid="vNFuST3-hki-vWC4Hk4gAA" hash="33-6xw">There was something else: the speaker suggested that almost immediately we move from praying about ourselves to praying for someone else—a friend, a teacher, a stranger—and asking Heavenly Father to bless that person.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p6" pid="HaFPU-9f-0-FH-6c3FdHVQ" hash="f9JNBg">He also warned us that all of this might seem awkward at first but that if we chose to try, we could truly be filled with His love, our faith really would grow, and we would feel joy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p7" pid="nHJlDadKH0epIyslrKwD6A" hash="ShTssQ">That sounded wonderful to me. I decided to try. I could not believe how many times the bell rang each day. When I heard it, I stopped. “Heavenly Father, thank you. Please bless me and bless Dorene. I know she’s having struggles.” It was awkward at first, but soon I found myself thinking about my Heavenly Father and Savior, not only when the bell rang but many times during the day. I remember walking across a muddy field one morning and seeing a tiny yellow flower. It was probably a weed, but to me it was beautiful, and I felt that He had created it just for me. I loved Him so much. My faith had increased, and I was happy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p8" pid="AVJv3c2x7UCxro7Csfr4SQ" hash="d2IS1Q">Choosing to increase our faith in the Savior isn’t easy. It takes work, but the feelings inside of peace and joy and love are worth all our efforts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p9" pid="QG1NKwy1qE62IK3_cZc4Uw" hash="QuI9EA">Sometimes when we try hard to make changes—good changes—we have a lot of distractions and obstacles. One of my favorite scripture stories is about Peter. As I read this story to you, think about Peter and what happened when he was distracted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p10" pid="lJ35A75GzkilHF6FBtPnyw" hash="wUzI-Q">Jesus and His disciples had just finished feeding five thousand people with five loaves of bread and two fishes.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p13" pid="qNevN-Kn8ka0YGvJo_lZ8w" hash="wj1xYA">“And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p14" pid="6ysw3KBT5UyXpVs2bw9C5A" hash="9K_dFw">“And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p18" pid="IU4JKyUabUuRGtl_lPpnYQ" hash="Urylsw">“But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p19" pid="JCK0Huc630m-s_2Bp2PiSA" hash="f2CD1Q">“And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/14.22-31" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 14:22–31</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p20" pid="GM4F072Ks0SC3oxu1CHqlg" hash="SRXLZw">I think that’s a wonderful story.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p21" pid="-VCSVvNL1Um7cGvjj_9Hzw" hash="jC1fQw">Peter chose to believe in Jesus. He asked Jesus if he could come to Him, and he really did walk on the water. But when he began to pay more attention to what was happening around him, “the wind boisterous,” he began to sink.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p22" pid="GIvq8jI4zUKTHQSH-JSPqg" hash="V61zgQ">What are the winds boisterous in our lives? What are the things that distract us from the Savior, that turn our hearts and our minds away from Him? It may be thinking more about pleasing our friends or other people than we do about pleasing God (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.44" class="scriptureRef">John 5:44</a>). It may be the loud and confusing voices we hear on TV, in videos, in music. Sometimes we just don’t care. Our hearts are hard (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/12.37" class="scriptureRef">John 12:37</a>). There will always be distractions, winds boisterous, but if we choose to turn to the Lord, to believe in Him, to follow Him, we can increase our faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p23" pid="59slVxjWGUGL3pU6cpBTWQ" hash="SWOlFg">When Peter began to sink, he turned to the Lord and cried out, “Lord, save me,” and Jesus immediately “stretched forth his hand, and caught him.” He will do that for you. He will do that for each one of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p24" pid="zsEMfQg55UaJLOL1rEp2ug" hash="hJ3R5Q">What can we do to turn to the Savior? What can we do to increase our faith in Him? There are many things we can do. I have chosen just three:</p>
      <div class="figure" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.f2">
	<ul class="bullet">
	  <li pid="wXZMi-wGYE22bkkQ3Ue53A" hash="kgZJiw">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="U7yQydMC3Uy_xjUL79O-Rw" hash="AWt9_A">We can choose to believe.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="Phhg0qKqwk2NK52IS3WpMA" hash="xRtzOA">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="8OQptxj93kiOINUyaXW9kg" hash="rF37Vw">We can ask for help, then listen.</p>

          <p pid="sZQe_zrhXEagEwEhYcb-ZQ" hash="KldDtQ">We can practice turning to Him.</p>
        </li>
	</ul>
      </div>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p25" pid="39jJBNkokUqCViZqpww6-g" hash="_wVL6A">In the scriptures it says, “But without faith it is impossible to please him”; and to please him we must “believe that he is” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.6" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p26" pid="phOjImmCcEypWwJn5kbi3g" hash="wiQfLw">Choosing to believe is an important step in increasing our faith in the Savior. It has to be our choice. No one can make that choice for you. If I stand in front of a mirror and look myself in the eye and say, “I choose to believe in the Savior,” that helps me; then whenever I look in a mirror it reminds me of my choice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p27" pid="gHLlW3YCeEq6l3PBXNjLCQ" hash="_5iKpA">Another thing we can do is to ask for help, then listen. Our Father and Savior want us to have more faith. Faith is a gift, but it must be sought after. We can seek after faith by asking for more faith in our prayers. Could we say, “Heavenly Father, please help me have more faith”?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p28" pid="ZWKqMv6c1UaLBU2k1moo5Q" hash="ZYDIiQ">Harder than asking is listening. We can listen in our hearts and hear Their voice. We can listen in the scriptures and hear Their word. We can listen to our prophet and leaders and hear their testimonies of faith. We can increase our faith by “hearing … the word of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/10.17" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 10:17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p29" pid="pyCd6NkJ90i-_VTLe4Bh1A" hash="chI-hg">And third, we can remember to practice—practice turning to Him, practice thinking about Him. Increasing our faith does take more than choosing to believe and asking. It takes some kind of physical and mental action. It takes practice, diligence, and patience, and it takes obedience. We must be “doers of the word, … not hearers only” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.22" class="scriptureRef">James 1:22</a>). We can practice living righteously by turning to Him, by thinking about Him, by following Him. And then we must help Him with His work by helping others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p30" pid="goc0Drq-TkO8u4SErPmcyg" hash="46et4g">A bell helped me think about the Savior. Do you have bells in your life?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p31" pid="wol-_vx-c0S3vClFGZhjEg" hash="rBM5QA">A penny in my husband’s shoe reminded him that he truly was Heavenly Father’s little boy. A penny in your shoe could remind you—ouch—“Thank you, Heavenly Father. I do remember. I do love you and my Savior. I will think about you and follow you.” It really makes no difference what we use to help us remember to think about our Savior. What is important is that we try.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/increase-in-faith.p32" pid="-FODUE32gEacPEafQ4eufg" hash="GrCwAw">I sense the tender feelings in your hearts. I feel that too. I believe we want to follow Him, to trust Him, to please Him, to live righteously, to increase our faith in Him. I believe we can do that as we choose to believe, ask and listen, and practice, and practice, and practice. My testimony is that He loves us so much, that He understands, and that His light will comfort us and guide us as we come unto Him. I love you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/teach-the-children.p3" pid="cqmPyjlJDUiFzZNcbrgX5w" hash="rxgkyg">Several years ago while my husband, Ed, and I were serving in the England London South Mission, there was an unexpected storm. All night the winds raged. When morning came we ventured from the mission home to see the damage. It was devastating. Many trees throughout our garden, the neighborhood, and all of southern England had been uprooted. It was amazing to see the fallen trees with their gigantic root systems, still intact, jutting into the air. I came to the conclusion that because of the “easiness of the way” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.46" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:46</a>)—rain is plentiful in England—the trees had no need to sink their roots deep into the earth to get the nourishment they needed. Their roots were not strong enough or deep enough to withstand the hurricane-force winds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/teach-the-children.p4" pid="qPY2DTjFTEyTP7k5HFhXkw" hash="gcIlRA">On the other hand, the giant redwood trees that grow in northern California also have a very shallow root system. But when they are surrounded by other redwood trees, the strongest, fiercest wind cannot blow them over. The roots of the giant redwood trees intertwine and strengthen each other. When a storm comes, they actually hold each other up.</p>

To my father, who is soon to be eighty-nine years old and is living with us, thank you, Dad. Thank you for teaching me as the scriptures counsel, “only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; … [yes,] reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41,43" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:41, 43</a>).</p>

Thirteen of our seventeen grandchildren are Primary and pre-Primary age. They will help teach me about Primary and children. They can be my hands-on training.

My deep gratitude to President Janette C. Hales, the Young Women presidency, board, and staff who have shared their wisdom and insights, who have more than loved and supported me these last two years. To Michaelene Grassli, Betty Jo Jepsen, Ruth Wright, and the Primary board, thank you for your devotion and untiring efforts to encourage all members of the Church to focus on what is best for the children.</p>

That is one of my most vivid Primary memories. I remember being very nervous. I remember making many mistakes. But I remember even more clearly that the Primary leaders cared more about me than about the mistakes I made.</p>

And then he said, “Who will teach the children?” That thought will not leave my mind or my heart. Who will teach the children? Who will teach the child who asks, “Will Heavenly Father really answer my prayer?” Who will teach Kate when at five years of age she asks, “Why do we need Jesus?” Who will teach the children? Please, will you? Will you? Will you help teach the children?</p>

I watched the father sitting on top of the wall standing guard. The mother was busy keeping her 10 precious babies together and seemed to be demonstrating how to peck in the earth for food. I was fascinated. I carefully and quietly walked closer. All too soon I was detected by the watchful father, and he let out a warning call. The mother tried to guide the children around the wall to safety, but I—the danger—was too near, and she became frustrated and confused and flew up on the wall by the father. I didn’t want to harm this family, so I quickly retreated out of sight.</p>

Satan rejoices in our confusion and frustration, and his influences surround us. We turn on the television—is this a family show? We hear something coming out of our child’s room—is this music? We try to pick a movie—did this one really have an acceptable rating?</p>

I have asked myself these questions: Do I leave my children exposed to danger when I don’t teach them the truths of the gospel? Do I neglect their souls when I don’t help them recognize the promptings of the Spirit and the guidance they can receive? Do I leave my children exposed to danger when my example is not the same as my words or when I don’t share my love in such a way that each child feels it deeply?</p>

Our Father has blessings and eternal rewards available for each of His children, whether they are married or single, parents or childless. Our circumstances may be different, our opportunities may be varied, but the end result of our righteousness can be the same—eternal parenthood, eternal lives. Helping to care for the souls of children will help each of us prepare for this eternal blessing.</p>

I believe that seriously studying how our Father cares for His children can help us. Everything we know about our Heavenly Father is connected with His parenthood and His loving care for our souls. He loves each of His children unconditionally. We can do the same in our families. His plan of happiness is a plan to help His children progress and be prepared to receive His greatest blessings. We can make plans to help our families progress. He included His children in the great Heavenly Council and allowed us to participate and use our agency to choose. We can have family councils and include our children as active participants. Under His guidance, this earth was prepared as a place where we could learn and grow. Our homes can be happy places where our children can learn and grow. He has given His children rules of conduct and commandments that keep us moving forward, focused on the path that leads to our heavenly home. The rules of conduct in our family can help us move forward on the path back to our Heavenly Father.</p>

We were able to come home to Utah for his funeral, and then we immediately returned to England to finish our mission. It was a very tender time for our entire family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p5" pid="7vZRQXHZ80qMTNvM21mxxQ" hash="5grFvw">One day, shortly after returning to England, I was walking down the street and an acquaintance who had heard of the death of our son said to me: “Well, what do you think of your God now? You are serving a full-time mission for Him, and He has taken your son.” I was both shocked and hurt. I felt so sorry for this person who did not understand Heavenly Father’s plan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p6" pid="UuFZDcuO5k2Fn1xWLcSkdQ" hash="27Uwmw">The difficult experience of my son’s death helped me identify and rejoice in the blessings of peace, hope, and direction—blessings that all who truly accept and live the gospel of Jesus Christ may enjoy. I can bear witness to the words of Elder Richard G. Scott: “Please learn that as you wrestle with a challenge and feel sadness because of it, you can simultaneously have peace and rejoicing” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1995, 20; or <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 17).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p8" pid="6QC9x0hr50i75jLwzjF-Rg" hash="PSjNoA">First, we must have complete trust in our Father’s plan of happiness and our Savior’s part in that plan. Trusting in His plan gave me peace during the time following our son’s death. I knew where our son was, and I knew Heavenly Father loved him. I had a perfect hope that because of the Savior’s Atonement Cory lived and we would be together again as an eternal family. I also had direction. I knew what I needed to do and what our family needed to do to be together forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p9" pid="GpCO2sZU0EaBCWELNwtpxw" hash="J_8uqw">The second thing that has helped me receive these blessings is the principle of courageous obedience. I am so grateful for God’s gift of laws and commandments. Peace, hope, and direction are outcomes of striving to live the teachings of Jesus and obeying His laws and commandments. The scriptures teach, “Great peace have they which love thy law” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/119.165" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 119:165</a>). They also teach that “he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:23</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p10" pid="s1Gv3K9qa02T1I1Ny_hrjw" hash="jrclqw">While Brother Pinegar served as president of the Provo Missionary Training Center, as you can imagine, we often talked to the missionaries about the feelings of happiness and peace that accompany courageous obedience to true principles. We talked of the influence of the Holy Ghost that comes to those who are obedient. We encouraged the missionaries to make obedience their quest. I enjoyed telling them the story of the little boy who went to the park with his father to fly a kite.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p11" pid="t0F1SmojtUCHp7g26Ut6-Q" hash="TlMEdg">The boy was very young. It was his first experience with kite flying. His father helped him, and after several attempts the kite was in the air. The boy ran and let out more string, and soon the kite was flying high. The little boy was so excited; the kite was beautiful. Eventually there was no more string left to allow the kite to go higher. The boy said to his father, “Daddy, let’s cut the string and let the kite go; I want to see it go higher and higher.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p12" pid="Y-bOAhyNqk6Y8mDE7KLCnw" hash="RmIs7g">His father said, “Son, the kite won’t go higher if we cut the string.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p13" pid="RxdjveCqPkCB-y88koQxnw" hash="iDy2ow">“Yes, it will,” responded the little boy. “The string is holding the kite down; I can feel it.” The father handed a pocketknife to his son. The boy cut the string. In a matter of seconds the kite was out of control. It darted here and there and finally landed in a broken heap. That was difficult for the boy to understand.

Grandma is 99 and very frail. She is blind and quite deaf, and recently it has become difficult for her to talk in more than a whisper. Her little body is so bent over that there is not much room in her lungs for air.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p17" pid="V8MxBHE4oUG7ZeYov-7xHQ" hash="tVChCg">I leaned close to her and asked, “Grandma, tell me how the gospel has blessed your life.” She whispered softly and shared her gratitude for the promptings and guidance she had received from the Holy Ghost.</p>

Suddenly, she couldn’t see him and ran from the house calling and searching frantically. There was water in the irrigation ditch that shouldn’t have been there, and she searched along the edge of the ditch and could see nothing. She ran for the hired hands to come and help and ran back to where the ditch went through a long culvert. Running to the other end of the culvert, she saw two little shoes, and pulled on them. When she had her son in her arms, she was prompted to clasp her hands together and place them under his stomach and carry him in front of her in this way, using her knee to hold some of his weight. She ran toward the road crying for help. The promptings she received to carry him in such an unnatural manner saved his life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p19" pid="CVDylav3oUaz1XAYjQ7teg" hash="VNBZsw">Brothers and sisters, I am personally grateful for the promptings we received as a Primary presidency. During the general conference when we were sustained, President Gordon B. Hinckley described some of the terrible atrocities that have been inflicted on children throughout the world. We read in newspapers and periodicals of the evil influences that are invading our homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/peace-hope-and-direction.p20" pid="9RBjwt_9EkyoOD1GE85M1A" hash="3r9LCQ">As a new and very concerned Primary presidency, we prayed and searched the scriptures and were led to a verse in Isaiah that describes conditions during the Millennium: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/11.9" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 11:9</a>). That was exactly what we wanted to have happen. We didn’t want any child to be hurt or destroyed, but we didn’t want to wait for the Millennium. We wanted that to happen right now. If our Primaries were full of the knowledge of the Lord, if our homes were full of the knowledge of the Lord, there would be peace and righteousness and the children would not be hurt in any way. We prayed to know how we could help that happen and were led to 2 Nephi 25:26 [<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:26</a>]. Our homes and our Primaries will be full of the knowledge of the Lord when “we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ.”</p>

When we experience these great blessings in our own lives, let us help others experience them also, especially the children. To paraphrase the words of the Savior, “And when thou art converted, strengthen [your children]” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:32</a>).</p>

The world is not a safe place. It is not a place where children will feel peace, hope, and direction unless they are taught to love and follow the Savior. Please help them know that these great blessings can be theirs, and show them what they need to do to receive these blessings.</p>

I love my counselors, Sister Anne Wirthlin and Sister Susan Warner. We have been one in our desire to serve and bless the children of the Church. We believe that Christ-centered Primaries can help parents as they teach their children the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the only knowledge that will give our children peace, hope, and direction. I am grateful to our faithful, dedicated board members and capable office staff and thank our priesthood leaders who have taught and inspired us. I am grateful for the new Primary presidency sustained at this conference. I offer them my love and support. My most sincere thanks and love go to my precious family and especially to my sweetheart for his unfailing love and support.</p>

The blessings of peace, hope, and direction that I have identified are only three of the many ways my life is blessed because of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As expressed in the words of a Primary song, I want the Savior to know that I feel His love</p>
