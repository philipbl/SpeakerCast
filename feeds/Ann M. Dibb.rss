        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="79"></span>A number of years ago, a one-inch article in my local newspaper caught my attention, and I have remembered it ever since: “Four people were killed and seven workers were rescued after clinging for more than an hour to the underside of a 125-foot-high [38-m] bridge in St. Catharines, Ontario, [Canada,] after the scaffolding they were working on collapsed” (“News Capsules,” <span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> June 9, 1993, A2).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p2" pid="wwDsNAGUYE-Lxe7FSJ9oKA" hash="xhfiOA">I was, and I continue to be, fascinated by this brief story. Shortly after reading this account, I called a family friend who lived in St. Catharines. She explained that the workers had been painting the Garden City Skyway bridge for about a year and were two weeks short of completing the project when the accident happened. After the accident, officials were asked why these men did not have any safety equipment. The answer was simple: they had the equipment; they just chose not to wear it. After the scaffolding gave way, the survivors held on to a one-inch (2.5-cm) lip of steel girder and stood on an eight-inch (20-cm) ledge of steel for over an hour until rescue teams could reach them. One survivor related that as he clung to the bridge, he thought a lot about his family. He said, “I just thank the Lord for me being here today. … It was pretty scary, I tell you” (in Rick Bogacz, “Skyway Horror,” <span class="emphasis">Standard,</span> June 9, 1993).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p3" pid="3F6OEASoyEam-Mz_HIPg5w" hash="3dSREg">There are many lessons to be learned and comparisons to be made from this incident. While most of us will never face such a dramatic, life-or-death situation, many of us feel that we are going through a scary time in our personal lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p4" pid="kT_ywGcIBUqZS-0OrV-K3w" hash="xiEBQw">We may feel as though we are holding on to what may seem to be a one-inch lip of steel girder. Our mortal probation is not easy, and it is not brief. We are blessed to come to this earth and gain a mortal body. This life is our opportunity to prove ourselves and exercise our agency (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.25" class="scriptureRef">Abraham 3:25</a>). We can choose to follow Heavenly Father’s eternal plan of salvation (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1.2" class="scriptureRef">Jarom 1:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.5" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:5</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.62" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:62</a>) and redemption (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6.8" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 6:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.25" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:25</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.11" class="scriptureRef">42:11</a>), or we can try to find our own way. We can be obedient and keep His commandments, or we can reject them and face the consequences that will surely follow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p5" pid="bvvuHS5__Uy9ko0P01lB2Q" hash="s1Og0w">Because of this, we too have a hazardous job description and duty. We must deal with challenges. We may experience loneliness, strained relationships, betrayal of trust, temptations, addictions, limitations of our physical body, or the loss of much-needed employment. We may be challenged with feelings of disappointment because our righteous hopes and dreams have not been met in our personal timetable. We may question our abilities and fear the possibility of failure, even in our Church and family callings. The challenges and the dangers we live with today, including society’s tolerance of sin, have been prophesied by ancient and living prophets. These are just as precarious and real as the threat of falling 125 feet (38 m) to certain death from a high bridge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p6" pid="9f0LflNpykaIjnajEz5mIw" hash="xT73tw">My life is not perfect. I deal with many of the same challenges. We all do. I know that the temptations of the adversary and the difficulties of mortality are ever present and beset each of us. I concur with the rescued worker’s expression of his dangerous experience of holding on to that steel girder: “It [is] pretty scary, I tell you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p7" pid="VJHTRWm4Ake2PZiibynf5w" hash="XYtDgA">It is important to note, however, that in the scriptures there are very few stories of individuals who lived in blissful happiness and experienced no opposition. We learn and grow by overcoming challenges with faith, persistence, and personal righteousness. I’ve been strengthened by President Thomas S. Monson’s endless confidence in our Heavenly Father and in us. He has said: “Remember that you are entitled to our [Heavenly] Father’s blessings in this work. He did not call you to your privileged post to walk alone, without guidance, trusting to luck. On the contrary, He knows your skill, He realizes your devotion, and He will convert your supposed <span class="pageBreak" page-number="80"></span>inadequacies to recognized strengths. He has promised: ‘I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up’” (“Sugar Beets and the Worth of a Soul,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> July 2009, 3–4; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> July 2009, 5–6).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p8" pid="gDb3obS8ukitzJ8n4Y-yaA" hash="9E264g">Heavenly Father has not left us alone during our mortal probation. He has already given us all the “safety equipment” we will need to successfully return to Him. He has given us personal prayer, the scriptures, living prophets, and the Holy Ghost to guide us. At times, using this equipment may seem cumbersome, awkward, and horribly unfashionable. Its proper use requires our diligence, obedience, and persistence. But I, for one, choose to use it. We must all choose to use it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p9" pid="3-Q07nbTM0eRkyQ4E4R__A" hash="7EB9RQ">In the scriptures we learn about another key piece of safety equipment—a “rod of iron.” Disciples of our Savior, Jesus Christ, are invited to hold on to this rod in order to safely find their way to eternal life. I am speaking of Lehi’s vision of the tree of life found in the Book of Mormon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p10" pid="zdbKjCgG0Eie_JyrkaXDdA" hash="KtIP6w">Through divine personal revelation, the Book of Mormon prophet Lehi and his son Nephi were each shown a vision of our mortal probationary state and its accompanying dangers. Lehi says, “And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 8:23</a>). Yet “he [also] saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to [that] rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree,” meaning the tree of life (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.30" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 8:30</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p11" pid="Qet_EzxDIE6soKQqdlI8Gw" hash="QhCoog">From Lehi’s vision we learn that we must take hold of this safety railing—this iron rod, found alongside our individual straight and narrow path—and hold tight until we reach our ultimate goal of eternal life with our Heavenly Father. Nephi promises that those who hold fast to the iron rod “would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.24" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 15:24</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p12" pid="1osLhN8-Fk-8MjHzCHkLSQ" hash="c3J2Bg">I invite you to read again the full accounts of this inspired vision. Study them, ponder them, and apply them to your daily life. In modern terms we might say we are invited to “get a grip.” We must hold on tight to the iron rod and never let go.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p13" pid="esI4ywH5iEGI6UDQmUiO_A" hash="f25XVg">President Harold B. Lee, the prophet when I was a teenager, taught, “If there is any one thing most needed in this time of tumult and frustration, when men and women and youth and young adults are desperately seeking for answers to the problems which afflict mankind, it is an ‘iron rod’ as a safe guide along the straight path on the way to eternal life, amidst the strange and devious roadways that would eventually lead to destruction and to the ruin of all that is ‘virtuous, lovely, or of good report’” (“The Iron Rod,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> June 1971, 7).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p14" pid="k7ctgXKQ5keeezhoBdHy5Q" hash="wTLSmg">This quote was relevant when I was a teenager, and it is perhaps even more relevant today. Prophets’ words warn, teach, and encourage truth, whether they’re spoken in 600 <small>B.C.</small>, 1971, or 2009. I encourage you to listen to, believe in, and act upon the inspired words of those we sustain as <span class="pageBreak" page-number="81"></span>prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p15" pid="IhctgkWZL0yC1C0G24MUiQ" hash="MmrYlQ">Holding to the iron rod is not always easy. We may let go because of peer pressure or pride, thinking we can find our own way back—later. When we do so, we are leaving our safety equipment behind. In Lehi’s vision he saw many who let go of the iron rod. Nephi says, “And many were lost from his view, wandering in strange roads” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.32" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 8:32</a>). In difficult times in our own lives, we may find we are also “wandering in strange roads.” Let me reassure you that it is always possible for us to find our way back. Through repentance, made possible by the atoning sacrifice of our Savior, Jesus Christ, we can regain and recommit to a strong grip on the iron rod and feel the loving guidance of our Heavenly Father once again. The Savior has extended an open invitation to us: repent, hold on, and don’t let go.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p16" pid="E5OZz6N-JEmJcKvoqMtDCA" hash="H8Dbyw">I, like Nephi, exhort you with all the energies of my soul that you will “give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.25" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 15:25</a>). Use the safety equipment He has provided for you. Hold fast, and believe that Heavenly Father will bless you for your diligence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p17" pid="tkvgvu0eHkaGrmJl3RgnDg" hash="1tdOEw">I know the restored gospel is true, and I know we are led by a living prophet of God, President Thomas S. Monson. It is my great privilege and blessing to be his daughter. I love my parents dearly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p18" pid="xfYTCX12xkuzkdr3eH-pCA" hash="6uqD9A">One evening I was feeling a bit discouraged and said, “Oh, Dad, the blessings we experience as members of the Church and the promised blessings of the temple are so good, <span class="emphasis">if we will only reach out and choose to accept them.</span>” He responded without hesitation, “Ann, they are everything.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/hold-on.p19" pid="HkqL5z4sIkOAUYS9oAeXng" hash="fmJR8g">May we <span class="emphasis">hold on</span> to the eternal truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ because they are literally everything is my sincere prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="114"></span>Many times, as General Authorities address the priesthood brethren at general conference, they will begin by saying that they feel as though they are addressing a “mighty army” of powerful priesthood leaders. Tonight, I feel as though I am standing before a “mighty army” of elect daughters of God. You have been chosen to move forward, standing alongside those valiant priesthood holders, in righteousness in these latter days. You are a commanding and beautiful sight.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/be-of-a-good-courage.p2" pid="-Q_wQLH1EEKihk5ud1n26Q" hash="FpL1sQ">I would like to begin this evening by briefly reviewing the historical context of our theme, <a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/1.9" class="scriptureRef">Joshua 1:9</a>: “Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/be-of-a-good-courage.p3" pid="qOt-nklmZUKCPQFR4P4Xkg" hash="LJnm-w">Moses was the mighty prophet who led the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, where they had been slaves and had been influenced to worship false gods. After 40 years of hardship in the wilderness, they were ever so close to their new home, where they could be free to worship the true and living God. At Moses’s death, Joshua was called by God to be the prophet who would complete this miraculous journey.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/be-of-a-good-courage.p4" pid="mO12Nebw8UGt4oaj14M09Q" hash="Q2d9Uw">Joshua was an influential leader. The Bible Dictionary calls him “the highest type of the devout warrior” and indicates that his name means “God is help” (Bible Dictionary, <a href="/scriptures/bd/joshua" class="scriptureRef">“Joshua”</a>). His inspired leadership was greatly needed because there were still many rivers to cross and battles to win before all that the Lord had promised to the children of Israel could be realized and obtained.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/be-of-a-good-courage.p5" pid="tiFzitC500mYN2uJuFmqZw" hash="MYOlwQ">The Lord knew the prophet Joshua and the children of Israel would need great courage during this time. In the first chapter of the book of Joshua, the Lord tells him several times to “be strong and of a good courage.” The word <span class="emphasis">courage</span> is defined as “mental or moral strength to … <span class="emphasis">persevere,</span> and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty” (<span class="emphasis">Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary,</span> 11th ed. [2003], “courage”; emphasis added). Through their courage and obedience, Joshua and the children of Israel were able to enter the land of promise and find happiness in the blessings of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/be-of-a-good-courage.p6" pid="DjzAGJ0agkuH-p7H0bm37w" hash="dm-CJQ">Joshua and the children of Israel lived long, long ago. But in our day we too are striving to enter a “land of promise.” Our greatest goal is to obtain eternal life with our Heavenly Father. In the first chapter of the book of Joshua, we find four sure guides to help us overcome our obstacles, complete our journey, and enjoy the blessings of the Lord in our “land of promise.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/be-of-a-good-courage.p7" pid="LaCtfalzukq2wGy88KTR8g" hash="osNMlg">First, in <a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/1.5" class="scriptureRef">verse 5</a> the Lord promises Joshua, “I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.” We can find courage and strength in this promise that the Lord will always be there for us and will never leave us alone. We are taught that Heavenly Father knows and loves each of His children. As one of His precious daughters, you have access to <span class="pageBreak" page-number="115"></span>His assurance and guidance through the power of prayer. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read, “Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 112:10</a>).</p>

But often patience is required when we are “wait[ing] upon the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/40.31" class="scriptureRef">Isaiah 40:31</a>). As we wait, we may begin to believe that we have been forsaken or that our prayers were not heard or that possibly we are not worthy to have them answered. This is not true. I love King David’s comforting words: “I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/40.1" class="scriptureRef">Psalm 40:1</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/be-of-a-good-courage.p9" pid="WQrFUFE9SEWi7_AT0cnFbQ" hash="0i7cuQ">No matter what you may face in your personal journey, the first guide found in Joshua reminds us to pray, be patient, and remember God’s promise: “I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/1.5" class="scriptureRef">Joshua 1:5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/be-of-a-good-courage.p10" pid="8UqzyWp9iESJZ_Q2KPALrQ" hash="yDkbMA">The second guide is found in <a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/1.7" class="scriptureRef">verse 7</a>, when the Lord tells Joshua, “Observe to do according to all the law … : turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.” The Lord is instructing Joshua to be strictly obedient to the commandments and not to deviate from the Lord’s path. President Howard W. Hunter taught: “Joshua knew that his obedience would bring success, and although he did not know exactly how he would succeed, he now had confidence in the result. … Surely the experiences of the great prophets [found in the scriptures] have been recorded [and preserved] to help us understand the importance of choosing the path of strict obedience” (“Commitment to God,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1982, 57, 58).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/be-of-a-good-courage.p11" pid="S6Yrx3CtEkOBQIr6xsRvXg" hash="ELLS6g">A month ago I visited a group of young women. I asked the older girls what advice they would give a new Beehive to help her to remain faithful and virtuous in every setting that she may encounter. One young woman said, “When you walk down the halls of your school, you might, out of the corner of your eye, see something that catches your attention, something that doesn’t seem quite right. You may be curious and want to look. My advice to you is this: Don’t look. I promise you’ll regret it if you do. Believe me; just look straight ahead.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/be-of-a-good-courage.p12" pid="YirsqUrVE0it2G3qmjizZw" hash="_iPSDA">As I listened to this young woman, I knew I was hearing the Lord’s advice to Joshua, “Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/1.7" class="scriptureRef">Joshua 1:7</a>), applied to an everyday setting in these latter days. Young women, avoid the temptations that surround you by strictly following the commandments. Look straight ahead at your eternal goal. The second guide reminds us that in doing this you will be protected and will “prosper whithersoever thou goest” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/1.7" class="scriptureRef">Joshua 1:7</a>).</p>

Here the Lord refers to a “book of the law” and tells Joshua to “meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: … and then thou shalt have good success.” The Lord is instructing Joshua and all of us to read the scriptures. Daily scripture study—especially reading the Book of Mormon—establishes a firm foundation for your developing testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel. It invites the Spirit into your life. President Harold B. Lee counseled, “If we’re not reading the scriptures daily, our testimonies are growing thinner [and] our spirituality isn’t increasing in depth” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Harold B.

During that time I visited several churches and attended church on a regular basis but still felt that there was something more. One night I fell on my knees and begged to know what to do. That night I had a dream about you, Kristi. I hadn’t seen you since we had graduated from high school. I thought my dream was strange, but I didn’t attribute it to anything. I dreamed about you again for the next three nights. I spent time thinking about the meaning of my dreams. I remembered that you were a Mormon. I checked the Mormon website. The first thing I found was the Word of Wisdom. My mother had passed away from lung cancer two years previously. She had been a smoker, and reading about the Word of Wisdom really hit home with me. Later I was visiting my father’s house. I was sitting in his living room, and I started to pray. I asked to know where to go and what to do. At that moment a commercial for the Church came on television. I wrote down the number and called the same night. The missionaries called me three days later, asking if they could deliver a Book of Mormon to my home. I said, ‘Yes.’ I was baptized three and a half months later.

In <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.5" class="scriptureRef">verse 5</a>, where we find this year’s theme, the Lord tells him, “Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations.”</p>

Personally, I think of you—the noble youth of the Church. I picture you diligently arising from your beds each morning for early-morning seminary. I see you faithfully arising from your knees after finishing your daily prayers. I think of you courageously arising to share your testimony and defend your standards. I am inspired by your commitment to the gospel and your good examples. Many of you have already accepted this invitation to arise and shine forth, and your light encourages others to do the same.</p>

On my personal copy, I have circled the words <span class="emphasis">for</span> and <span class="emphasis">you,</span> as taught to me by a respected friend. This simple act reminds me that these standards are not just general guidelines—they are specifically <span class="emphasis">for me.</span> I hope you will take the time to circle those words on your own booklet, read it cover to cover, and feel the Spirit testify that the standards are <span class="emphasis">for you</span> as well.</p>

Read your scriptures. Spend time on the Church’s official website, <a href="http://www.lds.org"><span class="language">LDS.org</span></a>, to find answers to your questions. Talk to your parents, your Church leaders, and those who shine brightly as they live the gospel. Pray. Pour out your heart to your Heavenly Father, who loves you. Use the gift of repentance daily. Serve others. And most important, listen to and obey the promptings of the Holy Ghost.</p>

In the book of Judges in the Old Testament, we learn about Samson. Samson was born with great potential. His mother was promised, “He shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> But as Samson grew, he looked more to the world’s temptations than to God’s direction. He made choices because they “pleaseth [him] well”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> rather than because those choices were right. Repeatedly, the scriptures use the phrase “and he went down”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> as they tell of Samson’s journeys, actions, and choices. Instead of arising and shining forth to fulfill his great potential, Samson was overcome by the world, lost his God-given power, and died a tragic, early death.</p>

Daniel was also born with great potential. In the book of Daniel, chapter 6, we read, “Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> When worldly challenges came to Daniel, he didn’t look down at the world—he arose and looked to heaven. Instead of following the king’s worldly decree that no one should pray to anyone but the king for 30 days, Daniel “went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/arise-and-shine-forth.p17" pid="1knEJJM0CUyI9mvWgnPqpQ" hash="S3OzHQ">Daniel was not afraid to arise and shine forth in following God’s commandments. Although he spent an uncomfortable night in the lions’ den for standing for what was right, he was protected and blessed for his obedience. When King Darius removed Daniel from the lions’ den the next morning, he made a decree that everyone should fear Daniel’s God and follow Daniel’s example of faithfulness. Truly, Daniel shows us what it means to be a standard for the nations and never lower our standards in the face of worldly temptations.</p>

Joanna was one of only three members of the Church in her high school and the only young woman in her ward. She committed to herself and the Lord that she would never use bad language. When she was paired with a young man for a school project who had not made the same commitment, she did not lower her standards. She asked him to respect and honor her values. Over time, with many gentle and some not-so-gentle reminders, her friend formed new habits and used cleaner language. Many people noticed the difference, including his father, who thanked Joanna for being a good influence in his son’s life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

A teacher required that every student learn to make and taste the variety of drinks that would be served in their restaurants. Some of the drinks contained alcohol, and Karen knew it was against the Lord’s commandments for her to taste them. In the face of serious consequences, Karen found courage to arise and shine forth, and she did not partake of the drinks.</p>

I wondered how this young girl from Colorado came to possess such confidence in her identity as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I couldn’t help but wonder what meaningful phrase I would figuratively choose to have printed on <span class="emphasis">my</span> T-shirt reflecting my belief and testimony.

With so many distractions, do we have the strength, discipline, and commitment to remain focused on what matters most? Are we as well versed in gospel truths as we are in our studies, careers, hobbies, sports, or our texts and tweets? Do we actively seek to find answers to our questions by feasting on the scriptures and the teachings of the prophets? Do we seek the confirmation of the Spirit?</p>

Even in our most diligent efforts to live the gospel, all of us will make mistakes, and all of us will sin.

She wrote: “I’ve been a member of the Church for a little over a year. … For me, when investigating, one sign that this was the true Church came because I felt I’d finally found a church that taught modesty and standards. I’ve seen with my own eyes what happens to people when they disregard commandments and choose the wrong path.

Sometimes this happens when times are challenging and we must practice patience. Sometimes it happens at the peak of our prosperity and abundance. Whenever I have this feeling, I know I need to refocus my efforts on increasing my gospel knowledge and living gospel principles more fully in my life.</p>

In Christ’s prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, He expressed to the Father, “Not my will, but thine, be done.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> This should be our prayer as well.

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/your-holy-places.p5" pid="GCWgSx6GwECdUHj-KkplCw" hash="AUECMg"><span class="pageBreak" page-number="115"></span>Our 2013 Mutual theme comes from the 87th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. This instruction is found in three separate sections; obviously the admonition is important. It explains how we can receive protection, strength, and peace in unsettling times. The inspired instruction is to “stand ye in holy places, and be not moved.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/your-holy-places.p6" pid="d2dF7BJYRkKlD8FJQVZMkg" hash="jUzAUg">As I have pondered this theme, I can’t help but wonder, “What are the ‘holy places’ Heavenly Father is referring to?” President Ezra Taft Benson counseled, “Holy places include our temples, our chapels, our homes, and the stakes of Zion, which are … ‘for a defense, and for a refuge.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> In addition to these, I believe we can each find many more places. We might first consider the word <span class="emphasis">place</span> as a physical environment or a geographic location. However, a <span class="emphasis">place</span> can be “a distinct condition, position, or state of mind.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> This means holy places can also include <span class="emphasis">moments in time</span>—moments when the Holy Ghost testifies to us, moments when we feel Heavenly Father’s love, or moments when we receive an answer to our prayers. Even more, I believe any time you have the courage to stand for what is right, especially in situations where no one else is willing to do so, you are creating a holy place.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/your-holy-places.p7" pid="gwZleD9WtUa5hy7FemEJpQ" hash="bjf0pg">Throughout Joseph Smith’s short but magnificent life, he truly “[stood] in holy places” and was not moved. As a young teenager, he was troubled by the religious turmoil in his community and wanted to know which of all the churches was true. The wooded area close to his home became a holy place as he knelt among the trees and offered his first vocal prayer. His prayer was answered, and today Latter-day Saints refer to these woods as the Sacred Grove.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/your-holy-places.p8" pid="RBsq7-GJ20u0OI5oaExpSQ" hash="N59-wg"><span class="pageBreak" page-number="116"></span>Young women around the world stand in holy places in nature at Young Women camp. A leader shared with me the story of one young woman’s experience. This girl was less active and was a bit skeptical about having a spiritual experience in the woods. After the first day, she reported to the leader, “I’m having a great time, but could we please cut out all of the talk about the Spirit? I’m here to camp, enjoy nature, be with my friends, and have some fun!” However, at the concluding testimony meeting, this same girl tearfully admitted, “I don’t want to go home. How can I have what I am feeling right now, this Spirit, with me all the time?” She had discovered a holy place.</p>
		</span>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/your-holy-places.p9" pid="ES8huLAmcUqw-6bppP-ISw" hash="r5E2IA">Another holy place in Joseph Smith’s life was his own bedroom. This may be hard to believe because, like many of you, he shared his bedroom with siblings. It became a holy place when he prayed with great faith, humility, and need. He explained, “After I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> The three years which had passed since Joseph had the vision in the Sacred Grove had not been easy. Seventeen-year-old Joseph had endured endless mockery, ridicule, and bullying. But that night in Joseph’s bedroom, the angel Moroni appeared in answer to his pleadings. Joseph received knowledge and comfort. That night, his bedroom became a holy place.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/your-holy-places.p10" pid="3y5yn78dMk6Os7c3ayx3WQ" hash="OSHuXA">While watching a Mormon Message for Youth, I witnessed another bedroom that had become a holy place. The video shows Ingrid Delgado, a young woman from El Salvador, sharing her feelings about the temple. She says, “It is good to know we have a place where we can get away from the things of the world and receive sacred ordinances and help those who couldn’t receive them in this life.” As she speaks, the video shows Ingrid reading her scriptures, surrounded by Mormonads, quotations, a Personal Progress book, pictures of her family and the temple, and yes, her favorite stuffed animals.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Perhaps without even realizing it, she has created her holy place away from the things of the world. I wonder how many times Ingrid has read her scriptures, felt the Spirit, and received answers to her prayers in her holy place.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/your-holy-places.p11" pid="LjPC41T1Hk-uAN12JAdTrw" hash="YKWoHQ">Yet another unexpected holy place in Joseph Smith’s life was Liberty Jail. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said, “There was no more burdensome time in Joseph’s life than this cruel, illegal, and unjustified incarceration.” Elder Holland went on to explain that Liberty Jail has been referred to as a “prison-temple” because of the sacred experiences the Prophet Joseph Smith had there.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/your-holy-places.p12" pid="rgFCxmxNSEycfUwOpZ0KgA" hash="X44f6Q">Some of you young women may be experiencing your own Liberty Jail, a place where you face humiliation, a place where you feel no loving-kindness, a place where you are mocked, bullied, or even physically harmed. To you young women I offer Elder Holland’s words: “You can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experiences with the Lord <span class="emphasis">in the most miserable experiences of your life</span> … , while enduring the most painful injustices, when facing the most insurmountable odds and opposition you have ever faced.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> In other words, just like the Prophet Joseph Smith, <span class="emphasis">you</span> can create and stand in holy places even in the hardest times you have ever experienced.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/your-holy-places.p13" pid="EjfLkPJOMki__Z-H1QL_Og" hash="hRcDvw">A young adult, Kirsten, shared with me her painful experience. High school had been her Liberty Jail. Fortunately, the band room provided relief. She said: “When I stepped into this room, it was as if I stepped into a safe place. There were no degrading or belittling remarks, no profanity. Instead, we heard words of encouragement and love. We exercised kindness. It was a happy place. The band room was filled with the Spirit as we practiced and performed music. The room was like this in large measure because of the influence of the band instructor. He was a good Christian man. Looking back, high school was a refining place. It was difficult, but I learned resilience. I will forever be grateful for my refuge, my holy place, the band room.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Once, I was feeling overwhelmed, fearful, and completely alone. Silently, I prayed: “Heavenly Father, I do not know how to do this. Please, please, help me!” Soon, an individual unexpectedly came forward, placed a hand on my shoulder, and offered sincere, encouraging words. In that moment, I felt peace. I felt acknowledged. Everything had changed. The words of President Spencer W. Kimball came to mind: “God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> For me, that moment, that place, had become holy.</p>
