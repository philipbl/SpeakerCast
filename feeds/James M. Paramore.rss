I am grateful beyond almost all power of expression to tell you what a thrill and an honor it is to be here tonight with you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/a-thousand-witnesses.p2" pid="nq4ndvJb7kCroIc0detIcw" hash="OgqwSA">I love the prophet. Unlike most of you, I have spent four years of my life by his side, and another three years with President Benson; and I have spent every Thursday in the temple with the Council of the Twelve Apostles. I want to leave you my testimony tonight that our Heavenly Father directs this work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/a-thousand-witnesses.p3" pid="yGBKUCCy5EKF8r6OjY4s-Q" hash="9Q4wPg">I would like to pay tribute to my angel mother, who for many years prayed that a husband would become active, that he would recognize his sonship to God, and that he would accept the priesthood. As a little boy, I walked through those many years with my mother’s sustaining hand at church, finally seeing my father receive a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost. I honor him tonight, and I love him and respect him. He has been my friend, for he has taken me into his confidence. He has taught me how to work, and how to love, and how not to be judgmental. I am grateful for my father and my mother.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/a-thousand-witnesses.p4" pid="T8oJ1d0JOkupiO9ArUwTOg" hash="57i6PA">And I am grateful for my wife. I would like to tell you a little story. I have been to three or four thousand meetings, I guess, in the last twenty-five years; and every one of those times she has sustained me—except for one. When I was off to a Sunday School meeting one night, she asked, “Will you be home early?” I said, “Yes, I’ll be home at 10:30.” Eleven o’clock and 11:30 came, and I wasn’t home. When I finally came home, I walked up to the door to walk in as usual, and it was locked. I rang the doorbell—and no answer. So I knocked on the door, and finally she came. She said, “I’m not going to let you in.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/a-thousand-witnesses.p5" pid="8qBh3s-ClkGIQjLybGw8gQ" hash="pjgYjw">I said, “Oh, come on.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/a-thousand-witnesses.p6" pid="ocjZIpuSDk62WwQMGV33ng" hash="mq7KBA">And she said, “No, it’s one time too many.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/a-thousand-witnesses.p7" pid="uhlKeIuuhUK4GhjgtOrH_Q" hash="7kEL3w">In those days we had a Nash Rambler with a front seat that made out into a bed (but it was in the middle of winter). So I took my overcoat and went out into the car and rolled back the seat, and went to bed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/a-thousand-witnesses.p8" pid="NeIZ45aTqUiwkrqymEpSfA" hash="rSIjsA">After a little while I could hear the front door open, and my wife came out to the car and asked me to come in. I told her I didn’t think I would. It was so cold I finally did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/a-thousand-witnesses.p9" pid="kQvleZ3cbkSgGimLlK6NKw" hash="qqKQXA">Brethren, my wife is such a wonderful woman. In all of those years, she has sustained me so much; and I would hope that as members of the priesthood, as we hold leadership roles, we will remember this little experience and remember our wives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/a-thousand-witnesses.p10" pid="LmN9Gy07WU69WWqyJ_vzwg" hash="hmnntg">I am so grateful for the gospel of Jesus Christ. I have received a thousand witnesses in the course of my life with my missionaries and my family. I saw a daughter one night beside herself with the pain of an earache. My wife came and said, “Jim, I think you should give your daughter a blessing.” I went and gave my lovely girl a blessing; and, brethren, before I could finish the words, she was asleep.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/a-thousand-witnesses.p11" pid="7jPN-0pk1UOmw2j7XXX-oQ" hash="rvEBeA">I want you to know that my life has been and will be dedicated to the things of God, for I know He lives, and I love His work, and I love and know the principles of the gospel are true. I pledge my support to the prophet and to the Council of the Twelve Apostles, and to Brother Richards and the other presidents. I pray that it might be said of me as the apostle Paul said at the end of his days: “This one thing I do.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/3.13" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 3:13</a>.) In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

    <div class="topic" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.t1">
      <img src="ensignlp.nfo-o-274c.jpg" alt="Elder James M. Paramore" guid="1f8befce-51e0-44cc-b4a9-a24751e05bad" pid="ePf1om8NGkWm48tQrzmIKw" hash="iLbr6g" />
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="wzE8WVJctk69SsQlDWmM8Q" hash="vScKug">My brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I would like to thank you, all of you members, for all that you have done for me these past two years. I solicit your faith and prayers this morning as I speak with you about the subject of commitment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="e5Mq0ZCqjUi_2Imo6soGCQ" hash="VakhaA">A short time ago I attended a very special dinner meeting. It was to honor a friend who had given many years of total commitment to a special group of people. I watched group after group bring gifts, embrace, and thank him for what he had done for them. As I saw him stand before the hundreds gathered that night, I thought: “How could anyone so young have done so much in such a short time?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="_24dDAoLz0y-vtdRxPFh8A" hash="LwjTsg">Then I reflected on the thousands of selfless acts he had done for these people; his encouragement in the face of almost insurmountable obstacles. He gave his time, home, money, skills—his total commitment to do everything he could to help them. It was like being in a testimony meeting. I went away thanking the Lord for his life and the fact that one person’s commitment can make such a difference. I learned again that night that commitment is doing what everyone <span class="emphasis">can do</span>—but usually doesn’t. When one commits himself like this young man, it is like opening up the headgates of a mighty dam, permitting all its power to become available.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="lObbbnW5c061Epo5pPth-A" hash="5DsFpw">As I think of commitment I recall one of many solemn days of commitment in the life of the Savior. Jesus had just touched the ear of a servant of one of the high priests and healed him. Only moments before, his ear had been severed by a sword. And then Jesus was taken into the high priest’s house where he was mocked, bound, blindfolded, and spat upon. The next day he was taken again before the council and was again scourged and berated. He might have saved himself. Instead, he stood majestically before his accusers and acknowledged his sonship, his kingship, his personal commitment to his Father and to all mankind. This ultimately changed the destiny of every living soul. How many hundreds of times because of fatigue, hunger, pain, or disappointment he might have disavowed this commitment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="dhLluPlookOn_3WBPBLNMg" hash="o97Ipg">The Savior’s commitment was a very special one, to be sure. It could only be done by him. But we, too, have commitments to make—commitments to him, our families, and others. These are essential to our happiness here and our exaltation hereafter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="yUZdLYDyUEqbMemxmftDFg" hash="R3puCA">What of commitment? Does it really make a difference? The Lord spoke of this principle to the Prophet Joseph Smith on August 1, 1831:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="J7QI0sgSWE6vtlPrem91og" hash="UYOeuw">“Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="HFpqYPmjuUW2L24BWVSUTQ" hash="E-hIAA">“For the power is in them” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27-28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27–28</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="kfDx-f0ChUSQLqKIMFs49Q" hash="9JnYrQ">Commitment, as we have observed, is to be an example of goodness. It is to be “anxiously engaged” and “do many things” of our “own free will.” It is not by compulsion, but because of our desire to “bring to pass much righteousness.” Commitment is not confessing, but doing. It is not convenient. It isn’t easy—it’s never easy. It is example leadership. It is a binding, but happy, response to duty. It is at once peaceful yet compelling, for it obligates one to action. It is essential to the good life. It is doing what everyone <span class="emphasis">can</span> do. It is a beautiful principle to observe in action.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="5qpGrXPglEWfxg2brGX2AQ" hash="YiG4uQ">While I was in the mission field a few years ago, I observed one of the missionaries who always had people to teach and baptize. Wherever he went, he went with such commitment, happiness, and love for others that he was accepted. It was said of him that when he would come back into an area, many of the people would peek through their windows just to get a glimpse of this unusual young man. Though he was not particularly gifted in language skills, he succeeded in bearing a strong testimony to thousands of people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="AmgjEZ1iMEuYwkUk0d8t6w" hash="4xGcOw">Again, like my friend, he only did what everybody <span class="emphasis">could do,</span> but usually doesn’t.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="u-gQc1g8b0q2qGxYoJJ7PA" hash="6-RRkw">Once commitment is understood as a binding principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ, a committed person is able to call on heavenly powers and healings. Like the waters behind the mighty dam, these powers transform his personal world.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="7ms_JDDy8ESWPOlIHYniGg" hash="7uUPUQ">An early American prophet counseled us how important our commitment is to the Savior:</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="5lwwISCsgECtPvcubi-3cg" hash="e9H30w">“And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:12</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="3DYNjI6Dyk2tqXFZ2xRcAQ" hash="A0yhKw">When we commit ourselves to him, we receive the inner peace and security he promised: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>). When we are committed to him, we bind him to bless us, for he said: “I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say;” and conversely “but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:10</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="GU-aPss2uEWeDURLxvvreQ" hash="Qr8UzA">A newspaper once received this question from a reader: “What would be the most important news the world could receive?” After much careful deliberation the editor answered: “To know that Jesus Christ lives today.” This would be the most important news anyone could know.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="G3hKnZiBdkGkzbrpnag01Q" hash="tlrjmA">We bear a solemn witness to you that he does live. He restored and directs his church through a prophet of God. The priesthood and the principles of the gospel have been restored to bless all who commit them into their lives. We invite all to make a personal commitment this day from the things you have heard to study these doctrines and earnestly ask our Father in Heaven if they are true.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="UPUxqjQN40K7a9-08YIiTQ" hash="j7zZJA">As we commit ourselves to the Lord and his principles, we are led to share them with our families. The family is eternal. We may be sealed together forever in a patriarchal order if we are righteous. This knowledge we willingly and anxiously share with the world because of the joy we feel. We affirm that every life is sacred and important. Every child is a gift and a blessing. The home is an institution of learning, of loving—to develop the capacities of each of its members to live in accordance to the laws of God. We testify that these laws are eternal and unchanging. A personal commitment to this priority is paramount. Nothing can surpass the inner security of having one’s family committed to God.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="B3tA4_yABE6fPGsDnCnY4A" hash="QjJtEQ">A busy father, businessman, and Church leader told me a few years ago that he loved his family so much that he made this commitment: he would give several nights each week and part of every Saturday to them. They were programmed into his schedule. The gospel helped him to understand the importance of this priority. Then, though fatigue, business, Church and other requirements pressed him every day, he followed this commitment. For him, it was an irrevocable obligation, a looked-for pleasure to be with and nurture his family. He did what every father <span class="emphasis">could and must do</span>—but sometimes doesn’t do.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="ryTxuYvu9UKSX0DH3Eo2vQ" hash="lOgfPA">Prophets in all ages have counseled families to pray, study, work, and play together, to bind ourselves together in all holiness. It is and ever will be the answer to happiness, peace, and unity in this world. But it takes a commitment to do so—to do all we can. Knowing is not enough! It takes a personal commitment to be “anxiously engaged,” to do <span class="emphasis">everything</span> possible.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="RIFic5Y1rEakA1drHhT_dg" hash="z7w4yQ">And may I reecho a thought expressed by another? Never give up trying to reach a loved one—never, never, never. The blessings of heaven may be realized after the prayers and personal commitment of the righteous. When one is totally committed to <span class="emphasis">this</span> endeavor, there is a greater inner strength. We not only love more, but we help more. Can any member forget the story told yesterday by Elder Perry about an anxious prophet-father, Alma, who received the blessing of a changed son?</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="s-ZMNvjJOkScs0U1ckXI9Q" hash="OlYwIg">One man who had committed himself to do everything he could to share the gospel with others walked out of his office one day and saw a man running down the hall. He learned this man had stapled his finger. He reached into his big pocket, pulled out Merthiolate and a Band-Aid, and dressed the wound. The shocked individual asked in amazement why he did this. He responded: “I am a Mormon, and Mormons do these things.” This man was prepared to help another whenever possible.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="1MScEvlkVEWiXdZhDJfHZQ" hash="3KvzdA">In a stake conference a number of speakers mentioned a certain man. After the session the General Authority met the man. He learned from others that more than fifty people had joined the Church because of him. The way he kept his yard, his home, his happiness, his good deeds to his neighbors all brought him opportunities to tell others how the gospel had blessed his life.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="2NZ1BF8OrkmZSNVSWvo1kA" hash="15Sk4Q">These two men had just committed themselves to do what everyone <span class="emphasis">can</span> do.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="mvM11hRZIkmBBmO73Tsfdg" hash="RxS18w">I know, after many interviews, that many long to become part of the assembly of the blessed. Many times they cry out in the night for help, not knowing where to turn, how to begin. Their eternal spirits seek help. As social beings we need each other. The commitment to reach out to them is a binding invitation from the Savior. When this is done in love, we may help redeem them. It is infinitely more than just confessing Jesus Christ—it is <span class="emphasis">doing</span> what needs to be done.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="lfyLYjCwEEC2PB0xcgHZHQ" hash="UJ9YCw">Church leaders and home teachers have special opportunities to help. The object of all their work, meetings, faith, and prayers will be to help each individual and family.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="ShA3cp3X_kmC1ouJnheNmg" hash="NvMsjQ">A sister in France who joined the Church was approached by her former minister who asked her how she could possibly have done such a thing. Her response was beautiful and reassuring. It shows us how important our collective commitment is to serve others. She said that at least once every month leaders or members of the Church would visit her. They looked after her spiritual and temporal needs. She told her former minister that since she had been baptized as a baby, the only time she had been visited by anyone from her former church was this day, and that visit was only to inquire about her membership.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="eURDaTeWBEGsfGVubF1i1w" hash="Xc64fg">A total commitment to anxiously serve the Lord and others is the surest way to overcome the many temptations of the adversary.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="-gDpHToaHUmAA9TiokW-yw" hash="Nu5a4Q">Everyone who truly commits himself to the gospel finds his life expanding and his appreciation growing for all good things. His acknowledgment of God and his wondrous creations intensifies. The Lord described how this process works in a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in May 1831:</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="hflnf8e_sEq3zwjAQPLgUA" hash="ljJQbA">“That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:24</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="xhdgCCv9IE64rPsojuV_vA" hash="-Ye8ng">Brothers and sisters, a committed person makes goodness look attractive. He builds an inner confidence as he learns light and truth and then practices it. He becomes more like our prophet today, Spencer W. Kimball, who over a lifetime has translated desire into firm commitment to do everything he can do to demonstrate his love for the Lord and all of His children.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/a-personal-commitment.p" pid="OTt8so3IxEm1gR-iP8tBkg" hash="hbwlfQ">We, too, can resolve this day to declare ourselves, give ourselves, devote ourselves; to commit ourselves to do what <span class="emphasis">everyone can do.</span> In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Oh, to be sure, I don’t sit in the choir seats because I don’t sing well enough, but I do sit here below and silently sing along with them because their music is so beautiful. A line from one of their numbers that we all love is, “As I have loved you, love one another.” May I talk about this for a few minutes today—the love of God and loving one another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p2" pid="T7XjlfO_pkCDsBG5CNFlmA" hash="qMr24g">A little story given by one of your missionary sons in Italy a few weeks ago brought this clearly into focus for me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p3" pid="5oV7CqU2_EycohN8p1x23w" hash="5RlVjQ">He recounted that one morning a poor little crippled boy in ragged clothes and badly worn shoes came to a busy street corner and went from person to person, begging for a few lira without success. A man observing the boy from a distance finally went over and picked up this little lad, held him tightly and loved him, and then went forth and cared for him with his means without any judgment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p4" pid="SS9FlkaBY0KE2dBhNh8wpA" hash="2yvpwA">This sight would have touched any heart and helps us see the power of love that our Father in Heaven would have us understand in our lives. Jesus, the beloved Son of God, reemphasized this new dimension to bless the world when He said, “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.34" class="scriptureRef">John 13:34</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p5" pid="ZcqHR6jU50-l--gsF-2keA" hash="0gNCGQ">As we step back and try to understand this love of God, we are astounded by its profound impact. At its center is the reality of a literal Father in Heaven whose love for His children knows no bounds. All truths, wisdom, power, goodness, and love He desires to share with His children, whom He created and sent to earth. He would have us reach up and know Him as a Father, as one who forgives, as a helper, as friend, as lawgiver—as one anxious to grant to every man the full opportunity of His love and potential and ultimately the blessing to one day become like Him. This love from Father in Heaven and its effects upon <span class="emphasis">one</span> of His children or the whole world is miraculous and contagious. He is constantly and everlastingly watching over us to lovingly and gently nudge us along.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p6" pid="jRs-Kb4geEGHCCSVWUamVg" hash="DPLESA">He reaches down, through His Son; through prayer, His spirit, His prophets; and through His commandments to express His love and concern and provide His guidance and discipline to everyone who will listen. As the Psalmist said, “The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/33.5" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 33:5</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p7" pid="45-nTlwdB0WhGG7WSfE0iQ" hash="eLTRHA">He loves us so much that He gave us His most sacred eternal truths—His commandments—eternal standards to live by. To help us understand their importance, He revealed and surrounded them in sacred and holy settings. Who does not remember how the Ten Commandments were given? Men have constantly changed these commandments, but we testify to the world, they have been restored on this earth through a prophet of God because they are essential, eternal truths and if altered by man, lose their power. We testify to the world that these laws—commandments—standards—are one of the highest manifestations of the love God has for His children. Yes, they are commandments—absolutes—to plant the seeds of God’s love, His ways, and His divinity in us. They are the fountainhead of all real security, and the inner man recognizes this instinctively and rejoices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p8" pid="EhCaWxaB3U6-zZ-HSClbhg" hash="PNlg6Q">This same loving God also “so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16</a>) to perform a myriad of blessings for all mankind, including the offering of His own life to atone for man. He lived His life to demonstrate that the love of our Father in Heaven and His plan, His commandments, could in fact bring inner peace and lift mankind here and hereafter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p9" pid="IqXs4KVTmki4Wz24xR2TJg" hash="A1GUfg">My assignments these past few months have taken me to many lands, and with all my heart this morning I want to bear witness to the fact that when God’s love is known and felt and His commandments followed, the results are always the same. There is a newness of life—a spiritual awakening—that comes to man, its own witness that it is true. It is never forced or brought about by fear, but rather by a bond of love that develops between our Father in Heaven and His children. It is no wonder that we are counseled to look to God and live. This love reaches deep into the inner man, removes barriers, and causes an open spirit to emerge to be receptive to truth, goodness, and change. As it develops in man, he is turned outward toward others—gradually overcoming himself. When we humbly seek our Father in Heaven by prayer, and by learning and keeping His commandments, He transfers to us His love and many of His powers. Thousands bear witness that His words “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.10" class="scriptureRef">John 15:10</a>) are true. We then, as the Savior said, begin to attach ourselves as branches to the “true vine” and receive the same strength and power and can expect the same fruit. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.1-6" class="scriptureRef">John 15:1–6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p10" pid="sT75u0T8IUiZNI1pVUwsiQ" hash="zoNNKQ">Then the miracle really happens. Men thus touched and changed by this love of God begin to look upon their neighbors with profound respect and awe for who they are, what their potential really is as children of an eternal father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p11" pid="hgmh7N4nV0Oh8YKhVIYr2g" hash="hEHEVA">I had a very special experience a few years ago on an assignment to Oregon. After a stake conference I was asked to bless a little child. A couple was ushered into a room, and I learned that day what the love of God really was. They had adopted six or seven abandoned, physically handicapped little children who would need their love and care the rest of their lives. I felt humble in their presence, and the love of God filled that room that day. They were no more strangers to God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p12" pid="3J5M56VY7kmvTyWT0Lt15g" hash="lWulEg">As man perceives this love, he begins to overlook the flaws that make up every mortal being and to “esteem his brother as himself.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:24</a>.) He lifts and desires to help him whenever and wherever he can. Man’s spirit reaches out to everyone, for now there is no enmity, no envy, no restricting philosophies, pride, or vanity—even language does not separate men—there is only an openness and oneness with the Spirit and will of God. The scriptures are beautiful and clear:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p13" pid="e1H9V7-klE-qOpsGPczg6A" hash="B-vDdQ">“There [will be] no contention in the land,” “because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.15" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:15</a>, <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/5.5" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 5:5</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p14" pid="zyaZrlmy7UaG-aAc49nhVA" hash="7zVGwQ">Does this mean that those who embrace these things will be perfect? No, for they will forever be overcoming and growing. But it does mean that they will be striving toward perfection. The great prophet Moroni counseled us with a profound insight on this point when he said, “Condemn me not because of mine imperfection, neither my father … but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.31" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 9:31</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p15" pid="B3P4euTXBESEhmtkUwnHQg" hash="jgunFg">It is by achieving this gift, this love of God, that we are able to crowd out contention, discord, and judgments. It recognizes the power and goodness innate in man and how totally inconsistent it would be for one having these feelings—this love from God in their lives—to find himself judging others, not sustaining His leaders, for these things are absolutely foreign to the love of God. Our Father in Heaven said that “no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/12.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 12:8</a>.)</p>

I saw eighty-two little children sing songs of love to their Heavenly Father. I was so grateful for the Church which has been reestablished upon the earth, and that I too had one day been a Primary child, and my children also, and had learned those songs and the love they express. I’ve sung those songs thousands of times since my youth and am grateful for the love and the message they bring. On this very same day in that sacrament meeting was a new convert who is awaiting the arrival of her first child. She was so touched by the children, the Church, the Primary, and the love of our Heavenly Father that was there. She later excitedly said, “Oh, I can hardly wait to have my child so she can go to Primary.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p26" pid="nDVMFffejk2j4Rx31f_vDQ" hash="fO2Fkg">My beloved friends, this is only one of the many great programs and blessings that our Father in Heaven has provided in His church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Yes, there is a place of beauty—a refuge upon the earth—where the unchanging standards revealed by a loving Father in Heaven are found.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/love-one-another.p27" pid="jxxCVzDSLUWWLerAWvTh7A" hash="M4ncvw">Now all of this is really what the Lord had in mind, isn’t it, when he said, “As I have loved you, … love one another.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.34" class="scriptureRef">John 13:34</a>.) That will forever be the ultimate invitation of the Lord to everyone everywhere. We invite all men with all our love to come and partake of this spirit, this peace, this love of God that is in His kingdom here upon the earth today.</p>

A few years ago, just before our departure for a mission to Belgium, our family went on a vacation. Upon arriving at a motel, our children were out of their clothes and into swimming suits before we could unload the car. As I passed the swimming pool, the sign struck me forcefully: “Do Not Leave Children Unattended.” Though I had read similar signs and ignored them many times before, I felt compelled to stay and watch my young children. (My wife wasn’t very happy; she was unloading the car.) In minutes, one of my daughters was in deep water, and deep trouble, and struggling for help. I dove into the pool, clothes and all, and with all the energy I had, I reached her just in time. I recognized that frantic yet unspoken call for help that day, and I will never forget it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-and-basic-needs-of-people.p2" pid="gDXFDtj3F0aSLDkk835vkg" hash="Lwl6Uw">There are basic needs of people that are not always so obvious as this experience; but they are there, and their nearly inaudible voices are there if we can and will hear—signs and silent voices everywhere that say, “I feel that there is something, somewhere, that I need, that will give me peace, that will comfort me and let me know that my life has purpose and importance, that I belong.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-and-basic-needs-of-people.p3" pid="siNz7Z8DhE2wF9v5UzmOZg" hash="z63dNA">A few years ago a psychiatrist, Dr. Henry Link, after going through years of study and thousands of cases, found—though he had not been a Christian—that the gospel of Jesus Christ was the single greatest influence to make people happier, healthier, and more successful. So impressed was he by what he learned that he became a devout follower of Jesus Christ and wrote a book entitled <span class="emphasis">The Return to Religion.</span> As I have thought about this, I think of the statement of the Savior: “By every word which proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good thing.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.25" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:25</a>.)</p>

A new little puppy at our home barked endlessly for the first week because it missed its mother, and when any one of us would pick it up, it felt secure and wanted, that it belonged—and it stopped barking.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-and-basic-needs-of-people.p6" pid="HT-mkFR8T0K56Llzz6qXwQ" hash="F9UOIg">As a fifth-grader years ago, I felt a desperate need to belong; and just being on a baseball team with a uniform created that security, that belonging, for me. The gospel of Jesus Christ can answer this great need for every man, woman, and child upon this earth—for every family, every single person. Everyone who joins His church immediately belongs, no matter who he is or where he is. There is a brotherhood that goes beyond national and linguistic borders, and it ties all men together. The truths of the gospel, the brotherhood and the sisterhood of the gospel, and active participation in it, satisfies these longings and can overcome all barriers.</p>

He told his leader, “Please take a white flag and go to the other side and see if there is a Mormon elder who could administer to me.” What a bizarre request in a war of two mortal enemies. But seeing his condition, and anxious to satisfy what appeared to be a last request, the leader took the white flag, went across the enemy line, and asked for a Mormon elder. One was found and he, with the German, crossed the enemy line, laid his hands upon that brother’s head, and commanded in the name of the Lord that he remain alive until help could be had. There is a sense of belonging that is fulfilled by the gospel of Jesus Christ—first to our Father in Heaven; then to our family, which can be an eternal unit; and then to members everywhere upon this earth.</p>

They went by bus and stopped in Provo, Utah, for a while. They had no particular destination in mind, and they took a cab and rode around the Provo area. They liked what they saw and felt, and the very next day bought a home there. They came from a large city in the Midwest and, though they had lived in the same home for forty-two years, they knew nearly no one. When they moved into our ward area, it wasn’t hours until food, help, and friendship were offered. They could not believe what was happening. They now belonged to other warm, compassionate beings—beings who truly loved them and brought security, warmth, and the true love of Christ into their lives. They were never the same again. They belonged to a larger family and were truly happier than they had ever been in their lives.</p>

Listen to his words as he described how it was: “Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:19</a>.)</p>

They belonged the minute it was known they were members of the church of Jesus Christ. Everyone who lives upon this earth needs this feeling of acceptance, and the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and His church bring it about. Even though a member lives alone, he is never alone. He belongs; he contributes; he is never forgotten.</p>

Though he was an American foreigner, so to speak, he belonged to the household of God, and literally thousands of people in Holland and other lands, and the Apostles of the Lord, knelt and prayed for his life—if it was the will of God that he should live. Think of it—and it happens hundreds of times every day upon this earth. He belonged to the family of God; he felt their fasting and prayers and love. And what about his wife? She belonged as she had never known possible. I was there. I was a witness, and there were so many calls from those who belong to the household of God that she actually became weary.</p>

As I speak these words, I think of the elders quorum in Geneva, Switzerland, that has undertaken the project of moving all ward members when they relocate within the ward, without any cost. (They can’t even get away from us in a move!) Latter-day Saints everywhere open their hearts, their homes, their purses, their lives, in service and love to others. This is not done by constraint, but by the love and joy they feel from God and for each other. Indeed, this is the essence of the gospel as the Savior lived and taught it. Remember his words: “Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:27</a>.) “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>.)</p>

Everyone who belongs to His church <span class="emphasis">wants</span> to reach out—not because he is directed in an institutional or organizational way—to serve, love, aid, succor, and care for others with kindness and genuine concern. In humble, selfless ways each of us can be a light to others who may secretly or silently be longing or even praying to find that sense of belonging. My brothers and sisters, this type of caring, of nurturing, can never be accomplished by mandate or calendar, but comes because one has within himself that sense of belonging—feels its power, joy, goodness, and becomes concerned about all of God’s children.</p>

We belong to these truths, this brotherhood, and these promises—but also we belong to the organization of the church of Jesus Christ. We are really needed, and we learn in His service. We grow in compassion, in wisdom, in character, in appreciation, and in strength as we become “anxiously engaged in [His] cause.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27</a>.) We become more like Him. We begin—if we serve with purity of heart and selflessly—to learn the ways of the Lord. We become more responsive to the needs of others.</p>

He said: “And after they had been received unto baptism, … they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God. … [And they did] speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/6.4-5" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 6:4–5</a>.) Let us reach out to every member, that he might belong to the household of God.</p>

One time in a stake conference, one of my great friends and reactivated brothers stood and bore his testimony of the power that had come into his life because of the teachings of Jesus Christ and of those who had ministered unto him. His heart was full, his eyes overflowed, as he stood before the audience with his arms around his two sons. He said, “My gratitude knows no bounds. My life has been totally changed by the gospel and by the people who have truly loved me. I will need to spend the rest of my life ministering and teaching others as partial repayment for all that I have received.”</p>

As a home teacher, he was assigned to some special, great families who, as he had once been, were away from the Church and had challenges—some almost overwhelming.</p>

He visited and visited and served them in every way that he could. At first (just as he had been), they didn’t want to talk to him or hear his message, and often they would leave the room when he came. But he understood, for he had done it himself a hundred times to others, leaving his wife alone to hear them. He understood how they felt, expressed as follows by a reactivated man who is currently a bishop in the Church:</p>

When you lose the Spirit of the Lord, you don’t judge things properly. You look to judge negatively and to find fault. You wrap yourself in your own cocoon, so to speak, and you rationalize. But when I started working with these men, I found some of these fellows like to do the things that I like to do. I found out that they put their shoes on the same way I did. It was the influence of those men; they accepted me. They put their arms around me, and they accepted me for what I was and who I was. And we went to work, and I ate in their homes. And I just started catching the Spirit.”</p>

Every day after work for twenty years, he bought alcohol and consumed it until he could hardly find his way home. He received friendship and encouragement to pray to heaven for help. One day after his work, while he was driving into the countryside with his bottle, a voice came into his heart to stop his car, walk out into the field, and pray to Father in Heaven for help. His simple prayer was heard by his Father in Heaven, and as he stood up and walked back to his car, all desire to drink liquor left his life. The powers of heaven had descended upon him, and he knew that God lived and loved him.</p>

My heart has been touched as I think of how powerful and important the words are: “They taught and did minister one to another.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.19" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 26:19</a>.)</p>

Kimball gave these insights about the ministry of the Savior: “Never did the Savior give in expectation. I know of no case in his life in which there was an exchange. He was always the giver, seldom the recipient. Never did he give shoes, hose, or a vehicle; never did he give perfume, a shirt, or a fur wrap. His gifts were of such a nature that the recipient could hardly exchange or return the value. His gifts were rare ones: eyes to the blind, ears to the deaf, and legs to the lame; cleanliness to the unclean, wholeness to the infirm, and breath to the lifeless. His gifts were opportunity to the downtrodden, freedom to the oppressed, light in the darkness, forgiveness to the repentant, hope to the despairing. His friends gave him shelter, food, and love. He gave them of himself, his love, his service, his life. The wise men brought him gold and frankincense. He gave them and all their fellow mortals resurrection, salvation, and eternal life. We should strive to give as he gave. To give of oneself is a holy gift.” (<span class="emphasis">The Wondrous Gift,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1978, p. 2.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.title" class="scriptureRef">Alma 17–19</a>.) Ammon, one of the sons of Mosiah, truly gave himself to teaching and ministering unto the people for over fourteen years. He had waxed strong in the knowledge of truth by searching the scriptures diligently, by much prayer and fasting, and he received the spirit of prophecy and revelation and taught with power and authority from God. He prayed that he might be an instrument in the hands of God to bring the knowledge of the truth unto the Lamanites, a wild and hardened and ferocious people. As he came to the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites bound him and carried him before the king, Lamoni, to slay him or to make a slave of him. <span class="emphasis">And now the ministry and teaching began.</span></p>

He tended the flocks with others until a certain day came, and a number of the Lamanites scattered their flocks, causing grave concern, for the king usually killed those who lost their flocks. But this scattering filled Ammon’s heart with joy, for he said, “Now I will show the power that is within me.” He overpowered the enemy and gathered the flocks, and all were astonished at his power, for none of the enemy could touch him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/they-taught-and-did-minister-one-to-another.p15" pid="lTvlLxjpYkK1H93MwSZfpg" hash="W79yew">As the servants returned and testified of the miraculous things that had happened, the king sought to talk to Ammon, who was even at that moment feeding the king’s horses and preparing his chariots. The king was even more astonished and said, “He doth even remember all of my commandments to execute them.”</p>

His words as he came unto the king were, “I am a man and thy servant; therefore, whatever thou desirest which is right, that will I do.”</p>

Ammon now had that great opportunity to really influence the king and all of the people, to now teach them of God, and His truths and to extend His blessings. Miracles had already occurred and would follow as the king himself was raised from his bed by Ammon. Many did believe, were baptized, and became a righteous people. The Church was established among them.</p>

As I sat in that meeting attended by over three hundred sisters and saw the outstanding presentation—the choir of mothers and children singing and the testimonies of half a dozen of those sisters about the joys and goodness that had come into their lives because of Relief Society—I knew what I wanted to say to you today. And that is to seek the blessings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Listen to some of their comments in that meeting about the Church and its organization.</p>

Several years ago my husband died suddenly, and I felt as if my world had collapsed around me. But just as suddenly, I was surrounded by a wonderful circle of sisters who helped bear my burden. They are always there. Our weekly trips to the temple bring such peace and comfort into my life. I rejoice in this sweet sisterhood.”</p>

There were feelings within me that I cannot fully explain, but I recognized what the Church had done to bless my life and everyone around me who had truly accepted it and become involved in it.</p>

Our passage here on this earth is a proving ground, a period of growth and choice, and a time “to prepare to meet God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.24" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:24</a>). He has given us His Spirit to guide us and His truth and His church to influence us to recognize these powers and use them. One great man in Book of Mormon days who fought against these principles and teachings of the church was Alma the Younger, who was struck dumb and, after the Church spent days of fasting and prayer, was revived and spoke these words:</p>

He was told forthrightly and with great love that she wanted the power of the priesthood in her home and the blessings of an eternal family, and she would only marry someone who could give her those blessings. The teachings she had received had taken root, and the seeds of faith, knowledge, and choice had grown, and she knew that they were true.

A great shepherd, a bishop of the young girl, went to the father and helped him to see the value of that young woman, her standards, the Church, and the really truly important things in life. The father was touched that day as he attended the baptism and saw about twenty young men and women of the Church. Following the service, he asked that the missionaries come teach him. A young woman had taken on the divine nature and was able to share the priceless truths with others.</p>

Jesus Christ was central to that plan. Christ would come to earth, give of Himself to people every day, overcome the world, establish His ways for others to follow, and then take upon Himself the sins of the world in Gethsemane, and then be raised from the tomb to live again and tell us that we would live. He would give to the world hope and eternal perspectives. He would offer the way, the truth, and the light by which it could be done. His message would illuminate every human aspiration, every hope, and desire.</p>

All these witnesses certify of Him, and of the things He taught, and of the guidelines or standards—yes, the commandments—He gave that man could securely pass through this earth with joy and happiness and eternal blessings.</p>

Miraculous events surrounded His birth, and acknowledgment was given from heaven that this indeed was the Only Begotten Son of God sent to earth to redeem all mankind from death.</p>

He gave a special power, the gift of the Holy Ghost, to all who would follow Him and be baptized, which would, He said, be a Comforter, would guide to all truth, would teach all things, would bring all things to our remembrance, would show us all things to come, and would be a witness, and testify of Him.

He raised the dead and made the blind see. He fed thousands on several occasions from just a few loaves of bread and some fishes. He forgave the repentant sinner, gave hope and encouragement, and administered to others all the days of His life. And then he offered Himself, though in the greatest agony and pain ever known to mankind, upon the cross as a final witness of His love for you and me by taking our sins upon Himself, a pure and sinless Son of God, that we might have eternal life. He did something for us that we could not do for ourselves. But think of the great blessing that came a few days later when the tomb was open and He emerged as the living, resurrected, immortal Christ, showing us that He lives and that we, too, would live.</p>

The people in ancient America were so touched and changed by the teachings and power of the Savior that they lived His teachings for over two hundred years.

But, unfortunately, man would ultimately change His truths, His church, and lose sight of His promises. And so, in the year 1820, Jesus would again cross the veil that separates earth life and life hereafter in response to a fervent desire and prayer of a young man, Joseph Smith, Jr., and provide the <span class="emphasis">witnesses again.</span></p>

This will bring us peace and safety in a world of ever more frightening challenges and will ultimately make us witnesses ourselves of Him and His work and take us home one day to our Father in Heaven crowned with glory and eternal lives. Ken, won’t you take that journey? I bear to you my solemn testimony that it is true. There are witnesses—the New and Old Testaments. There are Apostles and prophets upon this earth today. His church is upon this earth today, and I do so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The prophet Mormon tells us that “by the power of [the Lord’s] word did they cause prisons to tumble.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.24" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:24</a>.) In recent weeks, I have reread the stories of Jean Valjean in Victor Hugo’s brilliant novel <span class="emphasis">Les Miserables</span> and of Bob Merrick in the novel <span class="emphasis">Magnificent Obsession</span> by Lloyd C. Douglas. These two stories, though widely different in time, circumstances, and affluence, have touched my heart in many ways.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p2" pid="Lr7kfh43AEanuc5UbjIK0w" hash="ZOvIOg">I have agonized as I have thought about the ordeal of Jean Valjean—the nineteen years in prison and the things done to him for the small transgression of stealing a loaf of bread to feed a starving family. He suffered so many indignities, even after he was finally released from the physical prison.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p3" pid="knjmw5nacEaXfZx9RwKD4g" hash="Qj-m_g">Some of the same feelings flood my mind as I reflect upon the self-inflicted sufferings of Bob Merrick. The life of a prominent surgeon was lost and the sight of another because of Bob Merrick’s wayward activities, selfishness, ego, and disdain for others. He suffered in a prison of his own making.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p4" pid="PWnARzunZEWtIjk3LvIKAw" hash="36miuw">Yes, I realize these masterfully crafted episodes are fictional, but they cause me to think about the various types of prisons Satan leads us into building for ourselves and others, or that others build for us.</p>

How did you feel when the doors were opened to your personal prison? How was it to feel free? How wonderful it is to be liberated from any kind of a prison.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p6" pid="mzAwa-jsD0CW0JPQq5Ak9A" hash="wmQO9g">I remember how I felt forty-one years ago when I was taken from a train in Europe at 2:00 <small>A.M.</small> by two soldiers of a hostile nation and held against my will. I was verbally and physically abused. I felt I would never see my family or my country again. I assure you that while I was held captive, the blood coursed through my veins like adrenaline. Though the captivity lasted less than a day, it seemed like an eternity. And when I was put on another train and sent back to safety, my gratitude to the Lord knew no bounds. I was <span class="emphasis">free!</span> As I talked to the train conductor, I learned that hundreds had not been so lucky.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p7" pid="C_R0yDpPw0yX7zHrEDgRGg" hash="J6yygg">I then was led to think of Him who really delivers us from various types of prisons into forgiveness, a newness of life, of spirit, of change, and of opportunity, and how the souls of men find such relief, fulfillment, and safety when this occurs. I thought of the Son of God and His greatest freewill offering to each of us, given at the expense of His own life and under excruciating pain. I thought of how our Father in Heaven loves each one of us. And though we sometimes walk into prisons of our own making, He is there with keys to unlock the doors that bind us. I thought of those who help along the way, who share in turning those keys which deliver others, and who care so deeply sometimes that they rebuild the trust of others—like the two men of God in the novels helped to free Jean Valjean and Bob Merrick from their prisons into magnificent, new freedoms promised by the Lord.</p>

They are very subtle and take various forms in life, like (1) taking advantage of another; (2) bearing false witness to get gain; (3) knowing things to be true and not defending them; (4) stealing the morality of another; (5) destroying the innocence of a little child; (6) being captive to alcohol or drugs; (7) or financially digging a pit for another, causing hardship and destroying his ability to take care of his needs and so on. There are many prisons which come from our sins or the sins of others “according to the captivity and power of the devil” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>) who leads us away.</p>

The prophet Job counseled us not to “dig a pit for your friend.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/6.27" class="scriptureRef">Job 6:27</a>.) I understand that could mean a business associate, a neighbor, a member of the Church. How could this happen?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p10" pid="AnLZSECkvkqTn8GN2clv_A" hash="6LJytA">Several years ago, a great young man had a thriving business. He had worked long, hard hours for many years to develop the skills, reputation, and expertise necessary to build his business and provide for the needs of his young family. He loved his work, and every morning he anxiously began each new project with creativity and opportunity. His was a great life, filled with much hope and many projects. Then one major project was completed and finalized. Rather large payments were anticipated, but a shrewd businessman found that oral approvals, given to my friend to make many necessary alterations in the project, could easily be broken and not honored. After all, there was no written record of the changes requested. It was just “good business” to get it as cheap as possible, even after commitments were made. And so verbal commitments were not honored. The money due, which was considerable, was not paid.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/by-the-power-of-his-word-did-they-cause-prisons-to-tumble.p11" pid="B8IWXvBLxUucWzmt2AswXw" hash="ERJumg">At this point we have several prisons that are now in place: the prison of deceit of the “shrewd” businessman, and the prison of the deceived, who could not now honor his own commitments. To this day the one deceived, through further industry and much hardship, is still trying to get out of the prison created by another. And he has lost confidence in others, and he and his family have lost opportunities and his business because of another.</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/22.5" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 22:5</a>.)</p>

But they should not happen. They often cause years of anguish. They cause those involved to wonder about justice and mercy. Sometimes they find it impossible to resolve their own personal affairs honorably.</p>

For He taught, in effect, Do unto others as ye would have them do unto you. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.12" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/14.12" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 14:12</a>.) He taught, “Behold it is my will that you shall pay all your debts.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.78" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 104:78</a>.) Yes, even if it takes years, pay your debts.</p>

Many widows, single mothers, and older couples are victimized by those who take advantage of them, who do not honor their commitments and then put them into a type of prison. Those affected find themselves pleading for someone to open their prison doors, often while babies cry for bare necessities.</p>

We become like one man who said that when he joined this Church it changed the way he thought, the way he talked, the way he believed, the way he dressed, the way he worked and honored his employer, the things he read, the movies he saw, the way he conducted his financial affairs in absolute honesty with everyone, and the way he served others. He truly believed in the liberating power of the gospel of Jesus Christ and became free because of it. As is stated in the book of John, “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.36" class="scriptureRef">John 8:36</a>.)</p>

He would leave work, buy his alcohol, drive into the countryside, and drink until he could barely find his way home. He truly was under the captive spirit of the devil and lived in hell. A faithful home teacher loved this brother, saw him often, taught him to pray for help, and prayed for him often. One day while he was driving his pickup truck into the countryside to begin his daily alcohol ritual, he felt a powerful influence to stop his truck, walk out into a field, fall to his knees, and plead for help from his Father in Heaven. Later, he tearfully testified that as he arose from his knees, the desire to drink alcohol had completely left him. He had been delivered from a twenty-year prison. God heard his prayer, felt the desire of his heart, and opened the prison doors that bound him.</p>

For his word is his bond—sacred and honored. His life becomes the testament that it is all true—every principle and every word that proceeded from the mouth of the Savior and His prophets. By living these cardinal principles, we are truly free and we become the witnesses of His word.</p>

It is your soul I am buying for you, and I give it to God.” (Victor Hugo, <span class="emphasis">Les Miserables,</span> vol. 1, bk. 2, chap. 12.) No more prisons for others, if you will, because of my actions.</p>

He walked the path, taught the way, opened the doors to truly liberate mankind, and said, “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.32" class="scriptureRef">John 8:32</a>.) The writer, Mr. Douglas, expressed it beautifully when he said to Bob Merrick, “When you find THE WAY, you will be bound—it will become an obsession—a magnificent obsession.”</p>

It is an honor to be in your presence tonight. The priesthood that is here and across the whole earth is a wondrous thing. A few months ago, I was in the main lobby of the Church Administration Building waiting for an elevator when three men came in and asked the receptionist at the front desk, “Is this where the brothers are?” The receptionist smiled, and I thought, “Isn’t that a great salutation.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-heart-and-a-willing-mind.p2" pid="gwSon35OHk6WzXOFSGT6kg" hash="q1UHiA">Wherever I go, we are brothers. It is instant, and it is reassuring. I return to my home after each assignment thanking God for this brotherhood and the love and the good works that I see. You are unbelievable, my friends.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-heart-and-a-willing-mind.p3" pid="-1w-m8C_2U6FuQqLGx7QZg" hash="nNJixw">Men of the priesthood, I remember a story about a schoolteacher who asked a returning class what their fathers had taught them about self-reliance during a summer vacation. After several accounts were told, she asked Johnny what his dad had done. And Johnny replied, “My dad taught me how to swim; he took me out in the middle of Utah Lake, threw me overboard, and told me to swim back to shore.” “Wow,” the teacher said, “that took a lot of courage.” And Johnny replied, “It wasn’t bad at all after I got out of the gunnysack.” Well, my young friends, life will be a challenge, but our Father in Heaven has given us the means to get through it safely. Let’s talk about that for a few minutes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-heart-and-a-willing-mind.p4" pid="oFNA1QGNh0KCLrFJPoOhTQ" hash="EILRwQ">The Lord wants you to have the greatest of all experiences as you make your journey on this earth. This can be a magnificent journey filled with literally thousands of tremendous experiences and spiritual confirmations if you will find your way through the many choices that will be yours along the way. The road given by our Father in Heaven is clearly marked, but the patterns and ways of the world can deceive you. But remember, “Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 2:9</a>). You are the means by which truth and goodness and eternal life will be made known to the whole world. We are all part of it. As the Lord said to Joseph Smith in 1831, we will all need “the heart and a willing mind” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:34</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-heart-and-a-willing-mind.p5" pid="XDhnV4Mr1kGkkUTgeiJvUQ" hash="ZmOLpQ">Young men, life is eternal. The Lord Jesus Christ and His servants give hope and witness to the world that the journey we take is from our Father’s presence to earth and then home again to our Father in Heaven to live eternally. We all bear this good news to the world. It is a supernal message of everlasting life and everlasting relationships—even eternal marriages and families. Nothing transcends its meaning, its value, its promise. With this knowledge and love, we can help transform hopes and dreams and help others to find eternal truths and the inward peace and security that it brings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-heart-and-a-willing-mind.p6" pid="ETbSFVDVjU2tpHp_OZp9cQ" hash="kzMYKw">For instance, consider my friend Bob and his watchcare over an elder who smoked. Nearly every morning, he would see a fellow member of his quorum and pray with him to help him overcome smoking and then give him a pack of Lifesavers or package of gum to help him during the day. Later, Bob would see him and his wife with hands linked across the temple altar, sealed for eternity. What was it that changed and helped to bring this all about? The gospel and “the heart and a willing mind.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-heart-and-a-willing-mind.p7" pid="g_d-oejiNkmRCojbsNm6qA" hash="vrhr_A">Youth, may I leave with you a few thoughts that will help you create that kind of a “heart and a willing mind.” <span class="emphasis">First,</span> we testify to this world that <span class="emphasis">there is a God and He has sent His Beloved Son</span> to establish the importance of this journey to earth and back. He has provided the plan for successfully making that journey. We just need to “trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 3:5</a>). The philosophies of men will ever be there, but they do not carry the promise of eternal life or even peace on this earth. Put your whole trust in the Lord. His scriptures and His prophets testify of Him and show the way.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Second,</span> God, through His Son Jesus Christ, has <span class="emphasis">established boundaries.</span> These are the <span class="emphasis">commandments</span> that He gives to us to help us make the journey safely. When, with “the heart and a willing mind,” we are obedient to these commandments, we go through a change process that alters the way we think, the way we feel, the way we dress, the way we live, what we eat and drink, and the way we serve others. As Alma the Younger said, “They become new creatures” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.26" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 27:26</a>). These boundaries protect us. They are essential to a safe journey.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-heart-and-a-willing-mind.p9" pid="9xzHmdQ3fEKIrV5vdy3yaA" hash="gcpKVQ">When I was five years old, my mother helped me to learn about boundaries when she said to me nearly every day, “Jimmy, don’t go near the quicksand,” which was just a couple hundred feet away from our house. Well, guess what Jimmy and his young friends would do? We would go there. As we walked closer to the quicksand, one of my friends walked onto this rather wet, darker-looking sand. It looked almost like the rest of the sand. At first his feet wouldn’t move, and we all laughed. And then they sank a little deeper into the quicksand, and he panicked. He couldn’t get out of the quicksand, and he started screaming. The rest of us ran as fast as we could go to a cowboy’s house, screaming at the top of our voices. He immediately grabbed a rope and ran with us back to the boy, who was now up to his waist in the quicksand. He quickly lassoed the boy, and we held the rope while he put out a log and climbed onto it to pull the boy out of the quicksand.</p>

	<p pid="e9P6mjEn_Em2Fr5dzRkcwQ" hash="GyDI4w">We learn that when we cross over the Lord’s boundaries, we are often caught in a quicksand of sorts. The ways of the world are often like that quicksand, and they can be so destructive. They seek to divert us from the Lord’s boundaries—His commandments. These worldly ways (drugs, drinking, smoking, living together without marriage, some of the music, and on and on):</p>

We go forth as missionaries and as members to help people find and value the commandments or boundaries of the Lord. If it is done with “the heart and a willing mind,” or in other words anxiously, happily, and enthusiastically, like President Hinckley as he goes forth across the earth, it will make us different, appreciative, and thankful for each opportunity that we take.</p>

After many meetings, the family was baptized. Now this son was on a mission. I later learned that over the years more than 170 people had been baptized by that family. I had been privileged to serve a mission, and those two and a half years were crucial to my testimony. I cannot thank God enough.</p>
