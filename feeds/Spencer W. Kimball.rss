They curse. They blaspheme. Another sin is disobedience of children to parents and parents’ disobedience to law.

Still in the dictionary, it means self-restraint, in sexual activities especially. Many good people, being influenced by the bold spirit of the times, are now seeking surgery for the wife or the husband so they may avoid pregnancies and comply with the strident voice demanding a reduction of children. It was never easy to bear and rear children, but easy things do not make for growth and development. But loud, blatant voices today shout “fewer children” and offer the Pill, drugs, surgery, and even ugly abortion to accomplish that. Strange, the proponents of depopulating the world seem never to have thought of continence!</p>

With a theory that “life is for sex,” every imagination of the minds of men devises ways to more completely get what they call “sexual fulfillment,” which they demand at the expense of all else—family, home, eternal life. There should be from press and lecture platform and pulpit deep and resounding voices urging man to rise above the carnal and rest his mind on things clean and sacred.</p>

But now comes a heavenly voice: “Thou shalt not commit adultery; and he that committeth adultery, and repenteth not, shall be cast out.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:24</a>.)</p>

He called them “spots … and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings,” “having eyes full of adultery”; “beguiling unstable souls.” He speaks of their “lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness”; and those who return to their sin after having been cleansed he likens to the dog returning to its vomit and the sow that has been washed returning to her wallowing again in the mire.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p1" guid="b5ff2110-b6bf-4ed6-9463-8b1989559589" pid="et5hC0h2hkSrqySQZA6Bag" hash="40Ae1Q">My beloved brothers and sisters and friends: Much is being said of deep crime which darkens heaven’s windows. We shudder at immoralities which terrify us. We nearly panic at the divorce frequency and broken homes and delinquent children about us. But perhaps sometimes we should stop to reflect that all are not criminals, all are not bad, and all are not rebellious.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p2" guid="228ccf5f-d3a2-472e-b555-191e2562b4c4" pid="SeBytWZliUap88csPWAGjQ" hash="kJ2z5g">More than once I have repeated an experience I had in getting my portrait painted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p3" guid="6fdd1b27-259a-4060-a9ec-90de6d9ac2c5" pid="hGwOKS_9EUSBPHPFIPgtOA" hash="JCeJHQ">In the temple on the fourth floor is the room of the Council of the Twelve Apostles with large chairs in a semicircle. Here important meetings of that body are held. Around its walls are portraits of the Brethren. When I came to this service, I looked upon them with admiration and affection, for these were truly great men with whom I was associated.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p4" guid="170d9086-2c1a-4017-9ad5-3c72b8cd22f3" pid="yhOBKJvRpUuCqtKpP71l2g" hash="_4t2-w">Sometime later authorization was given by the First Presidency of the Church for my portrait to be added to the others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p5" guid="26d95b74-96a0-4d70-8ef8-19ebc90eb947" pid="3eETwShLpkSNYunxfmh2Eg" hash="c7r__Q">Lee Greene Richards was selected as the artist, and we began immediately. I sat on a chair on an elevated platform in his studio and tried very hard to look handsome, like some of the other brethren. With paints, brushes, and palette ready, the artist scrutinized my features and daubed on the canvas alternately. I returned many times to the studio. After weeks the portrait was exhibited to the First Presidency and later to my wife and daughter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p6" guid="0c25f6cc-706a-4cc3-9cc2-b459fcc1158e" pid="rqWW_XuFhkS9c72dKtgXoQ" hash="nS-Xkg">It did not pass, and I was to submit to a redoing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p7" guid="23293b8e-8ee9-4bfb-b765-e508debb96db" pid="c2pl4tBrbUCE_VF1k0OpYQ" hash="V3gvCw">The angle was changed, the hours—many of them—were spent, and finally the portrait was near completion. This particular day was a busy one like most others. I suppose I was daydreaming, and quite detached from this world. Apparently he had difficulty translating my faraway gaze onto the canvas. I saw the artist lay down his palette and paints, fold his arms, and look straight at me, and I was shocked out of my dreaming by the abrupt question: “Brother Kimball, have you ever been to heaven?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p8" guid="c6778140-ec01-4a78-aa68-99c882a928a5" pid="9v5BN_LW-k2SqHLIW07QEw" hash="HHKXog">My answer seemed to be a shock of equal magnitude to him as I said without hesitation: “Why, yes, Brother Richards, certainly. I had a glimpse of heaven just before coming to your studio.” I saw him assume a relaxed position and look intently at me, with wonder in his eyes. I continued:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p9" guid="ceab33c3-f06f-45f8-bf1b-6e4bdf95eb3e" pid="ZRULqgD0Jk-ImzcmQtFmVg" hash="bkV2lw">“Yes. Just an hour ago. It was in the holy temple across the way. The sealing room was shut off from the noisy world by its thick, white-painted walls; the drapes, light and warm; the furniture, neat and dignified; the mirrors on two opposite walls seeming to take one in continuous likenesses on and on into infinity; and the beautiful stained-glass window in front of me giving such a peaceful glow. All the people in the room were dressed in white. Here were peace and harmony and eager anticipation. A well-groomed young man and an exquisitely gowned young woman, lovely beyond description, knelt across the altar. Authoritatively, I pronounced the heavenly ceremony which married and sealed them for eternity on earth and in the celestial worlds. The pure in heart were there. Heaven was there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p10" guid="ceee841c-4807-4679-8c01-e3be025839ce" pid="tXepQbq53kakZPl6p8HkeQ" hash="aop-gA">“When the eternal marriage was solemnized, and as the subdued congratulations were extended, a happy father, radiant in his joy, offered his hand and said, ‘Brother Kimball, my wife and I are common people and have never been successful, but we <span class="emphasis">are </span>immensely proud of our family.’ He continued, ‘This is the last of our eight children to come into this holy house for temple marriage. They, with their companions, are here to participate in the marriage of this, the youngest. This is our supremely happy day, with all of our eight children married properly. They are faithful to the Lord in church service, and the older ones are already rearing families in righteousness.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p11" guid="c6419955-74b5-4340-ad43-06114c2a2d91" pid="VaIZBnsV5keFPwOJEXYXWw" hash="y0brpw">“I looked at his calloused hands, his rough exterior, and thought to myself, ‘Here is a real son of God fulfilling his destiny.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p12" guid="dfc2a324-fdd8-49c3-b836-07a473e512f9" pid="jVOHFYoGqEWJ8GlVexf7LQ" hash="5Z0Npw">“‘Success?’ I said, as I grasped his hand. ‘That is the greatest success story I have heard. You might have accumulated millions in stocks and bonds, bank accounts, lands, industries, and still be quite a failure. You are fulfilling the purpose for which you were sent into this world by keeping your own lives righteous, bearing and rearing this great posterity, and training them in faith and works. Why, my dear folks, you are eminently successful. God bless you.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p13" guid="e5b3d4ac-30c0-4ea3-bd89-7696955d1e4b" pid="QG3icGZ_n0GStWYucXE6EQ" hash="WOImQA">My story was finished. I looked up at the portrait artist. He stood motionless in deep thought, so I continued: “Yes, my brother, I have had many glimpses of heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p14" guid="e7cb9b74-86b1-4066-b41c-775d035d061d" pid="m7VXJo8aD0mrxoe1Bad4NA" hash="fgdRFA">“Once we were in a distant stake for conference. We came to the unpretentious home of the stake president at mid-day Saturday. We knocked at the door, and it was opened by a sweet mother with a child in her arms. She was the type of mother who did not know there were maids and servants. She was not an artist’s model, nor a society woman. Her hair was dressed neatly; her clothes were modest, tastefully selected; her face was smiling; and though young, she showed the rare combination of maturity of experience and the joys of purposeful living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p15" guid="78a4ea9a-96e7-4b02-81d4-b7d1803b5f07" pid="5OCoFFteDU63EXK1xY7IJA" hash="C0Nugw">“The house was small. The all-purpose room into which we were welcomed was crowded and in its center were a long table and many chairs. We freshened up in the small bedroom assigned to us, made available by ‘farming out’ to the neighbors some of the children, and we returned to this living room. She had been very busy in the kitchen. Her husband, the stake president, soon returned from his day’s labors and made us welcome and proudly introduced us to all of the children as they returned from their chores and play.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p16" guid="d4efe7c3-fcdc-4a49-8424-69c040ec5bf9" pid="3HM5c9fxHUeIEP7g3V3ygw" hash="5O4sow">“Almost like magic the supper was ready, for ‘many hands make light work,’ and these numerous hands were deft and experienced ones. Every child gave evidence of having been taught responsibility. Each had certain duties. One child had quickly spread a tablecloth; another placed the knives and forks and spoons; and another covered them with the large plates turned upside down. (The dishes were inexpensive.) Next came large pitchers of creamy milk, high piles of sliced homemade bread, a bowl at each place, a dish of fruit from storage, and a plate of cheese.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p17" guid="e1c4926c-d582-419b-bfb1-f43eac881eaf" pid="wfrICEaWD0CitSFo5aZbgA" hash="Hq-qWQ">“One child placed the chairs with backs to the table, and without confusion, we all knelt at the chairs facing the table. One young son was called on to lead in family prayer. It was extemporaneous, and he pleaded with the Lord to bless the family and their schoolwork, and the missionaries, and the bishop. He prayed for us who had come to hold conference that we would ‘preach good,’ for his father in his church responsibilities, for all the children that ‘they would be good, and kind to each other,’ and for the little cold shivering lambs being born in the lambing sheds on the hill this wintry night.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p18" guid="d7079c32-d657-444b-84c9-fda460b4ddff" pid="9zR07pW4Skir_SOBmzXgvg" hash="IPCfHw">“A very Little one said the blessing on the food, and thirteen plates were turned up and thirteen bowls filled, and supper proceeded. No apologies were offered for the meal, the home, the children, or the general situation. The conversation was constructive and pleasant. The children were well-behaved. These parents met every situation with calm dignity and poise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p19" guid="70ec30d7-68f3-4687-a986-9e519bcb630b" pid="2caDeBamkUGlGdKurjO79Q" hash="SN6jYQ">“In these days of limited families, or childless ones, when homes often have only one or two selfish and often pampered children, homes of luxury with servants, broken homes where life moves outside the home, it was most refreshing to sit with a large family where interdependence and love and harmony were visible and where children were growing up in unselfishness. So content and comfortable were we in the heart of this sweet simplicity and wholesomeness that we gave no thought to the unmatched chairs, the worn rug, the inexpensive curtains, the numbers of souls that were to occupy the few rooms available.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p20" guid="d04ba8de-2ea1-4237-bfba-ee6140a3da9b" pid="QUiBBVabCkaUuspxPDdFGQ" hash="4PT4hA">I paused. “Yes, Brother Richards, I glimpsed heaven that day and many days, in many places.” He seemed uninterested in his painting. He stood listening, seemingly eager for more, and almost involuntarily I was telling him of another flight into heavenly situations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p21" guid="b1f62540-347a-4463-a840-3f3e47982706" pid="qh_QJG3JtkKODpl-rFlJqw" hash="5ZdCaA">“This time it was on the Indian reservation. While most Navajo women seem to be prolific, this sweet Lamanite wife in their several years of marriage had not been blessed with children of her own. Her husband was well employed. These new converts to the Church were buying their weekend groceries. As we glanced at the purchases in the large, well-filled basket, it was evident that only wholesome food was there—no beer, no coffee, no cigarettes. ‘You like Postum, do you?’ we asked them, and their reply touched our hearts: ‘Yes, we have had coffee and beer all our lives, but since the Mormon missionaries told us about the Word of Wisdom we use Postum, and we know it is better for the children and they like it.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p22" guid="1d9d22e7-e598-4360-b209-99c09d345cb3" pid="zH_OQNTB0ESB-6IgkpUsQA" hash="pJhIVQ">“‘Children?’ we asked. ‘We thought you were a childless couple.’ This brought from them the explanation that they had filled their home with eighteen Navajo orphans of all ages. Their hogan was large but their hearts even larger. Unselfishness—the milk of human kindness! Love unfeigned! These good Indians could shame many of their contemporaries who live lives of selfishness and smugness.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p23" guid="5cc2a882-c8d1-4396-b0f8-d6618ff3aae2" pid="s5H_LTipRka8cT4kl5m7aQ" hash="l23jzA">I said to the artist: “Heaven can be in a hogan or a tent, Brother Richards, for heaven is of our own making.” I was ready to return to the picture but apparently he was not so inclined. He stood and listened intently.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p24" guid="a4a68289-b415-49b4-9f6b-32801ded7b2d" pid="MmZVmopGdE2QSpksxnxPdg" hash="fly7-w">“This time I was in Hawaii in the beautiful little temple at Laie. It was a missionary group. The spirit was there; the proselyters could hardly wait their turns to bear testimony of the Lord’s gospel. Finally, the little Japanese missionary gained the floor. By the pulpit in her stocking feet she knelt reverently, and with a heart near bursting with gratitude for the gospel and its opportunities, she poured out her soul to heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p25" guid="ff83afaa-e2da-4979-8454-d2ea574c4bbb" pid="QE8ZXX9BZ0SlwlzTd8xHew" hash="Qdqw3w">“Heaven was there, my brother, in that little room, in that sacred spot, in that paradise of the Pacific with those sweet, consecrated young soldiers for Christ.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p26" guid="9ed054bd-057e-44f9-8356-f81bef39578c" pid="6PH6Lg_x-kC2hN7g5PlHsg" hash="zu8mvg">I continued: “Heaven was in my own home, too, Dr. Richards, when home evening was held. Through the years the room was filled with our children, when each, eager for a turn, sang a song, led a game, recited an Article of Faith, told a story, and listened to faith-promoting incidents and gospel teaching from parents who loved them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p27" guid="9eb03786-3baa-4b90-a20a-41ccaef3d5ed" pid="3rdXk6ZxGEq7QzHcUwPFZQ" hash="1rejBg">“Again, I found heaven in Europe:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p28" guid="31385fd8-3283-4878-8f5d-50ee1db088db" pid="3k61j0NiYUCa9J3A2EDrzg" hash="pnw8yg">“Elder Vogel was a local convert German boy of great faith. His parents refused to assist him in the mission which he so desired to fill. A kind American member helped with a monthly check to assist with the mission expenses. He enjoyed his work and all went well for a year and a half. One day a letter came from the wife of his sponsor, advising that her husband had been killed in an auto accident and it would be impossible to send any more money.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p29" guid="ec53a271-7d2d-4bb6-a66c-6f5591acf42d" pid="bhaQzMSeIE27kg6atoQ_Nw" hash="eQlz6A">“Elder Vogel kept his disappointment hidden and prayed earnestly for a solution. As he and his American companion, Elder Smith, passed a hospital one day, a solution to his financial problem was born in his mind. The next day he made an excuse and was gone for a time. When he came back he said little but went to bed early. When asked the reason, he said he was a little extra weary. A few days later Elder Smith noted a small bandage on the arm of the German brother, but his question was passed off lightly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p30" guid="3c36232b-096e-4b31-ae5e-cdebe5ba1f1c" pid="uYiCfsbaA0W-9bGeBiXmMQ" hash="e490OQ">“Time passed and Elder Smith became suspicious of the periodical bandages until one day, unable to keep his secret longer, Elder Vogel told him: ‘You see, my friend in America is dead and can no longer give support to my mission. My parents are still unwilling to help me, so I visit the blood bank at the hospital so I can finish my mission.’ Selling his precious blood to save souls! Well, isn’t that what the Master did when he gave his every drop in the supreme sacrifice?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p31" guid="76c8c035-9573-4709-a262-79d3155a5bf6" pid="cXY_nzI660q0uNTUc7oqLg" hash="W-DlsQ">“Do you believe in heaven, Brother Artist?” I asked. “Yes, that is it. Heaven is a place, but also a condition; it is home and family. It is understanding and kindness. It is interdependence and selfless activity. It is quiet, sane living; personal sacrifice, genuine hospitality, wholesome concern for others. It is living the commandments of God without ostentation or hypocrisy. It is selflessness. It is all about us. We need only to be able to recognize it as we find it and enjoy it. Yes, my dear brother, I’ve had many glimpses of heaven.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p32" guid="873e73fb-92bf-40d5-8f48-01286fd20ce5" pid="VvLY9ff6r0W7xbu2MzuFJA" hash="QDwbgA">I straightened up in my chair and posed again. The artist picked up his palette and brushes and paints, did some touching up of the portrait, and sighed contentedly as he said, “It is completed.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p33" guid="6c1b92f7-6afe-4eeb-8920-b61a634321ef" pid="Lc5wgMSF5UiupmxvoMVYmg" hash="27OykA">In due time it was placed with those of others of the Brethren in the Council of the Twelve room on the fourth floor of the Salt Lake Temple, where it hangs to this day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p34" guid="1b4d1d3d-473f-46a1-9ce3-a0d7adfab757" pid="Gt_vdchig0i975bafZMwRg" hash="aiuk2g">The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches men to live righteously, to make the family supreme, the home inviolate. It moves the characters of its adherents toward faultlessness. It is the true way. If lived rightly it will ennoble men toward Godhood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/glimpses-of-heaven.p35" guid="ba04f52c-c9aa-4e26-a0c0-27c8f8b88cff" pid="8rh-ZIzmlUKpB01h7Yl0pA" hash="PwKOZQ">May the true gospel of the Master reach into the lives of all of us, I pray. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

We have a great stalwart as the twelfth member in the Council now, Brother Ashton. We welcome with all our hearts Brother Peterson and Brother Featherstone into the group of General Authorities. It will be a joy to work with them and with Bishop Vandenberg and his counselors in their new capacities.</p>

It happened there in an early morning and startled every soul who heard of it.</p>

Hundreds of his intimate believing friends bore witness.</p>

It was cattle country. The road was straight and narrow for numerous miles, and on either side was a four-wire barbed fence. Parallel to the fence line was a series of poles on which were strung the wires for telephone communication to the world. Upon each telephone pole was a crossbar, and strung from crossbar to crossbar were the communication lines.</p>

Someone had carelessly thrown a lighted cigarette from a car window. It had ignited the grass, the telephone communications were ended or limited, and communication was down.</p>

Some had been burned off the first few feet from the ground and were hanging by the top part in the air from the wires they were intended to support. Dangling in the air, these sagging wires had let the poles touch the ground as they were swinging in the wind, each time creating static on the line.</p>

When the connection was made, almost invariably there would be static, and the words were cut in two and grating sounds were heard. In my mind’s eye I could see the telephone line on the Salta Road swaying in the breeze, hitting the ground and occasionally breaking connection.</p>

They are built for one purpose and sometimes serve another. They are designed to be firm and stout and to give support; but in many cases they are leaning and swaying and sagging until communications are greatly impaired, if not actually cut off.</p>

There is growing disgust and hate where there should be love and harmony.</p>

Their ideas of life were different as to spiritual matters (as well as many others)—one wishing to move along almost to what the other thought was fanaticism and the other moving along in a path that the other spouse thought to be almost apostasy; and both were wrong.</p>

Both were good people basically, but they needed unburned telephone poles and untangled wires of communication that were now sagging. Their inability to communicate in reasonableness led to anger, hard words, misunderstandings.</p>

He identified himself as a returned missionary whom I had met out in the world a few years ago. He said he had not attended the conference but had come at its conclusion, wanting to say hello. Our greetings were pleasant and revived some choice memories. I asked him about himself. He was in college, still single, and fairly miserable.</p>

I don’t feel the same as I used to feel in the mission field. What I used to think was a testimony has become something of a disillusionment. If there is a God, I am not sure any more. I must have been mistaken in my zeal and joy.”</p>

He had turned loose his hold on the iron rod. He associated largely with unbelievers. He read, in addition to his college texts, works by atheists, apostates, and Bible critics.

When the 450 priests of Baal could not influence their gods to burn the offering, and the Lord, through Elijah, brought down fire from heaven and consumed the bullock, then with a revival of faith on the part of Israel, the clouds came and a torrential rain fell.

Long will we tingle from the impressive address of President Lee, following the voting. I think almost if one had a heart of stone, it would melt with the demonstration of this morning to see all the various groups raise their hands in unison to support the leaders of the Church, and it touched my heart deeply.</p>

No theatrical stage has ever produced such acts of such engrossing interest and importance as have been the scenes of the history of the Church in these last days. The stage has changed from New York to Ohio to Missouri to Illinois to Utah. The conditions have altered and the people who have taken the parts are different people. Today another great leader is sustained. What a privilege for us who are here to be a part of such an important event! In this change in leadership of the Church, it is important that the quorums of the priesthood and the assembly of the Saints have an opportunity to express their gratitude, pledge their support and confidence, and reaffirm their covenants.</p>

Lee follows the same pattern as that of the other Presidents back for many, many years. He holds all the same keys, has the same authority, represents the same church except that it has grown much larger.</p>

In 1877 the new President, John Taylor, presided over about 145,000. Wilford Woodruff in 1887 had about 192,000 under him. When Lorenzo Snow became President in 1898, there were about 253,000 members, and then Joseph F. Smith had over a quarter of a million. President Heber J. Grant had nearly half a million; George Albert Smith one million, and when David O. McKay became President in 1951, there were over 1,100,000 members.</p>

I bear testimony too that President Lee is a prophet of God, and if we will follow him, we will make great headway in the kingdom. I bear this testimony to you in all fervor and sincerity and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

For the past three months President Harold B.

The Lord could have organized it otherwise but chose to have a unit with responsibility and purposeful associations where children train and discipline each other and come to love, honor, and appreciate each other. The family is the great plan of life as conceived and organized by our Father in heaven.</p>

He was born of goodly parents who taught him righteousness. He had flown 25 different types of military aircraft in 4,000 hours in the air. He had flown 142 combat missions in Korea and had received many distinguished medals. He told us that “before takeoff every pilot takes a few moments to make a last-minute check of his engine, flight controls, hydraulic and pneumatic systems and other essential subsystems of his aircraft to be sure the flight can at least begin safely. … His reactions to emergency conditions must be instinctive and as infallible as human thought and reflexes permit.</p>

There have been several instances … in which I know the answer to this prayer has been received with dramatic suddenness. …”</p>

If they have conscientiously and faithfully done all that is expected of them, nothing can be too far wrong.

Unembarrassed, he promptly said:</p>

Our increase in numbers is phenomenal, for the population has doubled in these past few years. Thirty years ago we counted our members in hundreds of thousands, and today over three million. There were 146 stakes in 1943 when I first visited stakes, and today there are some 635 stakes. There were 38 missions in 1943; today there are 107. In 1943 there were no stakes overseas, and now 70. This unprecedented growth pleases us, but challenges us tremendously. We are interested in numbers only incidentally. We are obsessed first to see that all men obtain eternal life.</p>

Certainly the terrible sin of premeditated abortion would be hard to justify. It is almost inconceivable that an abortion would ever be committed to save face or embarrassment, to save trouble or inconvenience, or to escape responsibility. How could one submit to such an operation or be party in any way by financing or encouraging? If special rare cases could be justified, certainly they would be rare indeed. We place it high on the list of sins against which we strongly warn the people.</p>

No fondling of bodies, one’s own or that of others, and no sex between persons except in proper marriage relationships. This is positively prohibited by our Creator in all places, at all times, and we reaffirm it. Even in marriage there can be some excesses and distortions. No amount of rationalization to the contrary can satisfy a disappointed Father in heaven. In this connection, we quote a paragraph from a popular evangelist, Billy Graham:</p>

It makes plain that God himself implanted the physical magnetism between the sexes for two reasons: for the propagation of the human race, and for the expression of that kind of love between man and wife that makes for true oneness. His command to the first man and woman to be ‘one flesh’ was as important as his command to ‘be fruitful and multiply.’</p>

It teaches clearly that sex can be a wonderful servant but a terrible master: that it can be a creative force more powerful than any other in the fostering of a love, companionship, happiness or can be the most destructive of all of life’s forces.” (Billy Graham, “What the Bible Says About Sex,” <span class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest</span> May 1970, p. 118.)</p>

It is a particular delight to us to see the fathers and their sons coming early to the Saturday night priesthood meeting—many of them an hour or two early to be sure of a good seat, and thousands of others, fathers and sons, hurrying to the Tabernacle and to the numerous stake and ward buildings all over the country. This is a delightful extension of our family life which we celebrate and love and which the world is beginning to recognize as a basic family pattern—to have fathers and sons together.</p>

The temples are generally full. The chapels are filling, and there is an increase in attendance and devotion. The families holding home evening are increasing, and we are happy with the display of faith and love which is manifested throughout the Church. We are particularly happy with the growth in numbers and effective activity in the stakes and missions overseas. It is a world Church; we believe we are getting nearer and nearer the universal church standing.</p>

The First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve have approved the organization of an elders quorum in every ward and independent branch. The elders, regardless of number, up to 96, residing in a particular ward or independent branch, may be constituted as an elders quorum, with a presidency. Where there are more than 96 elders, the quorum should be divided. It is felt by the Brethren that this great reservoir of power and strength can best be used to its greatest value to have strong, active quorums of elders in the more local jurisdictions.</p>

This should eliminate many long delays and create a good working relationship between the stake leaders and their seventies, and we hope that new emphasis may come to missionary work.</p>

Enlarging this answer we say: Certainly every male member of the Church <span class="underline">should</span> fill a mission, like he <span class="underline">should</span> pay his tithing, like he <span class="underline">should</span> attend his meetings, like he <span class="underline">should</span> keep his life clean and free from the ugliness of the world and plan a celestial marriage in the temple of the Lord.</p>

When I heard a Church leader from Salt Lake City tell us at conference that we should read the scriptures, and I recognized that I had never read the Bible, that very night at the conclusion of that very sermon I walked to my home a block away and climbed up in my little attic room in the top of the house and lighted a little coal-oil lamp that was on the little table, and I read the first chapters of Genesis. A year later I closed the Bible, having read every chapter in that big and glorious book.</p>

I had seen people chewing tobacco, and it was repulsive to me. I had seen men waste much time in “rolling their own” cigarettes. They would buy a sack of “Bull Durham” tobacco or some other brand and then some papers, and then they would stop numerous times in a day to fill the paper with tobacco and then roll it and then bend over the little end of it and then smoke it. It seemed foolish to me and seemed such a waste of time and energy. Later when the practice became more sophisticated, they bought their cigarettes readymade. I remember how repulsive it was to me when women began to smoke.</p>

I knew where it was written and I knew in a general way what the Lord had said, and I knew that when the Lord said it, it was pleasing unto him for men to abstain from all these destructive elements and that the thing I wanted to do was to please my Heavenly Father. And so I made up my mind firmly and solidly that I would never touch those harmful things. Having made up my mind fully and unequivocably, I found it not too difficult to keep the promise to myself and to my Heavenly Father.</p>

As a part of that celebration there was a sumptuous banquet for the district governors, and the large building was set for an elegant meal. When we came to our places, I noted that at every place there were seven goblets, along with numerous items of silverware and dishes; and everything was the best that Europe could furnish.</p>

Seven glass goblets were filled at every plate. The drinks were colorful. I was a long way from home; I knew many of the district governors; they knew me. But they probably did not know my religion nor of my stand on the Word of Wisdom. At any rate, the evil one seemed to whisper to me, “This is your chance. You are thousands of miles from home. There is no one here to watch you. No one will ever know if you drink the contents of those goblets. This is your chance!” And then a sweeter spirit seemed to whisper, “You have a covenant with yourself; you promised yourself you would never do it; and with your Heavenly Father you made a covenant, and you have gone these years without breaking it, and you would be stupid to break this covenant after all these years.” Suffice it to say that when I got up from the table an hour later, the seven goblets were still full of colorful material that had been poured into them but never touched an hour earlier.</p>

The young man who lived in that home was termed a kleptomaniac. He seemed to have a mania for stealing things, even items he had no use for himself. Numerous people in the town had been reporting that their buggy whips and their buggy robes were taken. Here they were under the porch, and this boy finally admitted to having stolen them. I remember how shocked we fellows were—how we pitied him because he had developed this terrible weakness!</p>

Why should she want a reward for doing right? Why should she be disappointed in the amount offered? Must people be rewarded for doing right? Would you expect a reward if you returned a lost article?

I heard this more than once in quorum meetings of the Council of the Twelve when George F. Richards was president. He was the venerable father of Brother LeGrand Richards who has just spoken to us. He said, “I believe in dreams, brethren. The Lord has given me dreams which to me are just as real and as much from God as was the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar, which was the means of saving a nation from starvation, or the dream of Lehi who through a dream led his colony out of the old country across the mighty deep to this promised land, or any other dreams that we might read in the scriptures.</p>

In this dream I was in the presence of my Savior as he stood mid-air. He spoke no word to me, but my love for him was such that I have not words to explain. I know that no mortal man can love the Lord as I experienced that love for the Savior unless God reveals it to him. I would have remained in his presence, but there was a power drawing me away from him.</p>

I know that this is the Church of God, and that it is founded on Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. I testify to you of these things as one who knows—as one of the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ that can bear witness to you today in the presence of the Lord that He lives and that He will live, and will come to reign on the earth, to sway an undisputed sceptre.” (Delivered in the October 1896 General Conference and reported in <span class="emphasis">The Deseret Weekly,</span> October 31, 1896, vol. 53, p. 610.)</p>

There were but 148 when I came to the headquarters of the Church in 1943. There were no stakes abroad, and we were to wait for many years before the Church began to cross the oceans and the great land masses. Already, since President Romney organized the Auckland, New Zealand, Stake in May 1958—there are 86 stakes overseas. We now have 112 missions, plus the 661 stake missions, and we now have approximately 18,000 missionaries, whereas in 1943 there was a very small group, relatively. We are happy with the growth, which is consistent and continues to be stable.</p>

Remember the Lord brought an end to this program many decades ago through a prophet who proclaimed the revelation to the world. People are abroad who will deceive you and bring you much sorrow and remorse. Have nothing to do with those who would lead you astray. It is wrong and sinful to ignore the Lord when he speaks.

For 141 years now we have been practicing this great truth embodied in that revelation that we would abstain from wine and strong drinks, that tea and coffee are not for the body, and that we should not use tobacco in any form, that it is good only for bruises and all sick cattle.

I remember standing by a hospital bed of a good friend of mine, and I watched him die of cancer. His physicians said it was caused by the use of tobacco. I have helped bury people who have been killed by the demon alcohol, and many other innocent people died because someone was driving who had been drinking.</p>

We are especially concerned that at Christmas time many celebrate this holy birth of Jesus Christ our Lord with a so-called social hour which surely must be an affront to him. Is it not a sad reflection upon people to have to drink to have a good time, or to take a stimulant to give them energy or self-assurance?</p>

We urge our bishops to be wise in their providing help, neither stingy nor overgenerous, and that the people who need the temporary assistance will be honest and fair and wise.</p>

The commandment says, “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.7" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:7</a>.) Except in prayers and proper sermons, we must not use the name of the Lord. Blasphemy used to be a crime punishable by heavy fines.

It is really garbage, but today is peddled as normal and satisfactory food. Many writers seem to take delight in polluting the atmosphere with it. Seemingly, it cannot be stopped by legislation. There is a link between pornography and the low, sexual drives and perversions. We live in a culture which venerates the orgasm, streaking, trading wives, and similar crazes. How low can humans plunge! We pray with our Lord that we may be kept from being in the world. It is sad that decent people are thrown into a filthy area of mental and spiritual pollution. We call upon all of our people to do all in their power to offset this ugly revolution.</p>

There is a definite relationship to crime. Murder, robbery, rape, prostitution, and commercialized vice are fed on this immorality. Sex statistics seem to reflect a relationship between crime and pornography.</p>

We are shocked at the depths to which many people of this world go to assert their freedom. We fear that the trends of permissiveness toward immorality are destroying the moral fabric of our generation.</p>

Nothing horrifies us so much as the possibility of punishing the nonguilty. But now we have carried this to an excessive concern for the guilty. We do not call him a criminal. He is a patient. He may be ill, but a failure of society; and since society cannot be tried for its crime, why should he take the blame?”</p>

Crime in the United States is said to be increasing nearly nine times as fast as the population. One-third of our firstborn children in the United States in two tabulated years were said to be conceived out of wedlock. In one year there were an estimated 400,000 illegitimate births in the United States; and many other countries have like records. About half of the female dropouts from high school were pregnant. The ugly estimates continue: More than a million American women each year resort to illegitimate abortions. This is one of the most despicable of all sins—to destroy an unborn child to save one from embarrassment or to save one’s face or comfort. An estimated 8,000 women die every year from such consequences. It is reported that suicide is said to be the number one cause of death among the U.S. college students.</p>

Right down the line Christ gives offense by His moral austerity.” He rebukes our acquisitive society. He rebukes our comfort-loving, take-it-easy philosophy. He rebukes our moral laxity. He rebukes our reliance on force and our rejection of love and of the royal way of life. Ours is a comfort-loving society. We equate comfort with civilization. Thanks to our Heavenly Father and his Son that the program is austere.</p>

An iceberg had been sighted. Most of the passengers rushed to the deck to see this sight. We could see it in the distance—a great white object against the dark sea and the azure of the sky.</p>

All my life I had heard about them, and now, for the first time, it was there before my eyes—a sharp mountain peak of ice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/ocean-currents-and-family-influences.p4" pid="wxu0QnWnuUymCJML9m3q0A" hash="ItNRVw">This recalled to our minds the tragic sinking of the <span class="emphasis">Titanic,</span> steamship of the White Star Line, on its maiden trip across the ocean. The huge iceberg collided with this large, new ship late in the evening, April 14, 1912. Fifteen hundred and three persons, many of them eminent in Britain and in the United States, were drowned as the ship sank and only 703 were saved.</p>

Much of our trip we had traveled above the blanket of clouds, but as we flew over Greenland, the sky was clear and free of clouds. The sun shone brightly. Seldom does the human eye ever see such beauty and grandeur. Stretching out in the distance was the mile-thick blanket of ice over the great, domed island. We saw the thick glaciers creeping slowly down the valleys to the sea, where they break off and become icebergs. The fjords were full of floating mountains of ice drifting on their way to the ocean. Here was the birthplace of countless such icebergs as we had seen 33 years earlier.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/ocean-currents-and-family-influences.p6" pid="ybCw_psiakWgNsTpLg0ckA" hash="W8zj1g">The icebergs spawned by the Greenland ice sheet followed a highly predictable course. As the silent Labrador Current ceaselessly moves to the south through Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, it takes with it these mountainous icebergs, even against the force of the winds and the waves and the tides. Currents have much more power to control its course than the surface winds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/ocean-currents-and-family-influences.p7" pid="LlVL194qC0yDSAvhRtFYdw" hash="3ueajg">And we compared this conflict of the earth’s powers with the results in our own lives when the current of our life, as defined and developed in the lives of a family by the righteous teaching of parents, will often control the direction children will go, in spite of the waves and winds of numerous adverse influences of the world of error.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/ocean-currents-and-family-influences.p9" pid="SpG-FUenAk6w7itolumRtQ" hash="bPkl0A">The mighty Mississippi River is a rivulet in comparison with the great ocean streams. One of the most spectacular of all is said to be the Labrador Current. The second most powerful is the Gulf Stream, which carries warm water from the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico parallel to the eastern coast of the United States and across the Atlantic to warm the shores of Europe. The Gulf Stream carries as much water as a thousand Mississippi Rivers combined. Though of lesser magnitude, the Labrador Current year after year carries thousands of icebergs down from their birthplace in Greenland, faithfully, steadily, until they disintegrate or melt in the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream. It is at this point, where the Labrador Current meets the Gulf Stream, that the <span class="emphasis">Titanic</span> met her fate.</p>

It is true also, however, that we are more like ships than icebergs. We have our own motive power, and if we are aware of the currents, we can take advantage of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/ocean-currents-and-family-influences.p11" pid="A6IIwNEfrEmuowyffeXSBg" hash="5lEFfw">Accordingly, if we can create in our families a strong, steady current flowing toward our goal of righteous life, we and our children may be carried forward in spite of the contrary winds of hardship, disappointment, temptations, and fashion.</p>

The winds of fashion push those about who are insecure and who require the feeling that they are in step with the crowd. The winds of sexual temptation drive some to destroy their marriage or to dash bright prospects or to degrade themselves. Bad companions, addicting drugs, the arrogance of profanity, the slough of pornography—all these and more act as influences pushing us, if we are not being carried forward by a strong, steady current toward the righteous life. The current of our lives should be determined and made strong by our parental and family life.</p>

We learn from the scriptures that we each have eternal existence, that we were in the beginning with God. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.22" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:22</a>.) That understanding gives to us a unique sense of man’s dignity.</p>

In this they bring sorrow to their parents, who have done their best to set in movement a current and to teach and live as examples. But I have repeatedly seen many of these same children, after years of wandering, mellow, realize what they have been missing, repent, and make great contribution to the spiritual life of their community. The reason I believe this can take place is that, despite all the adverse winds to which these people have been subjected, they have been influenced still more, and much more than they realized, by the current of life in the homes in which they were reared. When, in later years, they feel a longing to recreate in their own families the same atmosphere they enjoyed as children, they are likely to turn to the faith that gave meaning to their parents’ lives.</p>

They said, “We scrupulously train our children in our homes, so they know truth from error, and that when they go to school, the godless philosophies to which they are exposed simply run off without penetrating. Our children love and trust us and remain true to the faith.” God bless such selfless, faithful parents.</p>

The very mobility of our society means that our children are often moved from place to place and lose close contact with the extended family of grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, and longtime neighbors. It is important for us also to cultivate in our own family a sense that we belong together eternally, that whatever changes outside our home, there are fundamental aspects of our relationship which will never change. We ought to encourage our children to know their relatives. We need to talk of them, make effort to correspond with them, visit them, join family organizations, etc.</p>

All the family could attend the baptism, confirmation, and ordination of a member of the family. All of the family could root for a son who is on the ball team.

One way of establishing that is by regular, earnest prayer. It is not enough just to pray. It is essential that we really speak to the Lord, having faith that he will reveal to us as parents what we need to know and do for the welfare of our families. It has been said of some men that when they prayed, a child was likely to open his eyes to see if the Lord were really there, so personal and direct was the petition.</p>

We have motive power and are therefore able, the same as with ships, to move ourselves as we want to go. If we are aware of the currents, we can take advantage of them.

This idolatry, so closely associated with the destruction of mind and body, could inundate the world. We note the great increase in divorces. We disavow them. We sorrow with them, realizing that if there are justifiable ones, the justifiable ones are few. Generally, divorce is spelled <span class="emphasis">SELFISHNESS</span> on the part of one party, generally both. It is ugly and generally most destructive for the people concerned, in their loss, their sorrow, their loneliness and frustration, particularly with the many children who are greatly deprived. It is easy to rationalize and justify the divorce. Our study reveals the fact that all too often it is because of their immoralities and their idolatrous worship of the god of lust.</p>

Paul gave the injunctions, “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it. … So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/5.25,28-29" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 5:25, 28–29</a>.)</p>

God created male and female with special talents, powers, responsibilities, and with the ability to perform their special tasks.</p>

She is a partner with God. No being has a position of such power and influence. She holds in her hands the destiny of nations, for to her comes the responsibility and opportunity of molding the nation’s citizens.</p>

We take the solemn view that any tampering with the fountains of life is serious, morally, mentally, psychologically, physically. To interfere with any of the processes in the procreation of offspring is to violate one of the most sacred of God’s commandments—to “multiply, and replenish the earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.28" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:28</a>.)</p>

These commandments were, however, not new. They had been known to Adam and his posterity, who had been commanded to live them from the beginning and were merely reiterated by the Lord to Moses. And the commandments even antedated earth life and were part of the test for mortals established in the council of heaven.</p>

How fortunate are we, the men and boys of the Church, to be able to be so instructed and inspired in our personal lives and our Church work.</p>

Do you hear it, you Bishops and you Presidents? God will require it at your hands. You are not placed in position to tamper with principles of righteousness, nor to cover up the infamies and corruptions of men.” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> April 1880, p. 78.)</p>

It is an absolute requirement—not by the bishop—but it is a requirement by nature and by the very part of a man. This discipline is especially applicable to adults and married people and more especially to those who have been to the temple. They must understand that they cannot tamper with the holy laws of God.</p>

Sometimes we find members who have an overdose of false pride. They want their way or they will quit. Have you ever seen anybody leave the ward and never “darken the door” of the ward building again because of a little altercation perhaps with the bishop or with someone there?</p>

If the President of the Church or either of his counselors or, if the apostles, or any other man, feels in his heart that God cannot do without him, and that he is especially important in order to carry on the work of the Lord, he stands upon slippery ground. I heard Joseph Smith say that Oliver Cowdery who was the second Apostle in this Church, said to him, ‘If I leave this church, it will fall.’ Said he, ‘Oliver, you try it.’ Oliver tried it. He fell; but the Kingdom of God did not. I have been acquainted with other Apostles in my day and time who felt that the Lord could not do without them, but the Lord got along with His work without them. I say to all men—Jew and Gentile, great and small, rich and poor—that the Lord Almighty has power within Himself and is not dependent upon any man to carry on His work, but when He does call men to do His work, they have to trust in Him.” (Wilford Woodruff, “Discourse,” <span class="emphasis">Deseret Weekly,</span> Apr. 6, 1890, 40:559–60.)</p>

I remember when I was a deacon. (It has been a long time ago, however.) I thought it was a great honor to be a deacon. My father was always considerate of my responsibilities and always permitted me to take the buggy and horse to gather fast offerings. My responsibility included that part of the town in which I lived, but it was quite a long walk to the homes, and a sack of flour or a bottle of fruit or vegetables or bread became quite heavy as it accumulated. So the buggy was very comfortable and functional. We have changed to cash in later days, but it was commodities in my day. It was a very great honor to do this service for my Heavenly Father; and though times have changed, when money is given generally instead of commodities, it is still a great honor to perform this service.</p>

But they also need to have some heroes close by. They need to know some man of towering strength and basic integrity personally. They need to meet him on the street, to hike and camp with him, to see him close to home, every day, down-to-earth situations; to feel close enough to him to ask questions and to talk things over man-to-man with him.” (Source unknown.)</p>

Your Heavenly Father has helped to provide a world for you and a life for you. It can be a notable one or it can be a casual one. That is up to you, and by the time you are 12 years of age or older, much is expected of you. You are not living in the life of luck; it is a life of pluck, a life of effort and planning. It is said that in the Jewish law a boy of 12 is given nearly adult status. I suppose that is the reason the Lord Jesus Christ remained at the temple when his family took him there, and he talked intelligently with the community leaders and the doctors and the leading people.</p>

It is interesting to note that the Prophet Joseph Smith received his divine revelation at less than 15 years; he was only 18 years old when Moroni came to visit him and tell him of the plates. He was only 22 years of age when he received the gold plates and the great responsibility that came with them.

We have taken a group of the General Authorities and we have held for the local people a conference somewhat similar to this one. We have sustained the authorities of the Church; we have given to them the benefits that they might have received had they come to this conference.</p>

Hopefully, in later years, other temples might be built for those who are farther away. The people received it with gratitude and great happiness, tears of joy and thankfulness.</p>

They have been coming two, four, and six at a time to receive their endowments in the holy temple and to be sealed to their companions and to their families, and so to realize that they could have a temple close to home was a great joy to them.</p>

They were glad to pledge what they could toward building the temple.</p>

After you made the announcement to build a temple in Brazil, 70 cancelled their passage and pledged the fare to the building of the temple.” It runs into tens and tens of thousands of dollars, as you would recognize.</p>

I remember the Old Testament story of Belshazzar—spoken of by President Romney in the priesthood meeting last night—the son and successor of the famous Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, being the last reigning king before the conquest of Cyrus the Great. We remembered the unholy thefts of Nebuchadnezzar, when he defiled the sacred temple of Solomon in Jerusalem and took from that temple many costly and precious serving items. I noted that Belshazzar the king made a great feast, with a thousand of his lords. He drank wine before the thousand and with the thousand. To feed a thousand persons at a banquet is a herculean effort.</p>

His guests ate and drank, probably gave toasts to the gods of gold, the gods of silver, the gods of brass, the gods of iron, the gods of wood, and the gods of stone. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/5.1-4" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 5:1–4</a>.)</p>

In reading the media today I think I see some striking and frightening similarities in the two ages. I read of great feasts in many places, of many community leaders and social leaders and VIPs in large numbers. I read of the local lords and their wives and their mistresses. I read of their drinking and their drunkenness and their extravagances and their immoralities—their shame—and then I whisper to myself, “History is repeating itself.”</p>

He was aware that destruction of those cities was imminent; but in his compassion for his fellowman, he begged and pleaded with the Lord, “Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city,” will you spare the others of the city?

That pleading being granted, came Abraham again and prayed that the cities would be saved if 45 were found, or 40 or 30 or 20 or down to ten, but apparently there could not be found even ten, in those vicious cities, who were righteous.

Elder Gene R. Cook of Bountiful, Utah, formerly executive secretary of the First Council of the Seventy will become a member of the First Council of the Seventy. The First Quorum of the Seventy will be gradually organized, eventually with seventy members, the presidency of which will be made up of the seven members. Three Brethren this day will be added to the First Quorum of the Seventy. They are Charles A. Didier, a native of Belgium, now of Frankfurt, Germany, a seventy; William Rawsel Bradford of San Antonio, Texas, now president of the Chile Santiago Mission, a seventy; Elder George Patrick Lee of Towaoc, Colorado, and Shiprock, New Mexico, a seventy, now serving as president of the Arizona Holbrook Mission. These four men will assume and carry out the responsibilities of General Authorities. These four General Authorities will be presented with the other General Authorities for your vote a little later in the conference.</p>

The 114,000 estimated people in the five years of these area conferences could not possibly have come to Salt Lake to general conference, so we are taking the conferences to them.</p>

And then when we were in Asia we announced also the building of a temple in Tokyo for the people of the Orient. We feel that this is a mark of progress. When these two temples are built and dedicated, it will greatly reduce the distance and time and cost for the people in those two general areas to go to the temple for their sacred ordinances.</p>

They please us mightily by their devotion and their efficiency. The local ones proselyte without language training, and they proselyte without visas generally, and they know their own culture. And we are using local leaders in communities throughout the world. We are finding them to be loyal, effective, and devoted leaders.</p>

Every divorce means saddened lives, broken vows, neglected and deprived children, and broken homes. We decry divorce and feel that there are relatively few divorces which are justifiable. Great care should be taken in forming marriage alliances; then both parties should do their utmost to keep these marriages happy ones. This can be done.</p>

The apostle Paul knew the answer. He said for men to love their wives and wives to love their husbands. For two people to work out their marriage together, they need a carefully worked out budget, made by both husband and wife, and then careful adherence to the same. Many marriages are defeated in the marketplace when unscheduled purchases are made. Remember that marriage is a partnership and is not likely to be successful otherwise. There should be joint planning and joint disciplining of the family. Too many civil marriages are broken. We are grateful that the temple marriages are nearer in line.</p>

God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He has never intended that we should change or update with our vision the moral issues which he established long ago.

I want to begin by telling you a story. I suppose all of you young men learned the Articles of Faith before you became a member of the priesthood.

The Brethren have spoken from their hearts; they brought to our attention many of the great truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Master.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/spoken-from-their-hearts.p2" pid="03ZpRht0X0up4uhkFtGZqg" hash="_fWKCQ">We hope that the leaders and the members of the Church who have attended and listened to the conference have been inspired and uplifted. We hope you have made copious notes of the thoughts that have come to your mind as the Brethren have addressed you. Many suggestions have been given that will help you as leaders in the perfection of your work. Many helpful thoughts have been given for the perfection of our own lives, and that, of course, is the basic reason for our coming.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/spoken-from-their-hearts.p3" pid="Jjdidq1iOUimK4GFveneug" hash="gf984Q">While sitting here, I have made up my mind that when I go home from this conference this night there are many, many areas in my life that I can perfect. I have made a mental list of them, and I expect to go to work as soon as we get through with conference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/spoken-from-their-hearts.p4" pid="OjE6px7DlEiTtrQD4g8E8w" hash="DCv05w">You have heard the Brethren speak with great strength of the principles of the gospel. You heard Brother Benson in his inspired sermon tell us that the immutable laws of God remain steadfast in the heavens above; when men and nations refuse to abide by them, the penalty must follow. They will be wasted away. Sin demands punishment. He said further, “Therefore, as humble servants of the Lord, we call upon the leaders of nations to be humble and humble themselves before God, to seek his inspiration and his guidance.” That is a bold statement, but very much in order.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/spoken-from-their-hearts.p5" pid="1D0jBF0BQU2Riy3e5jRL6w" hash="V1wsEw">You heard Elder Thomas S. Monson speak of how the President of the Council of the Twelve is guided to make changes through the inspiration of the Lord, so that Elder Monson happened to be in the right place to give a blessing to a dying child. He told us how the program unraveled so that he went to this conference, drove eighty miles out of his way, and met the family that was soon to bury this little one.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/spoken-from-their-hearts.p6" pid="li6jD1yNK0GgCA3AddkZwA" hash="O1QAfA">Did you hear Elder Sill telling of the examples of great and powerful people who lost their power when they lost their controls and yielded to the demands of lustful lives? He told also the story in <span class="emphasis">Pilgrim’s Progress</span> where a man refused a crown because he had given his life to raking muck.</p>

How glorious it is! I hope every one of you will go home and see that you fail not in this glorious program of home-making. It was brought out in the Relief Society conference that the evil one knows where to attack. He is going to attack the home. He is going to try to destroy the family. That is what he wants to do. And you will see that all these workings of Satan that have been mentioned by the Brethren as they have talked to us have a final result of destroying the home, the family, the parents, the loved ones. That is what this Satan would like to do. Let us make up our minds he will not do it in our families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/spoken-from-their-hearts.p9" pid="BAe9Zg-XhkqGvSsf7VMv1A" hash="vhLWAA">You heard of the great missionary work from Elder Tuttle and others of the Brethren.</p>

He told of the Nephites and the Jaredites and followed the promises made of the Lord, that whatsoever nation shall possess this land of promise shall be free from bondage and from captivity and from all other nations under heaven if they will but serve the God of this land, who is Jesus Christ. That is said in about as few words as could be put together, but, oh, how important and far-reaching it is.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/spoken-from-their-hearts.p12" pid="h6eqb0pwYkKDveQEdIfYDA" hash="B5dRjQ">Elder Rector gave an instructive discussion of the Word of Wisdom, particularly on liquor, and gave some statistics which were frightening. All our magazines are filled with feeding the public, feeding the world; and he gave us information that would go a long way toward feeding the world—if we just didn’t put barley into liquor.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/spoken-from-their-hearts.p13" pid="sFOXZ7tGxEGooMeBbn_Ksw" hash="gXZmRw">You heard Brother McConkie say that once or twice in every thousand years come great blessings. And he went into detail with them. He talked about the great program that came to us in this dispensation, as will as many others, in his remarks—the great program of the restoration of the gospel.</p>

I liked the way he asked us to encourage the leaders—the legislature—to make the proper laws to control these situations—and when they do, to give them thanks and appreciation, and when they don’t, to give them a little nudging.</p>

I have been here for a long while. I was born here. But I’ve never heard that before, and I was grateful for that beautiful story of the sacrifices and the labors that these good people, our parents, went through so that we could sit, in reasonable comfort, at least, in this great Tabernacle. And how long it has served—a hundred years, he told us. A hundred years, this building!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/spoken-from-their-hearts.p19" pid="Hf0Ce6DHL0i1WForyFGkSA" hash="-hJLQQ">I can imagine that in this building there have been numerous great sermons by prophets and apostles and other leaders. I can imagine the numerous prayers, deep and sincere, offered by the Brethren. I can imagine the succeeding choirs of the years, and the leaders, and what a great service this building has rendered. I hope it can last for another hundred years, at least.</p>

How would it be if we called all of you on missions?</p>

This is a real problem, when we think of Satan pinpointing the things that will destroy us. That’s about the first thing, isn’t it? If we cease marriage and cease home life, we are done for.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/spoken-from-their-hearts.p23" pid="ZAaF4Fuv00eUuNwUREXWsw" hash="H4wBXQ">Well, now, brothers and sisters, this is the gospel of Jesus Christ, and to all who are listening in, we have not been fooling.

This is a Christian church. We follow him. We love him. We praise him. We glorify him. And now we must go forward and follow him in every detail. The gospel has been restored. It is here for us in all its fulness. Never before has it been so full and so complete, so comprehensive, never before that we know of in the world. And here it is, available to us and available to millions of people, some of whom are listening. We hope they will not make the mistake of casting it aside or ignoring it. God bless you who have been listening.</p>

And that the way he has planned, the way of life, is right and true in every particular. And I bear this testimony to you with our great affection for you, our love, and appreciation.

And third, I would like to say I wish our enemies could have seen this program this morning and seen the wide variety of help and assistance and succor that could be given to the people of this world. And then I wish they could have listened to what President Romney has said, and all the other speakers. We are doing a great service; and it would please us if they would go and do likewise rather than criticize our efforts.</p>

The priesthood presides in the home, but it must preside as Jesus Christ presides over his Church—in love, in service, in tenderness, and in example.</p>

Thus, for the power of the priesthood to truly be felt in a family requires the righteousness of the men and young men therein. We call to the attention of all our priesthood bearers that our relationship with our wives, mothers, and sisters is one in which we kneel together, whether at the altars of the temple or in our own homes; we serve together, side by side, a beautiful partnership.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/boys-need-heroes-close-by.p6" pid="tTz2_QDCAke5AU4D3lBcHg" hash="E-ao2w">We are concerned, brethren, with our need to provide continually significant opportunities for our young men to stretch their souls in service. Young men do not usually become inactive in the Church because they are given too many significant things to do. No young man who has really witnessed for himself that the gospel works in the lives of the people will walk away from his duties in the kingdom and leave them undone. We hope our bishoprics, who have a special stewardship in this regard, will see to it they have effective quorum activities and active youth committees. As our young men learn quorum management, they are not only blessing the Aaronic Priesthood youth in those quorums, but they are preparing themselves as future fathers and future leaders for the Melchizedek Priesthood quorums. They need some experience in leadership, some experience in service projects, some experience in speaking, some experience in conducting meetings, and some experience in how to build proper relationships with young women.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/boys-need-heroes-close-by.p7" pid="wDZ_HEYQCU-LMM5u9VB3tg" hash="RkaN4Q">We are rearing a royal generation—thousands of whom sit with us here tonight—who have special things to do. We need to provide them with special experiences in studying scriptures, in serving their neighbors, and in being contributing and loving members of their families. All of this requires, of course, time for planning and time to implement—anything but the casualness we sometimes see on the part of some fathers and adult leaders. We have reasons to believe, brethren, that the impact of the world on our LDS youth is not only greater than it has ever been, but that it comes sooner than it has come in the past. Thus, we must do our work better and sooner!</p>

We are just as concerned with those whose families and marriages seem to be held together in “quiet desperation.” Those who are careful and thoughtful in courtship will usually be careful and thoughtful in marriage. Those who thoughtfully enter the House of the Lord to be sealed for time and eternity are much less likely to experience divorce and difficulty, not only because of the influence of that sealing ceremony, but because usually they are better prepared for marriage in the first place. They have not only their young love for each other, but a common bond of love for the gospel of Jesus Christ which they knew before they knew each other. They also have some sense of the spirit of sacrifice and selflessness which underlies every happy marriage in countless ways.</p>

Accept the reality that personal improvement on the part of each priesthood holder is expected by our Father in heaven. We should be growing and we should be developing constantly. If we do, others will sense the seriousness of our discipleship and can then more easily forgive us our frailties which we sometimes show in the way in which we lead and manage.</p>

Even if the priesthood holders of our Heavenly Father are headed in the right direction, if they are men without momentum they will have too little influence. You are the leaven on which the world depends; you must use your powers to stop a drifting and aimless world.</p>

I have mentioned at this pulpit before some determinations made early in my life, which decisions were such a help to me because I did not have to remake those decisions perpetually. We can push some things away from us once and have done with them! We can make a single decision about certain things that we will incorporate in our lives and then make them ours—without having to brood and redecide a hundred times what it is we will do and what we will not do.</p>

We must never come to feel in the Church that those who labor in the crafts and skills have somehow done less than they should. We are grateful, of course, for the many professional men in the Church and for those who are thought of as being in our white-collar occupations; but I want us to reach out more than we now do for the men—young and old—who labor in the so-called blue-collar skills, which are more essential to our society than many realize. Indeed, some of these skills are in short supply! Let us reach out in a special way to these men, for among them are many of our prospective elders whose strength and skills we need and whose families will fully affiliate only if these men come and join us in greater numbers.</p>

I am impressed that our various Church programs are like keys on the keyboard of a piano. Some of the keys are used much more often than others, but all of them are needed from time to time to produce harmony and balance in our lives. So often, therefore, what we are doing in our various talks and meetings is to remind ourselves of the need for balance, the need for fresh emphasis here or there, and the need to do the things that matter most without leaving the other things undone.</p>

Righteousness proceeds outward from the individual to the group. We will find that if we are converted (through studying, searching, and praying), our immediate desire is to want to help others. True conversion causes us to want to reach out to the living and to the deceased to do what we can to help in each case. If we are truly converted, we will also want to provide for our own in the fullness of what welfare service means.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-preparedness.p2" pid="etmLoEYKFU2oIoWuIzAC1Q" hash="oFBL7A">As I listened to their addresses, I kept thinking over and over of something the Savior said,“Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?” It rolled over and over and over in my mind: “Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.46" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:46</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-preparedness.p3" pid="wxxj1cArFUmE5Qs25e_AnQ" hash="apUFhw">There are many people in the Church today who have failed to do, and continue to argue against doing, the things that are requested and suggested by this great organization.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-preparedness.p4" pid="ehCpqkigP06xkPzMT4HvrA" hash="BjHcOg">The Lord said also, “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:21</a>.) And I was thinking that there are as many wards and branches in the Church as there are people in this room, one for one. And what great accomplishment there would be if every bishop and every branch president in all the world, wherever it’s possible (of course there are a few places where this is not permitted), had a storage such as has been suggested here this morning—and took to their three or four or five hundred members the same message, quoting scripture and insisting that the people of their wards and branches do the things the Lord has requested, for we know that there are many who are failing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-preparedness.p5" pid="52o2zpkgL0mfZN3MIwqlVA" hash="YM-rJg">And then I hear them argue, “Well, suppose we do put away a lot and then someone comes and takes it from us, our neighbors who do not believe.” That’s been answered this morning.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-preparedness.p7" pid="Z_dqwrjG-0ObNOPUTXZR0g" hash="4lVI7A">Think of the number of people represented here this day by the stake presidents, mission presidents, and others who are directors, who have many people under them. Our 750 stakes—all of them including hundreds, sometimes thousands, of members—could that we have, if we go to work and actually push this matter until it is done. We talk about it, we listen to it, but sometimes we do not <span class="emphasis">do</span> the things which the Lord says.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-preparedness.p8" pid="fmy_BjtbfUOuf5I_kgqvCw" hash="BV2Eeg">Brethren and sisters, we’ve gathered here this morning to consider the important program which we must never forget nor put in the background. As we become more affluent and our bank accounts enlarge, there comes a feeling of security, and we feel sometimes that we do not need the supply that has been suggested by the Brethren. It lies there and deteriorates, we say. And suppose it does? We can reestablish it. We must remember that conditions could change and a year’s supply of basic commodities could be very much appreciated by us or others. So we would do well to listen to what we have been told and to follow it explicitly.</p>

A shop in a small British town carried a banner on its front window: “By candle power, battery power, and willpower, we will open six days a week.” That willpower apparently is the most important.</p>

We do not understand it, but it is true. And we honor, obey, and sustain the laws of the country which is ours. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.12" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:12</a>.) Where it is permitted, though, which is most of the world, we should listen to the counsel of the Brethren and to the Lord.</p>

We wish to say another word about this in the next meeting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/family-preparedness.p12" pid="n_SKNHTjgEizUnj6iooM0w" hash="lyVmnA">We encourage you to grow all the food that you feasibly can on your own property. Berry bushes, grapevines, fruit trees—plant them if your climate is right for their growth. Grow vegetables and eat them from your own yard. Even those residing in apartments or condominiums can generally grow a little food in pots and planters. Study the best methods of providing your own foods. Make your garden as neat and attractive as well as productive. If there are children in your home, involve them in the process with assigned responsibilities.</p>

We reaffirm the previous counsel the Church has always given, to acquire and maintain a year’s supply—a year’s supply of the basic commodities for us.

Improve your sewing skills; sew and mend clothing for your family. All the girls want to learn to type, they all want to go to an office. They don’t seem to want to sew anymore, and to plant and protect and renew the things that they use. Develop handicraft skills as the sisters have told us, and make or build needed items.</p>

We encourage all Latter-day Saint families to become self-reliant and independent. The greatness of a people and of a nation begins in the home.

We often have our individual reasons for fasting. But I hope members won’t hesitate to fast to help us lengthen our stride in our missionary effort, to open the way for the gospel to go to the nations where it is not now permitted.

He’d saved $2,900 for his mission from his Marine pay in three years and nine months and fifteen days. By doing odd jobs which others wished to escape, he had $2,900 for his mission. Just a boy without a job, without a place, without a home, without somebody to keep him busy. But he caught the idea and went out and did other people’s work on the ship, and saved his money for this important thing.</p>

What is he profited? Thus the Lord has made a vibrant contrast between the honors of the world and the honors which can come to the soul. He names vividly the contrast between the things of the world and the things that are related to heavenly desires and accomplishments.</p>

He hopes the officers will, by example as well as influence, endeavor to check it and that both they and the men will reflect that we can have little hope of the blessing of heaven on our arms if we insult it by our impropriety and folly. Added to this, it is a vice so mean and low, without any temptation, that every man of sense and character detests and despises it.”</p>

When the first baby is born, a mother is born and a father is born and grandparents are born. Only by birth can any of these come into being. Only by the natural cycle of life can the great progressive joys of mankind be reached.</p>

They are likely to give society far fewer problems of crime, immorality, divorce or poverty than are their unmarried companions. They will have children and rear them while they are strong, enjoy them when they are grown-up and successful, depend upon them in weakness and profit by the finest type of old age insurance ever invented by man or God, an insurance which pays its annuities in material goods when necessary, but which mainly pays in the rich joys of love and fellowship. … The crowning joys of human experience will come in middle age and onward through the companionship, love and honor of children and grandchildren.”</p>

We are grateful to announce that success has followed their efforts, and an estimated 117,000 converts will have been added to the rolls. They are happy in their new responsibilities as they have found a new spiritual home and have learned more concerning our Heavenly Father, His Son, and His program.</p>

In the springtime we planted vegetables and the neighbours told us that it would not grow. There is a little stream where we can go on our bikes hanged with cans, and this way we carry our water. We prayed to the Lord that he would bless our garden. The Lord did answer our prayers. Every kind of vegetable came. It is so wonderful to see the plants grow. We take turns now to go to our garden and water our plants. We are happy to have a garden.”</p>

Some 10,000 or 15,000 Indian students are being taught in the seminaries and other instructional institutions of religion, and hundreds of the more mature students are receiving their degrees from Brigham Young University, probably the greatest benefactor of Lamanite students among all higher learning institutions. They may then go into teaching, surveying, organizing, banking, and other services. We are very proud of our Lamanites. We hope all of our people will be loving and kind and helpful to all of the minority people who come into the Church.</p>

The scope and demands of the work at that time did not justify the reconstitution of the First Quorum of the Seventy. In the intervening years, additional Assistants to the Twelve have been added and today we have twenty-one.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-reconstitution-of-the-first-quorum-of-the-seventy.p5" pid="WIx5MdQ8bEG4NA06vWW1Kg" hash="opqKlw">You will see that these changes, which are reflected in the list of General Authorities to be read by President N.

This will make it possible to handle efficiently the present heavy workload and to prepare for the increasing expansion and acceleration of the work, anticipating the day when the Lord will return to take direct charge of His church and kingdom.</p>

What an opportunity it is to meet together under these auspices, 230,000 of us, possibly more. We welcome you again this night and ask the Lord to bless us while we are thus convened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p2" pid="NDpyNFZyhkaNm1kIC6edbQ" hash="K9kBVw">There are two or three matters I would like to bring to your attention. We have written a letter to all the stake presidencies in the western United States saying that in the past the Primary Children’s Medical Center received substantial financial support through the annual Penny Parade. These funds enabled the hospital to admit children in need of assistance without regard to race, creed, religion, or ability to pay. Since this source of support is no longer available, the hospital has organized a children’s fund, which will be conducting a penny-by-the-inch fund drive in the month of February 1977. All funds received will be used to continue charity services. We think the program is worthy of your support.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p3" pid="-0kDB6dqUECUqQkQUMIivQ" hash="M8bhiQ">And I wish to call your attention to another matter deserving your attention and support. The general presidency of the Relief Society more than a year ago proposed to the First Presidency and the Twelve the erection of a monument to the women of the Church. In view of the fact that the Prophet Joseph organized the Relief Society in Nauvoo on March 17, 1842, it was felt that this monument should stand in Nauvoo. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve, after consideration, felt to endorse this proposal with the understanding that the project would be funded primarily through the voluntary contributions of the women of the Church. Work on the monument has been going forward, and contributions are being received.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p4" pid="lkt7UBf700m3uhKM-sL9yA" hash="8nB8NA">We earnestly ask that stake presidents and bishops give their endorsement to this undertaking and encourage their respective Relief Society presidents in their efforts to secure the needed contributions. We are confident that, with support from you brethren, these funds can be gathered without doing any injury to anyone. If many contribute, the individual amount need not be large. We would also hope that some of the brethren might feel inclined to make a contribution to this worthy project. The general Relief Society presidency are anxious to conclude the funds drive before March 17 of next year, their anniversary date. Your efforts in this direction will be greatly appreciated. Each sister could make a small contribution to the Relief Society, and she would then feel a part of it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p5" pid="Em_zZ8vsBUKXoMzs5hrAjw" hash="k8bfWg">Another matter. We hope that you who teach in the various organizations, whether on the campuses or in our chapels, will always teach the orthodox truth. We warn you against the dissemination of doctrines which are not according to the scriptures and which are alleged to have been taught by some of the General Authorities of past generations. Such, for instance, is the Adam-God theory. We denounce that theory and hope that everyone will be cautioned against this and other kinds of false doctrine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p6" pid="GOoMwfHPDEGXYIixs6XppQ" hash="p9zBIw">Now, just a few words to you young men. Have you ever imagined yourself to be the Prophet Joseph Smith when he was fourteen and received his glorious vision? Or David when he was playing his harp for King Saul? Or Joseph who had dreams and visions and saw in a dream how his father and mother and all his brothers and their families would bow down to him? Have you ever thought of yourself as being Nephi, who, under very difficult circumstances, defied his rebellious brothers and went into the city of Jerusalem and singlehandedly obtained the plates which were vital to the posterity of Lehi and his family? Have you ever thought of yourself as being the young Nephi who gave leadership in large measure to his older brothers and to his father’s family?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p7" pid="5wD6wMt84Eq9EePqCwO8yw" hash="OBBWMg">Can you think of yourself as being Nephi who heard his father excitedly call attention to something he had found just outside the door of his tent? It was a round ball that made it possible for father Lehi to fulfill the commandment he had received during the night when visited by the Lord who told him to resume his journey into the wilderness on the morrow. There must have been great excitement in their family when the ball was shown to them. You and they found it to be “a round ball of curious workmanship,” made “of fine brass,” and none of you had ever seen anything like it before. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 16:10</a>.) It had two spindles or pointers which were designed to indicate the direction of movement of the party as they went forward. For no reason that you could figure out, one of the spindles pointed a specific direction which was identified by Lehi as the direction that should be followed into the wilderness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p8" pid="XLHSIgdDiEKwck4wvjC03A" hash="dmCofQ">If you were greatly interested and observed very carefully the workings of this unusual ball, you would note that it worked “according to the faith and diligence and heed” which were given unto it concerning the way you should go. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.28" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 16:28</a>.) What would you think if, upon closer examination, you noted that there were writings upon the ball that were “plain to be read” and went farther than pointing direction—they explained the ways of the Lord. And what if the instructions were “changed from time to time” as additional demands were made of the Lord and this “according to the faith and diligence” which the family gave to it? (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.29" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 16:29</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p9" pid="R9jinaWwYUW88fmm4jSXBA" hash="spWEFQ">Never had you seen anything like it, for it was curious workmanship. The directions to which the spindles pointed were invariable, but the writings were changed from time to time according to need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p10" pid="sdIfqkHA30m86q6TJiW-jA" hash="AEgsGg">Imagine yourself a younger brother, such as Nephi, but being more spiritual than your older brothers. You were very careful to follow the directions as they were given on the ball, or Liahona, as it came to be called. Suppose you found that the directions on the ball led the family to more fertile fields in parts of the wilderness where supplies could be had? Suppose that, in your long travels, you finally ran out of food and the children were crying from hunger. You had an especially fine steel bow and arrow, but you broke the bow in your vigorous handling. And then suppose your brethren came to you, very critical, because their wooden bows had lost their springs, limiting the opportunity to kill wild animals for food for the family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p11" pid="qf9GYAD79E-zwiGHPdEyAQ" hash="6-zkXQ">Suppose you then were obliged to sit in the camp and listen to your older brothers “murmur exceedingly, because of their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness” with definite criticisms of their father and yourself and even the Lord for having led them into this dry wilderness. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.20" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 16:20</a>.) Food was getting very scarce. Suppose in these difficult hours of criticism and complaint from your brothers that you made a bow and used a straight stick for an arrow, and that you had armed yourself with your new bow and arrow and with stones and a sling. Then you asked your father where you should go—in what direction—to find meat, and felt the inspiration of the faithfulness of your beloved father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p12" pid="sc9-V8wfGU-avypDxDwfug" hash="ZQX8zw">But suppose that even your father had begun to murmur against the Lord for leaving the family in these desperate straits. How would you feel to know that your father, as well as your brothers, were chastised by the voice of the Lord for their lack of faith and humility? Can you imagine yourself with your older brothers, your father, and all the family looking intently at the ball and its pointers to see what it would say when your father was instructed by the voice of the Lord to “look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written”? (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.26" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 16:26</a>.) Can you imagine all your brothers and members of the family crowding around the ball to watch it work, fearing and trembling as they apparently realized that it was something out of this world? Would you not tremble when you were reminded with the whole family that the pointers of the ball would work “according to the faith and diligence and heed” which you paid to it? (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.28" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 16:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p13" pid="hOO65xjyTUKuZ6cs9n2eLQ" hash="jA7sow">What if, after long journeyings and much tribulation, you finally convinced your brothers to help you build a ship and embark on the great ocean? Then after a short travel, the spindles wouldn’t work anymore and the ship was driven backward because of lack of faith of the brothers who were very rude and cruel? (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 18:9</a>ff.) What if they bound you hand and foot until your arms and your ankles ached? What would you think of all those things when you knew that if they would just live the word of the Lord and be faithful, the spindles would work? What would you think then if finally when the angel came and protected you and released you from this bondage and the brethren repented to some degree, the spindles worked well, and you went on to your destination?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p14" pid="oUDC4fd8eUuBLpX9ficYLw" hash="Ia7Y5g">The ball, or Liahona—which is interpreted to mean a compass—was prepared by the Lord especially to show unto Lehi the course which he should travel in the wilderness. Wouldn’t you like to have that kind of a ball—each one of you—so that whenever you were in error it would point the right way and write messages to you? Wouldn’t you like to have that kind of a ball, each one of you, so that you would always know when you were in error or in the wrong way?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p15" pid="K5IlXJ0uI0eXOJJFi2zIkQ" hash="O_Cgpw">That, my young brethren, you all have. The Lord gave to every boy, every man, every person, a conscience which tells him everytime he starts to go on the wrong path. He is always told if he is listening; but people can, of course, become so used to hearing the messages that they ignore them until finally they do not register anymore.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p16" pid="rNlwsfkXzkK3vExqhHHbRg" hash="UH4wOg">You must realize that you have something like the compass, like the Liahona, in your own system. Every child is given it. When he is eight years of age, he knows good from evil, if his parents have been teaching him well. If he ignores the Liahona that he has in his own makeup, he eventually may not have it whispering to him. But if we will remember that everyone of us has the thing that will direct him aright, our ship will not get on the wrong course and suffering will not happen and bows will not break and families will not cry for food—if we listen to the dictates of our own Liahona, which we call the conscience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p17" pid="yEo1KDkUJ0KSOkTmsEqYJg" hash="kODrnA">Brethren, this has been a glorious evening for us here to all meet together. We have just now received a phone call from Melbourne, Australia, which says they are receiving the conference very well, so this is the third corner of the world we have heard from.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/our-own-liahona.p18" pid="JVT-oBSyDUKiZ6jmLJiFmw" hash="06RuwA">Brethren, we’ve heard some wonderful messages here tonight. May the Lord bless us that we will ponder them and think them through and receive them into our souls, that we may carry on this great work that the Lord has given to us. The Lord also lives. The Savior of the world does live. He has a program for us. He has made it known to us that our Liahonas won’t work if we live so that they cannot be depended upon. We may not understand fully all the things the Lord tells us to do, but my faith and prayer is that we <span class="emphasis">will,</span> and that we will give serious consideration to all the things that we are hearing in this conference from the brethren who lead us. May the Lord bless us, brethren. May peace be with us and joy and comfort, and I offer this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

He was not a member of the Church and evidently had never known the pull and the pressure one feels when one has a positive assurance that the Lord is <span class="emphasis">not</span> playing games, but rather has a serious program for man and for his glory.

      <description>Brethren and sisters, this has been a most desirable meeting. I have sat entranced. I know that we did not come here to be entertained; we came here to be instructed. I hope we have accepted this meeting in that tone, that we will take into our lives</description>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p1" pid="bCjR4zXAi02yLRi7a1vGYg" hash="NkqMlw">Brethren and sisters, this has been a most desirable meeting. I have sat entranced. I know that we did not come here to be entertained; we came here to be instructed. I hope we have accepted this meeting in that tone, that we will take into our lives those suggestions which have been given. The brethren and sisters have given a wonderful demonstration of how it can be done, how we should do, and where we should go.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p2" pid="U4OdG828lUu9ABFWWZPluw" hash="u4_xcA">I remember, rather indistinctly, that when we first moved to Arizona from Salt Lake City this program officially was not in vogue, but unofficially it was. In many of the stakes and wards the work was going forward—partly it was.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p3" pid="K0M4cyjUsk20Q511IA2Hyw" hash="-KU78w">I remember that when we went to Arizona, President Christopher Layton had been the president of the stake. He was ill and soon passed away. My father took the reins and became the president of the stake. I remember we lived in a one-room house. I guess there were about nine of us at that time, and we lived in that one room for some time. Then we moved to a little adobe building a few blocks away, where there were about three rooms. The roof leaked and many times we had to sleep out in tents.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p4" pid="IhOAWclRpke4n06LpLJ4Ug" hash="MPCanQ">And then we acquired a ten-acre place which was above the canal. It was covered with mesquite bushes and chaparral and other desert plants. How to get rid of them, how to clear the land—that was the question. The first thing we knew, the brethren from Central Ward had come those several miles with their picks and shovels, their axes, and they began to help us clear our ten acres. They came from Layton Ward, and then they came from Pima Ward. They came before we knew it, almost. With the help of my father, who was a very excellent worker, and two sons who were older than I was, we soon had the place ready to plant.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p5" pid="hnqwG563ZUq2MuoPLirPTw" hash="Z7EEDg">That was welfare work. It wasn’t under the same direction. It wasn’t stimulated in the same way. But it was real welfare work, because each helped the other.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p6" pid="fUaJ4VUnpUqmhbBrXThmvA" hash="jGc89Q">Also, my father was very responsive. He found that President Layton, who was beginning to get rather old and feeble, didn’t have the help to do the things he needed to do, and he had a big orchard. So Father gathered all of us children up, with all the buckets and pans, and with the consent and approval of President Layton we all went down to his orchard and picked fruit on shares. There was a large family of the Laytons and there was a large family of us. We divided the pickings from the orchard and went forward with our program. My dear mother knew how to make ends meet. We had a pantry and that pantry was always filled with bottled fruits and everything else you could think of that was available at the time.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p7" pid="CUJ-lyxn20CSXefnXuvKZg" hash="CSMH5Q">Another thing I wish to mention is that in Nauvoo, Illinois, the Relief Society has been given approval to erect a monument which will be a joy forever. We would like it understood that we have given approval for it, and we would appreciate it if the stake presidencies and the mission presidencies and the bishoprics would give this encouragement. Encourage the sisters to make individual contributions—not too large, but very voluntary and adequate. We hope that you will encourage the sisters to go forward with this program. We shall mention this again tonight in the priesthood meeting. It is very important.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p8" pid="uL0kDfpfZEmIcOzkrheEJA" hash="KwaV4Q">President Marion G. Romney was talking about the work which involved our parents. The other day we heard a story in our council meeting that I saw raise the ire of the brethren. It was all righteous ire because of the things that had happened. A father who had been very careful in his investments and in his service had saved hundreds of thousands of dollars for his sweet little wife who had helped him to gather it. But unfortunately he died first and was laid away. His wife became a little older, and somewhat senile. She was put in a rest home. The money went to the children’s bank accounts, and she went on suffering. Maybe she didn’t fully understand all the suffering that came to her; but maybe she did. With inadequate clothes and with inadequate treatment and training, the poor woman is still living in a rest home. As far as we know her children <span class="emphasis">never </span>see her.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p9" pid="qMcOqNrW9k69zXFCMmoWoA" hash="myuhnQ">It must be a little bit difficult to visit a mother who gave her life for her children, who spent many, many years rearing and training and saving for them. It must be very difficult for them to show their interest when she is in a position where she needs some comfort from those whom she has loved.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p10" pid="PRWYcDotjEGOJ4STe3rxWA" hash="h-6KUQ">This is very important, and I hope you will not forget it, you bishops. In your wards, remind your people that they should take care of their fathers and mothers, no matter if they do become senile, no matter if they do become difficult to handle. They should be taken care of; that is a part of the program of the Lord established when He first organized this world.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p11" pid="Ts_5gOnaGUO_XuYRobdHsg" hash="TAcF3w">One other matter. I remember some years ago, a young man and his wife and little children moved to our Arizona community. As we got acquainted with them, he told me of the rigorous youth he had spent as he grew up. He’d had to get up at five and six o’clock in the morning and go out and deliver papers. He’d had to work on the farm, and he’d had to do many things that were still rankling in his soul. Then he concluded with this statement: “<span class="emphasis">My </span>boys are never going to have to do that.” And we saw his boys grow up and you couldn’t get them to do anything. They left off their Church activity and nothing seemed very important to them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p12" pid="UHvcMpUTDEGGj0cwxVaFKw" hash="fQIcbw">“Thou shalt not be idle,” the Lord said. (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:42</a>.) Idleness is of the devil, and we are not kind to our children when we become affluent and take from them their labors, their opportunities to serve and to be trained and to do things for themselves and for others.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/loving-one-another.p13" pid="Kf4t5YxlnEKCSj9NV8NNIA" hash="1xoa4w">This has been a wonderful meeting. We’re deeply grateful for the splendid service as directed by Bishop Victor L. Brown and his counselors, Sister Barbara B. Smith and her counselors. We’re grateful for their wonderful service. And we’re grateful for your service as bishoprics and stake presidencies as you give leadership to this marvelous program. We pray that the Lord will bless us as we go forward and follow the program as it is outlined for us. We say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

This is not the case. We are in possession of all the ordinances that can be administered in the flesh; but there are other ordinances and administrations that must be administered beyond this world. I know you would like to ask what they are. I will mention one. We have not, neither can we receive here, the ordinance and the keys of resurrection.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 15:137.)</p>

I have missed my parents much. If I had the power of resurrection as did the Savior of the world, I would have been tempted to try to have kept them longer. I have been called to speak in numerous funerals for people whom I have known, people whom I have loved, and people whom I have saved and held on to in a limited way. We do not know of anyone who can resurrect the dead as did Jesus the Christ when he came back to mortality.</p>

You and I—what helpless creatures are we! Such limited power we have, and how little can we control the wind and the waves and the storms! We remember the numerous scriptures which, concentrated in a single line, were said by a former prophet, Lorenzo Snow: “As man is, God once was; and as God is, man may become.” This is a power available to us as we reach perfection and receive the experience and power to create, to organize, to control native elements. How limited we are now! We have no power to force the grass to grow, the plants to emerge, the seeds to develop.</p>

Then he proceeded to create a world for them and sent them as spirits to obtain a mortal body, for which he made preparation. And when they were upon the earth, he gave them instructions on how to go about developing and conducting their lives to make them perfect, so they could return to their Father in heaven after their transitions. Then came the periods of time when souls were to be placed upon the earth and born to parents who were permitted to furnish the bodies. But no parent has ever yet on this earth been the parent of a spirit, because we are so far yet from perfection. Remember what was said a while ago, that “As man is, God once was; and as God is, man may become.”They came with the definite understanding that they could return to become like God and go forward in their great development and progress.</p>

In the Bible, which we proclaim “to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly” [<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.8" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:8</a>], the Old Testament prophets from Adam to Malachi are testifying of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ was the God of the Old Testament, and it was He who conversed with Abraham and Moses. It was He who inspired Isaiah and Jeremiah; it was He who foretold through those chosen men the happenings of the future, even to the latest day and hour.</p>

With war and pestilence and famine, with poverty, desolation, with more and more graft, dishonesty, and immorality, certainly the people of this world need revelation from God as never before. How absurd it would be to think that the Lord would give to a small handful of people in Palestine and the Old World his precious direction through revelation and now, in our extremity, close the heavens.</p>

Having given them free agency, their Heavenly Father calls, persuades, and directs aright his children, but waits for their upreaching hands, their solemn prayers, their sincere, dedicated approach to him. If they are heedless, they are left floundering in midnight’s darkness when they could have the noonday sun.</p>

When the heavens are sealed, the spiritual darkness that follows is not unlike that physical darkness in Nephite history, when “neither candles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled with their fine and exceedingly dry wood.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.21" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 8:21</a>.)</p>

We testify also that there is, since 1830 when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized, and will continue to be, so long as time shall last, a prophet, recognized of God and his people, who will continue to interpret the mind and will of the Lord.</p>

For many it is hard to accept as revelation those numerous ones in Moses’ time, in Joseph’s time, and in our own year—those revelations which come to prophets as deep, unassailable impressions settling down on the prophet’s mind and heart as dew from heaven or as the dawn dissipates the darkness of night.</p>

I say, in the deepest of humility, but also by the power and force of a burning testimony in my soul, that from the prophet of the Restoration to the prophet of our own year, the communication line is unbroken, the authority is continuous, and light, brilliant and penetrating, continues to shine. The sound of the voice of the Lord is a continuous melody and a thunderous appeal. For nearly a century and a half there has been no interruption.</p>

I hope you were all thinking of Joseph Smith, of Brigham Young, of John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and all the other Presidents. I hope you were thinking of President David O. McKay and President Joseph Fielding Smith, President Harold B. Lee and all of those who have filled this position in these days.</p>

One, I hope you have had the opportunity to see the four beautiful statues that have been placed just east of the temple in the central Church plaza. These four are a part of the group of thirteen statues honoring women that will be set up next year in the Relief Society park in Nauvoo, at the visitors center there. These four have been placed in the plaza for your enjoyment. They are lovely indeed. We invite you to visit that area and see the statues while you are here in Salt Lake City.</p>

Hinckley spoke of Joseph Smith so tenderly, and sweetly, and the thought went through my mind of that last night in Carthage, Illinois. They were gathered together with the mob all around them and the Prophet Joseph Smith asked one of the brethren to sing for him “A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief.”</p>

We hope this will be a permanent experience of our people, that they will raise much of what they use on their table.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p2" pid="HcDrgfS_aUmA1q75rNhB-A" hash="e5fXgw">I should like first to pay special tribute to the divinely inspired Primary organization of the Church. It is just a hundred years ago that Bishop Hess, with the approval of the First Presidency, called Aurelia Spencer Rogers to organize the first Primary in Farmington, Utah. From that humble beginning has grown a worldwide organization that has touched the lives of millions of people. I am confident there is not one within the sound of my voice who has not had his or her life influenced for good by the teachings of the devoted officers and teachers of this Primary organization. This past month I have received hundreds and hundreds of birthday cards. Many of them have been handmade by the Primary children of the Church. It is the humble Primary leaders who through their teaching and personal example instill in the hearts and minds of these wonderful little children, in their sensitive and formative years, love for the Savior, the Church, and for its leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p3" pid="qT9nEmgQ00S2k_yQEJZudg" hash="aSgZBQ">Primary helps little boys and girls prepare for their future great responsibilities as mothers and fathers and citizens of Zion. All that is taught in Primary is virtuous, lovely, and of good report, and praiseworthy. May the Lord continue to bless and prosper the Primary organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, together with all the other organizations who are doing comparable work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p4" pid="yHPdcqLsv0m5fJrkx67l0Q" hash="BhC12Q">I remember coming to this tabernacle as a boy from Arizona, with my father, to attend general conference. I was thrilled to hear all the Brethren speak. I have heard President Joseph F. Smith and all who have followed him up to now. I was thrilled at their utterances and took their warnings seriously, even as a young man. These men are among the prophets of God, just as were the prophets of the Book of Mormon and of the Bible. I do not remember ever feeling that these men pulled any punches or that their counsel went unheeded.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p5" pid="c9yhdkkOwUChWfoBJp0jcg" hash="EXyKQg">Various excuses have been used over the centuries to dismiss these divine messengers. There has been denial because the prophet came from an obscure place. “Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.46" class="scriptureRef">John 1:46</a>.) Jesus was also met with the question, “Is not this the carpenter’s son?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.55" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 13:55</a>.) By one means or another, the swiftest method of rejection of the holy prophets has been to find a pretext, however false or absurd, to dismiss the man so that his message could also be dismissed. Prophets who were not glib, but slow of speech, were esteemed as naught. Instead of responding to Paul’s message, some saw his bodily presence as weak and regarded his speech as contemptible. Perhaps they judged Paul by the timbre of his voice or by his style of speech, not the truths uttered by him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p6" pid="u1bsfRLvl02E0niSRAlvHA" hash="3QgYaw">We wonder how often hearers first rejected the prophets because they despised them, and finally despised the prophets even more because they had rejected them. Even so, why else is the record of rejection so complete? The cares of the world are so many and so entangling, even very good people are diverted from following the truth because they care too much for the things of the world, such as the young man who had kept all the commandments from his youth up. He could not do the one last thing that Jesus asked: “Sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/18.22" class="scriptureRef">Luke 18:22</a>.) We read that he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p7" pid="Ku9a--8AfEy9YSyKOFqmEw" hash="c5Cuig">Sometimes people let their hearts get so set upon things and the honors of this world that they cannot learn the lessons they most need to learn. Simple truths are often rejected in favor of the much less demanding philosophies of men, and this is another cause for the rejection of the prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p8" pid="aABkN9U0WkGbMJJbfAYBnA" hash="8ENhpA">But while there are various excuses for rejection, there’s a certain cause for this sad record. It must not be passed over. The cares of the world, the honors of the world, and looking beyond the mark are all determined by a persuasive few who presume to speak for all. Paul had difficulty because there were no leaders of thought among the Jews: Jesus was seen as a stumbling block, and among the Greeks, Christianity was seen as foolishness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p9" pid="BC0NLOZHnU2zTG1wa3Gx9g" hash="k2BxAg">The holy prophets have not only refused to follow erroneous human trends, but have pointed out these errors. No wonder the response to the prophets has not always been one of indifference. So often the prophets have been rejected because they first rejected the wrong ways of their own society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p10" pid="vdZT3W1BZEOiWisnwVpVdw" hash="upJWew">These excuses for rejection of the prophets are poor excuses. The trouble with using obscurity as a test of validity is that God has so often chosen to bring forth his work out of obscurity. He has even said it would be so. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:30</a>.) Christianity did not go from Rome to Galilee; it was the other way around. In our day the routing is from Palmyra to Paris, not the reverse. Just because something is in our midst does not mean that we have been in the midst of it. We can daily drive by a museum or an art gallery but know nothing of what is inside.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p11" pid="4LvwDtAdZ0WdDPr6pNwPLQ" hash="WFbxKQ">The trouble with rejection because of personal familiarity with the prophets is that the prophets are always somebody’s son or somebody’s neighbor. They are chosen from among the people, not transported from another planet, dramatic as that would be!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p12" pid="Ldu7ZC0UbkuPjcLbu31FOA" hash="rI2ZTQ">David was the youngest son of eight. His eldest brother was peeved at the presumptuousness of David for even being at the front where Goliath taunted the armies of Israel. Those who were so busy being indignant with David missed the purity in David’s indignation at Goliath, for the giant was defying the armies of the living God. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17.28-32" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 17:28–32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p13" pid="yPDdfAPMjkC0F_mpZlzS9A" hash="vf-SEQ">David was a local boy and was ignored until he could no longer be ignored. The trouble with rejecting the prophets because they lack prestige is that Paul, who knew something of rejection, forewarned us when he said, speaking of the work of God, “For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1.26" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 1:26</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p14" pid="UICLV0bay0ypN9EBhOCcCg" hash="fupmig">In multiple scriptures the Lord has indicated that he will perform his work through those whom the world regards as weak and despised. Of course, rejection of the holy prophets comes because the hearts of people are hardened, as people are shaped by their society. Yet even when the hardening is swift, it can also be subtle. Who, for instance, a scant twenty years ago would have foreseen the massive use of abortion in society today, like all the diseased doctrines of the devil. The practice is pleasing unto the carnal mind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p15" pid="xovt84Kn20WygHhsiMySyg" hash="kEhOnQ">Prophets have a way of jarring the carnal mind. Too often the holy prophets are wrongly perceived as harsh and as anxious to make a record in order to say, “I told you so.” Those prophets I have known are the most loving of men. It is because of their love and integrity that they cannot modify the Lord’s message merely to make people feel comfortable. They are too kind to be so cruel. I am so grateful that prophets do not crave popularity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p16" pid="xvOzKkVUe0GdU86iaSgSgQ" hash="gy5teQ">If we need a reminder of harsh realities and the dangers of duty which prophets face, Jonah gives us a glimpse in relation to his call to the exceeding great city of Nineveh, which took three days just to walk through, its size was so intimidating. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/jonah/3.3" class="scriptureRef">Jonah 3:3</a>.) One cannot read about the prophet Ether, warning the city by day and hiding by night in a cave, without marveling at his capacity to go each day once again into that hostile city. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/13.title" class="scriptureRef">Ether 13</a>.) We read of Enoch who was called when but a lad. He describes himself as a lad whom the people despised and who was slow of speech; yet he did his duty in love and compassion with stunning success. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.title" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6</a>.) I marvel at the empathy of these men in all ages, because even prophets have no immunity from thorns in the flesh. They learn to cast all their cares upon the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p17" pid="_f7Xa1hY8kKtPni1oeg9bg" hash="pc1qjw">The testimonies of the holy prophets of God have been written in the scriptures but also have often been written in red because these individuals are the Lord’s prophets. They help us to see the end from the beginning. The prophets have always been free from the evil of their times, free to be divine auditors who will still call fraud, fraud; embezzlement, embezzlement; and adultery, adultery.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p18" pid="dvsFo2e3g0KY75CpvVNG5w" hash="DO6BQQ">Now as we conclude this general conference, let us all give heed to what was said to us. Let us assume the counsel given applies to <span class="emphasis">us,</span> to me. Let us harken to those we sustain as prophets and seers, as well as the other brethren as if our eternal life depended upon it, because it does!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p19" pid="vR9dQVw4PEKRvzEgmbHiww" hash="kAp-nA">Now may I make a few further comments to let you know some of my concerns for us as a people who live in such challenging times. May I stress again the value of reading the addresses given at our general conferences in the <span class="emphasis">Ensign</span> magazine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p20" pid="h62_IuKc60O226-txA1RdA" hash="wpYs5Q">Please follow the counsel you have been given in the past and maintain your personal journals. Those who keep a book of remembrance are more likely to keep the Lord in remembrance in their daily lives. Journals are a way of counting our blessings and of leaving an inventory of these blessings for our posterity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p21" pid="odxzgfVdBUmfZVreBYgeFg" hash="YFqNCg">The spring of the year reminds us, too, of the need to garden so that we can produce some of our own food as well as flowers to beautify our yards and our neighborhoods. Even if the tomato you eat is a $2.00 tomato, it will bring satisfaction anyway and remind us all of the law of the harvest, which is relentless in life. We do reap what we sow. Even if the plot of soil you cultivate, plant, and harvest is a small one, it brings human nature closer to nature as was the case in the beginning with our first parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p22" pid="0Iu-y5Jlb0qkEE_QW--bLg" hash="gjdOKw">How can one see the slackening of traditional moral standards and not notice the decline in decency? As a boy I saw how all, young and old, worked and worked hard. We knew that we were taming the Arizona desert. But had I been wiser then, I would have realized that we were taming ourselves, too. Honest toil in subduing sagebrush, taming deserts, channeling rivers, helps to take the wildness out of man’s environment but also out of him. The disdain for work among some today may merely signal the return of harshness and wildness—perhaps not to our landscape but to some people. The dignity and self-esteem that honest work produces are essential to happiness. It is so easy for leisure to turn into laziness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p23" pid="CbqzwuK4IUKe8XJbn9ZPyw" hash="FId-9Q">How can one witness so many of those who ought to be good examples becoming bad examples and not cry out? Those who seem to flout the institution of marriage, and who regard chastity before marriage with fidelity after as old-fashioned, seem determined to establish a new fashion on their own and impose it upon others. Can they not see the gross selfishness that will lead finally to deep loneliness? Can they not see that, pushed by pleasure, they will become more and more distant from joy? Can they not see that their kind of fulfillment will produce a hollowness and an emptiness from which no fleeting pleasure can finally rescue them? The law of the harvest has not been repealed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p24" pid="kLcfMC-BG0mtuqUarIJ9sw" hash="HIzbDA">Once the carnal in man is no longer checked by the restraints of family life and by real religion, there comes an avalanche of appetites which gathers momentum that is truly frightening. As one jars loose and begins to roll down hill, still another breaks loose, whether it is an increase in homosexuality, corruption, drugs, or abortion. Each began as an appetite that needed to be checked but which went unchecked. Thus misery achieves a ghastly monument.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p25" pid="CuBWjQqO0kSijeBsB2ZL9Q" hash="GBfPbA">Decadence is very demanding and dogmatic, and it is no friend of liberty. Decadence which grew in the soil of tolerance and permissiveness soon seeks to drive out all of these. Then, finally, it reaches a point when, as one prophet declared, “There was no remedy.” In such moments the prophets of God speak out even more forcibly, doing as Alma did when he began bearing down in pure testimony against the evils of his time. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.19" class="scriptureRef">Alma 4:19</a>.) Nothing less will do under those conditions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p26" pid="TW1rBvRJXUKfPi1un23slQ" hash="a5F8Tw">We read of sections of this land where abortions outnumber live births, of how illegitimate births outnumber legitimate, and we wonder how long the judgments of God can be stayed. We read of those who have yielded to the fashion of the time and lived together without being legally married and wonder why such people do not realize that there can be no finding of their identity nor any real sense of belonging while they trample underfoot the commandments of God. We read of the increased portion of our children who are being reared by a single parent and wonder again about what will come when the law of the harvest operates. What is wrong is wrong, and trends do not make something right which is at variance with the laws of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p27" pid="iNHzdfbFGUepzr5OFG1FOg" hash="C4Toxw">We note the increasing coarseness of language and understand how Lot must have felt when he was, according to Peter, “vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/2.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 2:7</a>.) We wonder why those of coarse and profane conversation, even if they refuse obedience to God’s will, are so stunted mentally that they let their capacity to communicate grow more and more narrow. Language is like music; we rejoice in beauty, range, and quality in both, and we are demeaned by the repetition of a few sour notes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p28" pid="8RjyGRbRrU6TcxkC3I9bzA" hash="IPSCOg">Far from freeing those involved, sin is an admission of surrender to the herd. It is a capitulation to the carnal in man and a rejection of joy and beauty in this life and in the world to come. Because sin is such sadness, the righteous do not stress an attitude of “I told you so”—because the righteous, in their love, truly wish they had been more effective in communication and in testifying so that there could be less misery and more happiness in the world. No wonder we who bear the plan of salvation feel a special urgency in sharing the gospel, because we love our own neighbor. May God help us in the opportunities which are ours to live righteously as a way of witnessing to the world, to speak out humbly but forthrightly, to lead out effectively and thoughtfully, ever using the gospel of Jesus Christ as our constant guide.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/listen-to-the-prophets.p29" pid="KFMOxL6axEyyimGEuNjXKg" hash="ZEzKAQ">Before closing I should like to just add—the four testimonies of these young, new leaders of the Church were very, very inspiring. When I heard each one of them say, “I have put everything I own or ever have owned upon the altar; it’s there for the Lord or his servants to identify and to call upon,” that pleased me because we know there is still faith in the Church, in Zion, among the youth, and among the young people who are growing up in this church. I would not wish to talk longer but just say, the Lord bless you, my brethren and sisters, as you return to your homes. Peace be with you. May you find every home to which you return a real Latter-day Saint home with all the gospel in it. I bear testimony to the divinity also of this great work which is the greatest thing in the world, as was said by one of the Brethren. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We cannot be too often reminded that Church welfare assistance is spiritual at heart and that these spiritual roots would wither if we ever permitted anything like the philosophy of the dole to enter into our Welfare Services ministrations. Everyone assisted can do something. Let us follow the order of the Church in this regard and insure that all who receive give of themselves in return.</p>

As we hear talk of governmental welfare reforms and its myriads of problems, let us remember the covenants we have made to bear one another’s burdens and to succor each according to his need. President Romney, our dean of Welfare Services, gave good counsel when several years ago he made this statement:</p>

Members of the Church are commanded by the Lord to be self-reliant and independent to the extent of their ability. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.13-14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:13–14</a>.)</p>

The Lord declares that herein lies “the agency of man” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.31" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:31</a>), and with this agency comes the responsibility for self. With this agency we can rise to glory or fall to condemnation. May we individually and collectively be ever self-reliant. This is our heritage and our obligation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/becoming-the-pure-in-heart.p12" pid="z1ao55VlrkqlfKKpKXojRw" hash="ksTTtA">The principle of self-reliance stands behind the Church’s emphasis on personal and family preparedness. Our progress in implementing the various facets of this personal and family preparedness is impressive, but there are still far too many families who have yet to heed the counsel to live providently. With the arrival of spring we hope all of you will put in your gardens and prepare to enjoy their produce this summer. We hope you are making this a family affair, with everyone, even the little ones, assigned to something. There is so much to learn and harvest from your garden, far more than just a crop itself. We also hope that you are maintaining your year’s supply of food, clothing, and where possible, some fuel and cash savings. Moreover, we hope that you are conscious of proper diet and health habits, that you may be fit physically and able to respond to the many challenges of life. Would you see to it that in your quorum and Relief Society meetings the principles and practices of personal and family preparedness are taught.</p>

For many years we have been taught that one important end result of our labors, hopes, and aspirations in this work is the building of a Latter-day Zion, a Zion characterized by love, harmony, and peace—a Zion in which the Lord’s children are as one.</p>

Zion can be built up only among those who are the pure in heart, not a people torn by covetousness or greed, but a pure and selfless people. Not a people who are pure in appearance, rather a people who are pure in heart. Zion is to be in the world and not of the world, not dulled by a sense of carnal security, nor paralyzed by materialism. No, Zion is not things of the lower, but of the higher order, things that exalt the mind and sanctify the heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/becoming-the-pure-in-heart.p38" pid="5py4-_TuMkuSh8QvNC6ctg" hash="YMKo3A">Zion is “every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:19</a>.) As I understand these matters, Zion can be established only by those who are pure in heart, and who labor for Zion, for “the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money they shall perish.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.31" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:31</a>.)</p>

That can only be done through consistent and concerted daily effort by every single member of the Church. No matter what the cost in toil or sacrifice, we must “do it.” That is one of my favorite phrases: “Do It.” May I suggest three fundamental things we must do if we are to “bring again Zion,” three things for which we who labor for Zion must commit ourselves.</p>

President Romney recently referred to the tragic cycle of civilization, a cycle propelled by anyone who seeks for power and gain. Was it not this that led Cain to commit the first murder “for the sake of getting gain”? (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.50" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:50</a>.) Is not this the spirit of the anti-Christ in which “every man prospered according to his genius, and … every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime”? (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.17" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:17</a>.) Did not Nephi single this out as the spirit which led his generation to destruction:</p>

The Lord himself declared to our grandparents: “And again, I command thee that thou shalt not covet thine property.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:26</a>.)</p>

It is incumbent upon us to put away selfishness in our families, our business and professional pursuits, and our Church affairs. I am disturbed when I hear of stakes or wards having difficulty dividing equity in welfare projects or making equitable storehouse commodity production assignments. These things should not be. Let us resolve today to overcome any such tendencies.</p>

There must be unanimity in our decisions and unity in our actions. After pleading with the Saints to “let every man esteem his brother as himself” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:24</a>), the Lord concludes his instructions on cooperation to a conference of the membership in these powerful words:</p>

Moreover, when we do so, we are told by the Prophet Joseph Smith that “the greatest temporal and spiritual blessings which always come from faithfulness and concentrated effort, never attended individual exertion or enterprise.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> p. 183.) There are few activities in the Church that require more cooperation and concerted effort than Welfare Services. Whether it is rallying to find employment for a displaced quorum member, toiling on a production project, serving as a lead worker at a Deseret Industries, or accepting foster children in the home, it is cooperation and mutual concern that determines the overall success of the Storehouse Resource System.</p>

We begin by offering a “broken heart and a contrite spirit.” We follow this by giving our best effort in our assigned fields of labor and callings. We learn our duty and execute it fully. Finally we consecrate our time, talents and means as called upon by our file leaders and as prompted by the whisperings of the Spirit. In the Church, as in the Welfare system also, we can give expression to every ability, every righteous desire, every thoughtful impulse. Whether a volunteer, father, home teacher, bishop, or neighbor, whether a visiting teacher, mother, homemaker, or friend—there is ample opportunity to give our all. And as we give, we find that “sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven!” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 147.) And in the end, we learn it was no sacrifice at all.</p>

        &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;The following four addresses were delivered at the special women’s fireside held September 16, originating from the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. Latter-day Saint women twelve and older gathered in more than 1,400 congregations around the world to listen to President Spencer W. Kimball, Sister Ruth H. Funk, formerly general president of the Young Women organization; Sister Elaine Cannon, Young Women general president; and Sister Barbara B. Smith, Relief Society general president. Translations of President Kimball’s message were recorded and sent in the appropriate languages to congregations which did not receive the broadcast.&lt;/span&gt;

I only wish we could meet all the women of the Church in one large body, but we are grateful that the Lord has blessed us with the technology to make tonight’s worldwide assemblies possible. In a way, it is much like the gatherings that used to be held in this historic tabernacle, where all could be sitting together and listening together. I never tire of expressing appreciation for the way in which technology helps us build the kingdom and serve the Saints. In many ways, in spite of the complexities of our growing size, it allows us to keep in touch, perhaps even more adequately than long distances and poor communications did for our pioneer forebears.&lt;/p&gt;

I trust that what I say will be helpful and beneficial to you.&lt;/p&gt;

My dear sisters, choose to keep the commandments of God. For men, for women, for young, for old, this is the secret to happiness, here and hereafter. Keeping them with self-mastery and personal discipline allows the real freedoms that exalt and sustain us. The basic commandments are as simple as they are true: the Ten Commandments as given by God to Moses and the addition to them of what the Savior said—to love the Lord with all your heart, mind, might and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself.&lt;/p&gt;

Keep the Sabbath day holy in thought and deed. Live strictly the Word of Wisdom. Attend to all family duties. Keep your life clean and free from all unholy and impure thoughts and actions. Cultivate those associations and activities which will not threaten and lower your high, righteous standards.&lt;/p&gt;

Thus you may gain strength through the understanding of eternal things. You young women need this close relationship with the mind and will of our Eternal Father. We want our sisters to be scholars of the scriptures as well as our men.&lt;/p&gt;

They are divine principles which, if adhered to, will make you supremely happy.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a transgression to be involved in any illicit sex activity such as fornication or adultery. It is a transgression to become involved in lesbianism or to engage in any lustful activity.&lt;/p&gt;

They make it possible to leave one’s parents and cleave unto one another. But here, more than almost any other place, we must exercise self-control. These drives which are the fountainhead of human life are to be allowed expression only in the sanctity of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p16" pid="GRu1WSowrUWX7QTRKTviJQ" hash="xyxcbA"&gt;Among your most important choices in life should be a temple marriage. Honorable, happy, and successful marriage is surely the goal of every person. One who would purposely or neglectfully avoid its serious implication is frustrating her own eternal program.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p17" pid="1J-Svcy4z0CmshZ8rq8jWg" hash="dcC6RA"&gt;Marriage is perhaps the most vital of all the decisions and has the most far-reaching effects, for it has to do not only with immediate happiness, but eternal joys as well.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p18" pid="Wd8aTodvLkGTW9bom7OKtg" hash="QTUZKg"&gt;In selecting one’s companion for life and for eternity, certainly the most careful planning and thinking and praying and fasting should be done to &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;be sure that of all &lt;/span&gt;the &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;decisions, &lt;/span&gt;this &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;one &lt;/span&gt;is not wrong. In a true marriage there must be a union of minds as well as of hearts. Emotions must not wholly determine decisions, but the mind and the heart, strengthened by fasting and prayer and serious consideration, will give one a maximum chance of marital happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p19" pid="JXXkevRL4kKxNuVt6C-FWA" hash="Ywl2hA"&gt;Some young people think of happiness as a glamorous life of ease, luxury, and constant thrills, but true marriage is based on happiness that is more than that, one that comes from giving, serving, sharing, sacrificing, and selflessness.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p20" pid="d0hdjDzFqkCIAz1b24hoBQ" hash="869kJw"&gt;You can set your goals, young women, to make you reach and strain. Keep striving for them. Be prayerful and humble in seeking wisdom and knowledge. You are in the time of your life for studying and preparing. Learn all you can. Growth comes from setting your goals high and reaching for the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p21" pid="uLtCNorsjE-gptDFRXCv1Q" hash="Ean5zw"&gt;Now, the General Authorities are very much aware of the fact that many of our sisters are widows. Others have become divorced. Still others have never had the privilege of temple marriage. We want all such sisters to understand that when we speak of family life, it is not done to make them feel sad or unappreciated. The leaders of the Church have said often, and clearly, that women in such circumstances include some of the most noble spirits of our Father in Heaven. Those who make the best of what life has given to them will be rewarded for all that they have done in the service of our Heavenly Father and their fellowman.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p22" pid="9MGCHWxp50W8498QGRwj-A" hash="nKPTeQ"&gt;Those of you who do not now experience the traditional women’s role, not by choice, but for reasons beyond control, can still do so much to help others. Your talents and time must not be misused simply because all of the preferred ways of sharing and giving are not open to you presently.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p23" pid="LvJvGqhQn0aFqtPShoBI-A" hash="ef3Hfw"&gt;The Lord knows, too, that through circumstances beyond their control, some mothers are faced with the added responsibility of earning a living. These women have God’s blessings for he knows of their anguish and their struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p24" pid="Qk2kJY_pLUSMY_6GuwBwvg" hash="efzmsQ"&gt;The Church will always hold aloft the banner of happy family life, for we can do no other! Family life is the best method for achieving happiness in this world, and it is a clear pattern given to us from the Lord about what is to be in the next world.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p25" pid="6yhJz3dDFk-2vfqCEhiB4g" hash="dQdgVQ"&gt;We have no choice, dear sisters, but to continue to hold up the ideal of the Latter-day Saint family. The fact that some do not now have the privilege of living in such a family is not reason enough to stop talking about it. We do discuss family life with sensitivity, however, realizing that many sisters do not presently have the privilege of belonging or contributing to such a family. But we cannot set aside this standard, because so many other things depend upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p26" pid="ObsMwKSejECYBueMr65R2A" hash="gV0A6w"&gt;Young women should plan and prepare for marriage and the bearing and rearing of children. It is your divine right and the avenue to the greatest and most supreme happiness. You should also make choices looking forward to productive use of your time once the children are grown and gone from under your wing. You should seek for ways to bless the lives of all with whom you associate. You should know the truth of all things. You should be prepared to help build the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p27" pid="o_SpOmOJH06APheCg2FUYw" hash="RnNtXQ"&gt;You may answer that finding a husband is not within the power of a young woman. The man has the choice. To the extent that that is true, remember that what the Lord expects of each of his daughters is that she seek out those opportunities and make those choices which will keep her worthy of living again with him. Then she will be prepared for marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p28" pid="8xMcfCnteEOMHe7FVFp5yQ" hash="iO5EaQ"&gt;There is a great and grand principle involved here. Just as those who do not hear the gospel in this life, but who would have received it with all their hearts had they heard it, will be given the fulness of the gospel blessings in the next world—so, too, the women of the Church who do not in this life have the privileges and blessings of a temple marriage, through no fault of their own, who would have responded if they had an appropriate opportunity—will receive all those blessings in the world to come. We desire all you sisters to know how much we love and appreciate you. We respect you for your valiant and devoted service, and have many opportunities to observe how dedicated you are!&lt;/p&gt;

What makes her—and literally millions of others of you like her—so trustworthy and so trusting? I think there are some realities to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p30" pid="GPrBiDiBwEao7cFAa7jYMg" hash="zRlGqg"&gt;For one thing, Mormon women are basically strong, independent, and faithful. They have chosen to live by a creed and a way of life that can be demanding at best. From the earliest days of the Church, active membership has meant faith, fortitude, denial, selflessness, and good service.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p31" pid="23quE1UZf0WZKDxh9aKpmg" hash="VyZXbQ"&gt;All Church programs are designed to assist us, whether we are men or women, in becoming better Latter-day Saints. All Church programs are designed to bring us closer to our Heavenly Father and live lives more like that of his perfect son, Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p32" pid="68EUFkygXEiuR3ET7fSt5Q" hash="80pC3w"&gt;The great women of the kingdom have often been uprooted with their husbands and families and have been moved hither and yon, yet they never worried about God’s forgetting them, because they worshipped a God who governs the galaxies but who, in the midst of such vastness, continues to love each of his children perfectly, individually, and constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p33" pid="-e7x-JCmT0q64RDm9WH75A" hash="lKJlhA"&gt;Each of you should be grateful to be a woman! Self-pity is always a sad thing to see and especially when there is no justification for it. To be a righteous woman is a glorious thing in any age. To be a righteous woman during the winding up scenes on this earth, before the second coming of our Savior, is an especially noble calling. The righteous woman’s strength and influence today can be tenfold what it might be in more tranquil times. She has been placed here to help to enrich, to protect, and to guard the home—which is society’s basic and most noble institution. Other institutions in society may falter and even fail, but the righteous woman can help to save the home, which may be the last and only sanctuary some mortals know in the midst of storm and strife.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p34" pid="INEBUZvf2UGwFRBTHqdClg" hash="PHzKjw"&gt;One of the important messages that emerges from the history of great women in all ages is that they cared more for the future of their families than for their own comfort. Such good women had a grasp of what matters in life. When called upon to do so, they could fashion a lovely city in the midst of a swamp or make the desert blossom as a rose.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p35" pid="BxNmnRR6wkiWSMdJEbGdOw" hash="ywZkyg"&gt;Selflessness is a key to happiness and effectiveness; it is precious and must be preserved as a virtue which guarantees so many other virtues. There are so many things in the world which reinforce our natural selfishness, and neither our men nor women should be partakers thereof. We have grown strong as a people because our mothers and our women have been so selfless. That ennobling quality must not be lost, even though some of the people of the world may try to persuade otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p36" pid="wy5xWe7Pe0i6UbofKE8lSQ" hash="0HnOuQ"&gt;While there is much variety in the circumstances in which the women of the Church find themselves, they still have much more in common with each other than with other groups. Let us be conscious of doctrines which preach unity but which end up dividing. We hope our women as well as our men will be conscious of the philosophies of the world which would attempt to reverse the wisdom of the Lord when he told us that we can find ourselves only by losing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p37" pid="ozXi2eYHvUqUjAV_xpSiTw" hash="q7txZQ"&gt;There is a constant need to develop and to maintain tenderness. The world’s ways harden us. The tenderness of our women is directly linked to the tenderness of our children. The women of the Church do so much to teach our sons and daughters and to prepare the rising generation. Let us make no mistake about it—the home is the seedbed of Saints! Both sin and selfishness destroy our spiritual sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p38" pid="Sx4_KOGf5kCns_zNxmNy0Q" hash="9LD1bg"&gt;I am grateful for the way in which our sisters are encouraged to perform acts of Christian service as a result of their affiliation with Relief Society and other Church organizations. I hope our young women of the Church will establish early in their lives a habit of Christian service. When we help other people with their problems, it puts ours in fresh perspective. We encourage the sisters of the Church—young and older—to be “anxiously engaged” in quiet acts of service for friends and neighbors. Every principle of the gospel carries within itself its own witness that it is true. So it is that acts of service help not only the beneficiaries of the service, but they enlarge the giver.&lt;/p&gt;

Women, so often, are charity personified.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p41" pid="1M6UKawiHEakGhuXF7RV2g" hash="wlhe_A"&gt;It is true of all of us that, as we progress spiritually, our sense of belonging, identity, and self-worth increases. Let us create a climate in which we encourage the sisters of the Church to have a program of personal improvement. It ought to be a practical and realistic program, which is determined personally and not imposed upon them. Yet it ought to cause them to reach for new levels of achievement. We are not asking for something spectacular but rather for the women of the Church to find real self-fulfillment through wise self-development in the pursuit of righteous and worthy endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p42" pid="w_4Tcnk9PEeYYmIbrUSU6g" hash="lDxiig"&gt;We should be as concerned with the woman’s capacity to communicate as we are to have her sew and preserve food. Good women are articulate as well as affectionate. One skill or one attribute need not be developed at the expense of another. Symmetry in our spiritual development is much to be desired. We are as anxious for women to be as wise in the management of their time as we are for women to be wise stewards of the family’s storehouse of food.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p43" pid="CTltUcH2_06X04BON8hVUQ" hash="QkPOvg"&gt;We know that women who have deep appreciation for the past will be concerned about shaping a righteous future. We desire women to develop social refinements because these are very real dimensions of keeping the second great commandment—to love one’s neighbor as oneself. We know that women who will improve their relationships with the Father in Heaven will also improve their relationships with their neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters.p44" pid="HlgAOFd8AUKNKeUOeYSObw" hash="BFfSdQ"&gt;The women of God in all ages have been able to reflect with awe upon the handiwork of God in the heavens without neglecting the practical skills needed not only to survive on this planet but to live an abundant life. There is more of a connection than many realize between the order and purpose of the universe and the order and harmony which exists in a happy and good family.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially is this true if we approach these things in the spirit of the thirteenth Article of Faith: “If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.” [&lt;a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13" class="scriptureRef"&gt;A of F 1:13&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

But be not deceived; you must also be responsible for your choices. This is an eternal principle. The law of the harvest is ever in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Trust on the part of all. Now, just as God trusted us with all he had created here on earth, we must trust his knowledge and love and each other.&lt;/p&gt;

The Primary song says, “I am a child of God.” Born with a noble birthright. God is your father. He loves you. He and your mother in heaven value you beyond any measure.

One of a kind, made of the eternal intelligence which gives you claim upon eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

Remember that your choices may control to some extent others whose lives will be a part of your life. Remember also that if you succeed, it isn’t because of luck. Success comes from faith and work and prayer and from constant righteous effort. It is a question of agency—of what you choose to do with gifts of God—everything upon the earth, wherein there is life. This reverence for agency and life make us greatly concerned about the world in which we live today. It is a world beset with evil, with frustrations, with ugliness. It makes us realize that we must make a strong stand for the right or we may not stand at all.&lt;/p&gt;

He strikes the moral sanctity of the home. It is labeled “a new morality” in which freedom of sexual relations is proclaimed. It seeks destruction of the faithfulness and fidelity of husband and wife in the face of the Lord’s commandment, “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.14" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Ex. 20:14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

When the sun grows cold and the stars no longer shine, the law of chastity will still be basic in God’s world and in the Lord’s church. Old values are not upheld by the Church because they are old, but rather because through the ages they have proved to be right and because God has thus spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

It is divorce, with all its destructive forces, including heartaches, suffering, sorrow, and often disastrous results. We have often discussed the sadness and disappointments and sorrows of divorce. We can hardly emphasize it too much.&lt;/p&gt;

He has entrusted to his daughters the great responsibility of bearing and nurturing children.&lt;/p&gt;

Loud, blatant voices today shout, “Fewer children,” and offer the pill, surgery, and even ugly abortion, which has reached monumental numbers. It is an awful thing when mothers without righteous cause take the lives or participate in the taking of the lives of their unborn children.&lt;/p&gt;

In the perspective of the gospel it is not so. There is divinity in each new life. There is challenge in creating the environment in which a child can grow and develop. There is partnership between the man and woman in building a family which can last throughout the eternities.&lt;/p&gt;

They are partners with God, as well as with their own husbands, first in giving birth to the Lord’s spirit children and then in rearing those children so they will serve the Lord and keep his commandments. Could there be a more sacred trust than to be a trustee for honorable, well-born, well-developed children?

Stapley of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He died on August 19, 1978. Elder Stapley served faithfully and ably in the Twelve for twenty-eight years. His presence will be missed greatly, and we repeat our love and condolence extended to his family at the time of his passing. We present for the vote of the conference, as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to replace Elder Stapley, Elder James Esdras Faust. All of you who are in favor of this proposition, please make it manifest by the show of the right hand.</p>

Will those who can sustain these Brethren in the positions indicated, please signify it by raising your right hands? Any contrary by the same sign.</p>

We are constantly opening up new areas, and we are continually establishing new missions and dividing others to give more effective leadership to the ever-increasing numbers of our young men and women engaged in full-time missionary service. Since our last conference six months ago, we have added ten new missions, for a total of 166 throughout the world. We now have 26,606 missionaries carrying the gospel to almost every nation, kindred, tongue and people under the direction of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, whose divine calling it is “to officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to the institution of heaven; to build up the church, and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:33</a>).</p>

We urge parents not only to engage in this activity, but to let their boys and girls share in helping with the garden. They will not only learn the value and joy of work, but it will help them develop a sense of responsibility as they participate in such family projects.</p>

Any Latter-day Saint family that has searched genealogical and historical records has fervently wished their ancestors had kept better and more complete records. On the other hand, some families possess some spiritual treasures because ancestors have recorded the events surrounding their conversion to the gospel and other happenings of interest, including many miraculous blessings and spiritual experiences. People often use the excuse that their lives are uneventful and nobody would be interested in what they have done. But I promise you that if you will keep your journals and records they will indeed be a source of great inspiration to your families, to your children, your grandchildren, and others, on through the generations.</p>

All those who possess temple recommends should use them as often as possible to engage in baptisms, endowments, and sealings for the dead. Other members of the Church should concern themselves seriously with preparations to qualify for temple recommends that they, too, might enjoy these eternal blessings and also act as saviors on Mount Zion. There is an ever-increasing burden of temple work to be done by the Saints, and we should rise to meet this challenge.</p>

The Lord’s holy day is fast losing its sacred significance throughout the world, at least our world. More and more, man destroys the Sabbath’s sacred purposes in pursuit of wealth, pleasure, recreation, and the worship of false and material gods. We continue to urge all Saints and God-fearing people everywhere to observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy. Businesses will not be open on the Sabbath if they are not patronized on that holy day. The same is true of resorts, sporting events, and recreation areas of all kinds. Pursuit of the almighty dollar is winning, it seems, over the Lord’s commandment, “Keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/lev/19.30" class="scriptureRef">Lev. 19:30</a>).</p>

We are greatly concerned about the world in which we live. The mass media of communications daily presents us with so much that is evil, that is ugly and sordid, and so much that is destructive of righteousness. Godlessness seems to reign everywhere. Satan is unfettered apparently. We have previously said that the growing permissiveness in modern society gravely concerns us.</p>

Even the pace of life itself has speeded up. Sometimes it seems that the world is undergoing such throes of change that people are disoriented, not knowing what is of value. Right and wrong, however, are as they always were. The principles of the gospel are unaltered. All of men’s evil speaking and all of men’s evil acting cannot alter one jot or tittle of the commandments of God.</p>

Homes had been overturned and shredded, crushed into splinters like toothpicks; fences and gardens were obliterated; bridges and roads were washed away. Bathtubs, refrigerators, mangled autos lay strewn all about the streets. Where one of our little chapels had stood, nothing remained but the foundation. More than a hundred people lost their lives; as many more were injured; thousands were left homeless. I heard many stories while there of suffering, of heroism, of salvation.</p>

However, two of their little girls were away from home playing near a clump of lauhala trees. They saw the wave coming, ran into the trees, and held tightly with their arms around the tree trunks. The first gigantic wave washed entirely over them, but they held their breath and clung with all their might until the water receded and their heads were again above the water. When the wave receded, they quickly ran up the hill before the succeeding waves came. Together, the family watched from the safety of the hill as their home below disappeared under the pounding of the waves.</p>

It behooves us to be alert and to listen and flee from the evil for our eternal lives. Without help we cannot stand against it. We must flee to high ground or cling fast to that which can keep us from being swept away. That to which we must cling for safety is the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is our protection from whatever force the evil one can muster. An inspired Book of Mormon prophet counseled his people: “Remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:12</a>).</p>

You will have had your own reports from your wives and sisters, mothers, and daughters about the meeting. We feel gratified that we were able to hold the meeting and that technology made it possible. We love the women of the Church! We have great respect for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/fundamental-principles-to-ponder-and-live.p3" pid="mu9XWJT4dkaALHiEMUUQnA" hash="7lQ9Aw">In following up on that event, I want to counsel you as sons, brothers, fathers, and husbands. As you serve with the women of the Church, follow what Paul said when he urged Timothy to “intreat … the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/5.1-2" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 5:1–2</a>). We men of the priesthood ought to so do. We must be different than other men, and I am sure most priesthood holders are. Paul’s suggestion that we treat older women as if they were our mothers and younger women as if they were our sisters and to do so with “all purity” is excellent instruction. Men of the world may disregard women or see them only as objects of desire or as someone to be used for selfish purposes. Let us, however, be different in our conduct and in our relationships with women.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/fundamental-principles-to-ponder-and-live.p4" pid="8eJTWwql7kytUsnVzY6Rsw" hash="9OAIWw">Peter urged us to give honor unto our wives. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 3:7</a>.) It seems to me we should be even more courteous to our wives and mothers, our sisters and our daughters, than we are to others. When Paul said that a man who did not <span class="emphasis">provide</span> for his own and those of his own household was “worse than an infidel” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/5.8" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 5:8</a>), I like to think of providing for our own as including providing them with affectional security as well as economic security. When the Lord told us in this dispensation that “women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/83.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 83:2</a>), I like to think of <span class="emphasis">maintenance</span> as including our obligation to maintain loving affection and to provide consideration and thoughtfulness as well as food.</p>

I sometimes think our own Latter-day Saint women are “needy” just because some of us are not as thoughtful and considerate of them as we should be. Our pantries can be filled with food and yet our sisters can be starved for affection and recognition.</p>

It is not only wicked to destroy them, it is a shame, in my opinion. I think that this principle should extend not only to the bird life but to the life of all animals. For that purpose I read the scripture where the Lord gave us all the animals. Seemingly, he thought it was important that all these animals be on the earth for our use and encouragement.</p>

Smith said, “When I visited, a few years ago, the Yellowstone National Park, and saw in the streams and the beautiful lakes, birds swimming quite fearless of man, allowing passers-by to approach them as closely almost as tame birds, and apprehending no fear of them, and when I saw droves of beautiful deer [feeding] along the side of the road, as fearless of the presence of men as any domestic animal, it filled my heart with a degree of peace and joy that seemed to be almost a foretaste of that period hoped for when there shall be none to hurt and none to molest in all the land, especially among all the inhabitants of Zion. These same birds, if they were to visit other regions, inhabited by man, would, on account of their tameness, doubtless become more easily a prey to the gunner. The same may be said of those beautiful creatures—the deer and the antelope. If they should wander out of the park, beyond the protection that is established there for these animals, they would become, of course, an easy prey to those who were seeking their lives. I never could see why a man should be imbued with a blood-thirsty desire to kill and destroy animal life. I have known men—and they still exist among us—who enjoy what is, to them, the ‘sport’ of hunting birds and slaying them by the hundreds, and who will come in after a day’s sport, boasting of how many harmless birds they have had the skill to slaughter, and day after day, during the season when it is lawful for men to hunt and kill (the birds having had a season of protection and not apprehending danger) go out by scores or hundreds, and you may hear their guns early in the morning on the day of the opening, as if great armies had met in battle; and the terrible work of slaughtering the innocent birds goes on.</p>

He said once: “We crossed the Embarras river and encamped on a small branch of the same about one mile west. In pitching my tent we found three massasaugas or prairie rattlesnakes, which the brethren were about to kill, but I said, ‘Let them alone—don’t hurt them! How will the serpent ever lose his venom, while the servants of God possess the same disposition and continue to make war upon it? Men must become harmless, before the brute creation; and when men lose their vicious dispositions and cease to destroy the animal race, the lion and the lamb can dwell together, and the sucking child can play with the serpent in safety.’ The brethren took the serpents carefully on sticks and carried them across the creek. I exhorted the brethren not to kill a serpent, bird, or an animal of any kind during our journey unless it became necessary in order to preserve ourselves from hunger.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 2:71–72.)</p>

I mentioned this the other day to the brethren in the Regional Representatives meeting. We’ve hardly scratched the surface.

There are far too few who are willing to pay the price, in discipline and work, to cultivate hardy roots. Such cultivation should begin in our youth. Little did I know as a boy that daily chores in the garden, feeding the cattle, carrying the water, chopping the wood, mending fences, and all the labor of a small farm was an important part of sending down roots, before being called on to send out branches. I’m so grateful that my parents understood the relationship between roots and branches. Let us each cultivate deep roots, so that we may secure the desired fruits of our welfare labors.</p>

We all have challenges, heartaches, and experience success and failures. It is from these that we grow, gain strength and experience while in mortality. But when they take on serious proportions, it sometimes means we have not been fully obedient to counsel—both that of the Lord through his Spirit and that of our appointed leaders.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="2FewFwxIEUy_az5ZBXmfGw" hash="_nEVWg">I send my blessings and solemn greetings to all the Saints and to our countless friends and investigators the world over. Also, I invite the honest in heart everywhere to join with us in worshiping our divine Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="VM0J6YbjHUK2G_206Ng1hQ" hash="kpvJdg">Since we last met in general conference here on Temple Square in Salt Lake City six months ago, we have witnessed much growth and expansion of the Lord’s kingdom. We have opened a beautiful new temple in South America at Sao Paulo, Brazil, and have rededicated for the work of the Lord the temple in Logan, Utah, for the temple ordinances to be performed there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="HsZho_gBw0ipWtBSPTKk5w" hash="pDOKDQ">Five other temples are in varying stages of construction, and more are in contemplation toward fulfilling the prediction of latter-day prophets that holy temples will dot this and other lands from end to end, where the work of the Lord is being firmly established.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="TCq5eLB5eEauNn_lvEp3sg" hash="EdH4Uw">Our missionary force is constantly growing and is now approximately 28,000 missionaries. We think that there are tens of thousands of brethren and sisters in the Wasatch Front and elsewhere in the Church who could fill regular missions as worthy, able brethren and sisters if their bishops would call them on missions. We recognize that many of these missionaries are young men and young women, and it’s a growing number always. They are spending two years of their lives in the mission field, in the most significant and unselfish volunteer service, to carry the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to the nations of the world. These numbers are impressive, but we must not stop there. The need is ever greater, and more and more laborers are needed in the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="Q8815HSecESsdlmIgP8W8w" hash="E518mA">We have established new missions covering almost all of the free world, and we are turning our attention more diligently now to one day sharing the gospel with our Father’s children behind the so-called iron and bamboo curtains. We have need to prepare for that day. The urgency of that preparation weighs heavily upon us. That day may come with more swiftness than we realize.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="OHfwTU-Ghk-xxLVpAK_wRw" hash="Gn_PvA">Every year now we are adding approximately a hundred new stakes—the locally governed ecclesiastical units of Mormonism composed of several wards and branches each. Only a few weeks ago we created the thousandth such stake of Zion at Nauvoo, Illinois, a place of deep historical significance to the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="Hr6x1UtzMU2bBqffYjiSKQ" hash="9b9DbA">I rejoice with you, my brothers and sisters, in these statistical evidences of the progress and growth throughout Zion. It is indeed progress to add new thousands of people to a membership now in excess of four million. It is pleasing to build the temples and places of worship in so many lands and to add thousands of students to our expanding educational and training programs for both youth and adults.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="JAztF8u9B0qqxPbwscY8PA" hash="2NGAew">We are happy to see the further expansion of our vast Church Welfare program, with new bishops’ storehouses and production units for relief of the poor. The Savior has commanded and charged us with the care of the poor among us since the very earliest days of the Church—even to the directing of the ways in which the responsibility should be discharged—a program which has always stressed the independence of the individual by helping provide work opportunities and guiding lines for those who need rehabilitation. We feel very happy with this growth and all other growth that is being displayed in the Church in all the lands where we go.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="Pt6YSREcvkmp0XmybrcePA" hash="EDiEWQ">Each of our quorums of the priesthood has increased steadily in membership, as also have our auxiliaries working especially among the children, the youth, and the women of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="2x_wcgtj402CHSc7_KobkQ" hash="4ky16w">In all of this evidence of progress, there is cause for rejoicing, but unfortunately we cannot proclaim that “all is well in Zion.” We find that we Latter-day Saints are also vulnerable to the destructive forces of evil that are all about us in this sin-sick world. Of the greatest concern in this day are those evils which tear at the fabric of the home and family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="ew_hzh8gi0Ss0bPfX0QN8Q" hash="Pkl54g">Often we have called upon our people, and we repeat it again, to give attention to the outward appearance of their homes and buildings, the barns, the sheds, the fences, the places of business, to make our communities attractive and desirable. We have asked, and repeat it again and again, that you plant trees and shrubs and vegetables and berry gardens to beautify your properties and help provide for your needs. Your response to these appeals has been gratifying, and many letters have been received telling of your cooperation in these matters, and we are very proud of you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="oAKZC8tfqUacRgmtjBtXtg" hash="sqwwyQ">Don’t stop. Continue on. But while we would encourage you to continue to give attention to the outward appearance of your homes, we now implore you to give more and more attention to the <span class="emphasis">interior</span> of your homes. I do not refer alone to the cleanliness and attractiveness of the home and furnishings, as important as these may be, but to the cleanliness and godliness of the family members and to the general atmosphere that prevails.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="OR-GrymmikiCmhqBPZGcew" hash="w5tWJQ">The Church’s long-standing concern for children and its massive commitment in time and energy and resources to improve their lot are well-documented. We are constantly seeking ways to strengthen families and bless children, and that commitment will be continued and reinforced this year and in all the years to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="p6VR_4spdUutQX5rz19Bag" hash="wy_Etw">The Church welcomes the concerns of others to achieve these beneficial ends through appropriate means. We again are reemphasizing, however, that the greatest blessing we can give our own children and that can be extended to all the children of the world will come through the simple processes of teaching and training them in the way of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="2Pbhw1hVHkGhKdSFh8IIGg" hash="0T397g">Home life, proper teaching in the home, parental guidance and leadership—these are the panacea for the ailments of the world and its children. They are the cure for spiritual and emotional diseases and the remedy for its problems. Parents should not leave the training of children to others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="DwnI4LB65Uiq7GzNg4S5gg" hash="s3y2qw">There seems to be a growing tendency to shift this responsibility from the home to outside influences such as the school and the church, and of greater concern, to various child-care agencies and institutions. Important as these outward influences may be, they never can adequately take the place of the influence of the mother and the father. Constant training, constant vigilance, companionship, and being watchmen of our own children are necessary in order to keep our homes intact and to bless our children in the Lord’s own way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="WqVZmu_XOEe810r89BjRXQ" hash="mAvuRw">The Doctrine and Covenants makes it very clear. It is the responsibility of the parents to teach their children. All other agencies are secondary. If parents do not teach their children—<span class="emphasis">their</span> children—they will be held responsible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="Otk3QX6uiEqsZLM6nYgssA" hash="z0PtBA">We need continually to fortify our homes and families and defend them against the onslaught of evils such as divorce, broken families, brutality, and abuse, especially of wives and children. We need to constantly guard against immorality, pornography, and sexual permissiveness that would destroy the purity of the family members, young and old.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="TJPETrWDmEehBeVwmX3HhA" hash="PLBI1A">Such evils are very real and very threatening. One has but to read the headlines of our newspapers and magazines to become frighteningly aware of the crumbling, destructive influences which surround us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="IiJRHi1Ai0-tTjtEqCmwsA" hash="5CXTUQ">Perhaps I sound like an alarmist. If so, it is because I <span class="emphasis">am</span> alarmed. I am greatly concerned, and so are my Brethren in the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles and others of the General Authorities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="PpP_khYeV02ZOokw4GT0MQ" hash="moksvg">If we could but suggest you go home and lock these evils out by closing and bolting the windows and locking the doors of your homes securely, it would be a simple matter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="8aX29FACsUSOHFZkjQxLhA" hash="hdVTug">However, such security would be ineffective against the evils of which we speak. They come into our homes on ether waves by radio and the television screen. We find these evil forces almost everywhere we go. Exposure is almost constant. We track them into the home from the school, from the playground, from the theater, the office, and the marketplace. There are but few places we go in our everyday world where we can escape them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="OgWEfY9GoUaYzFpw3dvKvg" hash="GZSh-A">What then must be our service? What must we do? We must be constantly alert to their evil presence in our homes and destroy them as we would the germs and filth of disease. We must hunt them from the closets of our minds, freeing ourselves of such worldliness, quenching the embers of wickedness before they become destructive flames. How do we do this?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="LcZKltUyxEKfzwl_Apgi6w" hash="ik6tSQ">If we would escape those deadly thrusts of the evil one and keep our homes and families free and solidly fortified against all destructive influences so rampant about us, we must have the help of the very founder and organizer of this family plan—the Creator himself. There is only one sure way and that is through the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and being obedient to its profound and inspired teachings. Surely we must be made to realize that the purchase price of a family hearth free of such evil influences is the keeping of the commandments of God.</p>

He decreed that the basic unit of society should be the home and the family, and we must be warned that the false culture of the day is turning away from this God-ordained plan.</p>

It is an act of extreme selfishness for a married couple to refuse to have children when they are able to do so. It is a crime next to murder itself to destroy and abort the fetus except for extreme reasons which would endanger the life of the mother.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="ANHIT1dEQUagqmc-jJ_1Vg" hash="lKNR5A">As we have said on previous occasions, certainly our Heavenly Father is distressed with the increasing inroads among his children of such insidious sins as adultery and fornication and homosexuality, lesbianism, abortion, alcoholism, dishonesty, and crime generally, which threaten the total breakdown of the family and the home.</p>

When the selection of a life’s companion is made and the time comes, our young people should marry in the holy temple and have their families; complete their education; establish themselves in a profitable, honorable and rewarding occupation; and give themselves to their families, to the gospel, and to the Church.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="QNYA2Pl6E0yxLGrSjuA7XQ" hash="m0WarQ">There seems to be a growing trend against marriage from degenerate areas of the world and a very strong trend toward marriage without children. Naturally the next question is, “Why marry?” And the “antimarriage revolution” comes into focus. Arguments are given that children are a burden, a tie, a responsibility. Many have convinced themselves that education, freedom from restraint and responsibility—that is the life. And unfortunately this benighted and destructive idea is taking hold of some of our own people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="ALc1MrFfnkCvYX-e1Br8sg" hash="luheGQ">Marriage is ordained of God.

Instead, he has given us the avenue of communication known as prayer, whereby we might humble ourselves and seek his help and divine guidance, so that we could establish a house of prayer. I have previously said that they who reach down into the depths of life where, in the stillness, the voice of God has been heard, have the stabilizing power which carries them poised and serene through the hurricane of difficulties. President Harold B. Lee has said it this way: “Just as a flood-lighted temple is more beautiful in a severe storm or in a heavy fog, so the gospel of Jesus Christ is more glorious in times of inward storm and of personal sorrow and tormenting conflict” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1965, p. 16).</p>

None of us should get so busy in our lives that we cannot contemplate with prayer. Prayer is the passport to spiritual power.</p>

I say to everyone within the sound of my voice, “Do not fail the Lord.” We must accept the truth that the gospel principles are not on trial but that <span class="emphasis">we</span> are. The teachings of Jesus as revealed through the ancient and modern prophets are constant and unchanging.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fortify-your-homes-against-evil.p" pid="Q380TW7XQEKlMflpKUq-qw" hash="DGu8LQ">The history of man evidences that these teachings are true. The rise and fall of civilizations according to the alternating righteousness and wickedness of the peoples proclaim the need to hear and to heed the Savior’s divine messages. We must prepare ourselves, both individually and as a church, to defend the gospel truths against a world steeped in atheism and godlessness. We must oppose the so-called intellectuals who reason that they have all the answers, and we must contend mightily with those whose lust for power and worldly gain destroy their sense of right and wrong.</p>

We cannot condone a separation of our religious beliefs from our daily living. Righteousness must prevail in our lives and in our homes.</p>

Being a good Christian means we must be a good citizen of our country, wherever we live. We must be respectful and honorable in all our relationships with our fellowmen. We must worship the Lord in truth and keep all of his commandments. We must seek for an enlarged capacity to influence the world toward a return to righteousness and a pure love of God.</p>

      <description>Brethren, we have had a rich experience this night, listening to the servants of the Lord. They have given to us words of truth and righteousness. I hope that these words have sunk deep into the hearts of all those who have been listening tonight.</description>

Hunter spoke of one of the presidents of the Church, Wilford Woodruff, and it stirred my memory of some experiences of President Woodruff that I had been reading about. I would like to tell you of two or three of them while we are concluding this meeting. All of these experiences happened to him while he was a youth like those of you holding the Aaronic Priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/preparing-for-service-in-the-church.p" pid="SDXTOXojFUCtgHD6ocSg6g" hash="hBoaag">President Woodruff was one of the great spiritual giants of this dispensation. The Lord gave him many dreams and visions; he baptized thousands of converts, as was explained to us today, and he performed many, many miracles. Few men have enjoyed more of the guidance of the Holy Spirit than did President Woodruff. He was an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, was valiant and true all his days, and, in the provinces of the Lord, he was the fourth president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is the one who dedicated the Salt Lake Temple in 1893, and it was to him that the founders of the American nation appeared in the St. George Temple, seeking to have the temple ordinances performed for them. That was very unusual, brethren, and those kinds of miracles and visions and revelations were rather unusual, as you would know. These men of the American Constitution had lived in a day when the gospel was not upon the earth, but they were upright, good men who were entitled to all of the blessings which come to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/preparing-for-service-in-the-church.p" pid="vdScEtbi5E-cEU-IcOSaBg" hash="vRjLLw">We all need heroes to honor and admire; we need people after whom we can pattern our lives. For us Christ is the chiefest of these. “What manner of men ought ye to be?” he asked his Nephite disciples. His answer, “Verily I say unto you, even as I am.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>.) Christ is our pattern, our guide, our prototype, and our friend. We seek to be like him so that we can always be with him. In a lesser degree the apostles and prophets who have lived as Christ lived also become examples for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/preparing-for-service-in-the-church.p" pid="b8KWlsOQW0mBje7KYekspg" hash="KyaIEQ">Coming back to the thought of this special vision: Brother Woodruff saw to it through the authorities at the temple there that these people received their endowments and the blessings to which they were entitled. The wives went in and did the work for the women, who were anxious that this work be done. Now you can see why Elder Royden G. Derrick spoke to us today about temple service. There are millions of people in the spirit world who are anxious that this work be done for them, realizing that they have come to a halt. They cannot go further until the work has been done for them.</p>

That sermon was what I had prayed for from my childhood,” he said. “When I heard it I had a testimony for myself that it was true. I received it with every sentiment of my heart. He preached in a schoolhouse upon a farm that we owned in Oswego County, New York. He opened the door for any remarks to be made. The house was crowded. The first thing I knew I stood on top of a bench before the people, not knowing what I got up for. But I said to my neighbors and friends, ‘I want you to be careful what you say as touching these men (there were two of them) and their testimony, for they are servants of God, and they have testified unto us the truth—principles that I have been looking for from my childhood.’</p>

I was always sorry that I was not a deacon first, for I had a desire to bear the priesthood in its various degrees as far as I was worthy. I had had a desire for years, not only to hear the gospel, but to have the privilege and power of preaching it to my fellow men. I was a miller by trade, and I spent many a midnight hour in the mill calling upon the Lord for light and truth, and praying that I might hear the gospel of Christ, and be able to teach it to my fellow men. I rejoiced in it when I did receive it.” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</span> sel. G. Homer Durham, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946, p. 304.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/preparing-for-service-in-the-church.p" pid="EHhgcv1vUEK7foeZORC3jw" hash="WyMESw">President Woodruff was born March 1, 1807; he was baptized December 31, 1833, when he was twenty-six years old, and was ordained a teacher on January 25, 1834.</p>

We learn that he desired to preach the gospel, that his heart was right, and that he immediately believed the gospel when he heard it preached.</p>

We appreciated what was said about the missions this afternoon by President Ezra Taft Benson. All young men in the Church should be very eager to go on a mission, and they should also assist their parents to fill missions after the families are raised.</p>

In this dream I saw a great gulf, a place where all the world had to enter at death, before doing which they had to drop their worldly goods. I saw an aged man with a beaver hat and a broadcloth suit. The man looked very sorrowful. I saw him come with something on his back, which he had to drop among the general pile before he could enter the gulf. I was then but a boy. A few years after this my father and mother removed to Farmington, and there I saw that man. I knew him the moment I saw him. His name was Chauncy Deming. In a few years afterwards he was taken sick and died. I attended his funeral,” President Woodruff said. “He was what you may call a miser, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. When the coffin was being lowered into the grave my dream came to me, and that night his son-in-law found one hundred thousand dollars in a cellar belonging to the old man. I name this merely to show that in this dream I had manifested to me certain things that were true. I think of all the inhabitants of the world having to leave their goods when they come to the grave.</p>

That was fulfilled to the very letter, for I afterwards baptized my uncle and his wife and some of the children; also my own father and stepmother and stepsister; and a Methodist priest or classleader—in fact, I baptized everybody in my father’s house. I merely mention this to show that dreams sometimes do come to pass in life.” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</span> pp. 283–84.)</p>

After arriving in Missouri, having gone through many trials and tribulations, and suffering from cholera, which caused us to lay in the grave fifteen of our brethren, we stayed at Brother Lyman Wight’s. While at Lyman Wight’s, I attended council meetings with the Prophet, with David Whitmer, with Oliver Cowdery, and other leading brethren of the Church. David Whitmer was the president of the stake of Zion. Brother Joseph reproved him very sharply, as well as some of the other brethren, because of their lack in fulfilling the commandments of God and doing their duty.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/preparing-for-service-in-the-church.p" pid="JkuFSAothEGLdKHpr1RjlA" hash="Xm7sZw">“While at that place I had a great desire in my heart to go and preach the gospel. I went off one Sunday night by myself into a hickory grove, several hundred yards from the settlement, and I asked the Lord to open the door for me that I might go and preach the gospel. I did not want to preach the gospel for any honor I might get on this earth; for I thoroughly understood, as far as a man could in my condition, what a preacher would have to pass through. It was not honor, nor wealth, nor gold, nor silver, that I desired: But I knew this was the gospel of Christ, revealed to me by the power of God; I knew this was the Church of Christ; I knew Joseph Smith was a prophet of God; and I had a desire that I might preach that gospel to the nations of the earth. I asked the Lord to give me that privilege. The Lord answered that prayer, and said I should have my desire granted. I got up rejoicing. I walked about two hundred yards out in the open road; and when I got into the road there stood Judge Higbee. Said he, ‘Brother Woodruff, the Lord has revealed to me that it is your duty to be ordained to go and preach the gospel.’</p>

I was called by Bishop Partridge to go to the southern country on a mission. Bishop Partridge asked me a great many questions, and I asked him questions. It was then dangerous for any of our brethren to go through Jackson County [Missouri.] He wanted me to go to Arkansas, and the road led square through Jackson County. I asked him if we should go through there (I had a companion with me—an elder).</p>

I merely wish to say that I went out as a priest, and my companion as an elder, and we traveled thousands of miles, and had many things manifested to us. I desire to impress upon you the fact that it does not make any difference whether a man is a priest or an apostle, if he magnifies his calling. A priest holds the key of the ministering of angels. Never in my life, as an apostle, as a seventy, or as an elder, have I ever had more of the protection of the Lord than while holding the office as a priest. The Lord revealed to me by visions, by revelations, and by the Holy Spirit, many things that lay before me.” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</span> pp. 298–300.)</p>

We will close this meeting with our love and appreciation to all men and boys and their wives and mothers in all the lands of this world. We ask them to be devout and faithful and true to all of the testimonies they have. I bear this testimony to you that this work is divine. We have a special work to do and we must do it, and I pray this all in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Some decisions have been made and others pending, which will clear the way, organizationally. But the basic decisions needed for us to move forward, as a people, must be made by the individual members of the Church. The major strides which must be made by the Church will follow upon the major strides to be made by us as individuals.</p>

Let us resume our journey forward and upward. Let us quietly put an end to our reluctance to reach out to others—whether in our own families, wards, or neighborhoods. We have been diverted, at times, from fundamentals on which we must now focus in order to move forward as a person or as a people.</p>

Think, brothers and sisters, what would happen if each active family were to bring another family or individual into the Church before next April conference: We would be joined by several hundred thousand new members of the Church. Imagine, if only one additional mature couple were to be called on a full-time mission from each ward—our missionary force would go from 27,500 to over 40,000! Contemplate the results if each family were to assist—between now and next April conference—an inactive family or individual into full activity. How we would revel in the association of those tens of thousands!</p>

Father served from 1898 to 1924 as president of the St. Joseph Stake of Zion for twenty-six and a half years. This stake was named in honor of the martyred prophet. Though we as a family lived modestly, Father seemed to find a way not only to teach bishops how to care for the very poor, but on many occasions found it in his heart to help many a downtrodden soul himself. I believe that father so ministered to his people that he fulfilled a blessing given him by President Joseph F. Smith, who promised that the people of the Gila Valley would “seek unto him as children to a parent.” Although I am sure I did not then fully appreciate his example, the standard he set was one worthy of any stake president.</p>

He didn’t just tell others to be self-reliant; we were taught to exemplify it as a family. We raised almost all of our own food. He always wanted a garden—he wanted a garden to eat from and a garden to smell. I used to pump the water by hand to water the garden, and also I learned to milk the cows, prune the fruit trees, mend the fences, and all the rest. I had two older brothers, who, I was convinced, took all the easy jobs and left me all the hard ones. But I don’t complain; it made me strong.</p>

I served as the first president of the Mt. Graham Stake, formed in 1938 from parts of the St. Joseph Stake. Like all of you presidents, I have experienced the sadness as well as the joy of laboring with those in difficulty.</p>

It rained continually the weekend of stake conference. The day after stake conference the Gila River overflowed its channel and swept through Duncan, Arizona, and environs. After consulting with my first counselor, Vernon McGrath, regarding the Saints’ immediate needs, I loaded my car with goods from the interstake welfare storehouse in Safford and drove the forty miles to Duncan. Arranging matters as best we could there, I walked the eight miles to Virden because bridges were unsafe for cars. I was filled with grief as I viewed the devastation of the houses and the farmland. Yet, in the ensuing weeks, I shared in perhaps the most fulfilling experience of my tenure as stake president. Through the high council and ward bishoprics, we organized for reconstruction. From welfare supplies and local labor we reestablished the people on the land. The contributions of the Saints throughout the area were wonderful, and, as I recall, we did not have to call on the General Welfare Committee for help. We handled it all locally ourselves.</p>

The Great Depression had not fully run its course when I was installed. Although we did not then refer to it as personal and family preparedness, we taught the Saints of our stake to care for their own needs. In one way or another, we gave expression to the basic principles of work, self-reliance, love, service, consecration, and stewardship.</p>

        &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;The following four addresses were given at the women’s fireside held September 15 in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. Latter-day Saint women twelve and older met in 1,500 locations worldwide to listen to messages from President Spencer W. Kimball; Sister Barbara B. Smith, general president of the Relief Society; Sister Elaine Cannon, Young Women general president; and Sister Naomi Shumway, Primary general president. Since President Kimball was hospitalized at the time of the conference, his message was read by his wife, Camilla E. Kimball. Translations of addresses were recorded and sent in the appropriate languages to women of the Church who reside in non-English-speaking areas of the world. Tapes of the conference were sent to areas where direct-line broadcasts were not available.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p2" pid="JW-IwtOAa0qv7b-N-7U-rg" hash="JOJXIQ"&gt;My beloved sisters: I have been looking forward for months to the pleasure of meeting with you dear sisters once again in a worldwide conference of the women of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Unfortunately for me, I am in the hospital here in Salt Lake City and will not be present with you in person, but I will be with you in spirit. In fact, I will be watching and listening here in my room at the LDS Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p3" pid="pNa-kvcSCkCbxEWfwFG3Rg" hash="Sqphog"&gt;The counsel given at our meeting last year is still appropriate. Whenever I reflect and ponder upon the glorious truths of the gospel, and that is often, I wonder if we even begin to appreciate the implications of these glorious truths. Let us begin with a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p4" pid="dCTTRQCPOEa-uh1Ry3Mi2g" hash="6QkXUg"&gt;The scriptures and the prophets have taught us clearly that God, who is perfect in his attribute of justice, “is no respecter of persons” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.34" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Acts 10:34&lt;/a&gt;). We know also that God is perfect in his love for each and all of us as his spirit children. When we know these truths, my sisters and associates in this divine cause, it should help us greatly as we all experience much less than perfect love and perfect justice in the world. If, in the short term, we are sometimes dealt with insensitively and thoughtlessly by others, by imperfect men and women, it may still cause us pain, but such pain and disappointment are not the whole of life. The ways of the world will not prevail, for the ways of God will triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p5" pid="Idm92aFEp0yGaV3fKWXxKg" hash="t2d-IA"&gt;We had full equality as his spirit children. We have equality as recipients of God’s perfected love for each of us. The late Elder John A. Widtsoe wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p6" pid="b2lbQDLa7UyYAp2RB1I54w" hash="ccNlOw"&gt;“The place of woman in the Church is to walk beside the man, not in front of him nor behind him. In the Church there is full equality between man and woman. The gospel, which is the only concern of the Church, was devised by the Lord for men and women alike” (&lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;Improvement Era, &lt;/span&gt;Mar. 1942, p. 161).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p7" pid="c-lbb333DU2NgHFE2arTXA" hash="OFab1w"&gt;Within those great assurances, however, our roles and assignments differ. These are eternal differences—with women being given many tremendous responsibilities of motherhood and sisterhood and men being given the tremendous responsibilities of fatherhood and the priesthood—but the man is not without the woman nor the woman without the man in the Lord (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.11" class="scriptureRef"&gt;1 Cor. 11:11&lt;/a&gt;). Both a righteous man and a righteous woman are a blessing to all those their lives touch.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p8" pid="Fp8Jkv1uHkGxc9GNVbRcSQ" hash="ZA8ngg"&gt;Remember, in the world before we came here, faithful women were given certain assignments while faithful men were foreordained to certain priesthood tasks. While we do not now remember the particulars, this does not alter the glorious reality of what we once agreed to. You are accountable for those things which long ago were expected of you just as are those we sustain as prophets and apostles!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p9" pid="T51WZTRaGUOuqP9abIQXew" hash="1Qp7AA"&gt;Even though the eternal roles of men and women differ, as we indicated to you a year ago, this leaves much to be done by way of parallel personal development—for both men and women. In this connection, I stress again the deep need each woman has to study the scriptures. We want our homes to be blessed with sister scriptorians—whether you are single or married, young or old, widowed or living in a family.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p10" pid="SLIjmerKgk-dUE1JvKgfzA" hash="ZZS1xQ"&gt;Regardless of your particular circumstances, as you become more and more familiar with the truths of the scriptures, you will be more and more effective in keeping the second great commandment, to love your neighbor as yourself. Become scholars of the scriptures—not to put others down, but to lift them up! After all, who has any greater need to “treasure up” the truths of the gospel (on which they may call in their moments of need) than do women and mothers who do so much nurturing and teaching?&lt;/p&gt;

No greater recognition can come to you in this world than to be known as a woman of God. No greater status can be conferred upon you than being a daughter of God who experiences true sisterhood, wifehood, and motherhood, or other tasks which influence lives for good.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p13" pid="0glToOlFLUOgc4QBR1pMCw" hash="EkeTlA"&gt;True, there are some temporary differences and some constraining circumstances. Some of you have lost your husbands through death, others through divorce. Some of you have not yet had the great privilege of marriage. But, on the scale of eternity, the missing of these blessings “shall be but a small moment” (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.7" class="scriptureRef"&gt;D&amp;amp;C 121:7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p14" pid="ecStru1-S06Nwr23m-udDA" hash="_mNzUg"&gt;Others of the sisters are experiencing the anguish that often goes with aging. Still others of you now know the uncertainty of being young as you ponder your place in the eternal scheme of things. But real as these challenges are, all of you need to drink in deeply the gospel truths about the eternal nature of your individual identity and the uniqueness of your personality. You need, more and more, to feel the perfect love which our Father in Heaven has for you and to sense the value he places upon you as an individual. Ponder upon these great truths, especially in those moments when (in the stillness of such anxiety as you may experience as an individual) you might otherwise wonder and be perplexed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p15" pid="ACR7wZsYyUSyGqNkk8iIlw" hash="caSI_A"&gt;Remember, too, as we focus on the glories and importance of family life here, that all of us belong to the eternal family of our Father in Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p16" pid="ZgTrTwZh3kuEgmSUQoMO3A" hash="c24I1w"&gt;Be assured, too, that all faithful sisters, who, through no fault of their own, do not have the privilege during their second estate of being sealed to a worthy man, will have that blessing in eternity. On occasions when you ache for that acceptance and affection which belong to family life on earth, please know that our Father in Heaven is aware of your anguish, and that one day he will bless you beyond your capacity to express.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p17" pid="zifZRXf2x0-q_K3WpCh6xg" hash="DxcBYw"&gt;Sometimes to be tested and proved requires that we be temporarily deprived—but righteous women and men will one day receive &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;—think of it, sisters—&lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;all &lt;/span&gt;that our Father has! It is not only worth waiting for; it is worth living for!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p19" pid="cNqksjV4rU-AzmtVkGnbiQ" hash="PvqDoQ"&gt;Some women, because of circumstances beyond their control, must work. We understand that. We understand further that as families are raised, the talents God has given you and blessed you with can often be put to effective use in additional service to mankind. Do not, however, make the mistake of being drawn off into secondary tasks which will cause the neglect of your eternal assignments such as giving birth to and rearing the spirit children of our Father in Heaven. Pray carefully over all your decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p20" pid="UGNzROYepUiNACo0_VWw5w" hash="C8Zt6A"&gt;We wish you to pursue and to achieve that education, therefore, which will fit you for eternity &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;as well as &lt;/span&gt;for full service in mortality. In addition to those basic and vital skills which go with homemaking, there are other skills which can be appropriately cultivated and which will increase your effectiveness in the home, in the Church, and in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p21" pid="0GfVYkB5IEGXcKT1IsINTQ" hash="2sIejw"&gt;Again, you must be wise in the choices that you make, but we do not desire the women of the Church to be uninformed or ineffective. You will be better mothers and wives, both in this life and in eternity, if you sharpen the skills you have been given and use the talents with which God has blessed you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p22" pid="23MMAc9p8UCe0GwUGHIBiw" hash="06LArA"&gt;There is no greater and more glorious set of promises given to women than those which come through the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ. Where else can you learn who you really are? Where else can you be given the necessary explanations and assurances about the nature of life? From what other source can you learn about your own uniqueness and identity? From whom else could you learn of our Father in Heaven’s glorious plan of happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p23" pid="fWWKnBzxikWx5rfgkvfe-A" hash="XZx9Gw"&gt;The gospel answers are the only true answers to the questions which women and men, over the centuries, have raised about themselves, about life, and about the universe. How good God has been to us all in blessing us with these answers and assurances—even though these truths place upon us serious and everlasting obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p24" pid="nHLJ5Uj5N0yFl2pLaa5kGQ" hash="9IyV-Q"&gt;How special it is for Latter-day Saint women to be given the lofty assignments they have been given by our Father in Heaven, especially those of you who have been privileged to be born in this part of this last dispensation. Let other women pursue heedlessly what they perceive as their selfish interests. You can be a much needed force for love and truth and righteousness on this planet. Let others selfishly pursue false values, but God has given to you the tremendous tasks of &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;nurturing &lt;/span&gt;families, friends, and neighbors, just as men are to &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;provide.&lt;/span&gt; But &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;both &lt;/span&gt;husband and wife are to be parents!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p25" pid="oZp3ckLwuUyN0k6z3OJYvw" hash="mutvHA"&gt;Finally, my dear sisters, may I suggest to you something that has not been said before or at least in quite this way. Much of the major growth that is coming to the Church in the last days will come because many of the good women of the world (in whom there is often such an inner sense of spirituality) will be drawn to the Church in large numbers. This will happen to the degree that the women of the Church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives and to the degree that the women of the Church are seen as distinct and different—in happy ways—from the women of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p26" pid="qpe0zcVt1UiITlMvUkkGDQ" hash="-QkWDg"&gt;Among the real heroines in the world who will come into the Church are women who are more concerned with being righteous than with being selfish. These real heroines have true humility, which places a higher value on integrity than on visibility. Remember, it is as wrong to do things just to be seen of women as it is to do things to be seen of men. Great women and men are always more anxious to serve than to have dominion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p27" pid="eeY1xBFyFUemxayML_wZzQ" hash="RXHUIQ"&gt;Thus it will be that female exemplars of the Church will be a significant force in both the numerical and the spiritual growth of the Church in the last days.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-righteous-women.p28" pid="tJ8U7grS9Uq2yuHihsD0_A" hash="kVBsLQ"&gt;No wonder the adversary strives, even now, to prevent this from happening! Regardless of who is getting the adversary’s special attention at any given time, he seeks to make all people “miserable like unto himself” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef"&gt;2 Ne. 2:27&lt;/a&gt;). Indeed, he seeks “the misery of all mankind” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.18" class="scriptureRef"&gt;2 Ne. 2:18&lt;/a&gt;). He is undeviating in his purposes and is clever and relentless in his pursuit of them.&lt;/p&gt;

Let us observe it strictly in our homes and in our families. Let us refrain from all unnecessary labors. Sunday is not a day for hunting or fishing, nor for swimming, picnicking, boating, or engaging in any other sports. The stores in areas where we are more numerous would not long remain open on Sunday if the Saints refrained from shopping on that day. Remember, the Lord has said:</p>

Prayer is such a privilege—to speak to our Father in Heaven. It was a prayer, a very special prayer, which opened this whole dispensation! It began with a young man’s first vocal prayer. I hope that not too many of our prayers are silent, even though when we cannot pray vocally, it is good to offer a silent prayer in our hearts and in our minds.</p>

The echoing of “amen” by the listeners is evidence of their accord and approval. Of course, the setting of prayers needs to be taken into account. This is one reason why public prayers, or even family prayers, cannot be the whole of our praying.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-need-a-listening-ear.p15" pid="V5nyIuGa8UaxVVqus4riIQ" hash="qtyh_g">Some things are best prayed over only in private, where time and confidentiality are not considerations. If in these special moments of prayer we hold back from the Lord, it may mean that some blessings may be withheld from us. After all, we pray as petitioners before an all-wise Heavenly Father, so why should we ever think to hold back feelings or thoughts which bear upon our needs and our blessings? We hope that our people will have very bounteous prayers.</p>

I renew that admonition. We may think there is little of interest or importance in what we personally say or do—but it is remarkable how many of our families, as we pass on down the line, are interested in all that we do and all that we say. Each of us is important to those who are near and dear to us—and as our posterity read of our life’s experiences, they, too, will come to know and love us.

They want a prophet that will tell them that what they are doing is right, no matter how wrong it may be.” A prophet has spoken—the prophet is speaking. We do not need another prophet.

I say serve and lead because the headship of the man in the home is to be like the headship of Christ in the Church. Christ led by love, example, and selfless service. He sacrificed himself for us. So it must be if we are leader-servants and humble patriarchs in our homes.</p>

Do not regard their presence in your midst as a burden but as a blessing.</p>

Perhaps when this happens, it is a result of insensitivity and thoughtlessness, but it should not be, brethren. The women of this Church have work to do which, though different, is equally as important as the work that we do. Their work is, in fact, the same basic work that we are asked to do—even though our roles and assignments differ.</p>

I mention all these things, my brethren, not because the doctrines or the teachings of the Church regarding women are in any doubt, but because in some situations our behavior is of doubtful quality. These things are not mentioned because of any sense of alarm, but because of a general concern that our people in the kingdom will need to become even more different from the people of the world. We will be judged, as the Savior said on several occasions, by whether or not we love one another and treat one another accordingly and by whether or not we are of one heart and one mind. We cannot be the Lord’s if we are not one!</p>

President McKay wisely observed, “No other success can compensate for failure in the home” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1964, p. 5).</p>

Is there anyone who doesn’t know the great missionary he has been? When I was a member of the stake presidency in Arizona, Brother Richards came to our stake; and after all the thousands of good things he had to give us, I remember so very well that he and I both went down to Miami, Arizona, to conclude our conferences, and we sat there and talked about the gospel most of the evening. I don’t know whether he will remember that or not, but it was very impressive to me. The First Presidency recently went with some of the General Authorities down to an area conference in New Mexico and we got caught with a plane breakdown. They had to send back to Denver to get some parts. While the rest of us were sitting around waiting, Brother Richards started talking to the pilot and the stewardess, and he taught them the gospel. That’s the kind of missionary he is.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/give-me-this-mountain.p2" pid="jd3811Y2TUC_xwjvTilyKA" hash="pkzG8A">I think he mentioned 28,000 missionaries, and I think we now have 29,000 plus. Anyway, we are very, very grateful to Brother Richards and all the other Brethren who have been as faithful as he explained to us in his sermon.</p>

It has been good for all of us to be here. I’ve been grateful for the remarks of the Brethren who have spoken. The Lord has answered their prayers for divine help in the preparation and delivery of their sermons.</p>

We are grateful for your devotion and ask the Lord to bless you with a capacity to be touched in your hearts by the messages you have heard, long after we have sung the songs and long after we have said our last amen. We realize so much depends on what you as leaders do as you return to your homes to work again with those in your stakes and wards and individual homes.</p>

In that story there is an account of one special man that moves and motivates and inspires me. His name was Caleb.</p>

Caleb and Joshua were among the group. After spending forty days on their mission, the twelve men returned. They brought back figs and pomegranates and a cluster of grapes so large it took two men to carry it between them on a pole.</p>

Although they found a land that was beautiful and desirable and flowing with milk and honey, they also found that the cities were walled and formidable and that the people, the “sons of Anak,” looked like giants. The Israelite scouts said that they felt like grasshoppers in comparison. Caleb, however, saw things a little differently, with what the Lord called “another spirit,” and his account of the journey and their challenges was quite different. He said, “Let us go up at once, and possess [their land]; for we are well able to overcome it” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/num/13.30" class="scriptureRef">Num. 13:30</a>).</p>

But this conference is even more special because we celebrate the Sesquicentennial of the organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The history of the Church is essentially the history of its individual members. One of the best ways to celebrate righteous history is to make <span class="emphasis">more</span> of it, make more righteous history! In this connection, you will recall that a year ago you were called upon to stretch yourselves in further service. Included in the counsel given then was the suggestion that each active member or family bring an individual or a family into the Church by the time the April 1980 conference arrived. That conference is now here. Did we do it? Or are some of us still being “neighbors as usual,” not yet fully sharing the gospel with our friends and neighbors?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/no-unhallowed-hand-can-stop-the-work.p3" pid="yytsEarrjEKmgP1lFH1h8Q" hash="qzRAVA">As we speak of sharing the gospel, let me say that the First Presidency has just been advised by the Church Missionary Committee that as of last week we had 30,004 full-time missionaries. That is the largest number of missionaries ever in the history of the Church. What a glorious work they are performing and what blessings they bring into the lives of our Father’s other children throughout the world who hearken to their message of joy and peace and salvation.</p>

Presently they represent 79 percent of our total missionary force. We have not yet reached our potential. The young sisters serving represent 13 percent of the total. Eight percent of the total missionary force is represented by older couples. What a blessing their maturity and experience are wherever they serve. With the divine commission we have to share the gospel with the entire world, we do indeed need many more missionaries. Remember that “the field is white already to harvest” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:4</a>).</p>

We said at that time: “We see ourselves as positioning our people so that the Latter-day Saints can give greater attention to family life, can focus more on certain simple and basic things, can render more Christian service, and can have greater effectiveness in all these things—through the process of simplification, scheduling, proper priorities, and by honoring the priesthood line” (Regional Representatives’ seminar, 5 Oct. 1979; see also <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1979, p. 100).</p>

Please do not neglect these wonderful brothers and sisters.</p>

Kimball, <span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>May 1979, p. 83). That is surely true and, in like manner, we will be spiritually successful to the degree that we are good neighbors and good friends to those in the household of faith and to our nonmember friends.</p>

We want to keep faith with that small but noble band of souls who assembled in the Peter Whitmer home 150 years ago for the purpose of formally organizing the Church. We <span class="emphasis">can</span> keep faith, in part, by helping the Church to grow in numbers and also in spirituality. We can count our growing membership.

We came here last night by jet airplane from Salt Lake City. We made the trip in a matter of a half-dozen hours, flying eastward over the broad expanse of this beautiful land where long ago our forebears painfully traveled westward in search of a place where they could be free of persecution and could worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/introduction-to-the-proclamation.p2" pid="qLQs4naamkecec-_h8bemw" hash="urMTnA">We are here, this lovely Easter morning, in the reconstructed farmhouse of Peter Whitmer, Sr. It has been faithfully restored for this occasion to bring to us anew the recollection of the all-important and significant event which occurred here a century and a half ago. In the years to come, it will be visited by good people from over the earth who will wish to stand where I stand today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/introduction-to-the-proclamation.p3" pid="iskRBw1j3EWULaOSueV-XA" hash="l0npzg">In this very location on April 6, 1830, there assembled a small group to formally organize The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They were believers in the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith that in a grove of trees not many miles from here, on a spring day in the year 1820, he beheld in vision God the Eternal Father and his Son, the resurrected Lord, Jesus Christ. There followed in the intervening years visitations of other resurrected heavenly beings. From the soil of Cumorah’s Hill, a few miles to the west of here, Joseph obtained from the angel Moroni the records of a people who anciently inhabited this land; and, through the gift and power of God, he translated that record, now known as the Book of Mormon. A substantial part of that work of translation was accomplished in this Whitmer home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/introduction-to-the-proclamation.p4" pid="c2gIT4OdGk-eE-gOvv5hrA" hash="o5WzIQ">On that historic Tuesday of April 6, 1830, one and a half centuries ago, six men from those assembled in this house organized the Church as a religious society. Three of the descendants of those men are here with us today—Sister Lorena Horner Normandeau, a great-granddaughter of Joseph Smith; Eldred G. Smith, a second great-grandson of Hyrum Smith; and Melvin Thomas Smith, a great-grandson of Samuel Harrison Smith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/introduction-to-the-proclamation.p5" pid="cyrMsljpC0aIvMXokOJobA" hash="1JKI0Q">Standing here today we review in our minds the mighty faith and works of those who, from this humble beginning, gave so much to help move the Church to its present wondrous stature; and more importantly, we behold through the eye of faith a vision of its sure and glorious future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/introduction-to-the-proclamation.p6" pid="wRO_RFPyI0CCnCBQvgiGnA" hash="ATiQTQ">Now, my brothers and sisters, with the future before us, and sensing deeply the responsibilities and divine mission of the restored Church on this sacred occasion, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles declare to the world a proclamation. We have felt it appropriate to issue this statement from here, where the Church began. Accordingly, I shall ask Elder Gordon B. Hinckley of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, to speak in my behalf and in behalf of my brethren, to read this proclamation to you and to the world.</p>

It was a thrilling experience to speak to you a few minutes ago from the Peter Whitmer farm home where the Church was organized. It is now an inspiring experience to be in this lovely chapel in Fayette, Seneca County, New York, because it represents something of the marvelous progress made by the Church during the 150 years of its history.</p>

Today is Easter Sunday.</p>

Eldon Tanner and others to the Holy Land for the dedication of the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. During the few days we were there, we retraced the footsteps of Jesus.</p>

We visited the Mount of Transfiguration and Jacob’s Well, the Garden of Gethsemane and Golgotha. We sat and meditated in the empty tomb. And then we walked out of the tomb into the sunlit garden where early in the morning the angels spoke to the two Marys and said, “Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:5–6</a>).</p>

He is risen! He lived. He died. He was resurrected—the Son of God, who opened the door of immortality to all men and the blessings of eternal life to those who live his commandments. Of his reality and divinity, I add my solemn testimony this beautiful Easter Sabbath.</p>

Hinckley, we have reviewed briefly the events of the coming forth of the Church as a restoration of the original church established by the Savior himself when he was upon the earth. We have borne witness to the world of the miraculous and wonderful events which preceded that restoration, and also we have spoken of the remarkable progress of the work in the years that have followed. For 85 of those 150 years, I have been a living witness of this progress.</p>

I testify that the Book of Mormon is a translation of an ancient record of nations who once lived in this western hemisphere, where they prospered and became mighty when they kept the commandments of God, but who were largely destroyed through terrible civil wars when they forgot God. This book bears testimony of the living reality of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer of mankind.</p>

Of these things I bear solemn witness to all within the sound of my voice. I promise in the name of the Lord that all who give heed to our message, and accept and live the gospel, will grow in faith and understanding. They will have an added measure of peace in their lives and in their homes and by the power of the Holy Ghost will speak similar words of testimony and truth. I do this and leave my blessing upon you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

On this anniversary day, we are met where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized under revelation from thee 150 years ago. Our hearts are filled with gratitude for thy marvelous blessings, so generously bestowed. As we review the past, we are subdued in contemplating the works of those who have gone before us, and particularly the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum who, with their life’s blood, sealed their testimonies of the sacred things which occurred in this area.</p>

We know that with thy direction thy work will roll on for the blessing of thy children of all generations and throughout the earth; and that where there are now hundreds there will be thousands; and that, whereas thy work is established today in many nations, it must and will roll forth over the whole earth until men everywhere shall bow the knee and give homage to thee and thy Son.</p>

May thy Holy Spirit abide here. May thy protecting power be made manifest in the preservation of these important scenes of history. May knowledge of thee increase and testimony of thy divine Son strengthen in the hearts of the many who will come with interest and depart with added faith and knowledge.</p>

We have been refreshed because of those reminders. But even as we speak of beginnings, events in the world remind us that we are moving ever closer to the ending of this dispensation. So, for me, this conference has been filled with memories and also with anticipation—feelings which have combined to make me more grateful than ever for the privilege of being a part of this great latter-day work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/let-us-not-weary-in-well-doing.p3" pid="YNo7pFuyfUim3LzqBal9Xg" hash="2-dLfA">Viewed in perspective, 150 years isn’t really a very long time, even in human history. It is but a brief moment in eternity. You and I know that, actually, individuals and institutions are measured by deeds, not days; by service, not centuries. Just as an individual’s life can often make up in quality what it lacks in length of years, so The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has compressed into 150 years many significant accomplishments. We don’t have to be old to be great.</p>

I sense that same steadfastness in the Church today. Our members know their Lord. They know his leaders. They know their Master’s voice and follow it. They do not follow strange voices nor the spurious enticements of strangers.</p>

We must ever be conscious of that trust and ever be on the alert. There is a tide to be taken now in the affairs of the Church in all the earth which will lift us up and carry us forward as never before. Let us then not weary in well doing.</p>

May we, as Paul said, be “wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/16.19" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 16:19</a>). Learn to recognize evil, and shun it always. May we keep Church programs and organizations simple. If we do, we will build to a thrilling and rewarding momentum in the days and months and years ahead. The Savior urged his followers to be “wise as serpents, and harmless as doves” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/10.16" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 10:16</a>). Let us follow that counsel today. Let us so live that if people speak critically of us they must do so falsely and without justification.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/let-us-not-weary-in-well-doing.p8" pid="Py3W5oxJjUiQi06fvpjJ_Q" hash="cCtNpQ">Let us hold fast to the iron rod. The Savior urged us to put our hand to the plow without looking back. In that spirit we are being asked to have humility and a deep and abiding faith in the Lord and to move forward—trusting in him, refusing to be diverted from our course, either by the <span class="emphasis">ways</span> of the world or the <span class="emphasis">praise</span> of the world. I see that quality of readiness and devotion in our people today. There is so much yet to be done! let us, then, move forward; let us continue the journey with lengthened stride. The Lord will lead us along, and he will be in our midst and not forsake us.</p>

He is the risen Lord, the Great Presiding High Priest, and he stands at the head of the Church. Of this I testify this beautiful Easter Sunday, on this great anniversary of the restoration and organization of the Church on this very spot 150 years ago. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Surely there never has been a time when we needed to be more anxiously engaged in such an important cause.</p>

Latter-day Saint women eighteen and older met in nine nations and 2,051 locations worldwide to hear messages from President Spencer W. Kimball; Sister Barbara B. Smith, general president of the Relief Society; Sisters Mary F. Foulger and Addie Fuhriman, both members of the Relief Society General Board; Sister Shirley W. Thomas, second counselor in the general presidency; Sister Marian R. Boyer, first counselor in the general presidency; and Elder Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Theme for the meeting was “Learn—Then Teach,” speaking to every woman’s responsibility to increase her own learning and to bless those within her circle of influence.</p>

With all our hearts, we love and appreciate you! We respect you, we honor you, and we need you. “Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 11:11</a>). We rejoice in your righteousness and the influence for good you have as individuals, wives, mothers, and grandmothers. We appreciate the faithful and devoted single sisters who do not yet enjoy a fulness of family life. The Lord loves you, for you are some of the most noble spirits of our Father in Heaven. If you continue faithful and true, no eternal blessing will one day be denied you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/learn-then-teach.p3" pid="RQLU46WOzEShZEv2V6iwVw" hash="8XfEQg">I am pleased with the theme that has been selected for this meeting, “Learn—Then Teach.” All my married life I have been blessed with my sweet companion, Camilla, who has had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. She is always reading and seeking. She believes literally in the Lord’s counsel through the Prophet Joseph Smith: “Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:18</a>). Not only has she been continually learning during our sixty-three years of marriage, but she has been sharing as well, by example and by teaching. For more than half a century she has been a Relief Society visiting teacher, and has taught the Spiritual Living lessons in Relief Society for much of that time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/learn-then-teach.p4" pid="LCHrXeRUHU6TJzyjSPxCPA" hash="gwiiUg">My dear sisters, stay close to the Church, all of you. Follow its prophets, so that you do not lose your way and so that you can help to guide back any of those who may have lost their way. Love and care for your families and be sure to hold your family home evenings regularly, every week. Home is a place of peace and love and caring. Be good neighbors as well, so that even if the love of many in the world waxes cold, your families and your neighbors are not deprived of your ministry and compassionate service. Continue to be good wives and mothers, daughters and sisters, so that even if love and peace diminish in the world, there is still peace and love in your homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/learn-then-teach.p5" pid="4XhWKwAGrkG7D24tAcIPlA" hash="Q7uunA">There are so many kinds of voices. Let me reiterate what I said to you sisters at the women’s meeting two years ago. Let other women pursue blindly what they selfishly perceive as their interests. But you, my dear sisters, can be a much-needed force for love and truth and righteous example on this earth. “Come, listen to a prophet’s voice, and hear the word of God” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 46).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/learn-then-teach.p6" pid="ETPrUuBSvEav_IeAr7H6Ag" hash="qPHqRA">The Lord is at the helm! He will steer us through. This is his work, of which the Relief Society is such an important part. My dear sisters, be loyal to the great Relief Society organization. By the inspiration of the Lord it was organized 138 years ago by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Support it and strengthen it for the good of yourselves, your families, and the Church. Furthermore, just as we must keep all the commandments, let us draw upon and make full use of all the other basic Church programs so that we are strong and balanced in our lives! If you keep the faith, the Lord will not forsake you and your loved ones.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/learn-then-teach.p7" pid="fpYDij0THkOxv6tZoE4vQQ" hash="buOlyw">My beloved sisters, I know that God lives, that Jesus is his Only Begotten Son, the Redeemer of the world, and that this is in very deed the church of Jesus Christ, with him at its head. I leave this testimony with you and my love and blessings upon you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p2" pid="zVePOfH_8E6Rp-VD3vLwVg" hash="QwrsMg">From the beginning, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has emphasized family life. We have always understood that the foundations of the family, as an eternal unit, were laid even before this earth was created! Society without basic family life is without foundation and will disintegrate into nothingness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p3" pid="YWKwRK7f5Ua6s8I7068Mpw" hash="G8_jFg">Therefore, whenever anything so basic as the eternal family is imperiled, we have a solemn obligation to speak out, lest there be critical damage to the family institution by those who seem to be deliberately destructive of it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p4" pid="9H7x5SGLQ0eBcIBr06v0RA" hash="hc51SQ">The commandments and standards of morality set by the Lord himself are under attack on every hand. There are false teachers everywhere using speech and pornographic literature, magazines, radio, TV, street talk—spreading heresies which break down moral standards.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p5" pid="bz5teknCdkWMo7YXxGsaVg" hash="oM2swA">Because of the seriousness of this matter, I have prepared an article for the November 1980 <span class="emphasis">Ensign</span> and <span class="emphasis">New Era</span> magazines in which I speak out frankly and at length on the subject of morality. This is a grave responsibility, and not an easy one. I encourage all Latter-day Saints to read this special message.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p6" pid="kLByHAt5TEC6vhdGW7QhQA" hash="n1t7TA">We are living in perilous times as more and more individuals dishonor the marriage vow and as juvenile delinquency mounts. Divorces in the United States are up over 65 percent since 1970. The number of unmarried couples living together has gone up over 157 percent during the past decade. Many more children are growing up without having both parents in the home. In 1979, almost one of every five families with children was being maintained by one parent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p7" pid="HxRBdl2VvEOTTMjMlC30zw" hash="Fv3_NQ">Abortion has reached plague proportions. There have been, for instance, “more deaths from abortion in England in the decade since the English Abortion Act than there were deaths in the First World War.” Of this, Malcolm Muggeridge said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p8" pid="QttxD26ELkalzbflc-gw_g" hash="zXoQww">“I was brought up to believe that one of the great troubles of our Western world was that in the First World War we lost the flower of our population. Well, now we have destroyed an equivalent number of lives in the name of humane principles, before they were even born.” (<span class="emphasis">Human Life Review,</span> Summer 1980, p. 74.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p9" pid="gmTqHwXbC029CFYUCD1n4w" hash="L2_4Aw">Furthermore, many of the social restraints which in the past have helped to reinforce and to shore up the family are dissolving and disappearing. The time will come when only those who believe deeply and actively in the family will be able to preserve their families in the midst of the gathering evil around us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p10" pid="qbVXGqVirkesBlCM0zDY8A" hash="95D5yw">Whether from inadvertence, ignorance, or other causes, the efforts governments often make (ostensibly to help the family) sometimes only hurt the family more. There are those who would define the family in such a nontraditional way that they would define it out of existence. The more governments try in vain to take the place of the family, the less effective governments will be in performing the traditional and basic roles for which governments are formed in the first place.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p11" pid="jGFwcNH2Y0eFrM0IqIN4UA" hash="MU1i_w">Whether we like it or not, so many of the difficulties which beset the family today stem from the breaking of the seventh commandment (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.14" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:14</a>). Total chastity before marriage and total fidelity after are still the standard from which there can be no deviation without sin, misery, and unhappiness. The breaking of the seventh commandment usually means the breaking of one or more homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p12" pid="L7adw3o7okWqpRtmmQ0vyA" hash="zkYocQ">Delinquent adults still tend to produce delinquent children, and that awful reality will not change simply by our lowering standards as to what constitutes delinquency—either in adults, youth, or children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p13" pid="uF_vgRIH_EitidHegl84VQ" hash="AXoiKg">We of all people, brothers and sisters, should not be taken in by the specious arguments that the family unit is somehow tied to a particular phase of development a mortal society is going through. We are free to resist those moves which downplay the significance of the family and which play up the significance of selfish individualism. We know the family to be eternal. We know that when things go wrong in the family, things go wrong in every other institution in society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p14" pid="oAWd1XuWhEOzq-M-76dAUQ" hash="ZAV6hg">Those who, whether in ignorance or malice, attack the family are setting in motion an awful and needless cycle of misery and despair, for they will search in vain and pain for substitutes, and the wisdom of the worldly wise shall perish publicly for their folly concerning the family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p15" pid="gAmYu2rXPUKhbJQ3A8RfsQ" hash="nW7DXw">The decline in many of our families is occurring at a time when the nations of the world are moving into some of the most difficult times known.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p17" pid="p17gHETP8k68b1jaBbrQJA" hash="wsJX0g">Our political institutions—parliaments, congresses, and assemblies—cannot rescue us if our basic institution, the family, is not intact. Peace treaties cannot save us when there is hostility instead of love in the home. Unemployment programs cannot rescue us when many are no longer taught how to work or do not have the opportunity to work or the inclination, in some cases, to do so. Law enforcement cannot safeguard us if too many people are unwilling to discipline themselves or be disciplined.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p18" pid="okNBo7LvlUS-3867gsKHCg" hash="YWwqcQ">Rising generations who have been taught that authority and loving discipline are wrong will not keep the fifth commandment, honoring their fathers and mothers (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.12" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:12</a>). How can the rising generations honor their parents if their parents have dishonored themselves—especially by breaking the seventh commandment?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p19" pid="4OpCKqauPE2WDVdN7WE8KA" hash="UnbuGg">Almost every array of statistics one sees with regard to the family becomes a sad sermon in statistics, reminding us of the need to stem and to turn the tide.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p20" pid="2jzXSZtEV0WUid_O5NjAcA" hash="vQHvtA">Let us be sure, in our Latter-day Saint homes, that we do our part to stem and to turn the tide.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p21" pid="UlGKADnAgUyKtztqC_7qOw" hash="rkSV6w">Again, I urge you to be diligent in recording your personal and family histories. We are pleased with the success of the recent World Conference on Records, where more than eleven thousand people from over thirty nations around the globe gathered to share and learn concerning personal record keeping. In this, let us be an example to others and reap the benefits of stronger family units as we preserve our heritage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p22" pid="FybyLgbTuUGJh7M4IhnShQ" hash="rDK0Ww">We hope our parents are using the added time that has come from the consolidated schedule in order to be with, teach, love, and nurture their children. We hope you have not forgotten the need for family activity and recreation, for which time is also provided. Let your love of each member of your family be unconditional. Where there are challenges, you fail only if you fail to keep trying!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p23" pid="jRSI81DdfEusfSahpGLEMQ" hash="AeMNnQ">We genuinely welcome help, real help, from churches, schools, colleges, and universities, from thoughtful men and women of every race, creed, and culture who care about the family. But, as indicated earlier, if the supporting network of institutions does not function adequately, then we will do our part anyway. There is no lack of clarity in what the Lord has told us. We cannot shirk. He has placed the responsibility directly where it belongs, and he holds us accountable with regard to the duties of parents to teach their children correct principles and of the need to walk uprightly before the Lord—and there is no substitute for teaching our children by the eloquence of example.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p24" pid="0JKoayd2WEWPtbK0sA3skg" hash="8gS-dQ">Oh, brothers and sisters, <span class="emphasis">families can be forever!</span> Do not let the lures of the moment draw you away from them! <span class="emphasis">Divinity, eternity,</span> and <span class="emphasis">family</span>—they go together, hand in hand, and so must we!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/families-can-be-eternal.p25" pid="1H3YFy-GzEG1PxmBCe3cNQ" hash="q3UpLw">I bear you my solemn witness that God lives, that Jesus Christ lives, and that he is our Savior and Redeemer.

Just think of the mighty and sacred power that is represented by this assemblage of men and boys. I rejoice with you, my brethren, in the manifold blessings which are ours in holding the priesthood of God!</p>

To those of you who are citizens of the United States: I wish to urge you and your family members of voting age to go to the polls in large numbers next month on Tuesday, November 4, and vote for the strongest, finest people who are certain to do the most to safeguard the rights and freedoms of this nation. We do not endorse any candidates, but we hope you will vote for good men and women of character, integrity, and ability. You are to be the judge. Further, we hope our Church buildings and our Church organizations will not be used to advance the candidacy or policies of any of the candidates.</p>

It is about that principle of caring for and ministering to the needs of the Church membership in these troubled days that I desire to speak to you brethren tonight.</p>

You are the nurturing shepherds of our people. To the greatest extent possible, let your counselors and others who serve and work under your direction be the managers of programs. If you will pursue this emphasis, you will often be able to detect very early some of those members who have serious difficulties, while their challenges and problems are still small and manageable. Be conscious of the little tensions and problems you may see in families so that you can give the required attention, counsel, and love when it is most needed. An hour with a troubled boy or girl now may save him or her, and is infinitely better than the hundreds of hours spent in their later lives in the reclamation of a boy or girl if they become inactive.</p>

Home teachers are to help watch over the flock. Even though they don’t counsel as bishops and branch presidents do, home teachers can render much appropriate and preventive help under the direction of the quorum leaders and bishoprics.</p>

The Savior has told us to feed his sheep (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.15-17" class="scriptureRef">John 21:15–17</a>). I fear that all too often many of our members come to church, sit through a class or meeting, and they then return home having been largely uninformed. It is especially unfortunate when this happens at a time when they may be entering a period of stress, temptation, or crisis. We all need to be touched and nurtured by the Spirit, and effective teaching is one of the most important ways this can happen. We often do vigorous enlistment work to get members to come to church but then do not adequately watch over what they receive when they do come.</p>

When special attention of some kind is not provided for these good people, we lose them. In April of 1977, as I was speaking about the Lamanites, I said that we could “no longer merely teach and preach to them, but we must establish the Church among them” (Regional Representatives’ seminar, 1 April 1977). This statement applies to all cultures.</p>

Its guidebooks, manuals, and reports are much less complicated than those for the full Church program. They are wonderful and are now available in most languages. We have designed smaller, less expensive buildings to meet this need also. Couples can be trained in the basic unit program and can then assist in establishing the Church among all people in all lands. Where the program is being used as outlined, we are meeting with <span class="emphasis">great</span> success.</p>

Be mindful always of the members of your flock who are sad, lonely, bereaved, or bereft. There are always some among us who need our special care and attention. We must never forget or overlook them. “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.27" class="scriptureRef">James 1:27</a>).</p>

The new consolidated schedule permits you, if you plan well, to hold all the meetings in the consolidated schedule along with the necessary administrative meetings and <span class="emphasis">still have several hours with your family every Sunday.</span> Please see to it that this is done, so that you priesthood brethren do not neglect your own families and so that our wonderful stake presidents, bishops, branch and quorum presidents, and others can do likewise.</p>

The challenge has been put well by an ancient prophet who said, “Now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.10" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:10</a>). We must not let the inner resolves we have made during this conference be forgotten as we return to the trials and tribulations and responsibilities of a workaday world, a world of turmoil and strife.</p>

We will see the constant progress of the Lord’s work, even in the midst of problems in the world. It will roll forth until it fills the whole earth. He has given us his assurances so many, many times. He has told us that if we will keep his commandments he is bound to keep his promises to us. He does! He will!</p>

From this fulness, the Lord requires that we dedicate one-tenth to him. Tithing is a law of God and is required of his followers.

Ten days later the Lord gave the Prophet Joseph a further revelation, section 120 of the Doctrine and Covenants, making known the proper disposition of the tithes of the Church by a council composed of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric. To this day, the Council on the Disposition of Tithes, composed of the eighteen presiding Brethren designated in the revelation, meets regularly under the inspiration of the Lord to determine and approve the disbursement of the tithes of the Lord’s church. As you are well aware, the Church does not engage in deficit spending. The sacred funds of the Church are carefully budgeted so that the expenditures never exceed the income.</p>

There is no such thing as an organization of men for any purpose of importance, without provisions for carrying out its designs. The law of tithing is the law of revenue for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Without it, it would be impossible to carry on the purposes of the Lord.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 226.)</p>

Smith. It concerns an experience his mother, Mary Fielding Smith, the widow of Patriarch Hyrum Smith, had after she came into the Salt Lake Valley. It is heartwarming and faith promoting. She said to a man at the tithing office, across the street where the Hotel Utah now stands, who chided her for paying tithing: “You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Would you deny me a blessing? If I did not pay my tithing, I should expect the Lord to withhold his blessings from me. I pay my tithing, not only because it is a law of God, but because I expect a blessing by doing it. By keeping this and other laws, I expect to prosper, and to be able to provide for my family.”</p>

New converts who joined the Church in 1980 numbered 210,777—and there will be even more in 1981. A miraculous upsurge in the work of the Lord has occurred among the wonderful people of the Caribbean Islands. Surely the Lord has blessed us abundantly!</p>

Romney and I left, in company with a number of others, to conduct area conferences in the Orient. Our first meetings were held in Manila, Philippine Islands, October 18 and 19, where twenty thousand Saints attended the sessions in the Araneta Colosseum. We also looked over possible sites for the new temple which has just been announced for that land. We had a very pleasant visit with Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, who gave up his Saturday morning with his family to meet with us at the presidential palace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/a-report-of-my-stewardship.p6" pid="8NNQFmp1EkCZBtUVQbuk0w" hash="3bLhkQ">From Manila we traveled to Hong Kong, perhaps the world’s most densely populated city, where there are about four hundred thousand people per square mile. There we held meetings in our own excellent stake center on October 20 and 21. The following day we flew to Taipei, Taiwan, where we met on October 22 and 23 in the beautiful Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. We had breakfast at our hotel with the two top leaders of the Republic of China, Prime Minister Sun and President Chiang, son of the late Chiang Kai-shek. We later had lunch as guests of the governor of Taiwan Province. After leaving Taiwan, we went to Seoul, South Korea, the “Land of the Morning Calm.” Meetings were held for two days, October 25 and 26. We met outside in the Korea Seoul Mission compound with more than six thousand present in bitter, subfreezing temperature due to an overnight change in the weather. At our hotel we had lunch as guests of the former Deputy Prime Minister of Korea.</p>

On Monday, October 27, President Romney and I laid the cornerstone for the Tokyo Temple, and then at 3:00 <small>P.M.</small> the first dedicatory session was held in the celestial room, with color television provided in all other rooms of the temple. During the next two days, six more dedicatory sessions were held. Following the dedication of the temple, the Tokyo area conference was held on October 30 and 31 in the famed Budokan Hall. In every place we visited we also held special meetings with the missionaries, with fifteen hundred being present in one meeting in Tokyo. It was indeed a thrilling and inspiring sight to see. On Saturday, November 1, we held morning and afternoon sessions of the Osaka, Japan, area conference. We left that evening to fly home, stopping off in Hawaii for three hours for the purpose of setting apart several sealers for the Hawaii Temple.</p>

Monday through Friday, November 17 to 21, thirteen dedicatory sessions were well attended. Over forty-three thousand members from the great Northwest attended the various sessions.</p>

In Tahiti we broke ground for a new temple in Papeete and met with the missionaries. We also visited with the Deputy to the High Commissioner of Tahiti at the official government residence.</p>

I am told it was the first time a President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has ever visited that island.</p>

We conducted meetings at the temple and the Church College of New Zealand and with the missionaries. On Wednesday, the eighteenth, we flew to Tonga, where we broke ground for the new temple in a beautiful coconut grove at Nuku‘alofa. The king and queen of Tonga and many of the nobles of that kingdom were in attendance throughout the entire day’s activities. Of the 247 missionaries we met with in Tonga, 235 are natives and 12 are from America.</p>

Several thousand Saints sat out in the open during a heavy tropical rainstorm during the entire service. Present for this occasion were the Chief of State of Western Samoa, the Prime Minister, and several members of Parliament.</p>

As we entered the gymnasium, the largest building on the campus, we saw seventeen hundred children sitting cross-legged on the gymnasium floor, crowded in as tightly as little sardines in a can. They ranged from small four-and five-year-old kindergarten children in the front to teenaged high-school youngsters in the back of the hall. What a beautiful, thrilling sight they were as they sang “I Am a Child of God”! They were all dressed in their school uniforms in colors of blue and gold. With their beautiful dark hair and big brown eyes, they presented a picture of youth and beauty that was breathtaking. The tears came to our eyes quickly and without shame. At the close of my remarks, I announced to the students that in honor of the occasion I was declaring a holiday for the rest of the day. Judging by the sound of the applause, I think I may have become an instant hero—at least for that day. After the brief meeting, we left the hall with the haunting strains of the Samoan farewell song, “Tofa My Faleni,” ringing in our ears and warming our hearts.</p>

During the day we visited the BYU—Hawaii campus and the Polynesian Cultural Center. Sunday morning we attended the Oahu Stake conference, and then, in company with Elders Gordon B. Hinckley, Thomas S. Monson, and Boyd K. Packer, we held a meeting in the Hawaii Temple. We then toured the newly remodeled visitors’ center and there met with the missionaries. On Monday, February 23, 1981, we returned to Church headquarters.</p>

On Saturday, March 7, we broke ground for the new temple in Atlanta, Georgia. Ten thousand were present for this occasion, including the governor of Georgia and his wife, several legislators, and U.S. senators Jake Garn and Paula Hawkins. Immediately following that service, we flew to San Juan, Puerto Rico. The next morning, Sunday, March 8, we held a meeting with over twenty-six hundred members of the stake and mission on that island. We next visited the Dominican Republic and held a meeting at Santo Domingo on Monday. Two years ago there were only two families of members on that island, but at our meeting we had over fifteen hundred members present. We left Santo Domingo on Tuesday, March 10, and that night dedicated a new visitors’ center on the Church’s Deseret Ranch near Orlando, Florida.</p>

The next morning, Friday, March 13, in company with Elder Gordon B. Hinckley, we visited with President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office of the White House. We presented to him his genealogy on his mother’s side. We then met with Mrs. Reagan. Both were very warm and gracious and very appreciative of the genealogical record.</p>

On Sunday, March 15, we returned home to prepare for this general conference.</p>

We are so pleased with the able leadership provided by the priesthood bearers of the Church—at all levels!

Therefore, take time to be together as families to converse with one another, to study the scriptures, to visit friends, relatives, and the sick and lonely. This is also an excellent time to work on your journals and genealogy.</p>

The Savior charged us with feeding his sheep. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.15-17" class="scriptureRef">John 21:15–17</a>.) I fear at times that all too often many of our members come to church, sit through a class or meeting, and then return home having been largely uninformed. It is especially unfortunate if this happens at a time when they may be entering a period of stress, temptation, or personal or family crisis. We all need to be touched and nurtured by the Spirit, and effective teaching is one of the most important ways this can happen. We regularly do vigorous enlistment and reactivation work to get members to come to church, but often do not watch over what they receive when they do attend.</p>

They had been delayed because their bus broke down. Under ordinary circumstances, they could have made the trip in about four hours, but they finally arrived after 10:00 <small>P.M.</small> to find the hall dark and empty. Many wept because they were so disappointed. All were converts, some for a few months and others only weeks or days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/rendering-service-to-others.p12" pid="EVyIu4VFVkiAnVmEaK_5nA" hash="6tXVTw">Sister Kimball and I had gone to bed after a long and tiring day. Upon learning of the plight of these faithful souls, my secretary knocked on the door of our hotel room and woke us up. He apologized for disturbing us but thought that I would want to know about the late arrivals and perhaps dictate a personal message to them. However, I felt that wouldn’t be good enough and not fair to those who had come so far under such trying circumstances—one hundred people jammed into one bus. I got out of bed and dressed and went downstairs to see the members who had made such an effort only to be disappointed because of engine trouble. The Saints were still weeping as we entered the hall, so I spent more than an hour visiting with them.</p>

They had to get back by morning to go to work and to school. Those good people seemed so appreciative of a brief visit together that I felt we just couldn’t let them down. As I returned to my bed, I did so with a sense of peace and contentment in my soul.</p>

That is our calling and our privilege. In serving the needs of others, we are mindful of the words of the Savior: “Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>.)</p>

As we seek contributions from our Saints for tithes and fast offerings, let us speak, more often than we sometimes do, in terms of blessings which will flow to us as we keep the commandments and do our duty. From time to time, we hear reports of unwarranted pressures which accompany the financial requests made of our Church members.</p>

In these days of inflation and emotional and political unrest, our people everywhere are being met with difficult and trying experiences on almost every hand. Prudence and wisdom not only suggest but dictate that we take some steps to retrench and husband our resources. We must not overburden our people. With this in mind, the First Presidency has prepared a letter which was released yesterday in which we set out the concerns of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve relating to the increasing financial burdens on members of the Church, in addition to their payment of tithing and fast offerings. With our letter, we prepared some guidelines to assist ward, stake, and mission leaders in complying with the counsel and direction given. We have instructed the Regional Representatives of the Twelve to give this matter immediate attention and implementation.</p>

There is strength and salvation in this principle. Someone has said that we are rich in proportion to that with which we can do without. As families and as a Church, we can and should provide that which is <span class="emphasis">truly essential</span> for our people, but we must be careful not to extend beyond that which is essential or for purposes which are not directly related to our families’ welfare and the basic mission of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/rendering-service-to-others.p18" pid="bAHFmFFVzkez9khnPWUa9g" hash="F6kKjQ">I love you, my brethren, young and old, and I am grateful for your faith and your devotion to the cause of the Master. I express my affection for you and leave my blessing with you. And I pray our Heavenly Father to bless you and your families, your homes, and your work. God bless you, peace be with you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

All Americans, and indeed people throughout the civilized world, were shocked and saddened last week when an attempt was made to assassinate the president of the United States, at which time he and three others near him were seriously wounded.

We are continually being tried and tested as individuals and as a church. There are more trials yet to come, but be not discouraged nor dismayed. Always remember that if this were not the Lord’s work, the adversary would not pay any attention to us. If this Church were merely a church of men and women, teaching only the doctrines of men, we would encounter little or no criticism or resistance—but because this is the Church of Him whose name it bears, we must not be surprised when criticisms or difficulties arise. With faith and good works, the truth will prevail. This is His work. There is none other like it. Let us, therefore, press forward, lengthening our stride and rejoicing in our blessings and opportunities.</p>

Our living came from the soil. There was little money and seldom enough to go around. Going without and making do was our way of life. We learned to share: we shared the work; we shared joys and sorrows; we shared our food and our means. We had genuine concern for one another. Our daily prayers reminded us how dependent we are upon the Lord. We prayed and worked continually for our daily bread.</p>

Live within your means and not beyond them. Where you have a plot of land, however small, plant a garden. Staying close to the soil is good for the soul. Purchase your essentials wisely and carefully. Strive to save a portion of that which you earn. Do not mistake many wants for basic needs.</p>

I look forward to, and draw strength from, these general conferences, and I am anxious to receive the counsel and instructions given to us under the inspiration of the Lord. I find that if I listen carefully and heed all that is said, my life is enriched and my inner soul is nourished with the bread of life.</p>

The Choir recently celebrated another anniversary, more than a half-century of “Music and the Spoken Word,” the longest continuous radio broadcast in the free world. As I listen to the lovely melodies of the Tabernacle Choir and organ, I am comforted by the assurance that there will be beautiful music in heaven, and for that I am most grateful. Some say there will be no music in that other place—but then some sounds that pass for music probably belong in that other place!</p>

As you are aware, we have been somewhat restricted due to a condition known as growing older. I believe I now understand a bit more clearly what is meant by enduring to the end. It is difficult and frustrating not to be able to do all that I would like to do. Nevertheless, I still do many things. Almost daily I join with my Brethren for meetings at the Church office, and I meet every Thursday in the temple with the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve.</p>

During the summer, Sister Kimball and I attended the Salt Lake Valley Dance Festival. We rode in the Days of ’47 Pioneer Parade and attended the rodeo. Last Saturday, we joined with 65,000 others at the BYU-Air Force football game at the newly expanded BYU stadium in Provo.</p>

I am thankful, too, for President Benson and the members of the Council of the Twelve and the other General Authorities, all of whom labor so diligently in the Lord’s vineyard. I am sorry, however, that my dear friend Elder LeGrand Richards is not with us this morning. He has been sitting here on this stand since 1938.</p>

But in the midst of all the turmoil about us, we can have an inner peace. We are richly blessed and have so much to be thankful for. As I meditate upon these things, I remember the words of the Lord, “For unto whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/12.48" class="scriptureRef">Luke 12:48</a>.) The Lord expects of us righteousness and obedience to His commandments in return for the bounties of life He has so richly bestowed upon us. It seems that iniquity abounds on all sides, with the Adversary taking full advantage of the time remaining to him in this day of his power. The leaders of the Church continually cry out against that which is intolerable in the sight of the Lord: against pollution of mind and body and our surroundings; against vulgarity, stealing, lying, cheating, false pride, blasphemy, and drunkenness; against fornication, adultery, homosexuality, abortion; and all other abuses of the sacred power to create; against murder and all that is like unto it; against all manner of degradation and sin.</p>

The way for each person and each family to guard against the slings and arrows of the Adversary and to prepare for the great day of the Lord is to hold fast to the iron rod, to exercise greater faith, to repent of our sins and shortcomings, and to be anxiously engaged in the work of His kingdom on earth, which is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Herein lies the only true happiness for all our Father’s children. We invite all men and women of good will everywhere to join in this divine and redeeming latter-day work.</p>

Our hearts go out in love and sympathy and compassion to all who have been thus bereft of precious little ones. I implore you mothers and fathers of Zion to keep a constant watchcare over your children. Teach them to beware of the growing danger of evil and designing men and pray ever for your children’s welfare. The Devil is not dead, nor does he sleep.</p>

We must come to think of our obligation to share the message rather than of our own convenience. Calls from the Lord are seldom convenient. The time is here when sacrifice must become an even more important element in the Church. We must increase our devotion so that we can do the work the Lord has for us to do. There is a growing need for more missionaries now that the term of service is shorter—but they must be those who have a desire to go and who have been carefully trained and prepared through the family and the various Church organizations. Young men, with the encouragement of their parents, should begin early in life to prepare with the spirit of saving, with the spirit of studying and praying about the gospel, with the spirit of attending seminary and institute classes. And of prime importance is preparation by keeping their lives clean and worthy. The parting words of the Master to His Apostles just before His Ascension were, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</p>

We must lengthen our stride. Not only is our own eternal welfare at stake, but also the eternal welfare of many of our brothers and sisters who are not now members of this, the true Church. I thrill to the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith in a letter that he sent to the Church from Nauvoo on September 6, 1842: “Shall we not go on in so great a cause?

How far from the truth they are! What heresy!

It is a particular delight to us to see the fathers and their sons coming early to the Saturday night priesthood meeting—many of them an hour or two early to be sure of a good seat, and thousands of others, fathers and sons, hurrying to the Tabernacle and to the numerous stake and ward buildings all over the country. This is a delightful extension of our family life which we celebrate and love and which the world is beginning to recognize as a basic family pattern—to have fathers and sons together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/set-some-personal-goals.p2" pid="zqQJWMQRNEatnc9i91hh5w" hash="-tcceQ">“We are grateful to have you present, and our appreciation for you is great and our affection sincere.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1974, p. 86.)</p>

Young men do not usually become inactive in the Church because they are given too many significant things to do. No young man who has really witnessed for himself that the gospel works in the lives of the people will walk away from his duties in the kingdom and leave them undone.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1976, p. 45.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/set-some-personal-goals.p4" pid="rjOqKCBUAkqn7fDrdUiiKQ" hash="jhWDIQ">“It is most appropriate for Aaronic Priesthood youth, as well as Melchizedek Priesthood men, to quietly, and with determination, set some serious personal goals in which they will seek to improve by selecting certain things that they will accomplish within a specified period of time. Even if the priesthood holders of our Heavenly Father are headed in the right direction, if they are men without momentum they will have too little influence. You are the leaven on which the world depends; you must use your powers to stop a drifting and aimless world.</p>

I have mentioned at this pulpit before some determinations made early in my life, which decisions were such a help to me because I did not have to remake those decisions perpetually. We can push some things away from us once and have done with them! We can make a single decision about certain things that we will incorporate in our lives and then make them ours—without having to brood and redecide a hundred times what it is we will do and what we will not do.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1976, p. 46.)</p>

When I heard a Church leader from Salt Lake City tell us at conference that we should read the scriptures, and I recognized that I had never read the Bible, that very night at the conclusion of that very sermon I walked to my home a block away and climbed up in my little attic room in the top of the house and lighted a little coal-oil lamp that was on the little table, and I read the first chapters of Genesis. A year later I closed the Bible, having read every chapter in that big and glorious book.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/set-some-personal-goals.p7" pid="pjl_z1q0n0Cjy-CQCsiWfQ" hash="hE1RLA">“I found that this Bible that I was reading had in it 66 books, and then I was nearly dissuaded when I found that it had in it 1,189 chapters, and then I also found that it had 1,519 pages. It was formidable, but I knew if others did it that I could do it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/set-some-personal-goals.p8" pid="S2C4lAfHXEq3cyd1VTfjvA" hash="lGvfvQ">“I found that there were certain parts that were hard for a 14-year-old boy to understand. There were some pages that were not especially interesting to me, but when I had read the 66 books and 1,189 chapters and 1,519 pages, I had a glowing satisfaction that I had made a goal and that I had achieved it.</p>

I have always been glad I read the Bible from cover to cover. …</p>

I knew where it was written and I knew in a general way what the Lord had said, and I knew that when the Lord said it, it was pleasing unto him for men to abstain from all these destructive elements and that the thing I wanted to do was to please my Heavenly Father. And so I made up my mind firmly and solidly that I would never touch those harmful things. Having made up my mind fully and unequivocably, I found it not too difficult to keep the promise to myself and to my Heavenly Father.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1974, p. 88.)</p>

Every boy would like to be independent and furnish his own funds for his mission, rather than to ask his parents to do that for him. Every boy in every country in all the world who has been baptized and received the Holy Ghost will have the responsibility of bearing the message of the gospel to the people of the world. And this is also your opportunity, and it will contribute greatly toward your greatness.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1974, p. 83.)</p>

It all depends upon you and your attitudes, for your altitude, or the height you climb, is dependent upon your attitude or your response to situations.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1974, p. 80.)</p>

Joseph Smith was only 14 when he had the Vision, 25 when the Church was organized, 18 when he met Moroni, 24 when he got the plates, and 39 when he was martyred.</p>

Johnson 18, when the Church was organized on April 6, 1830. And these men, many of them, were of the apostleship in 1835 when the Council of the Twelve was organized.
