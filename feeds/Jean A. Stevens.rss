      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p1" pid="3by13I2Qm0WYsb_8sEPAEw" hash="c0a2Hg">Our Father in Heaven, in His great wisdom and love, sends His spirit sons and daughters to this earth as children. They come to families as precious gifts with a divine nature and destiny. Our Heavenly Father knows children are a key to helping us become like Him. There is so much we can learn from children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p2" pid="ioFFYRFb8keaXoO-cOln3Q" hash="oenFPg">This important truth was evidenced some years ago as a member of the Seventy was on assignment in Hong Kong. He visited a very humble ward that was struggling in many ways, unable to provide for its own needs. As the bishop described their situation, the General Authority felt the impression to have the members pay their tithing. The bishop, knowing their dire circumstances, was concerned about how he could carry out that counsel. He thought about it and decided he would approach some of the most faith-filled members of his ward and ask them to pay their tithing. The next Sunday he went to the Primary. He taught the children about the Lord’s law of tithing and asked if they would be willing to pay tithing on the money they earned. The children said they would. And they did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p3" pid="wVd6QS5rU0updcc32mEd-Q" hash="Le_Q5Q">The bishop later went to the adults in the ward and shared with them that for the past six months their faithful children had been paying tithing. He asked them if they would be willing to follow the example of these children and do the same. The people were so touched by the sacrifices the children were willing to make that they did what was necessary to pay their tithing. And the windows of heaven were opened. With the example of these faithful children, a ward grew in obedience and in testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p4" pid="aoGltiSchkiwvZxuSYbtbw" hash="6KGqMA">It was Jesus Christ Himself who taught us to look to children as an example. The New Testament records His answer when His Apostles disputed who should be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Jesus answered their question with a small yet powerful object lesson. He called a little child to Him and set him in the midst of them and said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p5" pid="llaXwRK5VkGnQeWKolAVXA" hash="wfuwHQ">“Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p8" pid="iTJXCrhotkqbgDyRYff32g" hash="jMa0rA">These precious children of God come to us with believing hearts. They are full of faith and receptive to feelings of the Spirit. They exemplify humility, obedience, and love. They are often the first to love and the first to forgive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p9" pid="UkmebwyPDU6fPPVr1-P3qw" hash="axxkxg">Let me share some experiences of how children can bless our lives with their innocent yet powerful examples of Christlike attributes.</p>

As they walked past these sacred images, she heard her little boy reverently saying the name “Jesus.” She looked down to see him folding his arms and bowing his head as he viewed the paintings. Could we learn from Todd something about an attitude of humility, of reverence, and of love for the Lord?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p11" pid="iNrgHfkoU0SuXxADhhP19g" hash="XyqU4Q">Last fall I watched the example of a 10-year-old boy in Armenia. As we waited for sacrament meeting to begin, he noticed the oldest member of the branch arrive. He was the one who quickly went to her side, offering his arm to steady her faltering steps. He assisted her to the front row of the chapel, where she could hear. Could his small act of kindness teach us that those who are greatest in the Lord’s kingdom are those who look for opportunities to serve others?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p12" pid="VVIwwzOgqEGe-syppysBkA" hash="ohy2gQ">Katie, a Primary-age girl, taught us as we saw her influence on her family. She attended Primary and was drawn to the teachings of the gospel. With growing faith and testimony, Katie left a note on her parents’ pillow. She wrote that the gospel truths had found a “home in her heart.” She shared her longing to be close to her Heavenly Father, to be obedient to His commandments, and to have their family sealed in the temple. The simple testimony of their sweet daughter touched her parents’ hearts in a powerful way. Katie and her family did receive sacred temple ordinances that bound their family together forever. Katie’s believing heart and example of faith helped bring eternal blessings to her family. Could her sincere testimony and desire to follow the Lord’s plan lead us to see more clearly what really matters most?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p13" pid="OQHUbYHFfU29PBSAOZMEbw" hash="qWl-tg">Our family is learning from a close relative, six-year-old Liam. This past year he has battled aggressive brain cancer. After two difficult surgeries, it was decided that radiation would also be necessary. During these radiation treatments, he was required to be all alone and lie absolutely still. Liam did not want to be sedated because he disliked the way it made him feel. He was determined that if he could just hear his dad’s voice over the intercom, he could lie still without the sedative.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p14" pid="uN29bi3jZUGgjO4tNT7btQ" hash="bxD45Q">During these anxious times, his dad spoke to him with words of encouragement and love. “Liam, although you can’t see me, I am right here. I know you can do it. I love you.” Liam successfully accomplished the 33 required radiation treatments while holding perfectly still, a feat his doctors thought would be impossible without sedation for one so young. Through months of pain and difficulty, Liam’s contagious optimism has been a powerful example of meeting adversity with hope and even happiness. His doctors, nurses, and countless others have been inspired by his courage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p15" pid="N2C-8CBmiEq57QXrHA3RqA" hash="5dmnZg">We are all learning important lessons from Liam—lessons about choosing faith and trusting in the Lord. Just like Liam, we cannot see our Heavenly Father, but we can listen for His voice to give us the strength we need to endure the challenges of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/become-as-a-little-child.p16" pid="1Es7VNXvzkikESqvJHFdQA" hash="UAOzPQ">Could Liam’s example help us to better understand King Benjamin’s words to become as a child—submissive, meek, humble, patient, and full of love? (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</p>

They are bright spirits who are untarnished by the world—teachable and full of faith. It is no wonder the Savior has a special love and appreciation for little children.</p>

Russell Ballard has taught us the importance of the Savior’s admonition to “behold your little ones” when he said: “Notice that He didn’t say ‘glance at them’ or ‘casually observe them’ or ‘occasionally take a look in their general direction.’ He said to <span class="emphasis">behold</span> them. To me that means that we should embrace them with our eyes and with our hearts; we should see and appreciate them for who they really are: spirit children of our Heavenly Father, with divine attributes” (“Behold Your Little Ones,” <span class="emphasis">Tambuli,</span> Oct. 1994, 40; emphasis added; “Great Shall Be the Peace of Thy Children,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Apr. 1994, 59).</p>

It is here in our families where our hearts can be softened and in humility we desire to change, to become more childlike. It is a process by which we can become more Christlike.</p>

If so, look around at the children in your life. And then look again. They may be children in your family, across the street, or in the Primary in your ward.

There is nothing sweeter than receiving a precious baby, direct from heaven. One of my brothers experienced this feeling in an especially poignant way. His first little son was born prematurely and weighed only 2 pounds 14 ounces (1.3 kg). Hunter spent his first two months of life in the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital. Those months were a tender time for all the family as we hoped and petitioned the Lord for His help.</p>

Our Father in Heaven reaches out for each of us with His infinite love. He has power over all things and desires to help us learn, grow, and return to Him. This defines our Father’s purpose: “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span>

Nephi introduced it in the very first chapter of the book. In <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.20" class="scriptureRef">verse 20</a>, we read, “Behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span>

After passing him, I had a distinct impression I should go back and help him. But worried it could frighten him to have a stranger pull up beside him at night, I continued driving. The strong impression came again with the words in my mind: “Go help that boy!”</p>

I discovered that the experience isn’t just my story—it is his story too. Deric Nance is now a father with a family of his own. He too has never forgotten this experience. It helped us lay a foundation of faith that God hears and answers our prayers. Both of us have used it to teach our children that God is watching over us. We are not alone.</p>

As a young teenager, he felt confident he could make it home, so he started walking.</p>

Still miles from home and with no houses in sight, he was scared. In despair, he walked behind a pile of gravel, got on his knees, and asked Heavenly Father for help. Just minutes after Deric returned to the road, I stopped to provide the help he prayed for.</p>

And despite everything else going on in the world, He was aware of my situation and loved me enough to send help. The Lord has answered my prayers many times since that abandoned roadside. His answers aren’t always as immediate and clear, but His awareness of me is just as evident today as it was that lonely night. Whenever the dark shadows of life blanket my world, I know He always has a plan to see me safely home again.”</p>

But truly our Father knows us and hears the pleadings of our hearts. He accomplishes His miracles one prayer at a time, one person at a time.</p>

Lewis described: “I pray because I can’t help myself. … I pray because the need flows out of me all the time, waking and sleeping. It doesn’t change God. It changes me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span>

Think of young David, who escaped certain death at the hand of the mighty Goliath by relying on the Lord. Consider Nephi, whose pleadings to God in faith brought deliverance from his brothers who sought to take his life. Remember young Joseph Smith, who prayerfully sought the Lord’s help. He was delivered from the power of darkness and received a miraculous answer. Each faced real and difficult challenges. Each acted in faith and put his trust in the Lord. Each received His help. And still in our day, God’s power and love are manifest in the lives of His children.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/fear-not-i-am-with-thee.p23" pid="kGa_cLQwS0iJzVHVf2_p0g" hash="TlvrBQ">I have seen it recently in the lives of faith-filled Saints in Zimbabwe and Botswana. In a fast and testimony meeting in a small branch, I was humbled and inspired by the testimonies shared by many—children, youth, and adults alike. Each conveyed a powerful expression of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. With challenges and difficult circumstances surrounding them, they live each day by putting their trust in God. They acknowledge His <span class="pageBreak" page-number="83"></span>hand in their lives and often express it with the phrase “I am so much grateful to God.”</p>
		<span class="story">
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/fear-not-i-am-with-thee.p24" pid="XzD2lP48hkmVKxyB_SXL9A" hash="oF4lrQ">A few years ago a faithful family exemplified for members of our ward that same trust in the Lord. Arn and Venita Gatrell were living a happy life when Arn was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer. The prognosis was devastating—he had just a few weeks to live. The family wanted to be together one last time. So all the children gathered, some from distant locations. They had only 48 precious hours to spend together. The Gatrells carefully chose what mattered most to them—a family picture, a family dinner, and a session in the Salt Lake Temple. Venita said, “When we walked out of the temple doors, it was the last time we would ever be together in this life.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/fear-not-i-am-with-thee.p25" pid="UbAUKYqFEUmVDyXKvHWGeA" hash="FHTYhA">But they left with the assurance that there is so much more for them than just this life. Because of sacred temple covenants, they have hope in God’s promises. They can be together forever.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/fear-not-i-am-with-thee.p26" pid="rfx7dN8z9kyDtiCSpyiwuw" hash="KeKBhw">The next two months were filled with blessings too numerous to recount. Arn and Venita’s faith and trust in the Lord were growing, as evidenced in Venita’s words: “I was carried. I learned that you can feel peace in the midst of turmoil. I knew the Lord was watching over us. If you trust in the Lord, truly you can overcome any of life’s challenges.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/fear-not-i-am-with-thee.p27" pid="hnLXyppTPk2COIAGTS2rww" hash="3qc9ww">One of their daughters added: “We watched our parents and saw their example. We saw their faith and how they handled it. I would never have asked for this trial, but I would never give it away. We were surrounded with God’s love.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/fear-not-i-am-with-thee.p28" pid="YElZK9ixLUmrogCbe_UkRg" hash="VWC4-w">Of course, Arn’s passing was not the outcome the Gatrells had hoped for. But their crisis was not a crisis of faith. The gospel of Jesus Christ is not a checklist of things to do; rather, it lives in our hearts. The gospel “is not weight; it is wings.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> It carries us. It carried the Gatrells. They felt peace in the midst of the storm. They held fast to each other and to temple covenants they had made and kept. They grew in their ability to trust in the Lord and were strengthened by their faith in Jesus Christ and in His atoning power.</p>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/fear-not-i-am-with-thee.p29" pid="RtnfxeaEHE2wmmWZtXLzSg" hash="K2an-Q">Wherever we find ourselves on the path of discipleship, whatever our worries and challenges may be, we are not alone. You are not forgotten. Like Deric, the Saints of Africa, and the Gatrell family, we can choose to reach for God’s hand in our need. We can face our challenges with prayer and trust in the Lord. And in the process we become more like Him.</p>

				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p5" pid="PdmWNrKiBUun6NmVzAr-UA" hash="STNh9w"&gt;Dear sisters, I greet you with so much love. Right now, wherever you are in the world, I hope you feel the Lord’s love for you personally and the Spirit witnessing to your heart the message just sung by this beautiful choir. I add my voice of testimony to theirs: I know that my Redeemer lives and that He loves each one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p6" pid="17optJlRPUa-4wqRRhGMVg" hash="P6YWfA"&gt;Tonight we gather as covenant daughters of God. Our ages, circumstances, and personalities cannot separate us, because above all we are His. We have made a covenant to remember His Son always.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;span class="story"&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p7" pid="3C1tx9I8O06XaFKOgCEaKw" hash="pgveSA"&gt;The power of that individual covenant was impressed upon my heart three weeks ago as I attended a baptismal service. There before me were eight beautiful children sitting with reverent anticipation that finally their special day had arrived. But as I looked into their bright faces, I did not see just a group of children. Instead I saw them as I think the Lord would—individually. I saw Emma and Sophia and Ian and Logan and Aden and William and Sophie and Micah. Each baptismal covenant is made one by one. Each dressed in white, they were there—ready and willing with all their eight-year-old hearts to make their first covenant with God.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p8" pid="YEpcFUhLh0-d8zhyt7Bg2g" hash="_q6uSw"&gt;Think back and picture your own baptismal day. Whether you can remember many details or just a few, try to feel now the significance of the covenant you individually made. Having been called by your own name, you were immersed in water and came forth as God’s daughter—a covenant daughter, one willing to be called by the name of His Son and promising to follow Him and keep His commandments.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p9" pid="eSE5rmIea0m5KBhtWLVTLg" hash="I9uVqg"&gt;Covenants with God help us to know who we really are. They connect us to Him in a personal way through which we come to feel our value in His sight and our place in His kingdom. In a way we can’t fully comprehend, we are known and loved individually by Him. Think of it—each of us holds such a place in His heart. His desire is that we will choose the path that will bring us home to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p10" pid="8olWKp62u0KzcesY2LeRtw" hash="xuidSw"&gt;As essential and significant as the covenant of baptism is, it is only the beginning—the gate that puts us on the path to eternal life. Ahead on our journey are temple covenants to be made and priesthood ordinances to receive. As Elder David A. Bednar reminds us, “As we stand in the waters of baptism, we look to the temple.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p11" pid="7gZ4cvAtJkuYbMa4D_i5LQ" hash="XM8DOQ"&gt;It is not only in making covenants but also in faithfully keeping these covenants that we are prepared to receive eternal life. That is our hope, our goal, and our joy.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;span class="story"&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p12" pid="K7_ug3a_rkONmEnjiMgnkQ" hash="Dt-6cg"&gt;I was an eyewitness to the power of covenants as I watched my righteous parents, who loved and lived the gospel. In my sweet mother I was privileged to see clearly the daily decisions of a covenant daughter of God. Even when she was a girl, her choices reflected her priorities and identified her as a true disciple of Jesus Christ. I have seen the peace, the power, and the protection that came into her life as she made and kept sacred covenants on her journey. Her life on this earth reflected her love for the Savior and her desire to follow Him. Oh, how I want to follow her example.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p13" pid="KDueyjwUd0iKCfianXaClw" hash="viemmw"&gt;My parents’ lives together began in an unusual way. It was 1936. They were dating seriously and were planning to marry, when my dad received a letter inviting him to serve as a full-time missionary in South Africa. The letter said that if he was worthy and willing to serve, he was to contact his bishop. You can quickly see that the process of being called as a missionary was very different in those days! Dad showed the letter to his sweetheart, Helen, and they determined without question he would serve.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p14" pid="nhBnjr5010GoraKoMepwzw" hash="Vi9tuQ"&gt;For two weeks before he left, Mom met Dad each day for a picnic lunch in Memory Grove near downtown Salt Lake City. During one of their lunches, having sought direction through fasting and prayer, Mother told her dear Claron that if he still wanted to, she would marry him before he left. In the early days of the Church, men were sometimes called to missionary service and left wives and families at home. So it was with my mother and dad. With the approval of his priesthood leaders, they decided to be married before he departed for his mission.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p15" pid="tWPMs2XfxUSXQ-4SkgNmww" hash="nFf0jw"&gt;In the Salt Lake Temple, Mother received her endowment, and then they were married for time and all eternity by President David O. McKay. Theirs was a humble beginning. There were no photographs, no beautiful wedding dress, no flowers, and no reception to celebrate the occasion. Their clear focus was on the temple and their covenants. For them, the covenants were everything. After only six days of marriage and with a tearful good-bye, my dad left for South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p16" pid="52Ne_dyJo0yjQ_lLumLyvQ" hash="x30VRQ"&gt;But their marriage was more than just the deep love they had for each other. They also had a love of the Lord and a desire to serve Him. The sacred temple covenants they had made gave them strength and power to carry them through the two years of separation. They had an eternal perspective of life’s purpose and of promised blessings that come to those who are faithful to their covenants. All these blessings transcended their short-term sacrifice and separation.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p17" pid="31pSvZ_y1U2-5XFv0xg7yA" hash="naTANg"&gt;While it certainly wasn’t an easy way to begin married life, it proved to be an ideal way to lay a foundation for an eternal family. As children came along, we knew what mattered most to our parents. It was their love for the Lord and their unwavering commitment to keeping the covenants they had made. Though my parents have both passed away, their pattern of righteousness is blessing our family still.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p18" pid="oaxbxQY2-0WZ7vqDaZWyPQ" hash="RxnewA"&gt;The example of their lives is reflected in the words of Sister Linda K. Burton: “The best way to strengthen a home, current or future, is to keep covenants.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p19" pid="9o5vm_WS50667KB_7tDgtg" hash="UiUrFw"&gt;Their season of hardship and trial was not over. Three years after Dad returned from his mission, World War II was raging, and like so many others, he enlisted in the military. He was away from home for another four years as he served in the navy aboard battleships in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p20" pid="R6RALwoPdEeywsfxgzPCYw" hash="AjCrxw"&gt;It was a difficult time for my parents to be separated again. But for my mother, those days of loneliness, worry, and uncertainty were also marked by whisperings of the Spirit that spoke of eternal promises, of comfort and peace amid the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p21" pid="etfTcsDgBkm-t957lkOTcA" hash="2G6euQ"&gt;Despite her challenges, my mother lived a rich life, full of happiness, joy, love, and service. Her love of the Savior was reflected in the way she lived her life. She had a remarkable connection to heaven and a gift and capacity to love and bless everyone around her. Her faith in God and hope in His promises are reflected in President Thomas S. Monson’s words about the temple when he said, “No sacrifice is too great, no price too heavy, no struggle too difficult in order to receive those blessings.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p22" pid="Yg4qwxBupk-9sPMdPXEtPA" hash="H7jbDA"&gt;In all the seasons of her life, Mother was strengthened and blessed by her love of the Lord and by the covenants she faithfully made and kept.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p23" pid="nUn1r8ASh0eMMlPquKP6rQ" hash="kI9NbQ"&gt;There is no doubt the details of your story will be different than hers. But principles from her life apply to all of us. When daughters of God focus on the temple and on their sacred covenants, God is able to send blessings in personal and powerful ways. Like my mother’s example to me, your choice to believe and keep covenants will leave a rich legacy of faith for those who follow you. So, dear sisters, how can we access the power and blessings of temple covenants? What can we do now to prepare for those blessings?&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p24" pid="H2UAKajIzESiS7eVZtqLeg" hash="8AF2rg"&gt;As I have traveled, I have come to know there are sisters of all ages, in all circumstances, whose lives provide answers to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;span class="story"&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p25" pid="D_rcn1mkPUuNx4VeVaN2Ww" hash="VYYy0A"&gt;I met Mary shortly after her eighth birthday. Like so many others, she is excited about doing family history and has contributed over 1,000 names for temple work. Mary is preparing herself now for the blessing of entering the temple when she turns 12.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class="story"&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p26" pid="ovzM8NEAXESSfO39QloT4A" hash="4mlKeg"&gt;Brianna is 13 and loves doing family history and temple work. She has accepted Elder Neil L. Andersen’s temple challenge.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; She has prepared hundreds of names for temple work and, along with herself, has included her family and friends in performing the baptisms. In this sacred work, Brianna’s heart is turning not only to her earthly fathers but to her Heavenly Father as well.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class="story"&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p27" pid="i0xiiiFkJ0-EVpaJ9hu5qA" hash="tqjREA"&gt;Although Anfissa is a busy young adult who is working and going to graduate school, she still makes time to attend the temple each week. She seeks revelation and finds peace as she serves in the house of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class="story"&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p28" pid="82Gldx4FgkSQBiW42uslqA" hash="FNkvdA"&gt;Katya, a dear sister in Ukraine, has a deep love for the temple. Before the temple in Kyiv was built, she and others in her branch sacrificed to travel 36 hours on a bus to attend the temple once a year in Germany. These devoted Saints prayed, studied scriptures, sang hymns, and discussed the gospel as they traveled. Katya told me, “When we finally arrived at the temple, we were prepared to receive what the Lord had to give us.”&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p29" pid="VwAv81cCAkK9F6Bivmjybg" hash="7CNAnA"&gt;If we are to receive all the blessings God so generously offers, our earthly path must lead to the temple. Temples are an expression of God’s love. He invites us all to come, learn of Him, feel His love, and receive the priesthood ordinances necessary for eternal life with Him. Each covenant is made one by one. Every mighty change of heart matters to the Lord. And yours will make all the difference to you. For as we go to His holy house, we can be “armed with [His] power, … [His] name … upon [us], … [His] glory … round about [us], and [His] angels have charge over [us].”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/covenant-daughters-of-god.p30" pid="En_ZfnTRqkOkmxqkX3ADsg" hash="2QJwHA"&gt;I share with you my certain witness that our loving Father in Heaven lives. It is through His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, that every hope, every promise, and every blessing of the temple is fulfilled. May we have faith to trust in Him and His covenants, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;
