As a teenager, he studied in China, where a classmate introduced him to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Eventually, Girish came to Brigham Young University for graduate work and met his future wife. They settled in the Salt Lake Valley and adopted two children from Nepal.</p>

With native-language fluency and cultural understanding, Girish served as an interpreter, teacher, and mentor. After resettling in the community, some of the Nepali refugees demonstrated interest in the gospel. A Nepali-speaking branch was organized, and Girish later served as its branch president. He was also instrumental in translating the Book of Mormon into Nepali.</p>

Clearly, I needed to keep my covenants, get an education, start a family, and earn a living. But I wondered if there was something more, or even special, that the Lord wanted me to do. After pondering for several months, I came across this verse: “If you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this generation” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 11:8</a>).

Despite a daunting campaign process, he exercised faith and gathered the resources to run. Ultimately, he did not win but felt the Lord gave him guidance and strength to raise issues important to the community.</p>

Though it has been difficult, she feels strengthened by the Lord to fulfill her most important mission successfully.</p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/i-have-a-work-for-thee.p39" pid="pce9aMxBd0axfZIQHDTijw" hash="9dGWww">At the same time God helps us fulfill divine assignments, the adversary works to distract and dissuade us from a life of meaning.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/i-have-a-work-for-thee.p40" pid="vjZAR-oBZ0SsnlGgdWenHA" hash="2qH1Gg">Sin is perhaps our greatest stumbling block, dulling our sensitivity to the Holy Ghost and restricting our access to spiritual power. To perform the work Heavenly Father has for us, we must strive to be clean (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.1" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 8:1</a>). Are we living in such a way that God can work through us?</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/i-have-a-work-for-thee.p41" pid="tWmYsP2YD0eO57ipBDf6Ig" hash="rwpvfA">Satan also seeks to distract us with less important matters. The Lord warned an early Church leader, “Your mind has been on the things of the earth more than on the things of me … and the ministry whereunto you have been called” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/30.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 30:2</a>). Are we so preoccupied with worldly things that we are diverted from our divine assignments?</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/i-have-a-work-for-thee.p42" pid="TlEJIinYZ0yrs58IMNhkJA" hash="BhFnTg">In addition, Satan discourages us with feelings of inadequacy. He makes our work appear too difficult or intimidating. However, we can trust God! He loves us. He wants us to succeed. He “doth go before [us]; he will be with [us], he will not fail [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/31.8" class="scriptureRef">Deuteronomy 31:8</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/32.8" class="scriptureRef">Psalm 32:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Proverbs 3:5–6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.26" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 19:26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:18</a>).</p>

But every assignment from God is important, and we will find fulfillment as we “glory in that which the Lord hath commanded [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.9" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:9</a>).</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/i-have-a-work-for-thee.p44" pid="DtcAC1wp0kioitZ8LWVLJw" hash="r75GRQ">As God works through us, the adversary may tempt us to take credit for any accomplishments. However, we can emulate the Savior’s humility by deflecting personal praise and glorifying the Father (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.16" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:2</a>). When a reporter tried to recognize Mother Teresa for her life’s mission to help the poor, she retorted: “It’s [God’s] work. I am like a … pencil in his hand. … He does the thinking. He does the writing. The pencil has nothing to do with it. The pencil has only to be allowed to be used.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
