There was a long distance phone call awaiting me. The voice on the other end of the line introduced herself as “This is the secretary to President Lee. He and President Tanner would like to speak with you, but they aren’t available right now. I am wondering where you will be this evening that they might call you back.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p2" guid="8eb07f53-1084-41d2-88df-6e44c6a602c3" pid="tyv4HoHFakC0Pecq-8twxg" hash="41dAnw">All of a sudden everything I was going to do that evening became insignificant, and I said, “I will be here.” And then for the next thirty longest minutes of my life, I did many unimportant things, trying to keep busy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p3" guid="8b7ab8a6-8f8d-4a1b-9b09-8e36fc6f9978" pid="DasXqv-BB0Gc1_1TZVDa3w" hash="nDfFTQ">The call came, and President Lee and President Tanner told me of this assignment from the Lord. I must apologize to them for not doing my part in carrying on the conversation that continued. All I was able to say for a while was “Thank you.” It seems that my voice box and tear ducts did not know whose turn it was.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p4" guid="c2a2c5f2-8159-43ce-93bc-c24b5c770f2f" pid="NKcvSl12tkaQvZ5wE4glcQ" hash="5jRe5w">Finally President Lee said to me, “Brother Peterson, we want you to know that we have had a confirmation from the Lord that this is what he would have you do.” It seemed when he said this that I too received that feeling. It seemed then that even though I didn’t know how, and I still don’t know how, I knew that everything would work out as the Lord would have it work out.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p5" guid="c578c2ac-c4bb-4dca-932b-705fef14aaf7" pid="IFp9zjarSUGCAayiN3uOtQ" hash="fkt6sA">I am thankful to him for having called a prophet in this day. I am thankful to him for having called noble men to stand at the prophet’s side. I appreciate their confidence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p6" guid="079672f0-5f85-4c9e-a217-d38a27302a77" pid="cCYtNeCgXUmJvZwpk0ad1g" hash="Dl9Kdg">I appreciate the confidence of Bishop Brown. I am thankful that the Lord directed him in the selection of his counselors. I will do everything I can to make this an enjoyable and profitable experience for him as he works with me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p7" guid="d9db8819-59bf-4a92-9875-de755c1aca34" pid="InL3zIO0vkWvCa3_NHW1fw" hash="SObJGw">After the phone call, I called in my wife, and I told her what had happened. We sat and visited for a while about how this would affect our lives, our five daughters, our business, our home that we just bought. And then it seemed that almost automatically we knelt together and thanked our Father in heaven for his confidence, for his love, and for the things that he has done for us. We thanked him for our children and for their love for their Father in heaven. And I thanked him for her, this eternal sweetheart of mine. I thanked him for allowing her to remain on the earth for another season. I thanked him for her faithfulness in all the calls that have come into our home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p8" guid="c5799aad-aafe-49be-845b-664a461f51a9" pid="9DODUILML0ahNN9PjmHapQ" hash="kFa3Ow">Since the call last Thursday evening, I have had many things go through my mind—just why, just how this ever happened. I have thought and remembered back on my boyhood days, and I thanked him for parents who, by very simple means and very common undertakings, instilled in their sons a love for them and a love for their Father in heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p9" guid="effdbaf8-c07e-4f36-a184-81b60f323bb1" pid="GMRh5MMN1k648Xwzvripkg" hash="uHSaIQ">I remember many times, it seemed like almost every week, that four little towheaded boys would stand with their faces against the windowpane or against the screen door and wave goodbye to their mother and dad as they would get in the car and go to the temple in Mesa.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p10" guid="606ed9ac-61d6-4d4b-a258-279ee8d11551" pid="oy23jB5AWEySC9oXu-RmyA" hash="6yNYZg">We didn’t know much about the temple, and we didn’t know much about what went on in the temple, but we had been taught without any reservation that Mother and Dad loved us and that they would do anything for us. So, as we stood there and watched them go, we knew that something important must go on in that temple, to have these two people who loved us more than anything leave us as often as they did to go there. We gained an understanding in those tender years of the importance of the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p11" guid="4457d3d8-a553-4b2e-bc01-07bbb0652e9f" pid="z7FSbZMkEkKq1e7S1_P9pg" hash="5ajDBg">While we were growing up, our father was a ward clerk for fifteen years, and I remember that every Sunday evening he would come home after meeting and go into the dining room. He would pull down the blind and on the oak table he would put the money that he had gathered that day for the bishop—the tithes and offerings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p12" guid="93a9db04-6dbd-4bed-aa2f-8a91bec4158f" pid="gAByMT5xjU2_93cs1k4vCA" hash="0HDRrA">He would count it and account for it and put the ones and the fives and the tens in a pile; and then he would get the ironing board and an iron and a wet rag, and then our dad would take each of these paper bills and iron it smooth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p13" guid="ddf8eb35-319b-4893-99be-3cb63eb3eb11" pid="kI8VRyP7CESiz9uTF9hemg" hash="6Z6mTQ">Now you would wonder what four little boys would recognize about this. The one thing they got from it was that whatever you do for the Lord, you do the very best that you know how. There is nothing that is too good for the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p14" guid="904f867f-d272-419b-b69c-26d9edbef98a" pid="ZwbjpXbgHkeM1LvGRaymsQ" hash="ry_Leg">This humble man and his wife, who didn’t have much of the world’s goods, by some very simple experiences implanted in their sons a love for the Lord. And it is because of these experiences, and others like them, that I can stand here this morning and tell you that I know that God lives; that I know that Jesus is the Christ, and that I know that this is his church and that he organized it for the salvation of his children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/setting-the-example-in-the-home.p15" guid="761cfac1-8d6e-415c-9528-064a266bdf64" pid="ofq06oPEQ0-SQH0LxwkA-Q" hash="jE1cpg">I know these things are true, and I testify of them in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

    <div class="topic" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.t1">
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p1" guid="c26b80ba-9c55-492a-88b6-2e192e14d361" pid="05lTAk_TmUaw8Mm4txgxpA" hash="Fj3XBw">In countless writings the prophets of the Lord have been trying to teach us that throughout time and all eternity the most important organization is the family. A loving Father in heaven organized his church here on the earth as a means of teaching families how to be eternally happy. We know that none of us can receive the fulfillment of true happiness except as a member of an eternal family unit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p2" guid="4f3aa440-6383-4e39-bd40-174dba2d9950" pid="HymIU_zm6UWIy-YeAOf3iw" hash="wVDj5w">We also know, or we should know, that the success we experience in our homes as families is going to have a most significant effect on the eternal happiness of each of us. Happiness in the life hereafter is geared to our learning and living celestial laws while we are here on the earth. This being so, then our great need is to establish in our homes an atmosphere that will encourage the learning and living of the teachings of the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p3" guid="8d388d2d-447f-434e-8115-366652925deb" pid="SjxP-iAFeUmkGAyb5VheoQ" hash="79PYXA">Satan knows that he can cause unhappiness in our homes if he can bring about disunity, discontent, disharmony, and a host of other spiritual illnesses. By this insidious process he has gained no small measure of success in his plan to lead astray the children of our Father in heaven. For instance, he knows that if he can cause parents to quarrel with each other, their children may well follow the example.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p4" guid="0ab7b70b-c3e5-4551-a5e8-dd70c1bdb4c5" pid="cDr6KE8VLUmKScifDqbgmA" hash="YRcbEQ">He knows that if parents show little respect for each other, so will their children. He knows that children mirror the actions of their parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p5" guid="d96c18c8-9ff5-421d-9db6-9f8b77e76d66" pid="QsLRoLzpT0-cX6YM1_o7CA" hash="OvM6_Q">He also knows that his greatest effort to block the work of the Lord must be in the home. Unfortunately, it is here where he enjoys his greatest success, first by destroying family relationships and then by destroying the family unit. He is using many devious means to accomplish his purpose. Many are the homes that do not recognize his ofttimes silent enroachment into their happiness and security.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p6" guid="bc06fea1-4605-4d0e-af60-cb29a0b482f0" pid="YOp-YlybkEm3BRfRJIiVBw" hash="38eHKg">One of Satan’s most effective tools is at work among us today—it is a destroyer of happiness, peace, contentment, family solidarity. Families are stumbling and falling because of its hobbling and crippling effect. This tool of Satan is called contention. The dictionary describes contention as follows: “To argue, to bring discord or strife, to dispute, to quarrel.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p7" guid="91ce1d70-54b4-45e4-ae42-f15e52596c20" pid="jX9eo5fOQ0Ki_yrRn_cpMA" hash="4jNp5A">Now, some will say, “This is our way of life—everybody’s doing it.” Lest we think these acts are not serious and are just our way of life, to be accepted and lived with, let us hear the word of the Lord as expressed by an ancient prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p8" guid="52fe70c2-f428-448f-8f1f-0537939e7cb5" pid="PO3MTkTnvU6GpDrKaVn6sw" hash="dA3BSA">We read in 3 Nephi: “… And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p9" guid="baf86c12-fc44-42e7-8c52-f82ebafdac89" pid="b_uh7y5O50CLMG9Aa5_KKQ" hash="0axTRA">“For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</p>

We read in Mosiah:</p>

Fathers and mothers, may I remind you that we are always teaching.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p15" guid="cebd92d7-b1f9-465e-b942-cb5bde21a37e" pid="eZtMliebdEipiojrdZmUwA" hash="htX5XA">The home should be the great workshop of the Lord. Here is where children must be taught to walk in ways of truth and soberness, of love and service to each other.</p>

Few of us realize how very pliable and teachable children are in their primary years of life. How quick they are to pick up parental habits and traits and teachings!</p>

May I suggest that we give more of ourselves, that we give more good experiences to our children, experiences that are love-producing and family-solidifying. Whether the times we give are measured in minutes or hours is not as important as what we do in them. It may be five minutes at a child’s bedside each night or a fifteen-minute walk in the evening. It may be a day in the hills or a three-minute phone call from the office at midday. It may be a clever love note to a little girl or a night out to a ball game with a boy. It can even be the experience of a family home evening. It can even be the experience of a family learning to pray together and reading the scriptures together and fasting together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/harmony-in-the-home.p18" guid="d262df4f-452a-453a-9679-d914bcf3476d" pid="rkcYcfFKXEWJa2EPwt9GWA" hash="xTuwjw">We must expand our thinking on ways to develop happy children. As the Lord has said, the power is within us to do so. The ways of the Lord are simple ways. Simple experiences with children develop unbreakable ties that will endure forever. It might be something as simple as smiling more in your home.</p>

See how long you can uplift your whole family. Take one day at a time. As a TV commercial says, “Try it—you’ll like it.”</p>

We must be sure to give adequate time to our own courtship. A happy marriage nowadays is a perishable item. Take time alone together to feed it and nurture it and keep it alive.

We never seem to be in calm waters. Either it’s sick children, a Primary lesson to prepare, a car that breaks down before meetings, a flooded bathroom—you name it, we’ve had it.”</p>

It seems that life is tilled with a variety of difficult experiences that test us and try us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p5" guid="765bb882-9db1-4a54-8508-e306dee01f84" pid="1uSlP9bxsEOvoMrpXuk1zg" hash="HDhzjQ">We should understand that a life filled with problems is no respecter of age or station in life. A life filled with trials is no respecter of position in the Church or social standing in the community. Challenges come to the young and to the aged—to the rich and to the poor—to the struggling student or the genius scientist—to the farmer, carpenter, lawyer, or doctor. Trials come to the strong and to the weak—to the sick and to the healthy. Yes, even to the simplest child as well as to a prophet of God. At times they seem to be more than we can bear.</p>

The father had been active in the Church as a boy, but during his teenage years had veered somewhat from his childhood pattern. After returning from the military service he married a lovely girl and presently children blessed their home. Without warning an undisclosed illness overcame their little four-year-old daughter. Within a very short time she was on the critical list in the hospital. In desperation and for the first time in many years the father went to his knees in prayer—asking that her life be spared. As her condition worsened and he sensed that she would not live, the tone of the father’s prayers changed—he no longer asked that her life be spared—but rather for a blessing of understanding—“Let thy will he done,” he said. Soon the child was in a coma, indicating her hours on earth were few. Now, fortified with understanding and trust, the young parents asked for one more favor of the Lord. Would he allow her to awaken once more that they might hold her closely. The little one’s eyes opened, her flail arms outstretched to her mother and then to her daddy for a final embrace. When the father laid her on the pillow to sleep till another morning, he knew their prayers had been answered—a kind, understanding Father in heaven had filled their needs as he knew them to be. His will had been done—they had gained understanding—they were determined now to live that they might live again with her.</p>

The Lord said, “If thou art called to pass through tribulation …” and then the Lord called to mind a series of possibilities that would test any man to the utmost—and he then concluded: “Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.5,7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:5, 7</a>.)</p>

Might this also be the case in our own lives! From trial comes refined beauty.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p11" guid="9a81dccb-fd7d-4817-b290-6b3b0843e3cf" pid="0DqgbGyxh0qAvrL16cVHSg" hash="4jwjrw">We could cite Beethoven or Abraham Lincoln or Demosthenes who won out in a most difficult struggle to become a magnificent orator—but closer to us we see the great beauty and wisdom in the speaking and teaching of President Spencer W. Kimball and we see the price he’s paid that our lives might be blessed.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p13" guid="595cb4db-145b-46e7-9e1c-b017799bdb8f" pid="xQclM98JGE6OAL5e7OvUiA" hash="M-bPqQ">From Hebrews we also read: “My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.5" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:5</a>.)</p>

They are given as a blessing to his children. They are given as opportunities for growth.</p>

How do we overcome them? How are we magnified by them? There seems to be a reason why we lose our composure in adversity—why we think we can no longer cope with what we’re faced with here in this life. There is a reason why we give up, why we “fall apart at the seams” so to speak. The reason may be so simple that we lose sight of it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p16" guid="20bf9ecd-b8fa-4628-ab40-8a416575992c" pid="A9uX3jXRckGKeiYxfQFFOQ" hash="ulubTw">Could it be it’s because we begin to lose contact with our greatest source of strength—our Father in heaven? He is the key to our enjoying sweetness in adversity—in gaining strength from our trials—he and he alone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p17" guid="17544e02-1c6a-4f6f-8c00-6d7c328eee16" pid="e407fR5kA0qZApX63g1G8w" hash="NOnBcw">As a reassurance to us, let us read from the New Testament: “There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 10:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p18" guid="0cef8823-eff0-407b-9dab-cf98b061d4cd" pid="qmQHega4gUS2KWWgY3TJKQ" hash="Xf59QQ">Did you get the significance of that scriptural promise—we will have no temptation or trial beyond our ability to overcome—he will provide a way for us to rise above—whatever it may be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p19" guid="ee8a7ed4-49c6-4b00-8784-2acebb86675a" pid="uhvSuhiXAUG_DO3P7wGkbA" hash="O1aJdQ">May I suggest the best way I know to keep close to the source of this great strength is through prayer. No man can stand alone in his struggle through life. Sometimes in discouragement our prayers, at best, become occasional or maybe not at all. Sometimes we forget or just don’t care. Brigham Young once said, “Prayer keeps man from sin, and sin keeps man from prayer.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p20" guid="9e9fc469-8f09-4f00-9570-c6954e773954" pid="S2vdRYMFG0akpuLcB4AOXw" hash="diyaZw">Some may be thinking that because they have a Word of Wisdom problem or because they have been dishonest or immoral—because they have not prayed for years—because of any reasons they now feel unworthy—they may say, “It’s too late, I’ve made so many mistakes—so why even try?” To these we say, “For your own sake, give yourself another chance.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p21" guid="17f06bdf-3b8f-4c91-8581-196ab7adff2d" pid="2023uJjAGUiOSgqsCqEcZA" hash="btpY_w">Sincere prayer is the heart of a happy and productive life. Prayer strengthens faith. Prayer is the preparation for miracles. Prayer opens the door to eternal happiness. The Father of us all is personal, ever waiting to hear from us, as any loving father would his children. To learn to communicate with him, to learn to pray effectively, requires diligence and dedication and desire on our part. I wonder sometimes if we are willing to pay the price for an answer from the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p22" guid="5afe2232-390f-44e5-ba0a-de11f6925b80" pid="kWsTWyyCOku6iYHsGGMV3w" hash="QCiEKQ">As we learn to develop this two-way communication, the standard of our life will improve. We will see things more clearly, we will try harder to do better, we will see the real joy that can come through trials and testing. Although problems will still be with us, peace, contentment, and true happiness will be ours in abundance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p23" guid="081b168c-82f9-4077-9629-98641be83cd8" pid="guOBX8rl0Uqo8KS5HlHA6Q" hash="0M933Q">As you feel the need to confide in the Lord or to improve the quality of your visits with him—to pray, if you please—may I suggest a process to follow: go where you can be alone, go where you can think, go where you can kneel, go where you can speak out loud to him. The bedroom, the bathroom, or the closet will do. Now, picture him in your mind’s eye. Think to whom you are speaking, control your thoughts—don’t let them wander, address him as your Father and your friend. Now tell him things you really feel to tell him—not trite phrases that have little meaning, but have a sincere, heartfelt conversation with him. Confide in him, ask him for forgiveness, plead with him, enjoy him, thank him, express your love to him, and then listen for his answers. Listening is an essential part of praying. Answers from the Lord come quietly—ever so quietly. In fact, few hear his answers audibly with their ears. We must be listening so carefully or we will never recognize them. Most answers from the Lord are felt in our heart as a warm comfortable expression, or they may come as thoughts to our mind. They come to those who are prepared and who are patient.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p24" guid="1857239f-f480-4b68-8f52-650824b319f4" pid="AUHhiXygjE2VvhBv0lQGjg" hash="-cc0oQ">Yes, the trials will still be there; but with the companionship of the Spirit, our approach to trials will change frustrations and heartaches to blessings.</p>

Forget the trials you now have. Remember back to those trials you had last year, five years ago, ten years ago. What did you gain? What did you learn? Aren’t you better prepared now because of them?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/adversity-and-prayer.p26" guid="fb89de0b-951b-4189-9de1-06bdfd453e6a" pid="ptm-VYSlWUS7Wih8Pkfzfg" hash="Icgggw">I testify he is ready and waiting to help us. For our own good we must take the first step and this step is prayer. I know he lives, brothers and sisters, I know Jesus is the Christ. I know he established his church here for our blessing. I know his mouthpiece is before us this morning, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

The story was titled “The Evolution of a Delinquent.” After rehearsing the many serious involvements the boy had had with the law, the reporter posed the question, “What twisted paths of childhood lead to the tortuous road of delinquency?” Interviews with the boy’s neighbors began to supply at least part of the answer.</p>

As the little boy held on to her hand, she asked, “Why do you always come running to our house when you come home from the nursery?” The tot replied sorrowfully, “Because there is no mommy at my house.”</p>

There was a mommy at his house and a father also, but many times the children were left at home alone to care for themselves. Often the children would go to the neighbors’ homes because there was not light and companionship at their own home. They were afraid of the dark. This was not just a darkness that fades with the morning sunlight. You see, there is a darkness that comes when there is no mother there.</p>

McKay put it beautifully when he said, speaking of mothers, “This ability and willingness properly to rear children, the gift to love, and eagerness, yes, longing to express it in soul development, make motherhood the noblest office or calling in the world. She who can paint a masterpiece or write a book that will influence millions deserves the admiration and the plaudits of mankind; but she who rears successfully a family of healthy, beautiful sons and daughters, whose influence will be felt through generations to come, whose immortal souls will exert an influence throughout the ages long after paintings shall have faded, and books and statues shall have decayed or shall have been destroyed, deserves the highest honor that man can give, and the choicest blessings of God. In her high duty and service to humanity, endowing with immortality eternal spirits, she is co-partner with the Creator himself.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Ideals,</span> Salt Lake City: <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era, </span>1953, pp. 453–54.)</p>

Satan, that master of deceit, would have us believe that when we have problems with our children, the answer may be a nicer home in a finer neighborhood, that they might have their own bedroom, or better quality clothes, and maybe their own car. Satan would have us believe that money or the things money can buy are more important in the home than mother.</p>

Fathers and mothers, before you decide you need a second income and that mother must go to work out of the home, may I plead with you: first go to the Lord in prayer and receive his divine approbation. Be sure he says yes. Mothers with children and teenagers at home, before you go out of your homes to work, please <span class="emphasis">count the cost</span> as carefully as you count the profit. Earning a few dollars more for luxuries cloaked in the masquerade of necessity—or a so-called opportunity for self-development of talents in the business world, a chance to get away from the mundane responsibilities of the home—these are all satanic substitutes for clear thinking. They are counterfeit thoughts that subvert the responsibilities of motherhood. As you count the costs of mother working out of the home, please consider the following:</p>

Far better for a boy or girl to go to school in last year’s shirts or hand-me-down dresses that are clean even though not in the height of fashion and come home to find mother there, than for a boy or girl to go to school in finer and newer clothes and come home to a new TV or a baby-sitter because Mother is away working.</p>

I’ve noticed there are always those of your number who have an unusual sense of dedication, who will do whatever is necessary in order to be true to the trust placed in them as sons of God, who will do whatever they need to do to bear his name in honor and dignity, to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to be the example he would be, to act as he would act.</p>

We were about to conclude a Saturday afternoon meeting with the stake presidency when a knock came at the office door. The president opened it, and I saw a hand give an envelope to him. It had my name on it. The letter inside introduced me to a young man who needed an interview in order to be accepted as a missionary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/as-a-beacon-on-a-hill.p3" pid="EDEhNE-fu0mdbibhO-nYXw" hash="J0t5Hg">As soon as our meeting with the stake presidency was concluded, I excused them and invited the young man in. His initial appearance shocked me. I couldn’t believe he was being recommended to go out and serve as a missionary. His clothes were somewhat wrinkled; he needed a shave; he reeked with tobacco smoke; he even had some sort of paperback book rolled up in his hands. What could he offer in the service of the Master, I thought.</p>

As I looked into his eyes, I was electrified. He was different. He was special, in spite of his outward appearance. As we sat down he told me his story. He first excused himself for appearing to be untidy and in a hurry. He said he had just gotten off the bus after a 13-hour ride from his home and, if I didn’t mind, he hoped he would be able to be back on the bus in another hour for another 13-hour ride to his home.</p>

I knew now why his clothes were wrinkled and why he needed a shave. I knew the tobacco smoke was not of his choosing, but from the close confinement in the bus. I made another observation. That paperback book in his hand was the Book of Mormon—well read, well used, a priceless possession. He went on to say that three years ago he had joined the Church because of his association with our young people. He said they were different. His parents had given him permission if he wanted to, but warned that if he did, he would no longer have a bed in their home. He could no longer live with them as their son.</p>

The young man didn’t. He moved in with friends. He told me that for the past three years he had been working and going to school. He said he had saved over $2,000 to keep himself on a mission. Please, could he go, he said; he wanted to more than anything in the world. The impression of the Spirit said yes, and he’s now part of the army of 18,000 stalwarts who are out covering the earth as servants of the Master.</p>

You meet him at every turn. He is the one who says no when others say yes to movies on Sunday, to R- or X-rated shows at any time (he knows he must not fall to this temptation). He’s the one who says no to immoral books or magazines or pictures or stories at any time. He says no to fishing or swimming or boating on Sunday. He’s the one who says no when others say, “Just try it,” to a beer or a cigarette—even if it’s just one. This courageous warrior is also the one who says yes when others say no to priesthood meeting Sunday morning, to sacrament meeting, to tithe paying, to prayers each day, to seminary or institute classes. This stalwart young man is one who says yes when others say no to a mission.</p>

Several appropriate parties were planned for the graduates. However, there was one party that sort of sneaked into the lineup that was wrong. It was bad. In this case several shows of an immoral nature had been planned at a local residence. Not knowing beforehand the nature of the movies, a group of unsuspecting Latter-day Saint young people went to the home for the party. As soon as the film started to run and its vulgar message came to the screen, part of the Latter-day Saint young people got up and left, while others of the same group stayed in the home.</p>

They told them of the nature of the show and recommended that they not go in. Part of this group then turned and left also; however, a few of the weak went into the home, there to have their minds saturated and polluted by the power of Satan. Yes, there are those who will do whatever they need to do to be right with the Lord, to do right. There are those who really believe that holding the priesthood is special, important, something really worth honoring.</p>

And I say this, knowing it isn’t easy to be made fun of and to be laughed at when you do what is right. Many times it isn’t the popular thing to do to go against the crowd or to do differently than one or two friends. May the Lord bless and strengthen you young brethren as you meet this challenge.</p>

Brethren, there are those among you who make no excuses for doing what they should, who find a way to spend their prime time in Church service with the young people of their ward or branch. You will notice as we do, because of their personal involvement, that their young people have a very special spirit about them, a spiritual alertness, and a strength that will easily compare to Helaman’s 2,000 stripling Ammonite sons. We see them often in the many stakes of the Church each weekend.</p>

We call it home teaching—the priesthood in action.</p>

It’s interesting to observe his actions too. He hasn’t released his counselor or the high council brethren from their efforts as he assumes the chairmanship of this committee, but rather he now takes a more personal interest in the committee work.

Our authority is limited to doing it the way he would—to be the kind of deacons president the Master would be; to be the kind of teacher the Master would be; as a priest, to prepare for a mission the way he would; to strive to be the kind of elders quorum president, bishop or counselor or stake president the Savior would be if he had that office and calling and responsibility.</p>

He came from what we commonly refer to as a good family, but his parents seemed to take the heart of the gospel for granted. They were willing to attend most of their meetings on Sunday, if it was convenient. They were warm people and friendly—always receptive to the brethren and sisters who came to their home. But I doubt if they had family prayer very often, and I’m sure family home evening was something occasionally discussed but seldom experienced. With no real personal attention, the children were allowed to come and go as they pleased.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p2" pid="d8K-kG0r9k2Mwpn40DRq8w" hash="IqPWqw">On one occasion my young friend told me he was sure that his parents loved him, but, oh, how he wished they cared about him! You know, to a young person there can be a difference. He said he wished just once as he went out the door they would ask him where he was going and when he would be home. He wanted them to give him some guidelines. He confessed that he wasn’t always sure of the judgments that were left to him. If only they had cared enough.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p3" pid="ICJPWzgcCUi9laG8lo487Q" hash="sCNANQ">Now, years later, the offspring of this family have experienced the birth of illegitimate children, divorce in their own marriages, runaways, drug addiction, and most everything else that can be tragic in our lives.</p>

As we read the newspapers, we become justifiably concerned over what is happening around us. There is a growing concern among our people as we see the prophecies of times past being unfolded before our very eyes. Some have a feeling of frustration, anxiety, anger, and yes, even fear. But remember that Paul, in his letters to Timothy, counseled: “For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 1:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p5" pid="chXnHYm9VUWtw35ypFfqFA" hash="a-lqmA">May I suggest that the steps we can take to dispel fear and bring peace and power are really very simple. The teachings of the gospel are not complicated. They are not hard to understand. They need not be confusing. Let us not be blinded by the craftiness of men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p6" pid="d7Vy4e-fmkSfalbbTamnUA" hash="tcNkMg">Nephi once said that because of the simpleness of the way or the easiness of it, there were many who perished. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.41" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:41</a>.) Jacob put it another way when he said that they became blinded because they were continually looking beyond the mark in their search for answers. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.14" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:14</a>.) They didn’t believe in the simplicity of the gospel teachings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p7" pid="BWJbxsUucEWBwiUFyLivcQ" hash="EtvscA">Yes, it is true that a family beset with trials and concerns seems to be the constant pattern of our mortal existence. However true this fact may be, it need not—it must not—have an adverse influence in our lives. Children are saved and families are exalted by participating in some very simple gospel experiences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p8" pid="kmjbkeYx60-xUZPkUvyVBA" hash="7ZH0OA">Let us listen to the reassuring words of the Lord as we try to analyze what we can do. He said:</p>

This is the main purpose for which the Lord established the organization of the family and home—that therein we might teach each other, especially the little children, to love the Savior and understand and live his teachings. As you consider the importance of teaching your little ones, have you ever thought in depth on the following scriptural passage?</p>

We read in Deuteronomy 6:6–7 [<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/6.6-7" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 6:6–7</a>], “And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p20" pid="GThM0T7pz02SGcbrKX7PYQ" hash="SH2Lrg">“And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p21" pid="qgtaJyn4-EunQ2E856GboA" hash="nk8CZQ">As I have traveled to the stakes of the Church, I have found many dedicated parents who gather their families about them daily to study the revelations of the Lord as recorded in the holy scriptures. I remember one family of 12 children who studied together daily in two groups, one for the older children and another for the younger children in their family. Think of the time and effort this has taken over the years. Think how the blessings to this family have multiplied, as many of their children have now reached adulthood and are raising young families of their own.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p22" pid="oZXiWNo4HUOLjTtgacGnYw" hash="lYz65w">I was in another home where ten children, all young, were given a daily treat of the scriptures. I know of a mother, alone, with four children. She has them get ready early for bed and reads to them from the scriptures before they go to sleep each night. What a blessing for thoughtful parents to shower on their most important responsibility, their little ones. There shouldn’t be—there mustn’t be—one family in this Church that doesn’t take the time to read from the scriptures every day. Every family can do it in their own way. I have a testimony of this.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p23" pid="t95zghNpO0WRZ1wrj0Et_Q" hash="qk5AAQ">May I relate a personal experience from the Peterson family. Several years ago after wrestling with the problem for some time, my wife and I, sensing the urgency of our parental charge, devised a new battle plan. You see, up to that point, Satan had been winning the battle of “Should we or should we not read the scriptures together in the Peterson home?” We had tried off and on for years with no sustained success. Our big problem was that someone or something always interrupted our schedule. With a 17-year spread in our children’s ages, we felt we had a special challenge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p24" pid="GjUhDzwptk2KEyJ3aWr2kQ" hash="uNS8Ew">As we studied and prayed over it, we concluded that the best time for our family of girls to read would be when no one else wanted our time. Since the older girls had to be in seminary by 7:00 <small>A.M.</small>, our controllable time had to be early. We decided on 6:15 in the morning. We knew it would be a challenge to get teenage support. The idea was good, but its implementation was most difficult and it still is. Our family is still struggling.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p25" pid="eD5fidFXGUyXV0jhIgszhg" hash="dJgY2A">Our great new plan had its birth one hot August day in Phoenix, Arizona. My wife suggested we give them a whole month to think about it and prepare for it. We went about their mental preparation in a very positive way. The plan was to start the first day of school in early September. To their protests that it was impossible to have their heads all filled with rollers in time, or that it was not likely they would feel happy so early in the morning, or that they might be late to seminary, or not have time to eat breakfast either, we replied very cheerfully that we knew they were clever enough to cope with any minor problems that might arise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p26" pid="Ubzt0wGunkuTI4a9sMiIGg" hash="fgvvvw">At its announcement, we also told the girls we had been praying for guidance in this family problem. This made it easier, because they had been schooled in prayer and had been taught not to question its results.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p27" pid="GKcYXsVFKk-lEl_GtdQPag" hash="kPflvA">The historic first morning finally came. My wife and I got up a little early so we would be sure to be wide awake and happy. Our initial approach must meet with success. We entered each bedroom singing and happy at the thought of the prospects before us. Purposely we went to one special bedroom first. Here slept a daughter who would be able to get up early but who couldn’t wake up before noon. We sat her up in bed and then went to the others and started them all into the family room. Some stumbled, some fell, some had to be carried in, some slept through that first morning—and I might say through subsequent mornings too.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p28" pid="PjVkS2kl_kO5JF7qqu4crQ" hash="wSaIAw">Little by little, we have learned over the years what reading the scriptures 15 minutes each morning can do for our family. You should know that we don’t try to discuss and understand each point we read. We try to pick out only a couple of thoughts each morning to digest. You should also know we still have to struggle with the plan’s performance, even though we now have only two children at our home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p29" pid="j75SCzvUBE2D0eWuOEwmzA" hash="fHJC8w">Can you imagine how a parent would feel to ask a little girl, “What did King Benjamin mean when he said, ‘When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God’?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:17</a>.) And she would respond, “I suppose he means that I shouldn’t be selfish and should do little things for my sisters because it makes Heavenly Father happy—and Daddy, I want him to be happy with me, so I’m going to try harder.” Innumerable are the blessings that will accrue to the family that persists in this noble effort of reading the scriptures together daily.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/help-for-parents.p30" pid="1aul1x7zg0GGlOLnUPGfdg" hash="OTKyLA">Remember he said, “Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:23</a>.)</p>

As in the past, efforts today in Welfare Production-Distribution are directed toward assisting priesthood officers and Relief Society leaders and the members of this worldwide church to fulfill the sacred obligation to care for the poor, the needy, the distressed, and those among us who are unable to care for themselves because of handicaps or other reasons, such as age.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p2" pid="jq7NW3Iu9ESBITAXm4JTdg" hash="M5UV3w">Now to establish a perspective I would like to begin by reviewing the mission of the Welfare Production-Distribution Department and how it relates to total Welfare Services. Its mission is to foster the economic self-sufficiency of the Saints, thereby helping to erase poverty and need from among Latter-day Saint families. This will contribute to developing a Zion society like that of Enoch. Quoting from Moses, we read: “And the Lord called his people <span class="emphasis">Z</span><small>ION</small>, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:18</a>.)</p>

All this is accomplished as fathers, mothers, and children respond to priesthood direction and prepare for the eventualities that lie ahead. Fathers receive instruction through their priesthood quorums, mothers from their husbands and through Relief Society’s program for provident living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p4" pid="YoW-AncR306rIyyMXcIK6Q" hash="1yETEA">The second focus, one which is within the framework of Church preparedness as set forth by Bishop Brown, is that of ward preparedness, wherein ward priesthood and Relief Society leaders help care for those ward members who do not have adequate means. The Welfare Production-Distribution Department has as its primary duties: (1) assisting in the development of ward preparedness by helping Church units acquire food and nonfood production projects, (2) managing the bishops storehouse system, and (3) giving direction to the Deseret Industries program, thereby making the wards, and thus the stakes and regions, as self-sustaining as possible so that they may, in fact, care for their own.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p5" pid="MuH1TPv4-EGCFKlxzhlKAA" hash="kHY3xg">To highlight this area of concern, let us look at the results of a recent survey conducted by Utah State University among LDS people in Utah. The four basic food groups were surveyed: meats, fruits and vegetables, grains, and milk products.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p6" pid="74xjkfDa4kSDcnGF72YfNQ" hash="U5bHlw">The study revealed that only about 5 percent of our Church members had a year’s supply of meat products. Only 3 percent had a year’s supply of dried or canned fruits or vegetables. Approximately 18 percent had a year’s supply of grains. In the milk group, only three families in a hundred had a year’s supply of canned or powdered milk. On the average, about 30 percent of the Church had a two-months supply of food; the remainder had little or none.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p7" pid="Q2skM35aqUmMPeT8yz32YQ" hash="F2ooQQ">These survey statistics indicate that most Church members are not prepared to meet month-to-month problems and future economic trials. Clearly, in this area of home production and storage, it is extremely important that priesthood and Relief Society leaders and all Latter-day Saints place greater emphasis on home storage—on obtaining and carefully storing a year’s supply of food, clothing, and, where possible, fuel. In the area of home production, we would hope that members would heed the admonition of the prophets and, where possible, grow a garden, sew their own clothing, make household items, and, in general, become as self-sufficient as possible to prepare against the days to come. In the words of President Kimball, “We are pleased that many people are planting gardens and fruit trees and are buying canning jars and lids. … We congratulate those families who are listening and doing.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p9" pid="dEawCrRj202YhWeo34hclw" hash="-Mb7Ug">Let us shift our focus now from family preparedness to ward preparedness, which includes production projects.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p10" pid="yZNaSvLhtkik8E5hcJr_Vw" hash="L9lSrw">Production projects are nonprofit activities that are operated by wards, stakes, or regions for the purpose of providing food and nonfood commodities to care for the poor and the needy of the kingdom. Food projects such as farms, orchards, dairies, ranches, feed-lot operations, canneries, and bakeries, and nonfood projects such as rug-making, handicrafts, furniture making, and sewing projects also provide a few of many opportunities where those receiving assistance may work as best they can, thereby maintaining their integrity in an age when there is more and more reliance upon so-called “free” government assistance. The projects also provide opportunities for families to learn to work together and to learn to sacrifice and to consecrate their energies to provide for those who are less fortunate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p11" pid="zPH3AcunEUmxfdlz1cjA3g" hash="AaErqA">The greatest number of Church welfare production projects were established in the 1940s. There followed a period of consolidation during the ‘50s and the ‘60s. In recent years, priesthood leaders have become increasingly conscious of the need for every ward to be involved in welfare production projects, and so we have seen the number of Church projects increase until today we have 671 of them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p12" pid="N1zVY0mv4UemPSi1BmjtuQ" hash="-c0e4g">Perhaps equally as significant as the number of projects are the acres under cultivation. We now have 143,000 acres in production. We are following the Savior’s counsel to provide food for our poor and needy brothers and sisters. This acreage is only sufficient to meet the current requirements to care for the poor and the needy in areas served by commodity storehouses. Under more difficult circumstances, at current levels of consumption, our food production projects will not be able to meet the needs of those who require assistance. Therefore, family preparedness, with home production and storage, must be the way the majority of our families take care of themselves. Ward preparedness, which means ward involvement in ward, stake, and multistake production projects, is only a back-up system for assisting those who are unable to care for themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p13" pid="oqeq7T9C-Eenh2K1QH2fVQ" hash="j-86Bg">We have considerable work to do before we reach full ward preparedness, however. We have approximately 5,000 wards worldwide. Only 54 percent of these wards are involved in production projects on either a ward, stake, or regional level. Bishops and other priesthood leaders have a great challenge as they seek to involve all wards in production projects.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p14" pid="L64oZoIYD0SdKDE_bwgR_w" hash="Vdn1Bw">In summary, with regard to production projects, the Church is (1) maintaining sufficient production capacity to assist the poor and the needy under the current usage level; (2) fostering more production projects so that every ward will have access to and be involved in a project; and (3) encouraging families and each Church unit to be as self-sufficient as possible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p15" pid="JMoXddFzcUyVujrsQo2X7w" hash="hwBcWw">In the last several years, the amount given in fast offerings increased about 15 percent a year over previous years. In response to the call of priesthood leaders, 1975 fast offering donations are up 47 percent over a similar eight-month period last year. You leaders might check the progress of your own units. It is our hope that this trend will continue and that our members everywhere will be encouraged to increase their fast offerings manyfold. Of fast offerings, President Kimball has said, “I think that when we are affluent, as many of us are, that we ought to be more generous. Instead of the amount saved by our two or more meals of fasting, perhaps much more—seven times more [should be given]—when we are in a position to do it.” (Filmstrip: <span class="emphasis">Principles of Welfare Services, “… in Mine Own Way.”</span>)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p16" pid="mBOCZ6GWcEu4mE_9DFRISQ" hash="QWvUHQ">From fast offerings and the Commodity Production Budget, certain reserves of both commodities and fuel have been established to meet the needs of the poor and needy among us. We have on hand one year’s supply of commodities in the distribution system for the poor and the needy. However, this supply would be quickly depleted by a major increase in demand. This fact further underscores the need for family preparedness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p17" pid="VLN6FFScUkmt1gNIyc9ffA" hash="6Nj56w">On another front, there is cause for alarm. It is right to care for the poor and the needy. It is wrong to give them something if they do not work for it to the extent of their ability. To provide a family with assistance without expecting them to work to the extent of their ability for what they receive is not the Lord’s way. Those who accept something for nothing lose their integrity and their self-respect, for they become parasites, living from the work and the efforts of others. The Lord has been firm in his instructions on this point. Everyone, both young and old, who receives assistance should work to the extent of his or her ability.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p18" pid="ml4RGEuYhEq-l6mOGxYy2Q" hash="Yw9UkA">Yet, the statistics show that only about 25 percent of those families receiving assistance are working for what they receive. We feel that at least 75 percent of the families who receive assistance should be working in some measure for what they receive, in order to maintain their spiritual strength and earn the welfare assistance received. About 25 percent of those receiving help are not in a position to work, although perhaps even they could do something if priesthood leaders made creative and inspired efforts to find the service that could be done. The spiritual strength of God’s children is destroyed when the program is not followed as the Lord has outlined it. Our people need to work for what they receive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p19" pid="yDToHfNNEUKVGn_s7y5k2w" hash="4Zon9A">In summary, with respect to the distribution system, the Church is seeking to maintain reserve levels as indicated, to expand the number and accessibility of our physical bishops storehouses, and to encourage bishops and other priesthood leaders to see that those assisted work to the extent of their ability.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p20" pid="I6SZ1jsUnkGxOQ3kdXavlQ" hash="tVu-5A">Regarding Deseret Industries, there are at present thirteen units in operation. The main purpose of Deseret Industries is to assist our handicapped and our elderly brothers and sisters by providing them with honorable employment. In Deseret Industries, the individual’s labors are fitted to his capacity for labor.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-welfare-production-distribution-department.p21" pid="8wvI4890YEKknBtNn7mzpg" hash="Fin3OA">Here, are found some of the happiest, kindest, and most serene people on the face of the earth.

Deseret Industries “helps people help themselves.” All members who can are encouraged to shop, to buy, to donate, to help the Deseret Industries program accomplish its vital mission.</p>

I imagine this is the greatest assemblage of the priesthood in this dispensation. I’ve wrestled with a way to deliver to you a message I think is of utmost importance and of vital concern to all of our Father’s children. I have prayed and do now pray for his Spirit to attend us. I testify to you that what I will say is truth, its preparation having been prompted by the Spirit. May your hearts be open and your spirits receptive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/priesthood-authority-and-power.p4" pid="sDcnWbIKjE-1tgnqaVU6Iw" hash="9-K2BQ">Spiritual growth, and the happiness resulting therefrom, is based on an understanding of and obedience to priesthood principles. I believe there are many whose lives are clouded with unhappiness because we priesthood brethren have not listened as attentively as we should to the warning voice of the Lord. As he tells the brethren, there are dangers when we misuse the priesthood. We have all read the following revelation many times. May I read it again and in the process relate it to the daily conduct of our lives? Quoting from the Doctrine and Covenants:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/priesthood-authority-and-power.p5" pid="1Jr7SiJA8EyFVxzZrjG8vg" hash="byoPIA">“Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/priesthood-authority-and-power.p7" pid="cSdFeAaHmUiVsVoIX1rrVQ" hash="ujiU5A">“That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.34-36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:34–36</a>.)</p>

Power and authority in the priesthood are not necessarily synonymous. All of us who hold the priesthood have the authority to act for the Lord, but the effectiveness of our authority—or if you please, the power that comes through that authority—depends on the pattern of our lives; it depends on our righteousness. Note again, “The powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/priesthood-authority-and-power.p9" pid="-LDR4cHNfUGG_YDXvojrWw" hash="gNmLlA">May I suggest that many of us have lost sight of one of the most important reasons for our holding the priesthood. To be an effective teachers quorum president, elders quorum president, bishop, or counselor is important—we spend many hours in training these officers. To perform the vital priesthood ordinances is essential. But even more important than all these is the need to learn how to use the priesthood to bless our families and homes.</p>

Ours can be a power that will bless and comfort little children, that will bring sleep to tear-stained eyes in the wee hours of the morning. Ours can be the power that will bring happiness to a family home evening, the power to calm the unsettled nerves of a tired wife. Ours can be the power that will give direction to a confused and vulnerable teenager. Ours, the power to bless a daughter before she goes on her first date or before her temple marriage, or to bless a son before his departure for a mission or college. Ours, my young brethren, can be the power to stop evil thoughts of a group of boys gathered together in vulgar conversation. Ours can be the power to heal the sick and comfort the lonely. These are some of the important purposes of the priesthood.</p>

He who has developed the power and uses it to do the things we have mentioned will honestly consider the righteous desires of his family, even though they may not be exactly the same as his. He will listen to those in his home with the same attention he would give a priesthood leader. He will listen—even to the smallest child.</p>

Elder John A. Widtsoe said, “The Priesthood is not bestowed on the basis of mental power but is given to good men. … Woman has her gift of equal magnitude. … A wiser power than any on earth understands why a spirit in the far off beginning was male or female.” (John A. Widtsoe, <span class="emphasis">Priesthood and Church Government,</span> Deseret Book Co., 1954, p. 90.)</p>

However, by the very nature of some of the things we do, we imply this. The fact that a man holds the priesthood and is the presiding officer in the home, as well as in Church organizations, does not in any way make him a superior being. The priesthood is a divinely given authority and responsibility which will receive its ultimate fulfillment only when there is a devoted and happy wife at his side. Note “happy” is the description of the wife.</p>

Women have a spirit and mental ability that is absolutely essential in strengthening the family relationship. It must be nurtured, however, and drawn upon by the presiding priesthood authority in that home. We should be gladdened, not threatened, by our wives’ good qualities. Elder Neal A. Maxwell once said, “I am grateful for [my wife’s] traits and qualities that excel my own in some critical dimensions of our partnership.” (BYU Twelve-Stake Fireside, Jan. 4, 1976.)</p>

We need only refer to the experience of the 2,000 Ammonite sons of Helaman for an insight into one measure of the capacity of the women. I quote from Alma:</p>

Many others might have been mentioned—mothers were. The fact that mothers are one of the keys and secrets to the strength of the Aaronic Priesthood would lead me to believe that more time must be spent by priesthood leaders in training girls in proper priesthood principles, that future Aaronic Priesthood generations might be as blessed as were Helaman’s 2,000 sons.</p>

This must continue. However, only a small fraction of this effort is put into the priesthood education and spiritual development of the girls. How can we expect in them as fine a product if we do not give them an increase in attention? Unless girls have had a model and know what priesthood qualities to look for in an eternal companion, the consequences may be that many families in generations to come will suffer because of wrong marriage choices. This need not be if priesthood brethren will be the appropriate models and give more earnest understanding and energy to the training of the girls.</p>

Bishop Brown has outlined for us some important points—some of the elements of family preparedness and Church preparedness. I would like to discuss with you the Church employment system, which is just one part of Church preparedness. May I emphasize that we shall review familiar ideas this morning. This is not new, but it does need strong reemphasis.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p2" pid="xAoKm4EieEat8qkKpurNdA" hash="u5SLTg">Earning our own way and sustaining ourselves has been the way of life since Adam and Eve were instructed as they left the Garden of Eden, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 3:19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p3" pid="Ves-s4Re5kiYNny2p3hK7g" hash="mvR-aw">You and I as parents and leaders have a God-given opportunity to teach our children this great eternal principle. Along with the principle of honest and honorable work is the principle of self-reliance—not stubborn, arrogant independence, but humble yet strong self-respect and personal responsibility for ourselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p4" pid="-0lNN_Xy3kO40ZUbkyZy4Q" hash="5G1XLQ">Now, while much of the responsibility for teaching these correct principles rests with the quorums of the priesthood, the primary responsibility for caring for ourselves rests with each of us and our families. We who are Welfare Services workers must never forget that our primary objective and the work of the priesthood is to help people to help themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p5" pid="EGmfdi8_0EylGb8MhcjXzw" hash="oxOqwQ">When a ward member becomes unemployed or when he is underemployed, it is his responsibility to find new employment. Obviously, he will need to be taught and encouraged how to do this by his priesthood leaders. Many do not know the steps to take in finding or improving their employment situation and will need the help of their quorum leaders. The individual needs to search intelligently and persistently by reviewing job listings in newspapers, by visiting employment centers, by sending out resumés, by contacting relatives and friends, and by using whatever other honorable means may be available.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p6" pid="ImbfYqoxDkSBUyY1_ZFjvw" hash="_9Pi7A">As a member seeks employment, he should appropriately call on the resources of his entire family. This would include brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, parents—everyone. What a tremendous opportunity for strengthening the bonds of family relationships as the family rallies to help one of their own! A strong, sustaining influence can be given during these discouraging times by family members who exhibit genuine and active concern for each other.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p7" pid="9Srt9WRAXEigH32fgC4orw" hash="y0QVuA">There are times when neither an individual nor his family is able to do all that is necessary to find employment. In this case, the Church employment system should be ready to help the member work out his problem. Very simply stated, the purpose of the employment system is to help qualified individuals find appropriate job opportunities as quickly as possible—or in even simpler terms, to get the right person in the right spot at the right time—usually the sooner the better!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p8" pid="SsDH3YdaJkCiwmsHVTa28Q" hash="4yx6oA">There are four parts of the employment system I would like to mention this morning. First and foremost, the priesthood quorum; second, the ward welfare services committee and appropriate resource people; third, a stake employment resource person; and fourth, a Church Employment Center. Let me emphasize once again that these components come into play only after an individual and his family, with proper training by priesthood leaders and home teachers, have done what they can to solve the problem.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p9" pid="HUVMf4FKeUWORRRG2JQ2eA" hash="YTNyTA">The priesthood quorum is the key to the success of the whole employment program—not the paper quorum on a theoretical chart, but a group of men, active in behalf and support of one of their brothers. Quoting from the <span class="emphasis">Welfare Services Handbook:</span> “Quorum leaders and home teachers should watch for signs of impending economic trouble such as excessive spending, business decline, inadequate education for the present or future employment situation, and other indications of potential economic stress.” (<span class="emphasis">Welfare Services Handbook,</span> p. 14.) They should constantly be on guard to help their assigned families when these types of circumstances appear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p10" pid="1AizsgDrNU-oC2UYcubIQg" hash="WeL-Tw">When a home teacher observes a need for employment or upgrading employment, this could be reported immediately and confidentially to the quorum president or group leader. In the quorum meeting, a very simple but effective way for quorum leaders to gather specific information is to label two columns on the silent roll each Sunday—one labeled “Do you know anyone who needs a job?” and the other, “Do you know of any job openings?” Whenever a home teacher or quorum member marks “yes” to either question, the quorum secretary should make sure the quorum leader receives the information that same day. The quorum leader should immediately contact the individual who reported the information for more specific details. Employment opportunities and needs are perishable commodities. Many may not survive longer than twenty-four or forty-eight hours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p11" pid="hT8_4i-klEamBQIC2wQ95g" hash="BtXiyA">The handbook further instructs us that quorums “should assist in job retraining or vocational upgrading by recommending trade schools, apprenticeships, and on-the-job training as needed. … The collective knowledge, skills, and efforts of the quorum will usually contribute to the solution of an economic problem.” (<span class="emphasis">Welfare Services Handbook,</span> p. 14.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p12" pid="_x7XCKVVYEace_X_Vda2Cw" hash="iuWEEQ">When the quorum alone cannot help the member resolve his employment problem, the quorum leader and the member should then take the problem to the next step in the employment system. This is called the ward welfare services committee. If possible, the quorum leader should also come prepared with a recommended solution.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p13" pid="2ro9ceaHykmzDdbaWov9ZQ" hash="e4tJQA">The welfare services committee’s duty is to rapidly assess any job openings they know of. In many instances, the ward committee may recommend to the priesthood leader that the member with employment needs be referred to an employment resource person in the ward. Every ward in the Church should have at least one employment resource person to assist members with employment problems. If possible, this resource person should already have basic skills in areas relating to employment and should be available to work directly with individual members whenever assigned by the welfare services committee. If he does not have these skills, he should be trained either in the ward or the stake.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p14" pid="JuKrgPyidU6RZgZ1Ru-Hfg" hash="0v85BA">We have received many encouraging reports from wards that are using employment resource people. Working through priesthood leaders and home teachers, an employment resource person may assist teenagers as well as their parents in ways to prepare themselves and steps to take in developing marketable skills we all must possess. Visiting Relief Society teachers need to be alert to the employment problems of families they visit and will immediately report them to the ward Relief Society president, who in turn will bring the matter to the welfare services committee meeting or to the bishop, as the urgency of the circumstances indicate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p15" pid="ybPUJ-ILWUulqUcmFechjQ" hash="njd6pA">When ward priesthood leaders feel that additional help is needed, they turn to the third component of the employment system—a stake employment resource person who is identified by the stake presidency to supplement the work of the ward resource people and to work with employment problems and opportunities that cannot be resolved within a single ward. The stake’s process, of course, is similar to the ward’s.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p16" pid="JT7KYWttP0O7YCP5_GtAIQ" hash="hn_JGA">We would hope, brothers and sisters, that every ward and every stake would become involved in these three aspects of the employment system: first, the priesthood quorum and the Relief Society doing all they can to help their members; second, the ward welfare services committee, assisted by employment resource people, helping where they are needed; and third, stake employment resource people assisting when they are called upon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p17" pid="etFUDs_bx0iVusUTLQAp5w" hash="TfLoAg">Finally, there is a fourth part of the employment system which is now available in areas where employment needs justify it. This is the Church Employment Center. Because of the training and full-time responsibility of the managers, Church Employment Centers are able to provide a listing of as many job opportunities as possible, match an individual’s abilities to job requirements, and provide counseling concerning the person’s vocational abilities, educational opportunities, and available financial aids. This applies equally to women who must support themselves and their families. Stake and ward priesthood leaders, and especially the resource people who work under their direction, should be thoroughly familiar with the services provided by an employment center if one is available locally.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p18" pid="MGFdvKOES06UtU_LCAPKCQ" hash="OR7Sqw">If any of you priesthood leaders here this morning do not have access to an employment center, but feel the need for one, or if you simply want to have more information, please have your stake president contact the Personal Welfare Services Department here at Church headquarters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-church-employment-system.p19" pid="rnqDVAbXHkyffvYfo4B2qQ" hash="7rY6Fg">Now, brothers and sisters, we challenge you to return to your people and make this employment program work. If you do, it has the capacity of blessing the lives of the Saints of all ages. Specifically, you can begin right now—</p>

It should be the right kind of project—one which will provide needed commodities for your bishops storehouse—thus assisting the area served by the storehouse to be self-sufficient in its ability to care for the poor and the needy. If your wards are already involved in a production project either on a ward or stake basis, be sure that ward members have opportunities to participate fully and that the project is operated as it should be. As you know, projects may be organized on either a ward, multiward, or stake basis. The key to this challenge is, of course, to accomplish this task during your time in office.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/acquiring-and-managing-production-projects.p2" pid="EzQVJ3OY1kCVm-6d61sGwA" hash="8sdfJA">My purpose this morning is to offer ideas on how you can meet the challenge. To do this, let’s put production projects in their proper perspective by answering some basic questions. First, how are the poor, the needy, and the distressed cared for in the Church? In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord says the following:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/acquiring-and-managing-production-projects.p3" pid="G05CSDAJjUqCUQLjuINICg" hash="iPlO7A">“All children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/acquiring-and-managing-production-projects.p4" pid="f_NjzAoFLkyFPmRn4vAWkw" hash="zUFXrQ">“And after that, they have claim upon the church, or in other words upon the Lord’s storehouse, if their parents have not wherewith to give them inheritances.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/83.4-5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 83:4–5</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/acquiring-and-managing-production-projects.p5" pid="cMkuJ4giFEGk0_rcAuBPMg" hash="ydzhJw">When an individual cannot care for himself, his family should provide every assistance possible; and when the family of the needy person has done <span class="emphasis">all it can do</span> to provide money or commodities, the bishop is empowered to assist. According to the <span class="emphasis">Welfare Services Handbook,</span> the bishop of each ward has “the sole mandate to care for, and the sole discretion in caring for the poor [and needy] of the Church. … It is his duty and his only to determine to whom, when, how and how much shall be given to any member of his ward from Church funds [or commodities] … . This is his high and solemn obligation imposed by the Lord Himself. Whoever and whatever the help he calls in to assist him to perform this service, he is still responsible.” (<span class="emphasis">Welfare Services Handbook,</span> p. 6.) Bishops must remember that they are under sacred obligation to follow the whole welfare services program of the Church as it relates to serving the poor and the needy. One of the key elements that is too often overlooked is the vital need for everyone in the program to work to the extent of his ability. Priesthood leaders who understand will not forget this basic principle. Souls can be destroyed when getting is not a partner with giving.</p>

They come from fast offerings to meet cash needs and from the storehouses to meet commodity needs.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/acquiring-and-managing-production-projects.p7" pid="VNk2awYFn0WxcA8FWdXgDQ" hash="0r9MNg">Regarding fast offerings, we learned recently that some members of the Church are unsure as to how they may help financially. May we reaffirm that the way members may contribute money to the Church to care for those in need is to pay a generous fast offering. In the words of President Kimball: “I think that when we are affluent, as many of us are, that we ought to be more generous. Instead of the amount saved by our two or more meals of fasting, perhaps much more—seven times more [should be given]—when we are in a position to do it.” (Filmstrip, <span class="emphasis">Principles of Welfare Services … “In Mine Own Way.”</span>) Certainly every faithful member will respond generously to this call from the Lord’s anointed prophet.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/acquiring-and-managing-production-projects.p8" pid="enw80TNeOE69WzEkMqp0CA" hash="-mCylQ">Third, where do storehouses get their commodities to fill bishops’ orders? Through welfare donations and through volunteer work on production projects, members help produce food and nonfood commodities to be placed in bishops storehouses throughout the Church. A storehouse should be available to each bishop so that he may, via a bishop’s order form, issue commodities to help those in need. As a matter of policy, where storehouses are available the bishop should use commodities first before using fast offering funds. By so doing our production base is then properly maintained and utilized; the cost to the Church is generally less when commodities from projects are used instead of fast offering funds to buy from retail stores; and finally, we remain independent from commercial supply, which cannot always be assured.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/acquiring-and-managing-production-projects.p9" pid="lDLjk6s4XESc0sDNfsi6Jg" hash="CQ1fyA">Next, what are the basic purposes of production projects? First of all, to provide food and nonfood commodities for the poor and the needy. Second, to give members a chance to share part of their abundance with others by generously contributing money and labor. Third, to efficiently produce enough commodities or cash to fill the assigned commodity production budget and to meet annual operating costs. Fourth, to provide work opportunities for those who receive Church assistance. Fifth, to promote local production self-sufficiency so that we can care for the needy. Sixth, to provide land reserves, trained and experienced managers and workers, and if possible a year’s supply of seed, fertilizer, fuel, feed, and so forth, so that additional commodities could be available if needed in the future to help those in need. Seventh, to provide individuals, families, and quorums with experiences in brotherhood and in the production of basic foods. And eighth, to provide for the community a model of efficient management and operation so that projects are successful and reflect a positive image of the Church.</p>

				<p pid="e2XAyo4tk0yhqm1TZI3U_A" hash="V8WcsQ">Finally, how can a ward or stake acquire a production project? Regarding the need for involvement in or improvement of a production project, the bishop or stake president should assign his counselor responsible for production to study the matter fully. The assigned counselor should work with the Relief Society counselor who is assigned to represent the Relief Society presidency in production matters. It may also be appropriate to obtain help from a resource person, such as an agriculturalist whose background and experience qualify him to assist in developing the project proposal or a businessman who could assist with a feasibility study. The proposal should conform to the purposes of production projects as herein outlined. The following considerations should be attended to:</p>

While welfare production projects are entirely owned (100 percent) by the local unit, loans are available, when necessary, from the General Welfare Services Committee for acquisition of the project, and, as necessary for operation, capital improvements and expansion. Acquisition loans can be obtained for up to 75 percent of the purchase price of the project. Loan repayment is determined on a case-by-case basis, not to exceed five years. Please remember that the acquisition cost is <span class="emphasis">not</span> to be met from project income, but rather from member contributions. These contributions represent one of the ways by which we live our covenant of consecration.</p>

In many instances, it is impossible to forecast this and therefore difficult to meet such a commitment. <span class="emphasis">It is a far better approach for priesthood leaders to recognize that contributing to welfare is a part of the law of sacrifice and that consecration is a never-ending process.</span> With the growth of the Church and the need to expand and upgrade welfare projects, it is far better to teach members that there will be a continuing opportunity to contribute to the welfare program. Priesthood leaders should read the handbook and teach the principles as outlined therein. If our people are taught these and related principles, they feel the redeeming power of contributing and caring for their fellow-beings according to their covenants. They feel the power that comes from imparting of their substance to care for the poor and the needy in the Lord’s way.

We are not running experimental farms. We should not be involved in unproven and untested methods. Often projects get into financial trouble when they move from basic food production into such things as exotic breeds, unproven varieties of crops, new and untested technology. Our projects should stay with proven crops and livestock production programs. Let us keep in mind that we are in the business of producing food. In the words of President Kimball, “Let us become efficient in our production operations, so that we don’t merely go through the motions of having welfare farms. The time will come when we will need all the products and more from our projects—even more than we do now.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1976, p. 125.)</p>

The President has further said, “Do what you can to make our projects economically viable, so that we don’t rationalize that the welfare project is good simply because it gets men together. Even though it is good for the priesthood to labor side by side, we can have the brotherhood of labor <span class="emphasis">and</span> the economic efficiency too.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1976, pp. 125–26; italics added.)</p>

			<div class="figure" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/acquiring-and-managing-production-projects.f3">
				<ol class="number">
					<li pid="8XcDssoUcUm0Q1655Pt2nQ" hash="jVHakQ">
						<span class="label">1.</span>
						<p pid="gZVIQTXWYUeMs59TQhRIHA" hash="kasR_g">
							<span class="emphasis">Organization.</span> Establish a competent committee with a chairman and representation from all units who own the project. When necessary, appoint a qualified manager to operate the project. Committee members should have the sound doctrinal, technical, and practical experience necessary to carry out their responsibilities. This committee should be as permanent as possible to ensure continuity of management. In general, the chairman should have the responsibility for day-to-day decision making. The committee function is similar to that of a board of directors. The manager, if one is hired, should spend the majority of his time in basic production activities that will produce food commodities.</p>
					</li>
					<li pid="H5dCctCuFUe0_uonnRntlQ" hash="2Oq70Q">
						<span class="label">2.</span>
						<p pid="llcDx6Xsk02xEepYlts6zA" hash="qYDYQg">
							<span class="emphasis">Planning.</span> Develop and follow a yearly operational plan and budget. An operational plan should detail what, when, why, and how commodities are to be produced and marketed. It will indicate when and how much operating capital will be needed and how and when it can be repaid if borrowed. A carefully prepared and followed plan ensures that your project is economically and operationally sound and efficiently operated.</p>
					</li>
					<li pid="bST9iNaGm0CNMpLndh22UA" hash="OxSo8w">
						<span class="label">3.</span>
						<p pid="QLuOpN2my0qPpQ6IX6KrdQ" hash="hWVa1A">
							<span class="emphasis">Operations.</span> It is critical for the success of agricultural projects that things be done on time. Sound management practices and proven technology are required in today’s agriculture. There is a time to plant and there is a time to harvest. Wise planning and diligent, consistent follow-through will help make each project successful. Again, stay with proven local agricultural projects.</p>
					</li>
					<li pid="PCmARBwAlEiUTVZI4xYfYQ" hash="NU2YwQ">
						<span class="label">4.</span>
						<p pid="NCU8b5ual0mEn6rE6PwBZA" hash="K5Vmrw">
							<span class="emphasis">Records.</span> Appoint a competent financial clerk to maintain accurate records and open a separate bank account for the project. The clerk should complete not only monthly reports for Church headquarters, but also production records that can be used by the committee to determine efficiency, cost of operation, profitability, etc. The timely preparation, study, and use of financial reports will improve control of the project and indicate that you truly honor your stewardship. Record keeping must be a joint effort involving the manager as well as the clerk.</p>

						<span class="label">5.</span>
						<p pid="SDyhwXJvvkWu5hdXrXA-PA" hash="I7l2bw">
							<span class="emphasis">Marketing.</span> A part of planning often overlooked in welfare operations is the marketing of the farm commodities. The Welfare Production-Distribution Department has established a quality assurance program. Only quality products will be accepted by the canneries and storehouses. All crop production above the amount turned to the storehouse needs to be wisely and effectively marketed. The principal challenge is to market quality commodities at the right time and at the best price to help ensure financial viability.</p>

						<span class="label">6.</span>
						<p pid="c_Fb6ZUB4UiJXs7G_PlGjw" hash="pGtBJA">
							<span class="emphasis">Volunteer Services.</span> A unique factor of welfare production is the volunteer labor which comes from the members. It takes real planning and follow-through to maximize the efficient use of volunteer labor. As well as the volunteer labor, in many instances projects can benefit from using volunteer local resources such as agricultural extension personnel, businessmen, and experienced farm operators. The training and supervision of volunteer labor on a project by a committee member and/or priesthood leader will allow the manager to spend his time in critical operational functions.</p>

One of these celestial mandates is to care for our poor and needy brothers and sisters in the Lord’s way.

They also help us to become self-sustaining and prepared for eventualities.</p>

Older men provide examples to younger boys and men. Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, parents and children can work together. Discipline, sacrifice, and obedience are learned. Those of different occupations learn to work together. Carpenters, plumbers, teachers, lawyers, doctors, people from all walks of life work side by side. There is opportunity for cooperation, fellowshipping, and missionary work; for strengthening quorum, family, friends, and neighbor relationships. There is skill development and appreciation of the farmer or rancher or businessman. Production projects provide opportunities to develop physical fitness.</p>

We more fully appreciate the law of the harvest, that what men sow and care for, they reap. All our projects provide men with time for prayer and spiritual growth. On production projects there is opportunity more fully to understand God’s handiwork as seen in nature.</p>

In more and more families the mother and children are left to carry out the father’s duties as well as their own. Divorce, pursuit of wealth, and indifference to sacred things are only three of many reasons why fathers neglect the welfare of their families. In this life a father is never released from his responsibility. We call bishops, and they serve for a time and are released. Stake presidents likewise are called, serve, and are released. But a father’s calling is an eternal calling if he lives worthily.</p>

He is to “provide … for his own.” He does this when he provides spiritual and temporal leadership to family members. He provides for the welfare of each family member as he sees their needs and provides a way to help each one satisfy those needs. Of course, when there is no father in the home, the head of the household must assume these duties.</p>

You will find that much of the happiness of this life consists in having something worthy to do and in doing it well. It has been wisely said that ‘that which is worth doing is worth doing well.’ If a man is to drive the plow, let him do it well; if only to cut bolts, make good ones; if to blow the bellows, keep the iron hot. It is our attention to our daily duties that makes us men. Aspire to acquire knowledge that you may be able to do more good and also to progress in your sphere of life; but remember that you will win only by trust in the Lord, by present contentment and by doing faithfully that which you have in hand. … We all, father, mother, brothers, sisters, friends, and brethren in the office, all join in love to you, and in prayers for your welfare.</p>

This would be a time when the father would not monopolize the conversation but rather would lead out with a simple, well-chosen question or two and then sit back and listen. There is nothing that can take the place of a listening father. His ears and heart must both be in tune. There is no substitute.</p>

They lived in New England, where there is a short growing season. They had no mechanical farming equipment such as we now enjoy, and Father Smith needed all the help he could get from his sons. Undoubtedly they started work early in the morning and stayed in the fields until late in the evening.</p>

Remember, fathers, you are always teaching—for good or for ill. Your family is learning your ways and beliefs.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/attending-to-personal-and-family-preparedness.p1" pid="_TcLpjJpSkiFVcEv4c4zvg" hash="0grOaQ">Brothers and sisters, this morning President Kimball has outlined for us standards of performance as they relate to the subject of personal and family preparedness. The filmstrip has refreshed our memories and hopefully inspired us to set goals and make preparations in areas of need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/attending-to-personal-and-family-preparedness.p2" pid="2TB3Th88eUaIu8vF5QLcsA" hash="V79x4Q">Each of the principles discussed in the filmstrip is basic and should have direct application in the lives of every person and family member in the Church. Individual needs will vary as does the circumstance of each of us. Personal situations change as years go by. We should constantly appraise our needs and update our direction and emphasis. Our eternal progression, in large measure, is determined by our ability to evaluate and strengthen each area of weakness. What is the need of one may not necessarily be satisfied in the same way for another. For a moment, I would like to give a few examples of what I mean.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/attending-to-personal-and-family-preparedness.p3" pid="X1UVu9vpL0e5oDCx-ZuOSA" hash="591dwA">As some of you may know, Sister Peterson and I have five daughters. Over the years, in an effort to increase our spiritual maturity, we have read the scriptures on a daily basis in our home. Fifteen years ago, when all of our children were at home, we would get together at 6:15 in the morning and study. Today, with one thirteen-year-old daughter at home, our scripture study continues, but the pattern has changed. In addition to reading together on family night and on Sunday evenings, we are now using an exciting new daily scripture reading program. On the side of the refrigerator is taped a chart with numbers from 1 to 30, each number representing consecutive days of reading the scriptures. Each family member is responsible for reading a chapter a day and recording his progress on the chart. It is visible to all. If one day is missed, then it is necessary for the one who missed to begin again in the counting of consecutive reading days. Each is motivated by the fact that if we are successful as a family for a period of thirty days, there will be a special surprise in store for all. None of us wants to be the one to deny the others the prize. This approach is particularly motivating for a thirteen-year-old.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/attending-to-personal-and-family-preparedness.p4" pid="LyTHZs_Qnkql3CFBEr2GEw" hash="O_Zp_A">In the area of home production and storage, we still have the year’s supply room in the basement with the sign designating it as the “Peterson Family Store.” However, our garden and year’s supply program is not the same as it was fifteen years ago. Our family store reflects the needs of two adults, one child, and many visitors instead of the needs of two adults and five children, as it did in years past.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/attending-to-personal-and-family-preparedness.p5" pid="vGQKb2tAzUiUtJ5b7EDWzg" hash="EiLm2w">Our physical health involvement has changed. In the past, when our children were younger and together, they were mutually involved in many physically stimulating exercises. It now becomes important for an older mother and father to become more a part of getting a thirteen-year-old involved in sports. For instance, in times past where daughters may have challenged each other, now a tennis match might be between the father on one side and mother and daughter on the other side. My jogging commitment has been a daily habit for fifteen years and is still a part of life. However, each morning it becomes more difficult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/attending-to-personal-and-family-preparedness.p6" pid="BbbjSDI0h0yhR_drNvmR2A" hash="ZE-_Ag">We find, as family conditions change and maturity develops, there is still a constant need for expressions of “I love you.” There is still the need for regular father-mother-daughter interviews. There is still the need for dad and a thirteen-year-old to spend some time every summer at the amusement park. Husband-and-wife communication must still be nurtured. Needs like these will exist forever and must be satisfied.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/attending-to-personal-and-family-preparedness.p7" pid="RPdCgl8-gEOGpG-gG65KSw" hash="hfwemw">My message, then, is this: We cannot progress without attending to our own personal and family preparedness on a regular basis. Preparedness is not something that is static; it is ever changing. I know of no situation in life where it is not necessary. May we all become involved in it for the blessing of our families. There is precious little time to waste in preparing for the eternities. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

The call is extended to all priesthood holders throughout the world. This message is intended for the twelve-year-old deacon as well as his elder or high priest father or grandfather.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p2" pid="MAA8b_KrSUGySf2DOXCsRA" hash="8iB_Vg">The destructive forces of Satan are becoming increasingly more effective in their relentless pursuit of the hearts and minds of men and boys everywhere. Many quite innocently have been led into habits that are gaining a stranglehold on some of the very elite in the army of the priesthood. I fear there are some here tonight who are far less effective than they could be or would be if the weren’t so afflicted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p3" pid="_EyxZ5b3hkOFj5F9tVvQZQ" hash="YOdlmg">I would like to begin by painting a word picture of a setting in east-central Arizona. Here there are some high and often snow-packed mountains. We refer to them as the White Mountains. From this fountainhead stem most of the major water-producing streams that fill the agricultural and domestic needs of central Arizona. From these mountains comes the water supply for the home in the city of Phoenix. In the wintertime the mountains are covered with snow, ofttimes many feet in depth. The streams, as they begin here, run cool and clear, filled with delicious, life-giving water. The streams run many miles in this unpolluted condition as they move down the mountains, through the valleys, eventually to empty into great reservoirs built to store the liquid during periods of drought.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p4" pid="X5tD1U3jw0OMwPtbMpn1Jg" hash="OHATAA">There are also in eastern Arizona many high-grade ore deposits which are and have been mined for many years, copper being one of the principal metals. Some of the streams that originate in the White Mountains run through the mining towns, and their water is used by the smelters in the processing of the ore. The waste from this process, in some cases, finds its way back into the streams, causing discoloration and the addition of harmful elements that make the water unfit for human consumption. These streams also empty into the great reservoirs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p5" pid="vvV2Xjl3YUWP9iMX4JVu1Q" hash="fxOFXg">There are seasons of the year when there are cloudbursts in the mountains upstream from the dam. The heavens literally open up and discharge their contents. When water comes in such great quantities as it does on these occasions, large amounts of soil are eroded; brush, and sometimes trees, are also washed down the rivers into the reservoirs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p6" pid="joTdWiyHA0ykkqlKtvKJ4g" hash="Au92PQ">These reservoirs have the unusual capacity of holding all that is put in them—the cool and clean, clear, and delicious water coming from the glistening snowpack, as well as the polluted water from the industries, and the brown, silt-filled waters resulting from the summer thunderstorms. All of it accumulates behind the huge rock and concrete dams. As we’ve said, part of the water that is held behind these dams is used as the domestic water supply for over a million people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p7" pid="syJ068yCQEuSNMWCYLwhwQ" hash="2B_zAA">The water, of course, in the condition in which it is stored behind the dams, is now undrinkable because of the impurities that have been dumped into it. And so there must be a filtering system that prepares it for use.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p8" pid="ST_nhnSj_UuwhPM7ur436g" hash="dnWwiA">First, there are large grates and nets of coarse screens that filter out leaves, branches, and dead animal life. The filtering system gets finer and finer as it removes other harmful impurities. Finally, after much careful attention and cleansing, it is released into the pipelines of the cities in a now-purified condition, ready to be used by the people of the valley.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p9" pid="BT9vy_cmUUmT96de1owtOw" hash="UU-_rw">When we were born in the earth, our minds and thoughts were clean and sweet and pure—unpolluted by the harmful impurities that are around us that become a part of the experiences of this life. In our infancy our minds are free from unrighteous and unwholesome thoughts. We are innocent and untouched by most of the harmful effects and influences of Satan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p10" pid="0fXHp3Su_ky7x8mAqikPNA" hash="mgImoQ">Our mind, which is like a tremendous reservoir itself, is capable of taking in whatever it may be fed—good and bad, trash and garbage, as well as righteous thoughts and experiences. As we go through life, we may be exposed to stories, pictures, books, jokes, and language that are filthy and vulgar, or to television shows and movies that are not right for us to see or hear. Our mind will take it all in. It has a capacity to store whatever we will give it. Unfortunately, what our mind takes in, it keeps—sometimes forever. It’s a long, long process to cleanse a mind that has been polluted by unclean thoughts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p11" pid="9mVv3dtVGkmf5GAwvKh-OQ" hash="XaPn5A">Sometimes our minds may be so cluttered with filth and pollution that they are unable to be a spiritual strength to us and our families, let alone mankind in general. When in this condition, we find our thinking processes are not clear or correct. Everyday problems are more difficult to solve. We say and do things we would otherwise never be a part of.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p12" pid="CLqcUnouWES_e0SaVEqh2Q" hash="FmLPGw">There are two things we must do. First, we must stop the flow into our minds of these unhealthy and unwholesome streams of experiences and thoughts. Evil acts are preceded by unrighteous thoughts. And unrighteous thoughts are born of vulgar stories, jokes, pictures, conversation, and a myriad of other satanic products.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p13" pid="fGl71Xm1A0eYfOWAGHK4Zw" hash="KMSyXQ">Vulgarity appears in many ways. We live in a society where profanity and vulgarity are accepted means of conduct and expression—even a way of life for some. I remember being in a business meeting some years ago with a group of men who were well educated, competent in their professions, and friendly to all—but their language was a dialogue in profanity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p14" pid="GvLlpg5-UUumlfSxVsy8eA" hash="rmuCJQ">Brother Boyd K. Packer has said, “The reality of profanity does not argue for the toleration of it” (<span class="emphasis">New Era,</span> Jan. 1976, p. 5). We are the victims of a vile habit. I would suggest that some are misled who think vulgarity occurs only now and then when a person utters obviously crude or offensive words. Vulgarity is not so rare as it should be. It is sustained by constant exposure to a steady diet of vulgar and filthy experiences. We might consider vulgarity in a couple of ways: first, <span class="emphasis">as an expression of</span> personal weakness, and second, <span class="emphasis">as a contribution to</span> personal weakness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p15" pid="n3oAtA6JV0O1jK_QsD2FCQ" hash="1cW3-g">Some demonstrate or express a personal weakness when they tell jokes or stories about the body and its functions, when they joke about or make suggestive comments concerning women or girls, when they are casual about sacred things. There is vulgarity when some speak crudely of body parts or sexual matters. Too often, common slang, even gutter terms, are used by brethren of the priesthood—ofttimes anger is used as an excuse for such utterance. This is wrong. No one need swear or be vulgar at any time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p16" pid="mNUd_Jwhw0GS3RPxG1s5fw" hash="DRhzLQ">Some contribute to this personal weakness when they read or experience filthy magazines, vulgar movies or television shows, or remain in a group where unclean discussions occur. Each of these kinds of experiences will weaken any spirit, will make it less able to withstand “the fiery darts” of the adversary (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/6.16" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 6:16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/purify-our-minds-and-spirits.p17" pid="oVJv2AR44EeCD1ACjtjadA" hash="ep_gbg">Now, brethren of the priesthood, there should not be any X- or R-rated movies that we participate in viewing or talking about. There must be no pornographic magazines, pictures, or stories, no re-telling of filthy jokes or crude experiences. Once in a while we should stop and ask ourselves, “In whose army are we fighting? Whose battle lines are we defending?” Do you have the courage to walk out of an off-color PG-rated movie—or do you watch and listen, and suggest to yourself, “This soon will pass,” or “Everyone is doing it; it must be an acceptable type of entertainment”? Have you the courage to keep out of your home some television shows that are filled with suggestive sexual conversation—and even experiences? Have you thought lately how effective these shows are in piercing even the strongest spirits? Brethren, we must not feed ourselves a diet of trash!</p>

The effectiveness of our filtration system depends upon the pattern of our life. We will be no more successful in helping ourselves and others than we are pure in our minds. True, we may systematically perform many of the tasks that are assigned us such as—teach a Sunday School or priesthood lesson, prepare reports, conduct a meeting—but unless our spirit is in tune and we speak, teach, and act under the direction of the Holy Spirit, we accomplish little of an eternal value.</p>

It begins with prayer every morning and ends with prayer every night. This is the most important step I know in the cleansing process. It may simply be a prayer for strength to turn from bad habits—remembering that all prayers are not answered the next day. With this step in place, I have seen hundreds of miracles take place. Without it, there is continued frustration, unhappiness, ineffectiveness, and despair.</p>

This was a commitment President Kimball made over seventy years ago when he was your age.</p>

Keep it simple, but <span class="emphasis">do</span> it—daily. It may only be a cheery hello, a short visit to a homebound, a phone call, or a note. Maybe even picking up your dirty socks will thrill an unsuspecting mother or wife. According to the scripture, a disciple of the Savior is first a servant to others (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/20.27" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 20:27</a>).</p>

As we walk through life, each of us becomes involved in a variety of interests and activities. Ofttimes, our judgment of their relative importance is subject to question. I fear that some of what we do is of little worth from an eternal perspective. In fact, some of our interests may even detract from what good we may otherwise accomplish. There are some basic, fundamental activities of life that are far more productive as preparatory steps for exaltation than many others with which we may busy ourselves. Some of our number have been known to be busily engaged in the “thick of thin things.” The Master undoubtedly was speaking of this group as he taught us with the parable of the ten virgins.</p>

They believed enough that they were going, as a body, to meet the Bridegroom. It appears that they were not wicked, as we think of that descriptive term. I assume they had spent their lives, to that point, in “church activity”; however, as in the parable, five of them had been doing things of more import than had the other five. Half of them had been involved during their lives in doing things of consequence—in doing things that mattered most—in preparing oil for their lamps.</p>

We have all entered the water. We have made the covenant. In the eighteenth chapter of Mosiah, Alma describes the conduct of a true follower of the Savior, a true disciple.

Perhaps a supreme form of charity may be exhibited by one who withholds judgment of another’s acts or conduct, remembering that there is only one who can look into the heart and know the intent—and know the honest desires found therein. There is only one whose right it is to judge the success of another’s journey through life. Uncalled-for judgments or prejudiced feelings keep many from displaying a truly charitable attitude or a willingness to help those in need, even those in our own family circle. A warning comes to us from King Benjamin, who said:</p>

As a boy, I always went to priesthood meeting on Sundays with my father and brothers. As a father, I have always gone alone. As a priesthood leader, I have interviewed and taught hundreds of boys concerning the Aaronic Priesthood. This has been a great experience, but I have never taught one of my own sons. I’ve gone on countless fathers and sons’ outings, but never with one of my own.</p>

I’d like to visit with you about this very special Aaronic Priesthood authority you now have.</p>

I was seated on the stand and you were assigned to pass the sacrament to those seated there. You passed the bread and the water to me <span class="emphasis">in remembrance of the Savior.</span> In your office as an Aaronic Priesthood bearer, you actually helped me rededicate my life to keeping the commandments of God. Even though I am your grandfather and a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, you used <span class="emphasis">your</span> authority to help me renew my covenants. I was thrilled with that experience we shared together. As I saw the reserved smile on your face I sort of thought you had figured it to be pretty neat too. Did you know that I’ve passed the sacrament during sacred times to the Presidency of the Church, as well as to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the other General Authorities? Isn’t it terrific that you and I use this <span class="emphasis">same priesthood authority</span> to help each other make these covenants with the Lord?</p>

You are different now than you used to be. The Lord has said he is going to share with you some of his power and authority to help others through life. He is going to let you do some sacred things now that you couldn’t do before. Let me tell you some more of them.</p>

You don’t need to be afraid; you’ll be surprised and thrilled when you feel the inspiration to say certain things to your families. One of our home teachers is an Aaronic Priesthood bearer. He comes every month. Three weeks ago he prayed with us and left a blessing on our home. We all felt good.</p>

There is no more satisfying assignment than helping those in need. Gathering fast offerings is a blessing to you when you look at it as helping the bishop and the poor. Someday you may get to see the smile on a widow’s face and the tears in her eyes when the bishop takes her some groceries or pays her rent with the fast offerings you have gathered for him.</p>

When you are a priest, as many in this meeting are, you will be able to administer the sacrament. You will be able to baptize others. Think of it! You, like these older boys here tonight, will have the same authority to baptize that John the Baptist had when he baptized the Savior. Did you know it was his Aaronic Priesthood that authorized him to perform that baptism?</p>

I’m mindful that it is not easy to be a teenager in today’s world. There comes a time in every boy’s life when he would like to be—and needs to be—accepted by his peers, by the kids he pals around with. Sometimes this seems to be almost as important as being liked by mom and dad. When you’re under this sort of pressure at school, it isn’t easy to say no when no is the right thing to say—or to say yes when yes is the right thing to say. It takes <span class="emphasis">real courage</span> to be a faithful Aaronic Priesthood holder.</p>

Power doesn’t automatically come from the priesthood <span class="emphasis">unless</span> we live for it. Unfortunately, we have some boys who have become sort of careless in their habits. Some have made mistakes in their lives and have not repented of them. For the time being, even if they still hold the priesthood, they may have lost some of its power. Do you know what I mean?</p>

Then, when I would get in bed at night and drop my head on my pillow—crack! I would remember to get out of bed and kneel down by it. I would then put the rock on the floor by my bed and go to sleep. Then, in the morning, I would jump out of bed, and as my foot would come down on the rock—“Ouch!” And I would remember to kneel down and say my morning prayers.

Most of them had the courage to do what was right. They stayed close to each other and helped each other when things got tough. Most of them went to a high school close by. In numbers, they were really only a handful of the total student body. They met a girl at the school who was not a member of the Church. Her circumstances were unusual, for she was deaf. She also had a defective heart. The only way she could know what you were saying was to watch your lips and read them. She sat in the front of each class so she could <span class="emphasis">see</span> the teachers speak. She was a good student, but when you can’t hear and can’t be active, it’s hard for you to be a part of what is going on. You’re sort of a spectator rather than a participant. She was a spectator watching from the sidelines.</p>

She responded to their kindness. One step led to another, and with her parents’ permission she was finally invited to receive the missionary lessons in one of the homes. She was taught by two nineteen-year-old elders not much older than she. She liked what she heard; she believed what she heard; she felt good inside. The day was set for her baptism. We were all invited to go. Dressed in white, she and one of the missionaries entered the water, and she was baptized as he said, calling her by name, “Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.73" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:73</a>.)</p>

Some of us stood in the circle as priesthood hands were placed on her head. I was aware that she couldn’t see the lips of the one confirming her. And she wouldn’t be able to hear the blessing he might give. I listened carefully because I wanted to invite her into my office later, where she could <span class="emphasis">see</span> me talk, and tell her what had been said.</p>

He then continued with a blessing. As he spoke, he began to make her promises that I thought were unusual. In fact, I became a little uneasy at his words. He continued the blessing, and I began to feel a calm spirit of peace as he spoke. Later, I sat in front of her and said, “I want to tell you of the blessing the elder gave you. It was tremendous.”</p>

The one I would like you Aaronic Priesthood bearers to remember is this: Here was a nineteen-year-old missionary, an elder holding the holy Melchizedek Priesthood. He had <span class="emphasis">prepared</span> himself for a mission. He had <span class="emphasis">made himself worthy</span> to be an instrument in the hands of the Lord to perform a miracle. So, as he stood with his hands on her head, he felt an impression—a heavenly message, if you please—telling him there was a special blessing for this young woman and he had been chosen to deliver it.</p>

As you may know, it is not a short ride, so I engaged in a rather lengthy conversation with the driver.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p2" pid="SwlaIXNmaE-WubMjlvk1sw" hash="R1FSjg">I learned an unforgettable lesson from this black man. He was a big fellow. He weighed at least 250 pounds. He said he was the father of three sons, that his oldest was fourteen. The father was a regular employee of the U.S. Postal Service, and to augment his income, he drove a taxi in the afternoon when he finished his postal shift. “But,” said he, “I’m always home every evening for dinner.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p3" pid="ee25JppkGkeEv1NTfXEIXQ" hash="_pRxBA">I said, “Your wife must be an excellent cook.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p4" pid="XbljowG4TkKWO5xHT0MUZA" hash="PfsRPA">“She is,” he said. But that wasn’t the main reason he came home at that hour. He could have eaten later. “The reason I come home early is to be with my boys,” he said. “My fourteen-year-old is almost as tall as I am. In a few years I’ll no longer be able to handle him physically. When that time comes, I know he will only be obedient if he knows of my love and respect for him and also feels love and respect for me. So every evening we play ball or do homework together, or I just listen to him tell of his day. There are times,” said he, “when time with a boy is more important than money, or the things money can buy.”</p>

For instance, I’ve been concerned about what goes through a boy’s mind when he hears his dad quarrel with or speak unkindly to his mother, or abuse her in any way. I’ve wondered where he puts his values when dad goes hunting on Sunday, or works in the yard, or goes shopping on the Sabbath. Is there a lasting impression in a boy’s heart when he hears dad criticize the bishop, the home teacher, or the Sunday School teacher—or maybe even the prophet? Though it may be ever so slight, does it have an effect?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p6" pid="BkOHPJ4E7UydFQP8Zlz1Mw" hash="ZqS5Ig">I’ve been thinking: what respect will a fourteen-year-old Aaronic Priesthood holder develop for the law when his dad drives forty-five miles an hour in a twenty-five-mile zone, or seventy when it should be fifty-five? Are there acts of dishonesty that are so small they can escape the gaze of a boy? Is it possible that if a boy hears his father swear or curse he will grow up to think that that is the mark of true manhood, or of a Melchizedek Priesthood holder?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p7" pid="CWHc20rLfkOgEoFdvRkx-Q" hash="EebX9A">I believe that through all these acts of inconsistency in living priesthood standards, generally speaking, a son will still love his dad and think he is the greatest; and because of these feelings, he may well want to be just like him. With those thoughts, I’ve then wondered: what respect will the boy have for the priesthood, and for authority, and for obedience? What are his chances to develop faith, and testimony, and devotion, and an unwavering belief in his priesthood leaders and what they represent, if his father sends up the wrong kind of signals?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p8" pid="iMYefc_XYECwdABMIrjTsQ" hash="Huuf0Q">There is a time in almost every boy’s life when dad can do no wrong, when he wants to be just like him. Therein lies the tragedy. Even when dad does set a poor example, even when he is wrong—to a son he is still great, “because he’s dad.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p9" pid="PW_4_jZGSkSuhXbHTbkePA" hash="gwPGag">Would it surprise you to know that in most cases faithful sons come from faithful fathers, and wavering and faithless sons come from wavering and faithless fathers? We are grateful that from among the army of faithful converts there are exceptions to the general rule, but the odds are overwhelmingly in favor of the son following his father’s example.</p>

I hope I can give some suggestions to help you handle it.</p>

In that regard, it would be well for us to be reminded that because free agency is so basic a gospel principle, we need to understand that we cannot force the heart of another to believe. We cannot force faith and testimony and obedience. We can <span class="emphasis">lead</span> another to believe, but we cannot <span class="emphasis">push</span> another to believe.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p12" pid="fRTL_VjG5UKq3u-cMr8z_w" hash="TMtl9w">One of my heroes, and a great Book of Mormon missionary, understood and practiced this eternal principle. Ammon was tremendously successful. Among many others, the two thousand sons of Helaman were products of his efforts. He taught that before conversion comes—before one will believe words of truth—his heart must be prepared to receive the message. Thus, to encourage the conversion process of a son, there are many things a father can do. Attitudes are changed and father-son barriers are removed by dads who will keep in mind and practice some important principles of conduct. Let’s consider some ways that we, as fathers, might prepare the hearts of our children to believe in our words.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p13" pid="cjPpuHNzxkSfVvTYx2j6tA" hash="f2laBQ">First, remember the impact of your example, brethren. As we think of those who are watching us, let us remember that power in the priesthood, the power to bless and guide and teach, the power to forgive and forget, the power to give positive direction to a family—to a son—comes through righteousness. The laying on of hands we all received is not enough. Priesthood power comes to those prepared to receive it as a result of the righteous pattern of their lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p14" pid="WgaLIza17E-Xpo47gV7_gA" hash="yHj3DA">Let’s begin tonight to weed out the little inconsistencies that we all have in the way we live. Let’s renew the purification process—whatever that may mean—in each of our lives. If our words are not consistent with our actions, they will never be heard above the thunder of our deeds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p15" pid="Sr4JayhHX0iu8b3pqGD0Vg" hash="Mcnz_w">Secondly, a boy’s heart is better prepared to believe if he has a listening father. If I were a boy, what would I want my dad to be like? I would probably wish he didn’t preach to me so much, but rather, would listen to me more. Many dads spend too much time preaching and not enough time teaching. Sometimes great things happen inside a boy when he’s listened to by his dad. He begins to think he is special—that he is not just another twelve-year-old or sixteen-year-old. His self-image improves. One of our crying needs is to have young men who have a worthy self-image. These are the effective builders of the kingdom. In a father-son visit, who talks most? One successful father said, “Dads need to give more ear and less lip to their sons.”</p>

I’ve already told you about the Washington, D.C., cab driver. Elder Richard L. Evans had a meaningful thought. Said he:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p17" pid="siiOq8yZu0uJqLruyECNIQ" hash="U-tiPQ">“In all things there is a priority of importance. … And one of our urgent opportunities is to respond to a child when he earnestly asks—remembering that they don’t <span class="emphasis">always</span> ask, that they aren’t <span class="emphasis">always</span> teachable, that they won’t <span class="emphasis">always</span> listen. And often we have to take them on <span class="emphasis">their</span> terms, at <span class="emphasis">their</span> times, and not always on <span class="emphasis">our</span> terms, and at <span class="emphasis">our</span> times. But if we respond to them with sincere attention and sincere concern, they will likely continue to come to us and ask. And if they find they can trust us with their trivial questions, they may later trust us with the more weighty ones.” (<span class="emphasis">Thoughts for One Hundred Days,</span> 5 vols., Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1972, 5:114–15.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/prepare-the-heart-of-your-son.p18" pid="_2DMrlK_A0-wXBZFun4aww" hash="IARLqw">Another way to prepare the heart of a boy: let him find in his father one who does not criticize—whether it be the boy himself, or Church leaders, or teachers, or neighbors, or even his own wife. Yes, especially the boy’s mother. There are few things a father can give his son that are worth quite as much as knowing he is in love with his mother. It doesn’t take much of a man to criticize another. Faultfinding is easy. It takes a true disciple of the Master to look beyond the weaknesses we all have and find the threads of gold that are always there.</p>

There were a father, mother, and two boys, ages about six and ten. The six-year-old made a mistake; the father was harsh with him and jerked him about as he reprimanded him. For the rest of the meal, though there was a holiday atmosphere at most of the tables, there was little conversation at theirs. As the young boy would take each bite, he glanced at his father to see if he had displeased him. On the boy’s face there was a look of worry and fear, and a soberness unnatural to a child.</p>

It takes quite a dad to look beyond the actions of boyhood and see the potential of manhood—and even more important, for him to get a glimpse of eternity.</p>

There he lays aside his mask and you may learn whether he is an imp or an angel, cur or king, hero or humbug. I care not what the world says of him: whether it crowns him boss or pelts him with bad eggs. I care not a copper what his reputation or religion may be: if his babies dread his homecoming and his better half swallows her heart every time she has to ask him for a five-dollar bill, he is a fraud of the first water, even though he prays night and morning until he is black in the face. … But if his children rush to the front door to meet him and love’s sunshine illuminates the face of his wife every time she hears his footfall, you can take it for granted that he is pure, for his home is a heaven. … I can forgive much in that fellow mortal who would rather make men swear than women weep; who would rather have the hate of the whole world than the contempt of his wife; who would rather call anger to the eyes of a king than fear to the face of a child.” (W.

I have prayed for the spirit to understand, and to be understood.</p>

It has affected young and old, rich and poor. Its onward roll is not limited by national boundaries, or race, or creed, or social standing. It affects some who appear to be strong. It affects many who are weak. It poisons the spirit of a person to the point that one is hobbled by its debilitating power. It has the power to drag people to the depths of hell; yet, when released from its hold, they may soar to celestial heights. It has kept many from rising to their full potential. It has been a roadblock to the talented and to the favored. It is one of the most effective tools of Satan. We are speaking of an unforgiving and unforgetting spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/removing-the-poison-of-an-unforgiving-spirit.p3" pid="puEuKTzxLUSL0iS-_Ysd4Q" hash="hnnGIA">There are many today who harbor in the deep recesses of their hearts a canker, a hurt, a feeling of resentment, a dislike, or in some cases even a hate because of unpleasant experiences with past and present associations. Some have been taken advantage of in a business sense. Others have had their feelings hurt by neighbors, or relatives, or friends. A few have been lied to or had a trust of long standing betrayed. Some children, young and now grown, have been offended by harsh or dictatorial parents. Husbands and wives may have deep schisms between them caused by criticism and a resulting resentment. The list of sad experiences goes on and on—yes, it is too long. To those of you who have been nursing the wounds of hurt feelings from the past, even from the little things, I would like to tell an experience which happened some time ago.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/removing-the-poison-of-an-unforgiving-spirit.p4" pid="PMdlArjtL0a446u0S4b80w" hash="1fJR3w">For much of our lives, we lived in central Arizona. Some years ago a group of teenagers from the local high school went on an all-day picnic into the desert on the outskirts of Phoenix. As some of you know, the desert foliage is rather sparse—mostly mesquite, cat-claw, and palo verde trees, with a few cactus scattered here and there. In the heat of the summer, where there are thickets of this desert growth, you may also find rattlesnakes as unwelcome residents. These young people were picnicking and playing, and during their frolicking, one of the girls was bitten on the ankle by a rattlesnake. As is the case with such a bite, the rattler’s fangs released venom almost immediately into her bloodstream.</p>

They could immediately begin to extract the poison from her leg, or they could search out the snake and destroy it. Their decision made, the girl and her young friends pursued the snake. It slipped quickly into the undergrowth and avoided them for fifteen or twenty minutes. Finally, they found it, and rocks and stones soon avenged the infliction.</p>

They became aware of her discomfort, as by now the venom had had time to move from the surface of the skin deep into the tissues of her foot and leg. Within another thirty minutes they were at the emergency room of the hospital. By then, the venom was well into its work of destruction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/removing-the-poison-of-an-unforgiving-spirit.p7" pid="4CycxhUn5EyyfNYLyJ-0bQ" hash="_2nKBw">A couple of days later I was informed of the incident and was asked by some young members of the Church to visit their friend in the hospital. As I entered her room, I saw a pathetic sight. Her foot and leg were elevated—swollen almost beyond recognition. The tissue in her limb had been destroyed by the poison, and a few days later it was found her leg would have to be amputated below the knee.</p>

How much better it would have been if, after the young woman had been bitten, there had been an extraction of the venom from the leg in a process known to all desert dwellers.</p>

What can be done? What will you do when hurt by another? The safe way, the sure way, the right way is to look inward and immediately start the cleansing process. The wise and the happy person removes first the impurities from within. The longer the poison of resentment and unforgiveness stays in a body, the greater and longer lasting is its destructive effect. As long as we blame others for our condition or circumstance and build a wall of self-justification around ourselves, our strength will diminish and our power and ability to rise above our situation will fade away. The poison of revenge, or of unforgiving thoughts or attitudes, unless removed, will destroy the soul in which it is harbored.</p>

After the war was over and the concentration camps were opened, there was much hatred among the weak and emaciated survivors. In one camp, observers noticed a native of Poland who seemed so robust and peaceful they thought he must have only recently been imprisoned. They were surprised to learn that he had been there over six years! Then, they reasoned, he must not have suffered the terrible atrocities to his family members that most of the prisoners had. But in questioning him, they learned how soldiers had come to his city, lined up against a wall his wife, two daughters, and three small sons, then opened fire with a machine gun. Though he begged to die with them, he had been kept alive because of his knowledge and ability in language translation.</p>

If you are prone to criticize or judge, remember, we never see the target a man aims at in life. We see only what he hits.</p>

That person who has not forgiven a wrong or an injury has not yet tasted of one of the sublime enjoyments of life. The human soul seldom reaches such heights of strength or nobility as when it removes all resentments and forgives error or malice. No one can be classed as a true follower of the Savior who is not in the process of removing from his heart and mind every feeling of ill will, bitterness, hatred, envy, or jealousy toward another.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/selflessness-a-pattern-for-happiness.p6" pid="FQKSWvHVgUSE6CyqdVCPTQ" hash="7TNBuQ">To paraphrase a statement made by Wendell Phillips, it may be accurately said, “How prudently most men sink into nameless graves, while now and then a few <span class="emphasis">forget themselves</span> into immortality.” (as quoted by William Jennings Bryan, <span class="emphasis">The Prince of Peace,</span> Independence: Zion’s Printing and Publishing Co., 1925.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/selflessness-a-pattern-for-happiness.p7" pid="VoabRpMaFUCFVcO303BrUA" hash="SmrIcA">In the day-to-day process of living, with all of its trials, challenges, and discouragements, we often underestimate our own God-given attributes and abilities which make it possible for each of us to pattern his or her life after that of the Savior and, in fact, do some of the things he did as he lived here among men. We may never personally experience the miracle of raising the dead, or be one to turn water into wine. We may not be one of thousands who may be fed from a few loaves and fishes, or be a part of the miraculous experience of walking on a stormy sea. But for each one of us, there are a number of Christlike patterns of living we can be a part of in our mortal sojourn.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/selflessness-a-pattern-for-happiness.p8" pid="84OH1tWfAE-XGVytQiuRhg" hash="VtY7Pg">For instance, with us here today there are more than a few who display unquestioning obedience to whatever is asked of them—as did he. There are those who are complete in their forgiveness of the offenses of others—as was he. Some among us are scrupulously honest, even when it isn’t convenient—as was he. The list of Christlike attributes and patterns of living goes on and on, as does the list of those who will continue to strive to be obedient, however difficult it may be. Thank heaven for those who keep trying! They cannot fail.</p>

You see, there are those among us today who are completely <span class="emphasis">selfless</span>—as was he.</p>

A selfless person displays a willingness to sacrifice, a willingness to purge from his or her mind and heart personal wants, and needs, and feelings. Instead of reaching for and requiring praise and recognition for himself, or gratification of his or her own wants, the selfless person will meet these very human needs for others. Remember the words of the Savior as he taught his disciples on an occasion when personal recognition was being sought: “But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, … whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.42-45" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:42–45</a>.)</p>

However, it is an ugly word. It describes a characteristic of satanic proportions. We will not say much of this word, for it is not pleasant to think about, and we don’t like to use it. The word is <span class="emphasis">selfish.</span> The dictionary describes a selfish person as one who is “concerned excessively or exclusively with oneself: seeking pleasure or well-being without regard for others.” (<span class="emphasis">Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</span>.) May we add, a selfish person is often one who refers to “I,” “me,” and “mine” rather than to “we,” “ours,” “yours,” or “theirs.” This person is anxious to be in the limelight, to be on center stage in life’s little dramas. He or she may be a poor listener, or a conversation monopolizer. Selfishness is the great unknown sin. No selfish person ever thought himself to be selfish.</p>

What can we do to cultivate and nurture the divine quality of selflessness? May I suggest, as a first step, that there be a very careful, introspective evaluation.

On this particular day her mother had been having an unusually difficult time, and didn’t have the strength to hold up her head, or even open her eyes. Though she was physically restricted, she was very alert mentally, and as my wife was caring for her many needs of the day she visited with her about family and friends. My wife held her mother’s head up with one hand while she fed her with the other, and during the meal their conversation turned to one of our daughters and her husband who have five children under the age of seven. My wife commented to her mother that three of our daughter’s children had chicken pox at the same time. The fact that this little mother was unusually busy was obvious. My mother-in-law stopped eating, thought for a moment, and then in a weak, almost inaudible voice said, “I feel so sorry for Robin. I wish I could go to her home and help her.” A few moments later, as my wife pondered this wish, she observed, “You know, Mother, I think in your case wanting to is enough. Surely you will receive a blessing for service and selflessness as though you went to her home and helped.”</p>

Let’s look at some of the ways we can nurture a heart so that a testimony can take root and grow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/preparing-the-heart.p11" pid="c6b6wv_iHEi3bJxrhBEP6w" hash="eRbe5w">If your home is a home where family members are loved unconditionally, regardless of behavior, then your home will have a spirit of warmth that will prepare the heart to receive the testimony of truth. When children and teenagers are loved because of who they are and not for how they behave, only then can we begin to help make much-needed changes in behavior. For example, a teenager who feels accepted will be more likely to choose wholesome friends.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/preparing-the-heart.p12" pid="oCmczUS0skirCITqZNTD5A" hash="3e7F4A">Now, you may think, “I would like to love my family and friends and neighbors unconditionally, but sometimes it is extremely difficult. How can I learn to feel that pure love?” Here are some guidelines:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/preparing-the-heart.p13" pid="Aw09PcQ0i0efpFQTfHXUWg" hash="euDQcQ">First, look for the good in each person, and mention it in a sincere and consistent way. It is amazing how hearts can be softened, testimonies implanted, and relationships improved when we begin to give a daily portion of heartfelt appreciation. It has a marvelous effect on preparing the spirit. Even mentioning a little thing will have a positive effect. It usually isn’t earth-shaking—just a simple act or attribute that will blossom and be multiplied if it is noticed. (By the way, it may take you all day to find something, but it is there.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/preparing-the-heart.p14" pid="MBCjJ1xzl0W5ceF2OBQYhQ" hash="Iqqm_w">One day after school, one of our daughters came into a teenage son’s room. It looked as if a big wind had blown through. He was sitting in the midst of it all. She felt the anger rising within, but remembered her resolution to look for the good. Searching desperately, her eye finally looked upward. “Your ceiling’s really clean, Adam!” she was able to say quite honestly. He laughed; he got the message, and he cleaned up the room.</p>

Criticism is a <span class="emphasis">destroyer</span> of self-worth and esteem. It is demeaning and cutting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/preparing-the-heart.p17" pid="W_aVZThTSEyDa-Vu1p3jfg" hash="DMWZFA">Some husbands expect perfection, and when this is not attained, their expressions turn to criticism. One wife wrote, “Life can be such a lonely struggle for a woman in this situation—[when there is] one who reminds her continually of her failings, letting her know she is not living up to his expectations. How can a woman feel she’ll ever become what our Heavenly Father expects of her when, no matter how hard she tries, she never pleases her husband?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/preparing-the-heart.p18" pid="BBLrq59fGkie07Pu7l96oQ" hash="2BHObA">It is heartbreaking how criticism can wound children and diminish their self-esteem. In one family, home evenings were discontinued because members of the family became discouraged by the contention. The father, who may have been conscientious about his responsibility to help his family improve, unwisely used most of the time to find fault with family members. Even though he made some effort to praise the children, it was not enough to offset his criticism.</p>

When she made the effort to look a little further, she came to realize that the annoying habits practiced by her roommate were actually appropriate expressions of a different cultural heritage.</p>

In relationships where there is forgetting and forgiving, joy and trust are nurtured.</p>

If your home is a home where children are listened to, even when what they say doesn’t seem important or you don’t feel you have time, then you are preparing hearts. Can we listen openly to a shocking experience without going into a state of shock ourselves, or without an immediate verbal overreaction? We all know there is a time to talk and a time to listen. To listen with patience to a young person’s reasons for getting home late will bring you undying gratitude. Remember, you can listen to understand, not necessarily to agree. Ofttimes we do our best teaching when we listen. Husband-and-wife relationships are nourished and strengthened as we listen to each other more. Hearts are softened.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/preparing-the-heart.p22" pid="uaiuviDGAEmVRY7S-V88zA" hash="cDv1Og">Finally, love is spoken in prayer. In your home, do children hear their parents pray for them in specific ways? For instance, when Kami is sick, she can hear the family pray she will have the Lord’s healing influence. When Cameron needs a job, it will help him to hear the prayers of his family express confidence in him. If in your home children hear their parents pray for each other daily, then your home is a faith-building home. In it, hearts can be changed, and those who live there may become the children of Christ.</p>

My thanks for all the good you do in behalf of our Father’s children all over the world. This evening I hope you can understand the concern this assignment has given me. Expecting that this will be my last opportunity to stand at this pulpit and speak to you brethren of the priesthood, my thoughts have been led to address a subject that some may find discomforting. As King Benjamin of old said, so plead I for each one of us. I quote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p2" pid="3TH6KTJp8E-Y0wNZqCzXww" hash="3Jzhjw">“Open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p3" pid="Lcz7oSM7kEeZkjIa_EzOGA" hash="tmBXJw">It is my hope that we will be taught by the Spirit tonight.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p4" pid="gCV0rz2K1UCc_m0UFoHtMA" hash="tAc4HQ">In <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.30" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:30</a> we read, “And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and <span class="emphasis">touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing”</span> (emphasis added).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p5" pid="IBptDSshxk2exjWgM_PhRA" hash="ab9K_w">My thoughts will center on our sometimes innocent involvement in one of the terrible, unclean things referred to by this ancient prophet. Satan, the very devil and the father of all lies, has slyly and slowly lowered the social norms of morality to a tragic and destructive level. In magazines and books, on CDs and tapes, on our television and theater screens is portrayed more and more often a lifestyle that might even rival the excesses of those who lived in Sodom and Gomorrah. The screens, music, and printed materials, etc., are filled with a profusion of sex, nudity, and vulgarity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p6" pid="72mEZvxMYEeBnCiocOxS6g" hash="FN2noQ">One of the great tragedies is that too many men and boys who hold the priesthood of God are watching and listening to this type of so-called entertainment. Some do it only casually at first. They think they are spiritually strong and will be immune to its influence. This trash is nothing more nor less than pornography dressed in one of its many imitation robes of splendor—one of the master counterfeiter’s best products.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p7" pid="ZDHebBCVd0uLrMrTugb4lw" hash="pOhdng">Part of the tragedy I speak of is that many men and boys do not recognize they are trapped or soon will be. Unfortunately, I fear even some within the sound of my voice have an addiction and do not realize it. They see this as a form of entertainment that serves as a relief from the troubles of the day. In point of fact and in reality, <span class="emphasis">it is only relieving them of their spirituality</span> and their capacity to draw on the powers of heaven in times of need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p8" pid="J90mBbzviU2vnBcjrA_R1Q" hash="_COoOw">We must come to understand fully the consequences of having an appetite for such entertainment. Fathers and mothers must warn their children and make them aware of the eternal penalty. No man or boy of us here tonight can look at, read about, or listen to such explicit vulgarity, even in its mildest form, without bringing sorrow to a loving God and a terrible injury to one’s own spirit. We cannot look at or listen to these unholy depictions in our own living room or wherever they are shown without suffering the consequences—and those consequences are very real.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p9" pid="RDElKWShV0an8l_eMU04yw" hash="KGALxQ">We must remember, our rewards for righteous living are only partially enjoyed in this mortal life. Likewise, our miseries for breaking the commandments of God will not all be realized fully as we live here on the earth. Eternity is a long, long time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p10" pid="y7eaX9cor0KzYUJRp2SuYA" hash="Bdg-bA">Brethren, I plead with you to leave it alone. Stay away from any movie, video, publication, or music—<span class="emphasis">regardless of its rating</span>—where illicit behavior and expressions are a part of the action. Have the courage to turn it off in your living room. Throw the tapes and the publications in the garbage can, for that is where we keep garbage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p11" pid="MKH2Pns0jEKkXxmcSvg5tg" hash="0wxgFA">The Doctrine and Covenants gives a warning and a promise. The promise says that “if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.67" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:67</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p12" pid="JdnPSuTsx06ato0e-upGCw" hash="SBeHtQ">In an application of this scripture today, it is my understanding that anytime we look at or listen to the kind of material we have been speaking of—even in its mildest form—the light inside of us grows dimmer because the darkness inside increases. The effect of this is that we cannot think as clearly on life’s challenges—be they business, church, school, family, or personal—because the channel to the source of all light for the solving of problems is cluttered with various unclean images. Our entitlement to personal revelation on any subject is severely restricted. We don’t do as well in school or at work. We are left more on our own, and as a result we make more mistakes and we are not as happy. Remember, our mind is a wonderful instrument. It will record and keep whatever we put into it, both trash and beauty. When we see or hear anything filthy or vulgar, whatever the source, our mind records it, and as it makes the filthy record, beauty and clean thoughts are pushed into the background. Hope and faith in Christ begin to fade, and more and more, turmoil and discontent become our companions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p13" pid="S0kTninvXkSTX4NNbl28lw" hash="8_4I7Q">Brothers, sisters, and parents are not as happy together as they used to be. We find less peace and contentedness in our hearts and homes. We do things that later we wish we had not done. Contention looms its vicious head, and when contention is present, the Spirit of Christ departs from us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p14" pid="L4WYj4AUNEqtvjlrBZfx5g" hash="boTUvw">Again I say, leave it alone. Turn it off, walk away from it, burn it, erase it, destroy it. I know it is hard counsel we give when we say movies that are R-rated, and many with PG-13 ratings, are produced by satanic influences. Our standards should not be dictated by the rating system. I repeat, because of what they <span class="emphasis">really</span> represent, these types of movies, music, tapes, etc. serve the purposes of the author of all darkness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p15" pid="TWxotifOK02Izr8Zfp4GFg" hash="WTImoQ">Brethren, let’s consider again why we cannot be involved in Satan’s program of entertainment and be held guiltless. Why? Because<span class="emphasis"> we are men and boys of the covenant,</span> and that makes us different from all others. When we’ve made a covenant with the Lord, we are special—not ordinary, but special. He loves all of his sons, <span class="emphasis">but those of the covenant have a special responsibility.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p16" pid="Jdy1r3uZmkuT_aPg17XeHw" hash="qItV_A">The Lord has told us in holy writ that before we ever came to this earth we were all called to hold his priesthood and bear up his work here. It isn’t a small, insignificant task we have. He <span class="emphasis">will</span> hold us responsible for our portion of the labor.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p17" pid="ah2pvYGJ-0i8Si0k6KVy8Q" hash="eShK7A">Now, if you have this problem we speak of, let me give you hope and a plan of attack. If you are young, go to your parents or your bishop for help. Both young and older must go to the Lord. Stopping the activity and cleansing the spirit of the impurities of which we’ve been speaking will not be easy, and it will not be quick, but it can be sure. I quote from a talk given at this pulpit several years ago.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p18" pid="8V2qy7TCc0mHth1nlQ8-Tg" hash="-JLJ9w">“The secret to cleansing our spirit of whatever the impurity is not very complicated. It begins with [sincere, heartfelt] prayer every morning and ends with prayer every night. This is the most important step I know in the cleansing process. It may simply be a prayer for strength to turn from bad habits,” or a prayer that sin will be distasteful to you (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1980, p. 39).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p19" pid="9jn3jdjmz0OLzsdSWatuEA" hash="NTBVyA">Meanwhile, remember that not all prayers are answered the same day or even the next day. Sometimes it takes a long time. But “with this step in place, I have seen hundreds of miracles take place. Without it, there is continued frustration, unhappiness, ineffectiveness, and despair” (ibid.).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p20" pid="RL8IY-JTm06OC2Y-flrh_g" hash="ZtfUYg">If you have tried and have given up, I plead with you to try again and again and again. Our Heavenly Father will not forsake your efforts if you persist.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p21" pid="PlH7-RMnoUu8gyxz2g_rjA" hash="O2mN7w">The second step in this plan of attack is to gain an added measure of spiritual strength through a daily study of the scriptures. Your study need not be long, but it should be every day. If I were you, I would read the scriptures tonight and never let a day pass without reading in them, even if only for a few minutes. There is an added measure of inspiration promised to those who read the scriptures regularly (ibid.).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p22" pid="7IdZUg0t1EOPSkYQxOZDsw" hash="AXDoaQ">The scriptures will assist us to overpower darkness with light.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p23" pid="9Xo9_7OrBESkMXu7GxwS8w" hash="lPnYfw">The third step that I would counsel is: when necessary, receive the blessing that comes in the confession process. Too many are harboring the inner feeling of guilt resulting from unrepented mistakes. Part of the repentance process is confession. If you happen to be one of those who has this need, I plead with you to go see your bishop before the sun sets tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p24" pid="bNNKzU6E20St3W6vsBfnmg" hash="iHPcLQ">I testify that the Savior is at the head of this work. May I echo the words that great prophet Moroni offered in his farewell address:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p25" pid="Qw6FgTiLhk6hATuZbQMmXg" hash="RSppUA">“Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:32</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/touch-not-the-evil-gift-nor-the-unclean-thing.p26" pid="MrK9GbF34kC0WRrrI9m-gQ" hash="894Bsw">Of him I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
