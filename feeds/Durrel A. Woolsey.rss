      <title>An Eternal Key</title>
      <link>http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key?lang=eng</link>
      <description>My beloved brethren of the priesthood, the Lord Jesus Christ said, “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” (.) Could we add, “lose his own soul, and his family”?</description>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p1" pid="yR4o-0enn0a_FSIqUQq6zA" hash="aTsWLw">My beloved brethren of the priesthood, the Lord Jesus Christ said, “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/8.36" class="scriptureRef">Mark 8:36</a>.) Could we add, “lose his own soul, and his family”?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p2" pid="iBIP1_IVBUmIA-YEOvRpSw" hash="22G7Hg">As I left California, bound for Salt Lake City to receive training and be set apart for a mission in Arizona, I experienced for a moment an alarming feeling. I had lost all of my keys. The keys to the cars, home, business, and Church calling had been left behind. I had the depressing feeling that I no longer had any keys; even my pockets seemed empty.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p3" pid="4GKkpOb3pUuIoMFuFhuifg" hash="JERj7Q">Then came the exhilarating thought that I still had the most important key of all, a key that I will hold eternally, if I remain worthy. That key, of course, is the patriarchal key with my family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p4" pid="OS4PONqJIkuPgitkY-mnXw" hash="eB9eww">I became aware of how temporary most other keys are, especially keys that control material things that will one day become victims of moth and rust. Priesthood keys of leadership and other keys of presidency are extremely vital; but for the most part, even they are temporary in nature. Eventually, after faithfully serving, you will then relinquish those keys to someone else.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p5" pid="US3RmAP1mUSHCsYkHBdJJQ" hash="V0VmjA">We will, however, be blessed to continue to hold our patriarchal key. Fathers, you hold the key to accomplish the work stated by several of the prophets as vitally important. President Harold B. Lee said, “The most important work you will ever do will be done within the walls of your own home,” and President David O. McKay cautioned that “no other success can compensate for failure in the home.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p6" pid="hpBIQHa_cU-hjJ3jr_lSDQ" hash="8XDqZw">Many in the world are alarmed, and with some justification, at the plight and deteriorating condition of families. The most powerful thrust toward a resolution of this significant problem would be an honorable father, full of integrity and fidelity, giving righteous leadership to his family. That joyful work and calling is to do whatever is necessary to chart a course for you and your family to unitedly return and live with Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p7" pid="9GoQrxeeV0u1l-33b5zeEQ" hash="vFYF3Q">We likely will not be called upon to endure the great physical hardships suffered by so many of our pioneer forefathers. Ours is a much more sinister and demoralizing challenge. Often this challenge will approach cloaked in confusing masks of misunderstood rights and agency or the enticements and allurements of a misguided world. We daily face the “anything for a thrill” crowd or the “What’s in it for me?” society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p8" pid="2cwZ12p9X0SwZKr3JyGMJA" hash="eeFYpg">The anti-Christ Korihor, in the Book of Mormon, taught a similar type of damaging doctrine when he said, “There could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.17" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:17</a>.) This rhetoric could blend into much of the accepted doctrine of the world today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p9" pid="EeokXJdeh0y3dE81NrC-dA" hash="N5p9Bg">So where is safety? How does a father go about safely guiding his most priceless possession through the reefs and shoals?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p10" pid="QRHbC2c7hUC4F4LoJVNTVA" hash="o4q_bg">Dad, you need to be a hero in your family. They need a hero. They will have strong peer pressure and temptation to adopt the so-called heroes of today who are not worthy of their attention and most certainly not their emulation. The heroes or superstars in the sports and entertainment world, and there are many, frequently become examples of dishonesty, instability, and infidelity. They flagrantly and indifferently flaunt those weaknesses of character and immorality before a doting and accepting world, as Korihor said, “according to the management of the creature.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.17" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p11" pid="acZPHSbTdkee7V9Wy0HxCQ" hash="qBok1A">Could not, should not, Father become the hero to his family? A father worthy of attention, worthy of emulation? Most certainly, but how?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p12" pid="HIkWe2iYUU2jngzUWEOoNg" hash="JDDtrQ">First of all, a generous amount of your time is required. Not a superficial moment here and there, not the tired and worn-out phrase, “We’ll talk about that later,” but an honest, generous piece of your day on a continuing basis, even at the sacrifice of things social, things personally entertaining, or even things financially rewarding. All of the money in the world, significant worldly accomplishments which may include the upper rungs of the success ladder, or the personal enjoyment of athletic and sporting activities, will not return you and your family intact to live with Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p13" pid="25FlL1HhnEix50a8Bfp5wg" hash="bKcnog">President Joseph F. Smith quoted from the Savior, as stated in Mark: “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/8.36" class="scriptureRef">Mark 8:36</a>.) Then President Smith continued, “What would it profit me, though I should go out into the world and win strangers to the fold of God and lose my own children? Oh! God, let me not lose my own. I can not afford to lose mine, whom God has given to me and whom I am responsible for before the Lord, and who are dependent upon me for guidance, for instruction, for proper influence.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1975, p. 462.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p14" pid="2I5RIwQYJUquzeKmdICmQg" hash="KJl1Zw">The salvation of our families will require all that we have to save all that we have. So you will make the time commitment. Great! Positive, wonderful benefits will begin to flow to you and your family almost immediately.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p15" pid="Dh1CX16o10etLGXoc0UM4Q" hash="HaESkA">So what next? I mentioned fidelity. It is absolutely essential that you set an undeviating course of loyalty and faithfulness to your companion, to whom you have previously made these very commitments and promises. The example of your great love and respect for her, the two of you being as one, will establish a singular guiding strength that your children will desire to follow. Your voices and actions blending together in a united front as you teach and lead your little family will be the trumpet with a certain sound of strength and unity leading to safety. Synonyms of <span class="emphasis">fidelity</span> are <span class="emphasis">allegiance</span> and <span class="emphasis">devotion.</span> They will be critical supports to your foundation of fidelity. “Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:22</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p16" pid="pRXOC9IEjkiX7Mjp4HgF_A" hash="lSp5_w">Father, one of your greatest resources will be the scriptures. You would not consider making a large investment in a rather complicated and technical piece of equipment, then begin its operation, without an involved study of the handbook of instruction. Further, you would likely reference that handbook often. The handbook of instructions for your somewhat complicated, very sizable investment called family is certainly the original handbook of instruction—that being our beloved scriptures. They are complete with instructions and examples. Often, you will find the answer before the question is asked. Daily research is required. It is also vital to maintain open communication lines with the Fountainhead of all wisdom and truth through your daily family and personal prayers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p17" pid="vXz30mXrmkmtIWpAxhjrPg" hash="JzSj-w">Finally, what better resource for direction could we have than a living prophet? A great safety-net can envelop you and your family as you follow the Brethren. How blessed you are, Dad, to have living oracles of God to update you with current instruction to guide your family through modern-day challenges. To not hear, or ignore them, to not understand and heed those instructions would be like beginning a trip across the sea in a small boat without a compass.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p18" pid="3GhfbdK1vkeZpTgU8yjLqw" hash="_vEI4g">Well, that’s it, Dad. You must become the family hero, worthy of not only their attention but their emulation. This will require your constant investment of sufficient time, complete emotional and physical fidelity, with unity of purpose between you and your eternal companion. This will require your constant dependency upon the Lord, demonstrated through scripture study and prayer. This will require that you follow the Brethren in every sense of the word—hearing, understanding, and doing. This simple formula will unite and strengthen your beloved family and bring countless blessings from our Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/10/an-eternal-key.p19" pid="O3Rp1zD2W0eRVvBFB6IEUA" hash="dtFC2Q">May God bless all fathers to righteously obtain and maintain this patriarchal key to the blessing of families throughout the Church. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p1" pid="vy5Gc5sFi0KlDVVLoiNoog" hash="4K09ew">I would like to speak to you today about a strategy for war. We sing the hymn “Onward, Christian Soldiers! Marching as to war” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 246). Paul said, “For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14.8" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 14:8</a>). In the book of Revelation we are told of a war in heaven (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/12.7" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 12:7</a>). What kind of battle? What kind of war?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p2" pid="_BRppikOjki0tOcq_ALT9w" hash="X_h7hw">The war is for the souls of men. The battle lines have been drawn since Adam: evil versus righteousness. In this the final dispensation and in preparation for the Millennium, the forces of evil have intensified and united under the powerful influences of Satan. On the opposite side of the line, the kingdom of God is clearly sounding the trumpet of righteousness, as perhaps never before. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is on the offensive in the declaration of good to be good and evil to be evil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p3" pid="_-1yToGxeUGRj7IkSqtSSg" hash="2X4wpA">Isaiah prophesied of our time on this very subject when he said, “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/5.20" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 5:20</a>.) Satan offers a strange mixture of just enough good to disguise the evil along his downward path to destruction, as described by Nephi, an ancient prophet, when he said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p4" pid="CGjbLmOD3UilzqcTZf9XrA" hash="8IhWDw">“For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p5" pid="AwMOCOcB2UW7ppf8XR-v8g" hash="TTygow">“And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well—and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.20-21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:20–21</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p6" pid="DGDsy7xKa0CJQXX-vX5oCA" hash="BJ_Rbg">Satan does rage in the hearts of some. Many he will lull away into carnal security; others he flattereth, or he says there is no hell. He has lured and enlisted many followers with enticements of fame, riches, and power. He forges a Rembrandt-quality representation by calling evil good and good evil. He has confused many people, even nations and leaders, to the point of an immoral approach to moral issues.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p7" pid="F9iZt6aN0UGmv01c861yTA" hash="LC9Chw">Let me mention just three examples of voices that are ungodly and powerful among Satan’s many proclamations. First, he says individual agency is justification for the destruction of a human life through abortion; second, same-gender intimate associations and even marriages are acceptable; and third, chastity and fidelity are old-fashioned and narrow-minded—to be sexually active with free expression is acceptable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p8" pid="60PObfnDpkGfRkWmsj5hWw" hash="4SXlbQ">At this very moment, international heroes in sports, music, and movies not only live immoral lives but teach that immorality around the world through the powerful influence of the media. They are idolized and accepted by millions worldwide. The world in general seems to have lapsed into a coma of unrighteousness, leaving God-given and time-honored moral values and principles behind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p9" pid="LOJIJU6rlUWkLQ4zzG1g4w" hash="Kykzvg">The Brethren have said to push the world back. We are many more than the ten needed to save Sodom and Gomorrah. How will we fight this battle as it continues? The faithful Saints of God, with the undergirding of His holy priesthood, are the most powerful force on earth. We must hold fast to forceful proclamations from God regarding the sanctity of life, His eternal and never-ending instruction to be chaste and pure. His loving counsel that families are ordained of God with a father, mother, and children to live together forever was not intended to be the exception, but the rule. A return to Christ by an individual will bring peace of mind in place of turmoil, tranquillity to replace strife, courage and optimism in place of fear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p10" pid="1gYWFsvDb0mpnhOeoNF8Eg" hash="glIK5A">This Christ-centered way of living is not only for individuals but for families, entire governments, and nations, and will bring about similar results. For example, the individual or even a nation living a chaste and virtuous life has little to fear of the dread disease AIDS. Fatherless families created through strife and divorce would be virtually unknown.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p11" pid="wV8QkitFfkaBc5oswnYvdw" hash="-f-MuQ">As you survey your individual responsibility, where do you stand? There are symptoms or warnings of the descending path. Ten symptoms to be aware of might be:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p12" pid="BWDL3YNOwEOwUMxmXM-iIg" hash="ANIBew">Some are more familiar with the location of sand traps on the golf course or a good tennis backhand than with the location of lifesaving scriptures. Many search for happiness in current financial pages instead of the inspired counsel from prophets. I have observed that the great majority of people the world over waste and wear out their lives making major commitments of time and effort toward projects that have absolutely no exalting benefits yet have eternal consequences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p13" pid="ZQX6wvYowU6tOwuLZfRYvA" hash="mDpvng">We must be involved in a good and a righteous cause. We must see through the glass clearly, with an objective look at ourselves and families so as not to be caught in the second great calamitous worldwide flood that is even now all around us. It has been prophesied that the faithful will win this great war, that they will triumphantly rise up to meet the Lord Jesus Christ at the time of His second coming. The prescription for this victory includes daily individual and family prayers with a family home evening at least weekly. You may say, “I don’t have time.” Brothers and sisters, you simply cannot afford not to take the time. It is amazing how much time suddenly becomes available with the television off. This prescription continues the same as it has always been—keep the commandments; follow the prophets; read, understand, and even ponder the scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/a-strategy-for-war.p14" pid="zHk1eNj2okGqTT0ZgmqKkg" hash="8UlcXA">I testify that God lives, that His Son Jesus Christ has brought to pass the reality of the plan of redemption.
