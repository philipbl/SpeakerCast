Malik, former president of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In it he said that what is needed today is “the challenge of a truly universal message, a vision of something great and tremendous, a call to an heroic mission. … The immediate situation [he said] presents the aspect of a final and total judgment: everything is being weighed—one’s life, one’s values, one’s culture, the vitality of the whole civilization to which one belongs.</p>

And those who believe will tell you that God is there and that most certainly He watches over His own, even if He should sorely chasten them still.” (Quoted in <span class="emphasis">Public Speaker’s Treasure Chest </span>[Harper &amp; Row, 1964], p. 42.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-light-shineth.p6" guid="77c206d3-b596-419d-89cd-fc07b0b41d03" pid="lKnZeNydOUaBSYjH1BGbbg" hash="EzDQQw">In conversing with you this morning, my purpose is to emphasize the fact that in our troubled world there now is and has been for a hundred and forty years a safe and sure guiding light; a light destined to bring joy, peace, and happiness to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people who will follow it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-light-shineth.p7" guid="188f934c-5bf2-4491-a83d-e8a75ef48a7c" pid="gr-gLuikzUG4nNec2J_DEA" hash="tAYCaA">My witness to you is that our beloved Savior, Jesus Christ, while still in mortality, foresaw and foretold the circumstances in which we find ourselves today. He also at that time revealed the now impending consequences of our present course and prescribed the means he would make available for averting them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-light-shineth.p8" guid="307cbdc0-490b-4457-9bac-db31c1b8335e" pid="lX27_pwO0EedqIis9Yw9jQ" hash="x02Erw">What he then said was and is, in his view, of such importance to us that he has had a record of it preserved in three separate scriptures: the Bible (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.title" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24</a>), the Pearl of Great Price (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.title" class="scriptureRef">JS—M 1</a>), and the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-light-shineth.p9" guid="7c5d1929-90dd-47cb-80af-349276d15439" pid="LDD5cWyqS0qlt_wi8lYpLA" hash="ilJx8g">The circumstances under which he spoke are most impressive. As he went for the last time from Jerusalem to Bethany, he stood with his apostles on the Mount of Olives. Being concerned over his prediction that of the temple buildings there would not be left one stone upon another, they asked him for an explanation. “Tell us,” they said, “when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.3" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:3</a>.)</p>

I do, however, because of its relevance to our present and future welfare, invite you to seriously consider with me what he said about the signs of his second coming “and of the end of the world.” As to these events, he began by saying: “… when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-light-shineth.p11" guid="bbd07624-308a-410b-8e78-6180cdb62c14" pid="MpR7wfw3rE-22c-3snewnw" hash="fj5JAw">That this prediction referred to our day is established by the fact that that “light” spoken of broke forth in the spring of 1820 when the Father and the Son appeared to the boy prophet, Joseph Smith. During the years immediately following, “the fulness of [Christ’s] gospel” was restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-light-shineth.p12" guid="0f685c4c-edc9-443f-be12-51fbb8cf45b9" pid="-J6ED8sURESwBH6AKFgkTg" hash="Rk6rcQ">These great events were to, and did, usher in “the times of the Gentiles”—that is, the era in which, in this last dispensation, the gospel is to be preached primarily to the non-Jewish people of the earth. You will recall that in the meridian of time it went first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-light-shineth.p13" guid="043c67e8-d2c0-4f42-81c1-4ac02ca3f08a" pid="COzEkkh5jUOUqaPQbmKJ0Q" hash="LJbZ_w">But, back to what the Savior said:</p>

The large majority to whom the gospel has been taken reject it. It is because of this rejection, and not because there is no guiding light, that this generation has been and, unless it reverses its course, will continue to be unable to avoid the calamities foreseen and foretold by Jesus. For, said he, in that generation—that is, in which the gospel is preached—“they perceive not the light” (the Gospel of Jesus Christ) and “turn their hearts from me.</p>

It confirms the fact that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the sure light shining in the darkness of our troubled world. The gospel, restored through the Prophet Joseph, is the good doctor’s yearned-for “vision great and tremendous.” It sounds the “call to an heroic mission.” It is “the challenge of a truly universal message.” It is what the good doctor says is required today. It confirms his conclusion that the world’s “immediate situation presents the aspect of a final and total judgment: [that] everything is being weighed—one’s life, one’s values, one’s culture, the vitality of the whole civilization to which one belongs.” It confirms the fact that our times are not only “very much like the last day,” but it assures us that they are in very deed the last days and that God is truly “there” watching “over his own.”</p>

In the spring of 1820, stirred by a religious revival in the vicinity of Palmyra, New York, where he lived; perplexed by the conflicting claims of the churches; motivated by the admonition and promise of James, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, … and it shall be given him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a>), Joseph, in childlike faith, inquired of the Lord “which of all the sects was right,” that he “might know which to join.”</p>

It is true that they were known and taught and believed by members of the church of Christ in the days of Jesus and his apostles. But in 1830 an understanding of them had long since been lost. It was ignorance of a true knowledge of God and man’s relationship to him that spawned the many churches.</p>

He instructed them concerning, and showed them how to administer, the saving ordinances of his gospel.</p>

As part of the restoration of the gospel in this last dispensation, the Lord originally initiated the United Order observed by the people of Enoch. When its practice was terminated because the people of the Church couldn’t discipline themselves to obey it, the law of tithing was given.

The lives of those who have given it thought enough to realize its implications are controlled by it; it gives meaning and direction to all their thoughts and deeds. This is so because they know that it is the universal law of nature in the plant, animal, and human worlds for reproducing offspring to reach in final maturity the likeness of their parents.</p>

The plan provided that after a probationary period in mortality they should die—that is to say, their eternal spirit bodies and their corruptible mortal bodies would be separated. Later on, in resurrection, they would be reunited as immortal souls.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Saved</span> as here used means resurrected and returned as a sanctified, celestialized, immortal soul to the presence and society of God, there to pursue an endless course of eternal progress.</p>

God our Heavenly Father is in fact and reality the father of our spirits. We are “his offspring” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/17.28" class="scriptureRef">Acts 17:28</a>) as Paul declared in his great speech on Mars’ hill.</p>

He is a human mortal soul subject to death. Man’s body will upon death return to the earth from whence it sprang, and the spirit of man—what happens to it? Many people have pondered this all-important question. Shakespeare raised and commented upon it when he put into the mouth of Hamlet his famous “To be, or not to be” speech.</p>

(See <span class="emphasis">History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</span> 3:380.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p10" pid="IvMOVREbOkO2FnlKukhcXQ" hash="cw2Dvw">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that absolute integrity must precede the promise of eternal life. He said:</p>

As a matter of fact, his performance throughout distinguished careers of business and government has been so circumspect and courageous that his associates refer to him as “Mr. Integrity.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p16" pid="v5W9yNjNuEed9DY7cLZjIw" hash="Ls2R1A">I shall now call attention to some circumstances in which this matter of integrity is involved. Here is an account that you bearers of the Aaronic Priesthood might think about:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p17" pid="oMiwFE3cdUCVEHZrLIF26A" hash="-KHNHQ">“Four Latter-day Saint boys set out from a Utah city on a cross-country trip. They had saved all their money during the last year of high school for this purpose, and now that graduation was over, they packed their suitcases into the trunk of their car and said good-byes to worrying parents and envious friends. It was a matter of considerable celebration when they crossed the Utah State line and entered into another state. They pulled up alongside the highway and got out to see how it felt to be in new surroundings. A certain thrill of excitement was noted by each of the young travelers and a sense of adventure led them to great speculation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p18" pid="-x5TBbxyhU2lpIohMFGiDA" hash="TQBc6g">“They had agreed to send their parents a postcard every other day to indicate their whereabouts, and had promised to send a collect telegram if they ran into any trouble. One of the boys commented that it felt real good to be on his own and not be under the necessity of getting advance approval from someone for every move he made. Another suggested that they must act like seasoned travelers and not impress others as country boys on their first junket away from home. As a follow-up, this same boy proposed to his friends that they forget all about being Mormons for the duration of their adventure. Asked why by the other three puzzled boys, he said that they could now afford to ‘let their hair down’ and sample some of the excitement enjoyed by other people, not of the Mormon Church. ‘Anyway,’ he argued, ‘what difference will it make? Nobody out here in the world knows us or cares anything about our church connections.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p19" pid="P4khvTuTFU-nV9-Wo3Y3Cw" hash="LG7JmQ">“The thrill of the new experience weighted their judgment, and the group made an agreement to give it a try. They decided to announce themselves to the world as students from the East who had been to school in Utah for a short time. Their Utah license plates made this necessary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p20" pid="NDDS0Hv6s0WB9xPTQE9Piw" hash="gYckJw">“Nightfall on the first day of the journey found them at a famous tourist attraction spot, and they made arrangements for camping near the resort. After the evening meal they gathered at the large hotel for the night’s entertainment. No sooner had they arrived when the ringleader of the boys suggested that they begin here and now sampling the things they had so long been denied by strict parents and teachers. The first thing that caught their eyes was a large neon sign at the far end of the lounge. It read, ‘Bar—beer, cocktails.’ Thinking it a moderate nod in the direction of ‘sinning just a little bit,’ they agreed to go into the bar and order a glass of beer for each one. There was a nervous air about them as they entered the gaudily lighted bar and surveyed the counters loaded with intriguing bottles of liquor. The boy who had been delegated to give the order lost his voice on the first try and had to swallow hard to get out an understandable, ‘Four glasses of beer, please.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p21" pid="tQ4z1VL810aS8WOdKWxBNg" hash="79z_1w">“What the beer lacked in palatability, the atmosphere and thrill more than made up. They grew bolder and began to talk of the next adventure they would undertake. The talk was growing racy when suddenly a well-dressed man entered the bar and walked straight toward their table. The look on the stranger’s face and the determined pace at which he walked toward them left the boys completely unnerved.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p22" pid="F6lwPvlRMk-PDNuLFORQIQ" hash="KHGRBg">“When the man reached the table at which the boys were sitting, he extended his hand to one of them and said, ‘I beg your pardon, but aren’t you George Redford’s son from Utah?’ The boy was speechless and terrified. His fingers froze around the base of the glass of beer and he answered in a wavering voice, ‘Why, yes, sir, I am.’ ‘I thought I recognized you when you came in the lobby of the hotel,’ the stranger continued. ‘I am Henry Paulsen, vice-president of the company your dad works for, and I met you and your mother last winter at a company dinner at the Hotel Utah. I have never forgotten how you explained your Mormon priesthood to one of the other executives of our company who asked you what it meant to be a Mormon boy. I must say I was a little surprised to see you head for the bar, but I suppose that with Mormons as well as non-Mormons, boys will be boys when they’re off the roost.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p23" pid="_knjwXGS80m1nW_NyLUyuA" hash="RRm0fQ">“These boys had heard a sermon they would never hear duplicated in the pulpit. They were sick, ashamed, and crestfallen. As they left their half-filled glasses and walked out through the hotel lobby, they had the feeling that everyone was looking at them. The cover of darkness was kind as they made their way to their camp. ‘You just can’t win,’ said the boy who had proposed their dropping their true identity, trying to ease the tension. ‘I’m not so sure,’ replied the boy to who the stranger had spoken. ‘If we have any sense left, we can make this experience into the most winning lesson of our lives.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p24" pid="n-s4vXNyo0inUagVtTofXw" hash="2AxDBg">Here is another experience—an experience of President Joseph F. Smith reported by the late President Charles W. Nibley, which you young elders might ponder to your profit:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p25" pid="zK-OTZQ-2Eeg8a17yx1zrQ" hash="XDLf1A">“Another incident which I have heard him relate,” says Brother Nibley, speaking about President Joseph F. Smith, who was the president of the Church and father of our late president, Joseph Fielding Smith, “which shows his courage and integrity, occurred when he was returning from his mission to the Sandwich Islands, in the fall of 1857. He came home by way of Los Angeles, by what was called the Southern Route. In that year Johnston’s Army was on the move for Utah, and naturally enough there was much excitement and bitterness of feeling concerning the ‘Mormons.’ In southern California, just after the little train of wagons had traveled only a short distance and made their camp, several anti-‘Mormon’ toughs rode into the camp on horseback, cursing and swearing and threatening what they would do to the ‘Mormons.’ Joseph F. was a little distance from the camp gathering wood for the fire, but he saw that the few members of his own party had cautiously gone into the brush down the creek, out of sight. When he saw that, he told me,” says Brother Nibley, “the thought came into his mind, ‘Shall I run from these fellows? Why should I fear them?’ With that he marched up with his arm full of wood to the campfire where one of the ruffians, still with his pistol in his hand, shouting and cursing about the ‘Mormons,’ in a loud voice said to Joseph F.:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p26" pid="6zkT-aaz4EehFZyVtErgSQ" hash="Qvw8mA">“‘Are you a ‘Mormon?’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p27" pid="reCft9cu10W0b3sSHIkoow" hash="CwWzFg">“And the answer came straight, ‘Yes, siree; dyed in the wool; true blue, through and through.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p28" pid="XE6ycYUDp0yQwYBmaVr23g" hash="9OejnQ">“At that the ruffian grasped him by the hand and said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p29" pid="5m_zxtIv30uebW9V7rslaA" hash="fMIT6w">“‘Well, you are the ---- ---- pleasantest man I ever met! Shake, young fellow, I am glad to see a man that stands up for his convictions.’” (Joseph F. Smith, <span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> Deseret Book Co., 1939 ed., p. 518.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p30" pid="7LrUk2arqEKQrdWAyEFPlw" hash="ZjEwlQ">Abraham Lincoln demonstrated his great integrity in his famous house-divided speech. John Wesley Hill, in his book <span class="emphasis">Abraham Lincoln—Man of God,</span> says: “Lincoln showed his independence and tenacity of purpose when he wrote his address accepting the nomination for United States Senator. … This is known as ‘The House Divided Against Itself’ speech. It embodied the historic declaration that the Union could not exist ‘half slave and half free.’ To his friend, Jesse K. Dubois, Lincoln said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p31" pid="y6ACOGDnbkqHBEwMpXpywA" hash="gfa6_A">“‘I refused to read the passage about the house divided against itself to you, because I knew you would ask me to change or modify it, and that I was determined not to do. I had willed it so and was willing, if necessary, to perish with it. I would rather be defeated with this expression in the speech … than to be victorious without it.’” (<span class="emphasis">Abraham Lincoln—Man of God,</span> New York and London: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1927, p. 151.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p32" pid="oOSQ4Nfm2EWYvv7if4PBXQ" hash="99RM4A">Now it took real courage for Lincoln to leave that “half slave and half free” sentence in his speech. He was ambitious, and it seemed that through the Senate was the way to the presidency, but the political climate at the time was not ready for the stand he took on that issue. The probability was that the statement would mean defeat in his race for the Senate, and that’s what it turned out to be. All this Lincoln well knew; nevertheless, he had the integrity to act in harmony with his convictions. Although his course did shut the door to the Senate, fortunately for the country, it later opened the door to the presidency.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p33" pid="sw0GwBgVnEWcnKZCPY0EOg" hash="697qqA">President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., was a man of like integrity. As a young man he presided for a short time over the Southern Branch of the State Normal College in Cedar City, Utah. He developed a great interest in that institution.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p34" pid="H4M2ijgz0U-IHg0XUYYuyQ" hash="Ar38XA">“Two years later … his help was solicited to give encouragement to members of the legislature to provide the funds which had been requested by the institution.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p35" pid="n0AzYbJu4k6XwT-0ByUqPw" hash="IMXXLQ">Responding by letter he “explained in utter frankness and candor that he could not support the … request” for $100,000.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p36" pid="Q4j-kOIIQkyhvbXFpTlZYw" hash="5w56lQ">“‘… Frankly and freely,’ he said, ‘I believe you are asking too much. …</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p38" pid="CwWO0ZfT0kivUYNUnM15Ew" hash="YJ2OjQ">“‘If you would say that you will drop the $100,000 and work for the $54,000 you may count on my active cooperation to the very limit of my poor ability; but if you still reach after the larger amount, you will at once see it will be better if I keep quiet; and I promise you that I shall do that.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p39" pid="tyt8bIYXy0-JSWU8Qk9dxA" hash="cDzsrA">“The frankness in this letter was to become a distinguishing characteristic of [President] Clark’s correspondence and dealings with men throughout his long career. Although his recommendations many times did not contain what others had hoped to receive, nonetheless his candor and complete honesty contributed greatly to men’s confidence in him for they knew they could depend upon him to say what he really thought.” (David H. Yarn, Jr., <span class="emphasis">Young Reuben,</span> Brigham Young University Press, Provo, Utah, pp. 113–14.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p40" pid="n-u16qatR0-1K_NfTrMnJg" hash="YKlXbA">How glorious, men of the priesthood, it would be if all of us possessed the integrity of a President Kimball, a Nathan Eldon Tanner, a Joseph F. Smith, an Abraham Lincoln, or a J. Reuben Clark, Jr. The Lord expects that from us, his priesthood bearers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/integrity.p41" pid="4H7Nj0JlVEWVPyiPXx-iog" hash="kneShg">God help us that we may think about this great quality of integrity and live lives of integrity, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

You will recall that while Lehi and his family were encamped in the valley of Lemuel, the Lord instructed him to send his sons back to Jerusalem and obtain from Laban the records. Laman and Lemuel murmured that it was “a hard thing” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.5" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:5</a>), but Nephi, their younger brother, said: “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:7</a>.)</p>

He knew he couldn’t get them, and he proved it. He said they were to return to their father.

In 597 <small>B.C.</small>, which was just three years after Lehi left, Daniel was carried into Babylon captivity by Nebuchadnezzar. He began to demonstrate his courage soon after he got there when he and Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to “defile himself” with the king’s meat and wine.

The scriptures respond to these questions. They make it clear that the spirit person Jesus Christ—as are the spirits of all men—is the Son of God, our Eternal Father. In this respect he is like all other men. He differs from all other men, however, by reason of the fact that men’s bodies are begotten of mortal men and are, therefore, subject to death, being descendants and inheritors from Adam, while Christ’s physical body was begotten of God, our Heavenly Father—an immortal being not subject to death. Christ, therefore, inherited from his Father the faculty to live on indefinitely. He had power over life and death, as witness his own declaration to the Pharisees:</p>

I know by the spirit of the Holy Ghost that they are true. Jesus lives; he is the Son of God. He came to earth as the Only Begotten of the Father. He conquered death, raised his own body from the grave, and implemented the power of resurrection for all men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/easter-thoughts.p81" pid="JPC8vvkfkkmM85bPc7fdOw" hash="rufMHQ">I know that through his suffering in Gethsemane and during his crucifixion he brought about the means by which, through repentance and obedience to the laws of his gospel, we may be raised not only to immortality but also to eternal life, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God. To this I bear solemn witness in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen.</p>

While <span class="emphasis">conversion</span> may be accomplished in stages, one is not really converted in the full sense of the term unless and until he is at heart a new person. <span class="emphasis">Born again</span> is the scriptural term.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/welfare-services.p1" pid="MQYFiUrjaEyTHThK3sSZUQ" hash="g7Perg">Brethren and sisters, after what I’ve heard here today—certainly a full coverage of the subject—I am reminded of an experience I had some years ago. I believe it was one of the few times, if not the only time, that we General Authorities were asked by the Brethren to treat a certain subject at a stake conference. That week I went to Richfield, and Brother Clifford Young went over to Monroe. They had a chorus of young folks from the school sing at Richfield while I was there in the morning and then they went over to Monroe in the afternoon and sang where Brother Young was. It happened that I talked about the assigned subject in the morning, and Clifford talked about it in the afternoon. When we made our report to the Council of the Twelve, Brother Young said it had been a fine occasion; the only bad thing about it was that those students had had to listen to the same subject twice. President George F. Richards, then president of the Twelve, said, “Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that. I don’t suppose they knew you were talking about the same subject.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/welfare-services.p2" pid="qfsCFi0qYkK-cQnsgKXwhw" hash="U39rsw">I believe that in the remarks I shall now make, you will be able to understand that I am talking about the same subject the Brethren covered this morning in that wonderful presentation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/welfare-services.p3" pid="xaRk2h5-f0mbEr9c4HAv7w" hash="l4zuhA">As Bishop Brown said, the Welfare Services Department of the Church comprises the three programs: the original welfare program, which he characterized as the production program, the personal services, and the health services. Of these three programs, the first organized was the old welfare program, now termed the Production-Distribution program. This program concerns the implementation of the Lord’s declaration, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 3:19</a>); and also the second great commandment, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/12.31" class="scriptureRef">Mark 12:31</a>).</p>

At the same time he told them that if they did not do so, they were not his disciples. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38</a>.)</p>

This the expedition was unable to do. On Fishing River, Missouri, June 22, 1834, the Lord explained the reason for the failure of their putting the Saints back in their homes, as follows:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/welfare-services.p21" pid="4wbQvPcA-UWPwde55zODmA" hash="pG6VHA">But the next Churchwide program oriented toward the principles of the united order was our welfare program. In the October conference of 1936, President Heber J. Grant read “The Message of the First Presidency to the Church” from which I want to quote this morning. In doing so, I shall substitute the word <span class="emphasis">welfare</span> for the word <span class="emphasis">security.</span> This change in wording was made by President Grant shortly after the program was announced.</p>

I well remember that immediately thereafter—pursuant to this counsel—we built, in the basement of our ward meetinghouse, some storage closets and gathered clothing and basic food needs.</p>

The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership.</p>

Thereafter, each year for fifteen years, I was assigned by the Brethren to meet with stake and ward leadership of all stakes in the United States and Canada. This, with my traveling companions, I did. Our responsibility was to teach the program, assign a production budget for the ensuing year, and to urge each bishop, individually or in cooperation with other bishops, to acquire a production project.</p>

After exchanging a few pleasantries, he, responding to my inquiry, told me about his business activities. He then inquired about mine. This, of course, led to a gospel discussion. He had no religion, although he said his mother was a Christian. He had no concept of a God, no idea whether he had had a pre-earth existence or whether he would live on after death. He had no purpose in life except to work hard and obtain a “reasonable standard of living.” After discussing a few fundamental gospel truths, he responded: “Such concepts would surely give one an objective to live for.”</p>

This statement required some explanation because, as he pointed out, our physical bodies are the offspring of our mortal parents.

This opened the way for an explanation that God himself is a soul, composed of a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s, and a spirit; that he is a resurrected, glorified, exalted, omniscient, omnipotent, and—in spirit, and power, and influence—an omnipresent person, the ruler of the heavens and the earth and all things therein; that the spirits of all men are literally his “begotten sons and daughters.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:24</a>.)</p>

I further explained to him that this mortal probation provides us the opportunity to, while walking by faith, prove ourselves worthy to go on to perfection and exaltation in the likeness of our heavenly parents.</p>

Howard of Rockford College, at the 101st annual commencement exercises of Brigham Young University, April 23, 1976. After noting the appalling rate of crime in our midst, he said:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/we-believe-in-being-honest.p3" pid="LTeenJJPYUa1aS0y-k0q1g" hash="h8q_wA">“The swelling tide of crime is matched by the deluge of dishonesty—and I think that word is adequate and accurate. The tide of crime is matched by the deluge of dishonesty on the part of politicians who promise what they know they cannot deliver and who try to deceive the people into believing that projects can always be paid for out of somebody else’s pocket. Wherever one looks a narrow concern for self-advantage seems to prevail over any thought of the well-being of the society. Principles seem to be overwhelmed by expediency. …</p>

In many places the honor system, which was once a manifestation of honorable people working together, has been discarded. The old concept of honor based on integrity has … yielded to a new code of honor based on dishonesty—also known as honor among thieves, which is, in fact, the source of the term <span class="emphasis">ratting.</span>” (President John A.

Rather, I shall limit what I say in these remarks to the first phrase of the article: “We believe in being honest.” And since there are endless ways of being honest and dishonest, I shall further limit my remarks to the one definition of honesty which reads: “Honesty implies freedom from lying, stealing, cheating, and bearing false witness.” I shall not always attempt to distinguish between lying and bearing false witness, nor between stealing and cheating.</p>

But finally he warmed up a little and said that when the missionaries had nothing else to do he would listen to them. Sometime thereafter when a wet and windy storm drove them in from tracting, finding him alone, they gave him the first missionary lesson. He didn’t exhibit much interest at first, but when they had concluded, he stood up and said, in effect:</p>

How much of a storm does it take to drive me in? My observations tell me that many of us priesthood bearers need to stir up the gifts of God which have been conferred upon us by the laying on of hands. One way for us to do this is to constantly sharpen and deepen our understanding of the gospel through self-disciplined study.</p>

Indeed, the fundamental principle of the system was the private ownership of property. Each man owned his portion, or inheritance, or stewardship, with an absolute title, which, at his option, he could alienate, keep and operate, or otherwise treat as his own. The Church did not own all of the property, and life under the united order was not, and never will be, a communal life, as the Prophet Joseph himself said.</p>

This surplus went into a storehouse, from which stewardships were given to others, and from which the needs of the poor were supplied.</p>

However, there are a number of concepts which must prevail in order for this ideal to be realized. Chief among these concepts are the following:</p><ol class="number"><li pid="bUcD5uB5qEm3cScVmwGiTg" hash="RIL_mw">
          <span class="label">1.</span>
          <p pid="cEROR0eq50KOeXj1M0YWJg" hash="MQFt2g">
            <span class="emphasis">A belief in God</span> and acceptance of Him as Lord of the earth and the author of the united order. Through it we seek righteousness and spiritual development. “For,” declared the Lord, “if ye are not <span class="emphasis">equal in earthly things ye cannot be equal in obtaining heavenly things;</span></p>
          <p pid="uD1zf4edkkaNHu2o1iel5Q" hash="5RskEw">“For if you will,” he continued, “that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you and required of you. …</p>
          <p pid="NWXpwlYY9UmBDV2bO84dDA" hash="2miHRw">“That you may come up unto the crown prepared for you, and be made rulers over many kingdoms, saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Zion.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.6-7,15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:6–7, 15</a>; italics added.)</p>
        </li><li pid="UmYi80HDr0aiXpZL9qvBpg" hash="fhNmoA">

          <p pid="g9Cy10Dce0C3yfSnavtm7w" hash="GdIjsQ">As to property, in harmony with Church belief as set forth in the Doctrine and Covenants, “no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience, [and] the right and control of property.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/134.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 134:2</a>.) The united order is operated upon the principle of <span class="emphasis">private ownership and individual management.</span> Thus, in both ownership and management of property, the united order preserved to men their God-given agency. In this way, He holds each steward accountable for his own work and productivity. Indeed, He said:</p>
          <p pid="Pi7aXbu3O0G-paGaxPS0QA" hash="lhkjew">“For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable, as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for my creatures.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 104:13</a>.)</p>
          <p pid="djE6mytB3UyBEI4NacGggg" hash="dGMEeQ">You can see from this the truth of President Clark’s statement when he said:</p>
          <p pid="rzWBou9O706UZDImI1uLTg" hash="x5IA-w">“The Church never was, and under existing commandments never will be, a communal society, under the directions thus far given by the Lord. The United Order was not communal nor communistic. It was completely and intensely individualistic, with a consecration of unneeded surpluses for the support of the Church and the poor.” (J. Reuben Clark, Jr., “The United Order and Law of Consecration As Set Out in the Revelations of the Lord,” from a pamphlet of articles reprinted from the Church Section of the <span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> 1942, pp. 26–27.)</p>

            <span class="emphasis">The united order is nonpolitical.</span> It is therefore totally unlike the various forms of socialism, which are political, both in theory and in practice. They are thus exposed to, and riddled by, the corruption which plagues and finally destroys all political governments which undertake to abridge man’s agency.</p>

            <span class="emphasis">The united order exalts the poor and humbles the rich.</span> In the process both are sanctified. The poor, released from the bondage and humiliating limitations of poverty, are enabled as free men to rise to their full potential, both temporally and spiritually. The rich, by consecration and by imparting of their surplus for the benefit of the poor, not by constraint, but willingly as an act of free will, evidence that charity for their fellowmen characterized by Mormon as “the pure love of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>.) In this way they qualify to “become the sons of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:48</a>.)</p>

In the meantime—while we are being more perfectly taught and are gaining experience—we should be strictly living the principles of the united order insofar as they are embodied in present Church requirements, such as tithing, fast offerings, welfare projects, storehouses, and other principles and practices. Through these programs we should, as individuals, implement in our own lives the bases of the united order.</p>

This law, still in force, implements to a degree at least the united order principle of stewardship.

Forgotten is the fact that our assignment is to use these many resources in our families and quorums to build up the kingdom of God—to further the missionary effort and the genealogical and temple work; to raise our children up as fruitful servants unto the Lord; to bless others in every way, that they may also be fruitful. Instead, we expend these blessings on our own desires, and as Moroni said, ‘Ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not.’ (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.39" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:39</a>.)</p>

In the <span class="emphasis">Bishops Guide</span> the duties of the bishop are outlined under five major categories; one of these is entitled “Director of Welfare Services.” On pages 24 to 26 of this guide, the specific duties of bishops are listed. They, together with the instructions in the <span class="emphasis">Welfare Services Handbook,</span> should be read, studied, and implemented by every bishop.</p>

This could not be a mere cursory operation. … To be effective, [it] must be one that involved the visiting, by some proper authority, … every household in the ward, and for a final check, a visit by the bishop himself, to determine the proper help he must be prepared to render to every needy person in the ward.” (“Fundamentals of Church Welfare Plan,” Bishops Meeting, October 6, 1944, p. 567.)</p>

The Ward Welfare Services Committee has been provided to help him do this. The Ward Welfare Services Committee can be of inestimable value. I remember president Lee’s saying that an inactive bishop is one who does not hold his weekly Ward Welfare Services Committee Meeting. I hope that we do not have inactive bishops in the Church today. If there are such, they should repent and become active during this coming week and continue to be active.</p>

[It] seeks to respond to many problems that beset our members in an affluent society, and it will no doubt increase in its importance, because so many of the problems which this cluster of agencies deals with are symptomatic of our time. Members may need counseling more than clothing, and members, who, through bishops, are referred to any agency in our social services program should feel no more hesitancy in asking for help of this kind than they should in requesting help through the priesthood [production] program.”</p>

They do not, of course, have the obligation prescribed to the bishop, although they should and do assist in the production and gathering of materials.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p22" pid="z-JdQNXmtEOH-9Y2LsQ5wA" hash="99sVCA">But the relationship of the priesthood, the spirit of lofty, unselfish brotherhood which it carries with it, does require that they individually and as quorums use their means and energy in rehabilitating spiritually and temporally their erring and unfortunate brethren.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p23" pid="OEiJspREIky5mVqJV2RdfQ" hash="zzlOZA">In his temporal administrations, the bishop looks at every needy person as a temporary problem, caring for them until they can help themselves. The priesthood quorums must look at their needy brethren as a continuing problem, until not only their temporal needs are met but their spiritual ones also.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/the-role-of-bishops-in-welfare-services.p24" pid="Sl_dbbeLo0mOYIO4Ho88tQ" hash="ATygCg">As a concrete example: a bishop extends help while the artist or craftsman is out of work and in want; a priesthood quorum sets him up in work and tries to see that he goes along until fully self-supporting and active in his priesthood duties. Much, much more attention must be given to this aspect of our welfare work.</p>

Specifically, it is that help given by a bishop is far different from help given for political, social, or economic considerations in which moral and spiritual considerations play only a secondary part. The welfare of the state, not the welfare of the individual, is the measure by which that kind of relief is gauged and its amount determined. In such relief special favors are frequently given in exchange for some special favor—usually political support—to be given in return. Such a prostitution of relief is destructive of the state and of the individual and must be carefully guarded against.</p>

But in this giving, the emphasis is rather on the giver than the receiver. There can be a distinct element of selfishness in this—one may give, because to do so makes him truly religious.</p>

Our efforts to activate her have been fruitless. Recently she has completely changed. She pays her tithing, attends sacrament meetings regularly, and participates in all Church activities. When asked what caused the reformation, she said: ‘I went to Salt Lake City to the funeral of my mother. During the services a man by the name of Romney spoke. After he had given an ordinary talk, I thought he was going to sit down; but instead he turned around to the pulpit and bore a testimony which greatly impressed me. It awakened in me a desire to live as my mother had always taught me.’”</p>

We must have this law in mind in all that we do in our welfare work. We must love our neighbors as ourselves. The Savior put this law second only to the love of God when He said:</p>

He goes into great detail and then he says that “after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need—I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.” (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.17-38" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:17–38</a>.)</p>

Wells. That was forty-two and a half years ago.

These are in the nature of covenants which men make with their fellowmen.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1936, p. 41.)</p>

Such a covenant God has made with every one of us. He has entered into an agreement with us. If you will do all things which the Lord your God shall command you; if you will do his will, you shall have glory added upon your heads forever and ever. That is the pledge, and God keeps his covenant and we should do the same.</p>

Not by signing a written instrument. True. But in a most impressive manner and a most authoritative manner. The Lord commissions his servants, bestows upon them his priesthood and authorizes them to perform sacred ordinances, the same as if he had signed it in person. They call attention to the necessity of following the Lord Jesus Christ and obeying his Gospel, doing all things whatsoever the Lord shall command us. That is the contract, and we enter into it in a most solemn way. What is the formality of it, if not by writing with pen and ink? It is by baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. What a wonderful and impressive formality! Could anything be more so? In baptism by immersion we symbolize both death and life, for as the Apostle Paul explains: ‘We are buried with [Christ] by baptism into death’ and brought forth out of the watery grave in likeness of his glorious resurrection.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1936, p. 41.)</p>

What I have to say I think would be applicable to all of us, however. I would like to start with Alma’s testimony to his son. He testified “that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:3</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="oq3dBTk4lU2X4pAM_SRlWA" hash="doGtgg">This reference to the destroying angel passing by the children of Israel refers to the occasion when, to persuade the Egyptians to let Israel go, “the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="bf7O-5JuOUGnbmricB9aOw" hash="PGEeUQ">“… and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/12.29-30" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 12:29–30</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="AAObHkxs00KA7yt6jWsh6A" hash="ujiaIA">It appears from the Word of Wisdom and other scriptures that there are destroying angels who have a work to do among the peoples of the earth in this last dispensation. The Lord told the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1831 that because all flesh was corrupted before him, and because the powers of darkness prevailed upon the earth, these angels were “waiting the great command to reap down the earth, to gather the tares that they [might] be burned” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="ty8SLfGv90yc85eLis8c3A" hash="pGIoQA">In 1894 President Woodruff said: “God has held the angels of destruction for many years, lest they should reap down the wheat with the tares. But I want to tell you now, that those angels have left the portals of heaven, and they stand over this people and this nation now, and are hovering over the earth waiting to pour out the judgments. And from this very day they shall be poured out. Calamities and troubles are increasing in the earth, and there is a meaning to these things.” (<span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> Oct. 1914, p. 1165.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="4cybgRAVxUO3WpApCCFFKA" hash="hMaJyw">Now, my beloved brethren, in view of this revealed knowledge and understanding which the Lord has given concerning what is transpiring about us, is it not a glorious thing to have the assurance that if we will clothe ourselves with bodies purified through observance of the Word of Wisdom, these destroying angels will pass us by, as they did the children of Israel, and not slay us? Well, this is one of the blessings to follow observance of the Word of Wisdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="jfHbgKTznEqUMDR9AnEGeA" hash="0JTsIQ">The promised blessings for obedience to the law of tithing are just as specific as are those for obedience to the Word of Wisdom. One of them has to do with the productivity of the soil. I remember being impressed with this thought many years ago as I listened to the remarks of Elder James E. Talmage, who was one of our great apostles when I was young. “Do you know,” said he, “that the soil can be sanctified by the tithing of its products? The land can be sanctified. There is a relationship between the elements and forces of nature, and the actions of men.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1929, p. 68.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="nx4kdHR7N02dBC9zGfQ7PA" hash="Ov4I8Q">This statement is in harmony with the sentiments of President Brigham Young. “Talk about these rich valleys,” said President Young, “why there is not another people on the earth that could have come here and lived. We prayed over the land, and dedicated it and the water, air and everything pertaining to them unto the Lord, and the smiles of Heaven rested on the land and it became productive.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 12:288.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="vsOEMVE64Ei6R-232BSrMQ" hash="JP3lxw">President Grant’s boundless faith that the Lord would prosper those who were liberal with their means in building his kingdom has had a distinct effect upon my life. Many years ago I heard him tell about attending a fast meeting at which his bishop made an appeal for donations. President Grant, though a very young man, had fifty dollars in his pocket which he intended to deposit in the bank. But he was so impressed by the bishop’s appeal that he tendered the whole fifty dollars. The bishop took five dollars and handed him back the forty-five, stating that five dollars was his full share. President Grant replied, “Bishop Woolley, by what right do you rob me of putting the Lord in my debt? Didn’t you preach here today that the Lord rewards fourfold? My mother is a widow and she needs two hundred dollars.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="_-AcUyMNrUmctKG8_wgv-Q" hash="C7Fu1w">“My boy,” queried the bishop, “do you believe that if I take this other forty-five dollars you will get your two hundred dollars quicker?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="DF7mHJJBkE2uKOzdBrYBHQ" hash="LFriBA">“Certainly,” replied President Grant.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="ItunOeZL0kKkkdqMQwhemw" hash="LVZn2g">President Grant testified that on his way from that fast meeting back to work, “an idea popped into” his head, acting upon which he made $218.50. Speaking about this incident years later, he said, “Someone will say that it would have happened anyway.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/trust-in-the-lord.p" pid="lK4_uFD5tEOewHmSlpBYVw" hash="5bOM1Q">“I do not think it would have happened. I do not think I would have got the idea, …” he said.</p>

But I believe He also gives us blessings of a temporal nature.” (<span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> Aug. 1939, p. 457.)</p>

In the eighty-fifth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord explains that his purpose in tithing his people is “to prepare them against the day of vengeance and burning,” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/85.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 85:3</a>) and in the sixty-fourth section he says, “Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:23</a>).</p>

You will remember, too, these words from Paul’s epistle to the Corinthians:</p>

He and I were standing in the railroad station in Rexburg, Idaho, in the early morning of November 12, 1920. We heard the train whistle and knew that in three minutes I would be on my way to Australia to fill a mission. In that short interval my father said to me, among other things, “My son, you are going a long way from home. But your mother and I, your brother and sisters, will be with you constantly in our thoughts and prayers, we shall rejoice with you in your successes, and we shall sorrow with you in your disappointments. When you are released and return, we shall be glad to greet you and welcome you back into the family circle. But remember this, my son, we would rather come to this station and take your body off the train in a casket than to have you come home unclean, having lost your virtue.”</p>

And not only shall they see the Lord, but they shall feel at home in his presence.</p>

Let us not be like some people were in the days of Malachi. They argued that it was unprofitable and vain to serve God because, as they saw it, the proud were made happy, the wicked set up, and they that tempted God were delivered (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.14-15" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:14–15</a>). Let us have the good sense to realize and remember that today, as well as in the days of Malachi, a book of remembrance is written before the Lord for those that fear him and think upon his name, and “they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</p>

This book is a translation of an ancient record inscribed on gold plates which, in September 1827, were delivered by an angel to Joseph Smith, a twenty-one-year-old youth.</p>

He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in [the record]. …</p>

He was an able military leader in his day, a learned historian, and a great prophet. He lived in America during the last half of the fourth century <small>A.D.</small> The book bears his name because he made a compilation and an abridgment of the then extant historical records. His abridgment constituted most of what Joseph Smith translated from the gold plates, which he received from Moroni, who had deposited them in the Hill Cumorah, located in western New York state, in about <small>A.D.</small> 421.</p>

This practice, if fully adopted, will change any society from one of freedom to one of slavery. Let us contend for the gospel of work. Let us be self-reliant. Salvation is an individual matter. There will be no mass salvation. Some have mistakenly concluded from Paul’s statement—“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.8-9" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:8–9</a>)—some have erroneously concluded from this statement that works are not necessary.</p>

There will be no government dole which can get us through the pearly gates. Nor will anyone go through those gates who wants to go through on the efforts of another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fundamental-welfare-services.p" pid="Y_gDtuLLG0-IfoSi5N7-Dg" hash="vOAUXQ">The first principle of action in Church Welfare is, therefore, for us to take care of ourselves as far as possible.</p>

You ought to now, more than at any previous time, make sure that you are prepared to go through a period of stress on the resources you have provided for yourselves. The necessity to do this may come any day. I hope it will not come too soon. In fact, I hope it doesn’t come in my lifetime. But it will come sooner or later.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fundamental-welfare-services.p" pid="vA3HZBuHpEW_GhEYXgKmPA" hash="ZHqxnw">Never forget this matter of providing for yourselves, even though you don’t hear as much about it now as you did a few years ago. Remember that it is still a fundamental principle, one that has been taught the Saints ever since they came to these valleys of the mountains. We have always been urged to provide ourselves, in the day of harvest, enough to last until the next harvest. Be sure that you do so now. Be prepared to take care of yourselves through a period of need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fundamental-welfare-services.p" pid="GwFrtC8l5E-507mRuvhu8w" hash="9uhidA">I don’t know how things will work out. People say to me, “What will we do? If we have a year’s supply and others do not, it will be gone in a day.” Well, it will last as long as it lasts, but I’m not worried about that. If we will do what the Lord tells us to do, he will take care of us all right.</p>

When they got to the Red Sea, Pharaoh’s armies caught up with them. I suppose they were worried, wondering how they could escape from that army. They did not know, but the Lord knew. When the time came, he simply said to Moses, “Lift … up [your] rod” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/14.16" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 14:16</a>). He did, and a dry-land passage through the Red Sea appeared, and they went through without the loss of a man. <span class="emphasis">They never would have been thus protected and saved if they had not been doing what the Lord directed them to do.</span></p>

I would like you to know that there are great rewards for so doing—both spiritual and temporal rewards. The Lord says that the efficacy of our prayers depends upon our liberality to the poor. Way back in the days of Isaiah, he made this clear. When at that time the people complained, “Wherefore have we fasted … and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/58.3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 58:3</a>), the Lord responded with this question:</p>

We are prone to get a headache when we fast, and sometimes we pretend to be starving to death. To ancient Israel the Lord put the question:</p>

This great prophet was a missionary companion of Alma. One of the greatest sermons in the Book of Mormon is the one preached by him as recorded in the thirty-fourth chapter of Alma. Having first explained to his hearers the atonement of Christ, he continued, “Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.17" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:17</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/fundamental-welfare-services.p" pid="9G1_yXc9uECHtKEttGgNUg" hash="ES5p1A">“Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.28-29" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:28–29</a>.)</p>

I understand from them that the Lord claims the earth as his, that it is not yours and mine to own and manage independently of him. No matter how many stocks and bonds or how much land and other properties we possess, they are not wholly ours. They are the Lord’s. He further says that he owns and gives to us all the blessings we have and that he makes us stewards over them, responsible to him. He makes it clear that it is his purpose to provide for his Saints, but he requires that it be done in his way, which way, he explains, is for those who <span class="emphasis">have</span> to contribute to those who <span class="emphasis">have not.</span> Having made us stewards, he gives us our agency, however, and then lays down the condition that if we accept these blessings and refuse to contribute our share for the care of the poor, we shall go to—well, he tells us where we shall go. I shall now read to you from the revelation:</p>

For years I have had the privilege of traveling throughout the Church and meeting with stake presidents in regional welfare meetings. I know how important it is for you to meet and conduct business at the region and multiregion levels. We have formalized this morning something that many of us in welfare have done for years. But while we have been at this welfare business for quite some time, there is still much to do. Therefore, I would like to suggest how these region, multiregion, and area councils are to build the welfare work.</p>

Because of the similarity of Welfare Services work to the work done through the temporal arm under the direction of the Presiding Bishopric, the Welfare Services Department reports to the General Welfare Services Committee through the Presiding Bishopric. However, it serves as a resource to the ecclesiastical and the temporal lines, both of which play a significant role in welfare services.</p>

Today, in the various handbooks of the priesthood, you will find four major categories of duties appointed unto the ward bishop. Except for those duties which are unique to the Presiding Bishopric of the Church and those which were made inoperative at the time the formal law of consecration was suspended, the role of the bishop today is essentially the same as was defined in these early revelations. Bishops have been given added responsibilities for the youth and as presiding high priest of the ward. However, of all of the bishop’s assignments, as important as each one is, none is more important than care for the poor.</p>

The bishop’s knowledge of his membership should come from following the counsel of the Lord to search after the poor.</p>

A Needs and Resources Analysis form has been provided by the Welfare Services Department to assist in this evaluation. Need may arise from any one of a number of causes, such as injuries, infirmity, unemployment, lack of education, poor management, or physical or mental deficiencies. Regardless of the kind or scope of problems, the bishop must learn the cause of the difficulty, how serious it is, and who can help in the solution.</p>

She should prepare a report and recommendation to help the bishop in his deliberations. With all the pertinent facts at hand, the bishop, acting as common judge, should decide what assistance is to be given.</p>

In the process, he should teach the fundamentals of Church welfare assistance, including self-help, family assistance, and Church responsibility. In an appropriate way, the bishop should determine if those directly involved have done all they can reasonably be expected to do for themselves. This will include ascertaining if other family members and relatives have done their part to assist.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-a-bishop-in-the-church-welfare-program.p28" pid="XgQ9y20lf0Sd4whTAoM7pQ" hash="apZH9g">Finally as led by the Spirit, the bishop <span class="emphasis">should render the needed assistance.</span> He will explain the nature and extent of Church resources to be given as temporary assistance. This may include cash assistance from fast offerings; food, clothing, etc. from the storehouse; or items from Deseret Industries. Certain kinds of problems may require services from the employment system or from the LDS Social Services. Of course, to officially authorize these goods and services, the bishop will sign a bishop’s order, which either he or his Relief Society president has prepared.</p>

This provides them the privilege of maintaining their dignity and self-respect, while sharing in the process of generating the resources they and others will use. Bishops must be ever watchful on this point of work by recipients for what they receive. We must never let the Lord’s program of self-help become a dole, for “the idler shall not have place in the church, except he repent and mend his ways” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/75.29" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 75:29</a>). If an individual refuses to do his part by working according to his ability, then the bishop has the prerogative of withholding assistance until a reformation of attitude is achieved.</p>

By this we mean dealing with the root cause of the problem so the individual or family can again become self-sustaining and able to provide for themselves. This rehabilitative action may be of short duration and quite straightforward, such as helping to find a new job for the breadwinner. Sometimes, serious accidents or problems require long-term rehabilitative action. In these cases, the priesthood quorum of which a needy person is a member should lead out and provide the impetus to plan and carry out rehabilitative activity.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/the-role-of-a-bishop-in-the-church-welfare-program.p31" pid="b6pFJs5u3U6KS3uYiQTrCg" hash="kKggvg">As noted in several successive welfare handbooks: “In his temporal administrations the bishop looks at every able-bodied needy person as a purely temporary problem, caring for him until he can help himself. The priesthood quorum must look at its needy member as a continuing problem until not alone his temporal needs are met but his spiritual ones also. As a concrete example,—a bishop extends help while the artisan or craftsman is out of work and in want; a priesthood quorum assists in establishing him in work and tries to see that he becomes fully self-supporting and active in his priesthood duties. In Church welfare work, the rehabilitation of quorum members and their families spiritually is the primary responsibility of quorums functioning as quorums” (<span class="emphasis">Welfare Plan of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: Handbook of Instructions,</span> 1952, p. 20).</p>

As President Clark so often reminded us, “The rule of the bishop in all these matters, is the rule of the priesthood,—a rule of kindness, charity, love, [and] righteousness” (J. Reuben Clark, Jr., unpublished article, Church Historical Department, 9 July 1941, p. 13).</p>

They will know that what they receive has been given to them under the inspiration of the Lord. I am thoroughly convinced that the Lord will touch their hearts that they might be worthy receivers and that their desires may be to do all that they can to truly earn those things that are given to them. I believe that it is not too much to believe that bishops can have in their hearts a desire to give all that is really needed, even sometimes more, and at the same time, our people can have the true Christian spirit that would want them to accept less than their good bishop is willing to give. This is not an idle statement. I honestly believe it is true.</p>

How much assistance should I give? How often and how long should I assist? No hard-and-fast rule will ever be given in answer to these questions. As the common judge, you must live worthy to get the answers for each case from the only source provided—the inspiration of heaven.</p>

Since the beginning of the program, our branch presidents, while they have not had the full welfare program, nonetheless have had the responsibility to bless the poor and the needy and administer to their needs.</p>

Included in these means are fast offerings (and they should be generously given), farm labor, volunteer services, Deseret Industries, welfare, and other contributions. May each of us—leaders and members, givers and receivers—catch the full vision and apply to a full measure the principles and practices of the welfare plan as it prepares us for the building of Zion in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times, concerning which the Lord said, in section 82 of the Doctrine and Covenants: “Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.</p>

Its principles are eternal. They have been revealed and implemented, to some extent, where and whenever the Lord has established his church upon the earth. We read in the Book of Mormon, for example, that “Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.</p>

First is the basic doctrine of being self-sustaining to the full extent of one’s ability. By applying the principles of personal and family preparedness, sometimes referred to as temporal welfare, we are to provide our own needs. So doing puts us in position to share our surplus with others. In his April 1937 conference talk, President J. Reuben Clark outlined the course of independence which should be followed by every member of the Church. He there said:</p>

It wouldn’t hurt my feelings to hear a family boast that through all vicissitudes they had come to each other’s help and had never received public assistance. I have known brothers and sisters to put each other through school by hard, self-sacrificing toil. I cannot imagine any of these permitting their father and mother to come to public relief” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1944, pp. 138–39).</p>

They bring about the desired end of establishing the Church and building up Zion. It is true, however, that when not properly applied, difficulties follow. Within two-and-a-half years after the original Church welfare plan was put in place by the First Presidency, President J. Reuben Clark made this significant statement in an address in Estes Park, Colorado, 20 June 1939:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/church-welfare-temporal-service-in-a-spiritual-setting.p36" pid="UQc-MGsTYU6qzHc5Lc784w" hash="rvQXKw">The Church has found that the whole problem is essentially a question of spirituality, rather than of finance or economics [in getting Church welfare work accomplished]. Where the spirituality has been high, the Plan has succeeded; where the spirituality is low, the Plan has lagged. The Church has proved there is no substitute for the great commandments: ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy … might, mind, and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself’ [see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.5-6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:5–6</a>]” (<span class="emphasis">Church Welfare Plan: A Discussion,</span> General Church Welfare Committee, 1939, pp. 32–33).</p>

Everything we do in welfare services must be measured by its accomplishment in spiritual terms. Givers must give out of a righteous heart and with a willing spirit. Receivers must receive with thankfulness and gladness of heart. The Spirit must confirm a bishop’s evaluation regarding assistance. It must lead a home teacher and a visiting teacher to know how to respond to needs of families to whom they are assigned. With righteous intent, participating in this great work sanctifies the soul and enlarges the mind. As we spiritually mature in fulfilling our welfare responsibilities, whatever they may be, we prepare ourselves to become “partakers of the divine nature” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.4" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 1:4</a>). May it be our happy lot to be filled with that measure of spirit that we may be sealed with the bond of charity, which, as Moroni said, “is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</p>

As we have been celebrating this, the sesquicentennial anniversary of the organization of the Church, I have recalled that ten months prior to that organization the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery had received from Peter, James, and John the Melchizedek Priesthood.</p>

The gospel itself is the new and everlasting covenant. The posterity of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob constitute what is known as the covenant race. We come into the Church by covenant, which we enter into when we go into the waters of baptism. The new and everlasting covenant of celestial marriage is the gate to exaltation in the celestial kingdom. Men receive the Melchizedek Priesthood by an oath and covenant.</p>

An oath is a sworn attestation to the inviolability of the promises in the agreement. In the covenant of the priesthood the parties are the Father—that’s the Lord—and the receiver of the priesthood. Each party to the covenant undertakes certain obligations. The receiver undertakes to magnify his calling in the priesthood. The Father, by oath and covenant, promises the receiver that if he does so magnify his priesthood he will be sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of his body; that he will become a member of “the church and kingdom, and the elect of God,” and receive the “Father’s kingdom; therefore,” said the Savior, “all that my Father hath shall be given unto him” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.33-34,38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:33–34, 38</a>).</p>

But these blessings, as has already been indicated, do not come by ordination alone. Ordination to the priesthood is a prerequisite to receiving them, but it does not guarantee them. For a man to actually obtain them he must faithfully discharge the obligation which is placed upon him when he received the priesthood. That is, he must magnify his calling.</p>

With such a penalty prescribed for breaking it, one might be prompted to question the advisability of accepting the obligations of the covenant; that is, he might question it until he reads the verse which follows the statement of the penalty. There he learns that those who do not receive the oath and covenant are not <span class="emphasis">much,</span> if any, better off than those who receive it and break it.

Our purpose in urging all bearers of the Melchizedek Priesthood to read the Book of Mormon is that they may learn more about the gospel. One cannot sincerely study the Book of Mormon without learning gospel truths, because it contains “the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:9</a>). So impressed was the Prophet Joseph with it that he “told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:461).</p>

It must be lived by one who would magnify his calling in the priesthood. As a matter of fact, getting a knowledge of the gospel and living it are interdependent. They go hand in hand. One cannot fully learn the gospel without living it. A knowledge of the gospel comes by degrees. One learns a little, obeys what he learns, learns a little more, obeys that, and repeats this cycle in an endless round. Such is the pattern by which one can move on to a full knowledge of the gospel.</p>

Every priesthood bearer should be familiar with this revelation and with the instructions given in section 59 [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59</a>] and section 88, particularly verses 117 to 126. [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.117-126" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:117–126</a>] Indeed, a priesthood bearer with serious intentions of so magnifying his calling as to merit the blessing of the “covenant which belongeth to the priesthood” should be conversant with all the instructions given to guide us in our personal conduct—both those recorded in the scriptures and those being received currently by the living prophets. One can scarcely hope to be fortified “against the wiles of the devil” by putting “on the whole armour of God” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/6.11" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 6:11</a>) unless he knows what that armor is.</p>

They put on every bearer of the priesthood the stimulating responsibility to render service—service in carrying the restored gospel, with all the blessings of the priesthood, to the peoples of the earth; and service in comforting, strengthening, and perfecting the lives of one another and all the Saints of God.</p>

The burden of it the Lord has laid upon his priesthood. It can be done properly only by men who are magnifying their priesthood—who know the gospel, conform their lives to its standards, and enthusiastically give dedicated service in the spirit of the divine proclamation that “men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; for the power is in them” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27-28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27–28</a>).</p>

For forty years now I have been coming to this building twice a year to receive instruction regarding what we today refer to as Church welfare services. Originally, this program was known as the <span class="emphasis">Church security plan;</span> that is the name it was given when it was started. What was then meant by that title needs to be understood today; namely, that security, <span class="emphasis">true</span> security, comes only by living the principles of the gospel. <span class="emphasis">Security is the fruit of righteous living.</span></p>

Whenever they kept the Lord’s commandments, they prospered in the land; when they were disobedient, they fell into wickedness, war, famine, and enslavement. Time and time again we read of families, tribes, and whole nations keeping the Lord’s commandments and making covenants with him and being blessed by his Spirit. Because of righteousness, they prospered both spiritually and temporally. When they did not keep his commandments, they deteriorated both temporally and spiritually.</p>

I believe our people want to achieve true security, but many of us are not following the course which leads to it. Today, individuals and governments seem to think that they can achieve economic prosperity in spite of a spendthrift mentality. They spend and spend, mortgage and mortgage, pile up debts and obligations and thereby lose stability, lose security, and lose independence.</p>

He has given eternal truths to guide us in these matters. Further, he gives us his Spirit to help us apply these principles. But only as we follow him can we have security.</p>

I was thrilled with the power and solemnity of the thoughts expressed by the Brethren. Here is a quote from President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.’s, statement made at the October 1936 conference, the day that President Heber J. Grant read a letter by the First Presidency establishing the Church security plan. Notice how President Clark emphasizes that this security plan is simply a true expression of the basic Christian tenets contained in the gospel. He said:</p>

More importantly, I wonder if we as a people, as a nation, and as a world community really understand the basic premise on which all of this rests—namely, <span class="emphasis">self-reliance.</span></p>

It is through our <span class="emphasis">own</span> efforts and decisions that we <span class="emphasis">earn</span> our way in this life. While the Lord will magnify us in both subtle and dramatic ways, he can only guide our footsteps when we move our feet. Ultimately, our own actions determine our blessings or lack of them.

The family <span class="emphasis">is</span> the basic organizational unit of the Church. No agency or institution can or should replace the family. By sacred covenant and eternal priesthood government, the eternal family unit is established. The same covenant that obligates parents to care for their children obligates children to care for their parents when they need it. The commandment to “honour thy father and thy mother” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.12" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:12</a>) extends to modern Israel and is required for all who are faithful members of the Church.</p>

The extent of this care and the basis on which it is given, however, again must be bound to fundamental principles. May I share a very insightful thought on charity given by President Joseph F. Smith in the general conference of April 1898: (That, of course, was before the welfare program as we understand it.)</p>

Every man and woman ought to possess the spirit of independence, a self-sustaining spirit, that would prompt him or her to say, when they are in need, ‘I am willing to give my labor in exchange for that which you give me.’ No man ought to be satisfied to receive, and to do nothing for it.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1898, p. 48.)</p>

Everyone would feel good about contributing to the Church welfare plan when the needy come in this spirit. Motivated in this way, people in need desire to quickly become self-sustaining again; they also desire to contribute all they can to the program when they are back on their feet.</p>

I reiterate that welfare services is not just a program; it is the gospel in action. Its principles are the principles of the gospel. It is the Christian rule in temporal affairs. It is my desire that we learn from the scriptures and from the counsel of the living prophets and do our part to sustain ourselves, to care for our families, and with generosity and humility to contribute our share to maintaining those less fortunate than we.</p>

And there are two aspects to religious knowledge. One of them concerns the great store of religious knowledge which we have in the scriptures. Ever since the beginning, from Father Adam’s time until now, the Lord has given through his prophets, by revelation, religious knowledge. Such knowledge concerns the verities of life. It deals with God and his Beloved Son, the great gospel plan, and the mission of Jesus as Savior and Redeemer. The other aspect to religious knowledge is the personal witness available through inspiration, a form of revelation that comes to each individual.</p>

This was all he could be expected to see, however, because he based his knowledge of who Jesus was upon what he had seen and heard of the Master’s miracles.

Through these ordinances the door is unlocked. Submission to this is absolutely essential to rebirth. But to obtain life eternal one must so humble and purify himself that he in fact receives through the power of the Holy Ghost a personal witness that God is his Eternal Father and that Jesus Christ is God’s Son and our personal Savior as well as the Redeemer of the world.</p>

It is personal to my family, but it makes the point, so I hope you will pardon my use of it. My wife was reared in a home where they had prayer night and morning; where, almost daily, they discussed gospel principles around the family hearth. She loved education and wanted to go to college. Her father, however, thought college was for boys. In her struggle for an education, she developed an attitude of awe toward people who had been through college. As a member of a stake Sunday School board in Idaho Falls, she taught a class. There came to the class a nonmember of the Church, the wife of one of the brethren on the board. This woman had received a college degree from the University of Idaho. My wife, having not yet received her degree, was a little timid in the presence of this woman.</p>

As she made her preparation for the lesson, there came into her mind the realization that this nonmember would be present in the class. This realization was followed by the question, “What will she think of me, an ignorant girl, saying that the Father and the Son actually came down from heaven and appeared before a fourteen-year-old boy?” The thought terrified her, and she concluded that she couldn’t do it. She went to her mother, crying, and said, “Mother, I can’t teach this lesson. I don’t know that Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son. I know I have been taught it all through my life by you and Father. I have believed you, but personally I don’t know it. This woman will ridicule me. I just can’t stand up before the class with this woman present and teach this lesson.”</p>

Abraham Lincoln was of the opinion that “the world has never had a good definition of [the term]. We all declare for liberty,” he said; “but in using the same word we do not mean the same thing. With some, the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labor; while with others [liberty] may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other men’s labor.”</p>

The sweets of liberty about which we usually speak may be classified as (1) political independence, (2) economic freedom, and (3) free agency.</p>

I would have us strive for a freedom of the soul to which they all contribute. I would have us attain that blessed state foreshadowed by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he said, “Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>.) One who enjoys such liberty is, in the words of Jesus, “free indeed.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.36" class="scriptureRef">John 8:36</a>.) He is possessed of perfect liberty.</p>

With high physical courage, impulsive energy, and fervid imagination, he, at the unripe age of thirty-two years, became to all intents and purposes master of the then-known world. But he was far from enjoying liberty, for of himself he was not master. In his thirty-third year he died, a victim of his own excesses, a total stranger to freedom of the soul.</p>

You may recall that he gave a long life in the service of two English sovereigns, enjoying all the while great freedom and political power. Finally, however, he was shorn of all his greatness by an impatient king. As he stood, disillusioned, among the ruins of his life, he lamented to his friend,</p>

It recorded how some of these men had died broke and in disgrace; others had committed suicide, and some had spent time in prison. All of the men had obtained, temporarily at least, economic freedom, but to none of them did their economic abundance bring freedom of the soul.</p>

And it is true that the God-given right to choose one’s course of action is an indispensable prerequisite to such freedom. Without it we can scarcely enjoy any type of liberty—political, economic, or personal. It is one of our greatest heritages. For it we are deeply indebted to our Father in Heaven, to the Founding Fathers, and to the pioneers. God gave it to man in the Garden of Eden. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.32" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:32</a>.) The Founding Fathers, under the Lord’s inspiration, wrote a guarantee of it into the fundamental law of the land. And the pioneers, led by the inspiration of heaven, gave their all to perpetuate it. Surely we ought always to be alert in its defense and willing, if necessary, to give our lives for its preservation.</p>

As a matter of fact, through the exercise of their agency more people have come to political, economic, and personal bondage than to liberty.</p>

This they did while living under a government providing for the freest exercise of agency. “Their laws and their governments,” says the record, “were established by the voice of the people, and they who chose evil were more numerous than they who chose good.” Therefore, “they could not be governed by the law nor justice, save it were to their destruction.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:2–3</a>.) Under these circumstances, they chose as rulers wicked men, who would certainly destroy their political liberties, to replace righteous men who had in the past protected and preserved those liberties and would have continued to do so in the future.</p>

The people—rejecting government by judges, which God had established—clamored for Samuel to give them a king. Notwithstanding Samuel’s warning that a king would make servants of their children, lay heavy taxes and services upon their backs, and send them to war, “the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel, [saying,] Nay; but we will have a king over us;</p>

In due time, just as Samuel had predicted, heavy burdens were laid upon them, their sons and daughters were made servants of the king, and war came. The nation was divided into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah, both of which were, in their turn, carried away into captivity. Not only did they lose their political freedom, but their very political existence as nations was terminated.</p>

The Egyptians, instead of exercising their agency to provide for themselves against a day of need, depended upon the government. As a result, when the famine came they were forced to purchase food from the government. First they used their money. When that was gone, they gave their livestock, then their lands; and finally they were compelled to sell themselves into slavery, that they might eat. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/41.54-56" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 41:54–56</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/47.13-26" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 47:13–26</a>.)</p>

We see the alcoholic with his craving for drink, the dope fiend in his frenzy, and worse, the pervert with his irretrievable loss of manhood. Who will say that such persons enjoy liberty?</p>

However, the free agency possessed by any one person is increased or diminished by the use to which he puts it. Every wrong decision one makes restricts the area in which he can thereafter exercise his agency. The further one goes in the making of wrong decisions in the exercise of free agency, the more difficult it is for him to recover the lost ground. One can, by persisting long enough, reach the point of no return. He then becomes an abject slave. By the exercise of his free agency, he has decreased the area in which he can act, almost to the vanishing point.</p>

Their final fate is to be cast out into outer darkness, such punishment being the natural consequence of the alternatives they elected in the exercise of their agency.

As a matter of fact, one may, by this process, obtain freedom of the soul while at the same time being denied political, economic, and personal liberty.</p>

Here was a man enjoying freedom of the soul while suffering the deprivation of almost every other liberty. The experiences of his life were in some respects comparable to those of the Apostle Paul, who in his labors suffered stripes often, imprisonment frequently, and repeatedly faced death. Reviewing some of his experiences for the Corinthians, he said:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p1" pid="KstmAQHlCEag0AJldtWq6g" hash="_BOoaQ">It is now my responsibility to say a few words about living welfare principles. For over forty years I have studied and taught the principles of the Church welfare program. I love its principles and know they constitute the capstone to a Christian life. I appreciate what has been said by those who have just spoken to us this morning. They have demonstrated the effect living welfare principles has on us individually and collectively.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p2" pid="jj6OOFWZCECSlvRGi4pwgg" hash="o5q2kw">In 1936 President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said, “The real long-term objective of the welfare plan is the building of character in the members of the Church, givers and receivers, rescuing all that is finest down deep inside of them and bringing to flower and fruitage the latent richness of the spirit, which after all is the mission and purpose and reason for being of this church.” (Special Meeting of Stake Presidencies, 2 Oct. 1936.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p3" pid="V1JSpAAOkkuKdGJSW_oX_Q" hash="0HNc5Q">Most of us have experienced the joy of observing someone who has been in need of help receive that help and, consequently, become self-sustaining. Many of us have become witnesses to the truth that the poor can be exalted when they are administered to in the Lord’s way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p4" pid="yUbu3Vxa5UCLr0PEsXHgqw" hash="leccmw">Today, however, I would like to direct my comments to the effect living welfare principles has on the giver, as opposed to the receiver. Repeating president Clark’s statement of 1936, “The real long-term objective of the welfare plan is the building of character in the members of the Church, givers and receivers.” The Lord doesn’t really need us to take care of the poor. He could take care of them without our help if it were his purpose to do so. “I, the Lord,” he said, “stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p5" pid="D8PQQEbCUEaHJCVEgFeZkQ" hash="RalFLg">“And it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.14-15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 104:14–15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p6" pid="rtKOtDoxi0K8j7Vp8PqTnw" hash="XOUZig">It would be a simple thing for the Lord to reveal to President Kimball where the deposits of oil and precious ores are. We could then hire someone to dig them out and we could float in wealth—and we would float in wealth right down to Hades. No, the Lord doesn’t really need us to take care of the poor, but <span class="emphasis">we</span> need this experience; for it is only through our learning how to take care of each other that we develop within us the Christlike love and disposition necessary to qualify us to return to his presence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p7" pid="WyglJeiHLU-qaPAcmohWhw" hash="aWaCYQ">That one cannot be a true disciple of Christ without significant giving is dramatically emphasized in the revelation received by the Prophet Joseph Smith in Kirtland, on June 7, 1831. In this revelation, the Lord directed twenty-eight of the elders to travel two by two from Kirtland to Jackson County, Missouri. They were to go by different routes, preaching the gospel as they went. You will recall that they were destitute in those days and had to travel through primitive country. Joseph Smith and his immediate companions “journeyed by wagon and stage and occasionally by canal boat to Cincinnati, Ohio,” then to Louisville, Kentucky, and on to St. Louis by steamer. “From this city on the Mississippi, the Prophet of God walked across the entire state of Missouri to Independence, Jackson County, a distance of nearly three hundred miles as traveled.” (George Q. Cannon, <span class="emphasis">Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1958, p. 117.) I call these facts to your attention that you may have in mind the background against which the Lord said to these men as they started, “Remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/52.40" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 52:40</a>.) Imagine that! These elders were nearly destitute and the Lord said, “Remember … the poor and the needy.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p8" pid="uyf8wrwH4U6xcKFSbHZJoA" hash="82BRyw">That the commandment to give is directed to all people is emphasized by King Benjamin when he said to the poor, “And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p9" pid="B-42KiZUdEWaUkZkWvHpxQ" hash="PwAxXA">“And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless, otherwise ye are condemned; and your condemnation is just for ye covet that which ye have not received.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.24-25" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:24–25</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p10" pid="k1_zhp1Y8EG7ZNf6LzoW5w" hash="U4gtgQ">Once we are convinced that we have an obligation to give, we must learn that to render service in the proper spirit is of first importance. Mormon, speaking to those who give for the wrong reasons, said, “For if he offereth a gift, or prayeth unto God, except he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p11" pid="b6x8rsR52UWVCq1sYl1dYA" hash="7X9Xgw">“For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p12" pid="GPRAhXCyREeM3WS6Ild7mA" hash="d77Pfw">“For behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, he doeth it grudgingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.6-8" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:6–8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p13" pid="NyHX3Zn9MkGK2I1JGXSuAA" hash="vb10jg">Only by voluntarily giving, out of an abundant love for his neighbor, can one develop that charity characterized by Mormon as the “pure love of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>.) In Mosiah we read: “And … Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p14" pid="KGMz-AbCcUOGMpo48WjaWQ" hash="NpP-fQ">“And thus they should impart of their substance <span class="emphasis">of their own free will and good desires towards God.</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.27-28" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:27–28</a>; italics added.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p15" pid="rnQFMDH_a0WzUfAGstptEQ" hash="2TXDEA">Some may ask, “How do I obtain these righteous feelings in giving? How do I overcome giving grudgingly? How do I obtain the <span class="emphasis">‘pure love of Christ?’ </span>” To those I would say: Faithfully live all the commandments, give of yourselves, care for your families, serve in church callings, perform missionary work, pay tithes and offerings, study the scriptures—and the list could go on. As you lose yourself in this service, the Lord will touch and soften your heart and gradually bring you to the feelings with which he blessed the people in King Benjamin’s time, which prompted them to say, “Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p16" pid="Gzc2HkTgMkKFOzT3UJYoeA" hash="pQh0Qw">This charity in its perfection is demonstrated by the Lord in everything that he does. The Lord revealed to Moses the numerous worlds which have been created and said, “For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p17" pid="E6g5Lobdk0-woxzdxZPT0w" hash="E369NQ">“And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.35,38" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:35, 38</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p18" pid="FBd4glfbNEC-U8l18i1shA" hash="wNe6Jg">After revealing to Moses the vastness of his creations, the Lord gave Moses some insight into his reason for doing all this when he said, “For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>.) Hence, we see the complete unselfishness of our Father in Heaven. His whole work and glory is to bring eternal life and happiness to his children. Should not our whole purpose in this life, therefore, be made up of righteous service one to another? If not, how can we ever hope to be as he is? As we individually become filled with the “pure love of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>), we collectively evolve into a church which is “pure in heart” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 97:21</a>). We can therefore become as the people of Enoch of whom was written, “The Lord blessed the land … and … called his people ZION, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.17-18" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:17–18</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p19" pid="NVApleqgzE2qZZvUhOC00g" hash="g0Rhjw">Of the Nephites who survived the cataclysm which accompanied the crucifixion of Jesus and thereafter lived the program, the record says, “And it came to pass … the people were all converted unto the Lord … and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p20" pid="EMUabck8BkGWJX-QG_NdYA" hash="Xb4QMw">“And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift. … And surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.2,3,16" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:2, 3, 16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p21" pid="zbebSAL-nkKSLNoOk8A84w" hash="kp5Itw">Why were these people so happy? Because they were free of the shackles of selfishness and had learned what the Lord knows—that ultimate joy comes only through service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p22" pid="T7K_YtEPoEitMDbRr8wfbA" hash="q8U-0Q">Becoming a people which is collectively pure in heart is not an impossible dream or an idealistic goal. We know this because the Lord has commanded us to become such, and the Lord gives “no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p23" pid="H0oIokZfuUS47qd_PmsK2w" hash="KMjMng">When we reach the state of having the “pure love of Christ,” our desire to serve one another will have grown to the point where we will be living fully the law of consecration. Living the law of consecration exalts the poor and humbles the rich. In the process, both are sanctified. The poor, released from the bondage and humiliating limitations of poverty, are enabled as free men to rise to their full potential, both temporally and spiritually. The rich, by consecration and the imparting of their surplus for the benefit of the poor, <span class="emphasis">not by constraint, but willingly as an act of free will,</span> evidence that charity for their fellowmen characterized by Mormon as “the pure love of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>.) This will bring both the giver and receiver to the common ground on which the Spirit of God can meet them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p24" pid="ijtO5gwtMUyNln2Sh0UXQQ" hash="DS__qg">It is the mission of the Church of this last dispensation to develop another people who shall live the gospel in its fulness. This people are to become “pure in heart,” and they shall flourish and be blessed upon the mountains and upon the high places. They shall be the Lord’s people. They shall walk with God because they shall be of one heart and one mind, and they shall dwell in righteousness, and there shall be no poor among them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/living-welfare-principles.p25" pid="6-fUG5BSs0mYajND0OuWhg" hash="MIlrLA">Let us have these things in mind and let us go forward with this great program. Welfare principles are eternal. The welfare program is built upon the principles of the law of consecration. I know from my own experience that this is the Lord’s work. It is to prepare us to become like Christ. If you will think of the most holy, sacred place you have ever been, you will remember that the final thing we are all to do is to be able and willing to consecrate all that we have to the building up of the kingdom of God—which includes caring for our fellowmen. Doing this, we will hasten the advent of the Millennium. God grant that we do not fail, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

These words, eloquent in their simplicity, announced the most significant event of recorded history, the resurrection of the Lord Jesus—an event so extraordinary that even the Apostles, who had been most intimately associated with Jesus in his earthly ministry and who had been carefully taught of the coming event, had difficulty grasping the reality of its full significance. The first accounts which reached their ears “seemed to them as idle tales” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.11" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:11</a>) as well they might, for millions of men had lived and died before that day. In every hill and dale men’s bodies mouldered in the dust, but until that first Easter morning not one had risen from the grave.</p>

His death on the cross, after having been rejected and betrayed and after having suffered appalling indignities, seems not to be in dispute, even among nonbelievers. That he gave his life voluntarily, with the express purpose of taking it up again in the Resurrection, is not so universally accepted. Such, however, is the fact. He was, it is true, maliciously slain by wicked men, but all the while he held the power to stay them. “I lay down my life,” he said, “that I might take it again.</p>

That the whole of his mortal life moved toward this consummation, he had repeatedly taught. It was foreshadowed in his statement about laying down his life and taking it up again. To the sorrowing Martha he had said, “I am the resurrection, and the life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/11.25" class="scriptureRef">John 11:25</a>); and to the Jews, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/2.19" class="scriptureRef">John 2:19</a>).</p>

The doctrine, however, had been heard even by the crucifiers. Being disturbed by it, they came to Pilate, “saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.” So with Pilate’s consent they set a watch “lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/27.63-64" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 27:63–64</a>.) Thus it came about that these hireling guards unwittingly became witnesses to the opening of the tomb by the angel (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.2-4" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:2–4</a>), the final preliminary to the appearing of the risen Lord.</p>

When he inquired into the nature of their conversation, they repeated to him the reports of the women. At their seeming doubt he said, “O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.” Then opened he their understanding of the scriptures concerning him. Tarrying at Emmaus, “he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.

For this purpose was the atonement of Jesus Christ conceived and executed.</p>

Even so, we will not be able, in mortal life, to fully comprehend it. We can, however, understand that priesthood is power—the power of God. By means of the priesthood he exercises, God the Father brings into existence and governs all of his creations. President Brigham Young said that “the Priesthood of the Son of God … is the law by which the worlds are, were, and will continue for ever and ever. It is that system which brings worlds into existence and peoples them, gives them their revolutions—their days, weeks, months, years, their seasons and times and by which they are rolled up as a scroll, as it were, and go into a higher state of existence.” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Brigham Young,</span> sel.

Grant stated, as was quoted by the former speaker: “Our primary purpose was to set up, in so far as it might be possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift and self-respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 3.)</p>

Bishops, are any of your people idle? Are all of your members independent, industrious, thrifty, and do they all have self-respect? Are any members receiving assistance as a dole? Are we helping our members to help themselves, or are we just taking care of the people? Finally, do our members understand the significance of work? If you don’t feel good about your answers, you will understand why we keep emphasizing President Grant’s statement.</p>

After answering them, I said, “You have been in dozens of meetings where I have addressed all of these questions, haven’t you?” He answered, “Yes, I’m sure that’s true, but I wasn’t a stake president then.”</p>

That fall, in large measure, was due to the purchasing of votes with unearned benefits, such as entertainment, circuses, and food. The government’s actions built up in the people an expectation and demand which eventually could be kept down only by the establishment of a dictatorship. Many of our members live in countries where this history has repeated itself. In the United States, our treasured American work ethic is waning and the purchasing of votes with unearned benefits is dangerously common.</p>

Lee’s influence in the welfare program, about a man whom they could not get to work. He wanted to be taken care of. The Church or government, so he thought, owed him a living because he had paid his tithing and taxes. He did not have anything to eat and refused to labor to care for himself. Out of desperation and disgust they decided they might as well take him to the cemetery.</p>

You cannot save a man who has such an attitude, and a nation made up of men and women with similar attitudes is vulnerable to the problems which led to the fall of Rome. The saddest day of a person’s life is when he sits down to work out a means whereby he can live thereafter without his own effort. One of the most demeaning things a government can do is to teach people that the government owes them a living.</p>

I thought it might be helpful to remember what the Church has done since its inception to give life to the principles stated so well by President Grant.</p>

Although President Grant’s statement came in 1936, you will note he said that “independence, industry, thrift, and self-respect [should] be <span class="emphasis">once more</span> established.” Also note that he said work should be <span class="emphasis">re-enthroned,</span> not <span class="emphasis">enthroned.</span> If time permitted, we could begin when Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden and found the earth cursed <span class="emphasis">for their sake.</span> (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 3:17</a>.) We could trace these principles through biblical and Book of Mormon times. However, in the interest of time, we will limit our comments to a few things done in this, the last dispensation.</p>

The first “welfare program” of this dispensation was the United Order, under which a person consecrated all that he had to the Church and received back that which was necessary to provide for his family according to their wants and needs. The portion of the property retained by the Church was used in one of two ways: first, if a person was able-bodied, he was given the means whereby he could earn a living; second, if a person was incapable of working, his needs were met.</p>

This surplus was also used to give more people jobs and to take care of the needy. As the Saints arrived in Missouri, many were destitute. The program provided these people with the opportunity to work and earn their own living. They were not given a handout, but they were given a job.</p>

For example, in an orderly immigration, some 5,000 converts came to Nauvoo from Great Britain. The more wealthy members gave of their means to assist the poor in both their transportation to America and in helping them obtain work after they arrived. The economy of Nauvoo was based primarily on agriculture and construction. The largest construction project was the Nauvoo Temple, which provided jobs for many of its members. One traveler is quoted as saying there was no pauperism in Nauvoo because those without subsistence were provided with work by the Church.</p>

Many Nauvoo residents were able to provide the largest part of their basic necessities from their own plots, which normally were one acre in size. They cultivated extensive gardens and often kept chickens, a milk cow, and several pigs, which they would get in exchange for several days’ work.</p>

If a person is not able to take care of himself, we will take care of him. …”</p>

By 1880, the relatively independent economic kingdom had to be abandoned as Utah became nationalized. The Church sold many of its economic enterprises, and its leaders ceased to direct the economic affairs of Church members. Utah had become an integral part of the national economy—hence, the dawning of a new era in the manner in which the Church could help employ its members. It is interesting to note that just as the Church became dependent on the nation for its economy, the nation entered the depression of the 1890s.</p>

Costly efforts were also made to bolster the economy. Assistance was given to such industries as sugar, salt, and coal.</p>

For example, in the 1920s, bishops were charged with the responsibility of finding employment for needy ward members. They were instructed to appoint a special person within each ward to be concerned with employment problems and discuss the problems in quorum meetings. This was very similar to the program Elder Fyans explained to us this morning.</p>

However, the emphasis was always on self-sufficiency. When the depression of the 1930s came, the members of the Church found themselves in a situation altogether different. There were no jobs, and many people were out of work. The government stepped in to alleviate this problem, but some of their methods promoted idleness because there was a dole involved. It was in this climate that President Grant announced the welfare program for that day. A model of production projects was announced six months earlier in a letter dated April 21, 1936 to the stake presidents and bishops, which stated in part:</p>

The priesthood of God is power. It’s an endowment, which the Lord has given to us who hold the priesthood, to perform sacred ordinances that have effect in this world and in the world to come. It’s the greatest power in the world—the priesthood—and I am very happy that I have had the privilege through the years to bear the priesthood and to receive offices in the priesthood from deacon up to the offices of the Melchizedek Priesthood which I have had assignments to work in. I know that it’s the priesthood that will save this world. It is not a man-made organization; it is not a man-prepared organization—it embodies a power revealed from heaven and sent here to us to help us prepare our lives for eternal life in the presence of our Father in Heaven.</p>

Smith many years ago, “that one of the greatest sins of which the inhabitants of the earth are guilty today is the sin of ingratitude, the want of acknowledgment, on their part, of God and his right to govern and control. We see a man raised up with extraordinary gifts, or with great intelligence, and he is instrumental in developing some great principle. He and the world ascribe this great genius and wisdom to himself. He attributes his success to his own energies, labor and mental capacity. He does not acknowledge the hand of God in anything connected with his success, but ignores him altogether and takes the honor to himself; this will apply to almost all the world. In all great modern discoveries in science, in the arts, in mechanics, and in all the material advancement of our age, the world says, ‘We have done it.’ The individual says, ‘I have done it,’ and he gives no honor and credit to God. Now, I read in the revelations through Joseph Smith, the prophet, that because of this, God is not pleased with the inhabitants of the earth but is angry with them because they will not acknowledge his hand in all things.” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, pp. 270–71.)</p>

It is impossible for us, weak mortals as we are, to fully comprehend and appreciate the suffering he endured on the cross so that he might gain for us victory over death. And even less can we understand the suffering he endured in Gethsemane so that we might obtain forgiveness of our sins. “Which suffering,” he said, “caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:18</a>.)</p>

None of us could have endured that suffering. No mortal man nor any number of men together could have endured it. All people who understand what Jesus did for us ought to love him and demonstrate that love by rendering to him, in a realistic manner, thanks and gratitude.</p>

Thank God for all this: for life and what sustains it, for loved ones that make it meaningful, for faith and purpose and continuance, always and forever. Thank God for all of this—and much, much more.” (“Thanks: for the Organization and Operation of the Earth,” <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era,</span> Feb. 1968, p. 74; KSL “The Spoken Word” broadcast, Nov. 19, 1967.)</p>

I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

At a ward gathering they thought they shouldn’t call on him because he would speak too long. Their final decision was, however, that they couldn’t pass him by, so they called on him and asked him to stand and tell them in just a word how they could live to be as old as he was and still be of service. So he got up and said, “Keep breathing.” I won’t be that brief, but I will attempt to be to the point.</p>

Today I shall speak to you about the principle of self-reliance and its impact upon our spiritual development.</p>

It is easy to understand the reason why the Lord places so much emphasis on this principle when we come to understand that it is tied very closely to freedom itself.</p>

Bowen said, “The Lord must want and intend that His people shall be free of constraint whether enforceable or only arising out of the bindings of conscience. … That is why the Church is not satisfied with any system which leaves able people permanently dependent, and insists, on the contrary, that the true function and office of giving, is to help people [get] into a position where they can help themselves and thus be free.” (<span class="emphasis">The Church Welfare Plan,</span> Gospel Doctrine manual, 1946, p. 77.)</p>

However, many of these programs are designed with the shortsighted objective of “helping people,” as opposed to “helping people help themselves.” Our efforts must always be directed toward making able-bodied people self-reliant.</p>

We fear many parents in the Church are making “gullible gulls” out of their children with their permissiveness and their doling out of family resources. Parents who place their children on the dole are just as guilty as a government which places its citizens on the dole. In fact, the actions of parents in this area can be more devastating than any government program.</p>

Some members become financially or emotionally dependent on their bishops. A dole is a dole whatever its source. All of our Church and family actions should be directed toward making our children and members self-reliant. We can’t always control government programs, but we can control our own homes and congregations. If we will teach these principles and live them, we can do much to counter the negative effects which may exist in government programs in any country.</p>

Outwardly, every act seems to be directed toward the physical: re-making of dresses and suits of clothes, canning fruits and vegetables, storing foodstuffs, choosing of fertile fields for settlement—all seem strictly temporal, but permeating all these acts, inspiring and sanctifying them, is the element of spirituality.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 103.)</p>

It also tells us that man is to be “an agent unto himself.” Man cannot be an agent unto himself if he is not self-reliant. Herein we see that independence and self-reliance are critical keys to our spiritual growth. Whenever we get into a situation which threatens our self-reliance, we will find our freedom threatened as well. If we increase our dependence, we will find an immediate decrease in our freedom to act.</p>

The rich, by imparting of their surplus, participate in the eternal principle of giving. Once a person has been made whole or self-reliant, he reaches out to aid others, and the cycle repeats itself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p48" pid="TdC0somr70C_TExieAy1rg" hash="yELEaw">We are all self-reliant in some areas and dependent in others. Therefore, each of us should strive to help others in areas where we have strengths. At the same time, pride should not prevent us from graciously accepting the helping hand of another when we have a real need. To do so denies another person the opportunity to participate in a sanctifying experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p49" pid="_Oh1j6ghY02DG56NAgojdg" hash="KjYCiw">Again, I say the principle of self-reliance is spiritual, as are all the principles of the welfare program. This is not a doomsday program, but a program for today. One of the three areas of emphasis recently outlined in the statement on the mission of the Church is to perfect the Saints, and this is the purpose of the welfare program. Today is the time for us to perfect our lives. May we continue to hold fast to these truths, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p1" pid="sm6v-nB6GUWZTycQX0lyQQ" hash="HyB-aQ">One of the central themes of the gospel of Jesus Christ is unity. The scriptures teach that equality and oneness should prevail among members of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p2" pid="RqpYzdHV_U2p3Xruq1-F9g" hash="m5vtHw">You will recall that on the night of the Last Supper, as the Savior met with his Apostles, he prayed that they might be one with him, as he was one with the Father. He prayed not for them alone, “but for them also which [should] believe on [him] through their word;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p3" pid="4UfIMX_MyEqWbKGS6DOmxA" hash="y1G7fg">“That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.20-21" class="scriptureRef">John 17:20–21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p4" pid="1_Jfn6pQ40eEB54006Y-YQ" hash="oW62Bg">Always the aim has been unity, oneness, and equality among the members of the Church of Christ. As an example, I call your attention to the record of Enoch, how he and his people reached a state of unity when the rest of the world was at war.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p5" pid="hKrE08G6-UO2mEdWCBgmgg" hash="CZyxLQ">“And there went forth a curse upon all people that fought against God;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p6" pid="eIS6lk4rqkmD5AXuxRtXXQ" hash="YrBVbA">“And from that time forth there were wars and bloodshed among them; but the Lord came and dwelt with his people, and they dwelt in righteousness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p7" pid="g6djzARBNEWIwyTjyiPyaA" hash="TxD__g">“The fear of the Lord was upon all nations, so great was the glory of the Lord, which was upon his people. And the Lord blessed the land. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p8" pid="ZZ3Xk9NhlEGXXz6n-2TMKg" hash="ww6hcw">“And the Lord called his people Zion.” Why? “<span class="emphasis">Because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.”</span> (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.15-18" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:15–18</a>; italics added.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p9" pid="7Pzlscp0lkiRtDezk-GfiA" hash="MOP5og">During his mortal ministry Jesus taught his disciples the same doctrine. After his ascension, “they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p10" pid="ipXt58IcaEKX3yocqkh_Uw" hash="6jblVw">“And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/4.31-32" class="scriptureRef">Acts 4:31–32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p11" pid="5oYy6dnfl0iFpaqGGlN1Bg" hash="933-Bg">After the resurrected Savior’s ministry among the Nephites, they “were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p12" pid="GM_-5a7IVUCP8CLM19ovUg" hash="eKvZ7Q">“<span class="emphasis">And they had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift.”</span> (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.2-3" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:2–3</a>; italics added.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p13" pid="-ZT6QfPzp0WOQ-HiTEyvlA" hash="tHprng">Today <span class="emphasis">we</span> are the Church of Christ, and the Lord expects us to come to this same unity. He has said to <span class="emphasis">us:</span> “Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p14" pid="t4x_IhHLSUOyCyk4lo0c4A" hash="u074ig">Some members assume that one can be in full harmony with the spirit of the gospel, enjoy full fellowship in the Church, and at the same time be out of harmony with the leaders of the Church and the counsel and direction they give. Such a position is wholly inconsistent, because the guidance of this Church comes not alone from the written word but also from continuous revelation, and the Lord gives that revelation to the Church through his chosen prophet. It follows, therefore, that those who profess to accept the gospel and who at the same time criticize and refuse to follow the counsel of the prophet are assuming an indefensible position. Such a spirit leads to apostasy. It is not new. It was prevalent in the days of Jesus and in the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p15" pid="jw-uLT5tqkmtmUdZXTratA" hash="_acGWA">It is good to remember the great lesson the Savior taught the Nephites on this subject as he began his ministry among them. Said he:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p16" pid="y62UK8mBl0SAfebEgI8DZA" hash="JakyDw">“There shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p17" pid="nchqsAJQ2UaG0cHIC6cblw" hash="JHo7gw">“For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.28-29" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:28–29</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p18" pid="2eY-1v7oykumDWDLjIIO3g" hash="H5Wd5Q">There is but one way that we can be united, and that way is to seek the Lord and his righteousness. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13.33" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 13:33</a>.) Unity comes by following the light from above. It does not come out of the confusions below. While men depend upon their own wisdom and walk in their own way, without the guidance of the Lord they cannot live in unity. Neither can they come to unity by following uninspired men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p19" pid="RBjGox0hiEmD18gqua59Bg" hash="64S24w">The way to unity is for us to learn the will of the Lord and then to do it. Until this basic principle is understood and observed, there will be no unity and peace on the earth. The power of the Church for good in the world depends upon the extent to which we, the members thereof, observe this principle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p20" pid="RmrvwS5jHkG-U8F3lEuaYw" hash="G8HT9w">The major reason for the world’s troubles today is that men are not seeking to know the will of the Lord and then to do it. Rather do they seek to solve their problems in their own wisdom and in their own way. The Lord, in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which he revealed as the preface to the book of his commandments, pointed this out and marked it as one of the causes of the calamities which he foresaw coming upon the inhabitants of the earth. Listen to this ringing declaration:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p21" pid="eU7udgZH3Emt0r3AAh-Vnw" hash="720i8g">“They have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p22" pid="OQDEfcIOvESAGJRVHgfPIw" hash="3RxDEw">“They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.15-16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:15–16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p23" pid="fQuezxPUDUaOK9eqYv_TBw" hash="UmpsJw">Brethren and sisters, do not rely upon the counsel of men nor trust in the arm of flesh (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:19</a>), but seek the Lord to establish his righteousness (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p24" pid="Z1sOaFvRFk6Q2tVcU86nBQ" hash="v_lSgw">We of this Church can come to a unity and a oneness which will give us strength beyond anything we have yet enjoyed if we will obtain a sounder understanding of the principles of the gospel and come to a unity in our interpretations of present world conditions and trends. This we can do by prayerful study of the Lord’s word, including that given to us through the living prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p25" pid="1FhLDyPXJESw30pe1Ahcdw" hash="XbJHnw">This is the way to come to a unity. If we will study the word of the Lord as it comes to us through the standard works and through the instructions of the living prophet and not harden our hearts, but humble ourselves and develop a real desire to understand its application to us in our own peculiar circumstances, and then ask the Lord in faith, believing that we shall receive (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:18</a>), all the while being diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord, surely the path we should follow will be made known unto us, and we will be able to face the world as a solid unit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p26" pid="nVbY3Au5W06TJLo3wKpimQ" hash="9EUc6g">Surely we need this unity and this strength in this day in which we live. We have a great opportunity, the opportunity to rise heavenward, to gain the spirit of the gospel as we have never enjoyed it before. This we can do by developing among us that unity required by the laws of the celestial kingdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p27" pid="hoK8Z05vd0-hBeiFWzPTKA" hash="y38hRQ">If, in the expediency of the moment, we set God aside to follow the teachings of men, we disown him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p28" pid="d3sPs95E1EiVdZGKPr_0mA" hash="jBHi-g">Only a united people, keeping God’s commands, can expect the protection which he alone can give when the floods come, and the rains descend, and the winds blow, and beat upon our house. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.25" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:25</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/unity.p29" pid="bMienV2A7kCwRFY41NkXlQ" hash="nsEefQ">It is my conviction that, since we are engaged in the Lord’s work, we can accomplish everything he requires us to do if we will but be united. That we may so be, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
