He handed me a bright key, the key to the chapel, and charged me with responsibility to help look after the building. I considered myself one of the most fortunate boys in the world to have an assignment from my priesthood president. I thought this would not be a difficult task. My home was just a one-minute bicycle ride away from the building. But I soon learned what I suppose all bishops know, and that is, that everybody in the ward seems to have a key to the building. As soon as I had the building locked up on an evening, someone came along behind me and opened a door. As soon as I had opened a Primary classroom, some diligent soul was there behind me to lock it up again. I could hardly stay on top of that job.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/i-know-in-whom-i-have-trusted.p3" pid="Z70eQGLlF0aEVHO0IyZLPw" hash="8bzPeg">But I began to learn then, as I have come to understand since, that any call, any service, in our Lord’s cause sanctifies us. Whether it is performed in the glare of the public eye or in a quiet corner known only to God is of no consequence. What matters is that we do serve, for by serving we keep our covenants with Deity, and in those covenants is the promise of salvation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/i-know-in-whom-i-have-trusted.p4" pid="N_SrBWxaqEm4XLtYO0HRag" hash="qcTnuA">Today I honor and express my love to those who taught me the covenants and in so many other ways blessed my life: a noble father, a blessed mother, grandparents, great-grandparents, and extended family, mentors and friends both in and out of the Church. My children cannot as yet fully understand how deeply they bless my life by their loyalty to the Savior and his gospel. I honor them for that. Those who know my Kathy have observed that I married much above myself, a conclusion I heartily agree with. Our marriage is a gratifying thing, and I have not adequate words to express my love.</p>

I so commit myself unreservedly.</p>

At the outset of this ministry, I acknowledge that anything I may achieve will be by virtue of the power and the grace and the gift of God. I am not, in Isaiah’s words, the axe that shall “boast itself against him that heweth therewith”; I am not the saw that shall “magnify itself against him that shaketh it.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/10.15" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 10:15</a>.) With Nephi, I know in whom I have trusted. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.19" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:19</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.3-5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:3–5</a>.) I rely heavily on that access to God, which he gives to all his children, for he is indeed no respecter of persons, and he that asks shall receive. I so witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p1" pid="oNCJjcvLWkywssFAMZV9qg" hash="kxwchQ">In 1918 Brother George Goates was a farmer who raised sugar beets in Lehi, Utah. Winter came early that year and froze much of his beet crop in the ground. For George and his young son Francis, the harvest was slow and difficult. Meanwhile, an influenza epidemic was raging. The dreaded disease claimed the lives of George’s son Charles and three of Charles’s small children—two little girls and a boy. In the course of only six days, a grieving George Goates made three separate trips to Ogden, Utah, to bring the bodies home for burial. At the end of this terrible interlude, George and Francis hitched up their wagon and headed back to the beet field.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p2" pid="JeL4hBmeCEK8nH3HJUWBzw" hash="exyGKw">“[On the way] they passed wagon after wagon-load of beets being hauled to the factory and driven by neighborhood farmers. As they passed by, each driver would wave a greeting: ‘Hi ya, Uncle George,’ ‘Sure sorry, George,’ ‘Tough break, George,’ ‘You’ve got a lot of friends, George.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p3" pid="inPiFXJ_zEG1D9Ws2l3BJQ" hash="z53aFw">“On the last wagon was … freckled-faced Jasper Rolfe. He waved a cheery greeting and called out: ‘That’s all of ‘em, Uncle George.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p4" pid="2ps1kKy0zUCZKRKTYSupLA" hash="iguLhw">“[Brother Goates] turned to Francis and said: ‘I wish it was all of ours.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p5" pid="Xr-Et5-NYkWtMRX88np8iw" hash="6RD5tg">“When they arrived at the farm gate, Francis jumped down off the big red beet wagon and opened the gate as [his father] drove onto the field. [George] pulled up, stopped the team, … and scanned the field. … There wasn’t a sugar beet on the whole field. Then it dawned upon him what Jasper Rolfe meant when he called out: ‘That’s all of ‘em, Uncle George!’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p6" pid="2LitMUsqaEya8fUV-RgPfw" hash="YCk4FQ">“[George] got down off the wagon, picked up a handful of the rich, brown soil he loved so much, and then … a beet top, and he looked for a moment at these symbols of his labor, as if he couldn’t believe his eyes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p7" pid="ThgoY_Usi0aeBunqNxICOQ" hash="IihDGQ">“Then [he] sat down on a pile of beet tops—this man who brought four of his loved ones home for burial in the course of only six days; made caskets, dug graves, and even helped with the burial clothing—this amazing man who never faltered, nor flinched, nor wavered throughout this agonizing ordeal—sat down on a pile of beet tops and sobbed like a little child.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p8" pid="3t4u0uvbPUypYsOrh4z9-w" hash="vdyr5Q">“Then he arose, wiped his eyes, … looked up at the sky, and said: ‘Thanks, Father, for the elders of our ward.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p9" pid="glkiYoPrWkOwraOBgkxoTA" hash="VQ6BKw">It is of such elders that I wish to speak this evening. I wish to speak of brothers in the priesthood. I wish to speak of the priesthood quorum.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p10" pid="tVVGyqmoGkqAinmR7UyApw" hash="vFm9NA">President Boyd K. Packer has explained that “in ancient days when a man was appointed to a select body, his commission, always written in Latin, outlined the responsibility of the organization, defined who should be members, and then invariably contained the words: <span class="emphasis">quorum vos unum</span> meaning, ‘of whom we will that you be one.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p11" pid="lLlJ7MtRa0CPdAukzpwnsQ" hash="6VZeow">“In the dispensation of the fulness of times, the Lord instructed that the priesthood should be organized into quorums, meaning selected assemblies of brethren given authority that His business might be transacted and His work proceed.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p14" pid="Z0-CkVAVMkKIX00TUxzRNQ" hash="vDcFfg">Sixty years ago Elder Stephen L Richards, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, provided a characteristically cogent statement of the function of priesthood quorums. Said he, “A quorum is three things: first, a class; second, a fraternity; and third, a service unit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Let us examine briefly these three aspects of priesthood quorums.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p15" pid="eK_37udKU0uHV8R430Fc8w" hash="6wXI-Q">
        <span class="strong">First, a quorum is a class.</span> When a priesthood quorum or group meets as a class, its members can learn together, be “nourished by the good word of God,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> and grow spiritually. We study so that we may better teach.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Beginning this year, the priesthood has a curriculum program, shared in part by the Relief Society, that can revitalize quorums and make them “school[s] of the prophets.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> On the second and third Sundays of the month, the course of study is based on the teachings of Presidents of the Church. The resource for instruction in 1998–99 is a compilation of excerpts from the sermons of Brigham Young. It is a text rich in doctrine and application. The curriculum continues on the fourth Sunday with <span class="emphasis">Teachings for Our Time,</span> an opportunity to study current gospel issues approved by the First Presidency. Brethren, you who are the leaders of quorums and groups, please study the instructions that have been provided by the First Presidency regarding this new curriculum until you understand them fully. Then implement them precisely.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p16" pid="Af7PT20jUUmmGH--Dug1rQ" hash="3Lv0Kw">The Aaronic Priesthood quorums are also blessed with superb class material, although it wasn’t always so. At the beginning of this century, while some stakes prepared printed, systematic lesson outlines for Aaronic Priesthood quorums, others left the young men to find their own way. This resulted “in some unusual priesthood meetings by our standards. One lesser priesthood group, for example, divided its class time between religious lessons and such adventure books as <span class="emphasis">Tom Sawyer, The Jungle Book, The Call of the Wild, Pigs Is Pigs,</span> and <span class="emphasis">Frank Among the Rancheros.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Today such “cultural enrichment” is for other times and settings; when the quorum meets as a class, the time is reserved for things of a higher order. Today’s Aaronic Priesthood curriculum includes such topics as “covenants guide our actions,” “respect for mothers and their divine role,” “valuing and encouraging people with disabilities,” and “moral courage,” to name just a few. Aaronic Priesthood quorums deserve a real priesthood class as part of a solid quorum experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p17" pid="hb3wMt5PuUG-jAUIklMUPA" hash="pUCWmQ">
        <span class="strong">Second, a quorum is a fraternity.</span> In the October general conference of 1982, Elder Robert L. Backman recounted the experience of a young man named Mark Peterson. Shortly after his ordination as a deacon, the deacons quorum presidency scheduled an appointment with Mark and his parents at their home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p18" pid="qNFi7RgQkkSD6AHuqhft7g" hash="Xt3u1Q">“Promptly at the hour set, the doorbell rang. The members of the presidency stood on the porch, dressed in suits, white shirts, and ties, and each one carrying his scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p19" pid="8rd93L5paEeDy6Tlqb-k1w" hash="FjZY8w">“Sitting down with Mark and his parents, they began with prayer, then handed an agenda to everyone there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p20" pid="1YKdWukaRUusyH1VZMey4g" hash="tElaKQ">“The president then opened the scriptures, having Mark and his father read those references which speak of the power of the Aaronic Priesthood, what it is, and the particular duties of a deacon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p21" pid="QRt9FWjh8kSuw5JfkyfRpg" hash="0QwwWg">“The president then spoke about Mark’s particular responsibilities and duties: how he should dress, how he should pass the sacrament, act as a messenger, collect fast offerings. And then they asked him if he had any questions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p22" pid="HVhNkP6ewUiRwdNwac1DdQ" hash="1R5uAw">“At the end of the visit they welcomed him to the quorum and offered help whenever he needed it. As they left, Mark … said to his Dad: ‘They were awesome!’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p23" pid="z4AF03Ow3EKjGt1dSSTFyQ" hash="fSOQkg">The fraternity of priesthood quorums can indeed be awesome. When I became a member of a Quorum of the Seventy, I assumed that I might be accepted by my brethren in the course of time if I were able to prove myself worthy of their association. I hoped someday to measure up and be approved. I was surprised to find myself immediately welcomed and from the outset treated as a brother, as an equal by men much more talented and accomplished than I. I have been supported and encouraged, loved and tutored in my quorum from my very first day of membership in it. Consequently, I feel a deep desire to contribute to the work of the quorum and to assist my brethren as much as I can.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p24" pid="xjvOJLDAsUipOmRY9BqfBw" hash="jNf4oA">President David O. McKay taught: “If priesthood meant only personal distinction or individual elevation, there would be no need of groups or quorums. The very existence of such groups, established by divine authorization, proclaims our dependence upon one another, the indispensable need of mutual help and assistance.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p25" pid="aus88coQvUavxLPseLgZ1A" hash="t56pEA">And let it be remembered that nowhere is the fraternity of quorums more crucial than in the case of newly baptized brethren and their families. Quorum and group leaders should provide the leading voice and laboring oar in every ward and branch council regarding retention of converts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p26" pid="lmAY-HfjGEC6J7BFpvvLcg" hash="4KQdag">
        <span class="strong">Third, a quorum is a service unit.</span> When I spoke earlier of the new Melchizedek Priesthood curriculum, I did not mention what takes place on the first Sunday of the month. That is a very special meeting. On the first Sunday, priesthood bearers meet in quorums and groups to learn their duties and plan their work. On the agenda are training and discussion, reports and assignments. It is a time to learn how to administer correctly priesthood ordinances and blessings. It is a time for the business of the priesthood. It is a time for putting the priesthood to work. I can imagine just such a meeting 80 years ago in Lehi, Utah, as the elders laid a plan to harvest the sugar beets of their beleaguered brother, George Goates.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p27" pid="Zm7hzBtRaEu8oTSKJoVyEg" hash="mkWX1A">Both Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood quorums will find their soul in service. Our great presiding High Priest and exemplar is Jesus Christ, who declared:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p28" pid="1wLGgBPALEul1rMYWX2-dw" hash="rMU94Q">“Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</p>

Hinckley expressed something of a vision regarding quorums in the priesthood. He said: “It will be a marvelous day, my brethren—it will be a day of fulfillment of the purposes of the Lord—when our priesthood quorums become an anchor of strength to every man belonging thereto, when each such man may appropriately be able to say, ‘I am a member of a priesthood quorum of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I stand ready to assist my brethren in all of their needs, as I am confident they stand ready to assist me in mine. Working together, we shall grow spiritually as covenant sons of God. Working together, we can stand, without embarrassment and without fear, against every wind of adversity that might blow, be it economic, social, or spiritual.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/the-priesthood-quorum.p32" pid="xTDtcxNNlk-dhJMV7UYTnQ" hash="u32XoA">We must not delay or wait longer for this great day of fulfillment. Each of you who has received an ordination in the priesthood belongs to a quorum. If you live in a place where there are not enough brethren to form a quorum, you are a member of a priesthood group that will become a quorum. Resolve now to do all within your power to make of your priesthood quorum one worthy of the name and one faithful to its mission. Study with your brethren in the quorum class. Stand with them in the quorum fraternity. Work with them in quorum service. The quorum, brethren, the quorum, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In the baptism of a living person, the officiator acts, by proxy, in place of the Savior. And is it not the central tenet of our faith that Christ’s sacrifice atones for our sins by vicariously satisfying the demands of justice for us? As President Gordon B. Hinckley has expressed: “I think that vicarious work for the dead more nearly approaches the vicarious sacrifice of the Savior Himself than any other work of which I know. It is given with love, without hope of compensation, or repayment or anything of the kind. What a glorious principle.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

We are dual beings of flesh and spirit, and we sometimes feel out of harmony or in conflict. Our spirit is enlightened by conscience, the light of Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.16" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:2</a>), and naturally responds to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit and desires to follow truth. But the appetites and temptations to which the flesh is subject can, if permitted, overwhelm and dominate the spirit. Paul said:</p>

We can turn to Him as we seek unity and peace within, because He understands. He understands the struggle, and He also understands how to win the struggle. As Paul said, “We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/4.15" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 4:15</a>).</p>

Soon after His intercessory plea that we might become “perfect in one,” Jesus suffered and gave His life to atone for sin. The power of His Atonement can erase the effects of sin in us. When we repent, His atoning grace justifies and cleanses us (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.16-20" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:16–20</a>). It is as if we had not succumbed, as if we had not yielded to temptation.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p2" pid="mK93smK4XkCQPD6ilKK7pw" hash="UI6CwQ">Years ago when I served as a stake president, a man came to confess a transgression. His confession surprised me. He had been an active member of the Church for years. I wondered how a person with his experience could have committed the sin that he did. After some pondering, it came to me that this brother had never become truly converted. Despite his Church activity, the gospel had not penetrated his heart. It was only an external influence in his life. When he was in wholesome environments, he kept the commandments, but in a different environment, other influences might control his actions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p3" pid="jiIPioPGekWdW4U4Goe0kA" hash="3Ej55w">How can you become converted? How can you make the gospel of Jesus Christ not just an influence in your life but the controlling influence and, indeed, the very core of what you are? The ancient prophet Jeremiah spoke of the law of God, the gospel, being written in our hearts. He quotes the Lord speaking about us, His people in the latter days: “I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p4" pid="O7HQ_q0k_kCQ5-kGc5B_1w" hash="4EIu8A">Do you want this for yourself? I can tell you how that can happen, but it must be something you want. The gospel cannot be written in your heart unless your heart is open. Without a heartfelt desire, you can participate in sacrament meetings, classes, and Church activities and do the things I will tell you, but it won’t make much difference. But if your heart is open and willing, like the heart of a child,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> let me tell you what you can do to be converted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p5" pid="GzDeO1NakkCRhPIBQbGA0A" hash="BOhDWg">As a first step, you must lay aside any feeling of pride that is so common in the world today. By this I mean the attitude that rejects the authority of God to rule in our lives. This attitude was described by the Lord to Joseph Smith when He said, “They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> You hear it expressed today in phrases such as “Do your own thing” or “Right and wrong depend on what I feel is right for me.” That attitude is a rebellion against God, just as Lucifer rebelled against God in the premortal world. He rejected God’s right to declare the truth and establish the law.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Satan wanted, and still wants, the power to declare arbitrarily what is right and wrong. Our beloved Creator does not force us to accept His authority, but willingly submitting to that authority is the first step in conversion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p6" pid="CJUEcyywr02DWNQFNJYx9Q" hash="FutXRg">Further, for the gospel to be written in your heart, you need to know what it is and grow to understand it more fully. That means you will study it.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> When I say “study,” I mean something more than reading. It is a good thing sometimes to read a book of scripture within a set period of time to get an overall sense of its message, but for conversion, you should care more about the amount of time you spend in the scriptures than about the amount you read in that time. I see you sometimes reading a few verses, stopping to ponder them, carefully reading the verses again, and as you think about what they mean, praying for understanding, asking questions in your mind, waiting for spiritual impressions, and writing down the impressions and insights that come so you can remember and learn more. Studying in this way, you may not read a lot of chapters or verses in a half hour, but you will be giving place in your heart for the word of God, and He will be speaking to you. Remember Alma’s description of what it feels like: “It beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> You will know that the gospel is being written in your heart, that your conversion is happening, as the word of the Lord from His prophets, past and present, feels more and more delicious to your soul.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p7" pid="Q20D04GowEy5HbCxYZyf2Q" hash="LJC7iQ">I mentioned praying as you study to understand the scriptures, but your prayers must not be limited to that. In the Book of Mormon, Amulek tells us we should pray about everything in our lives. He says, “Pour out your souls [to God] in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Your Heavenly Father wants you to pray about your hopes and fears, your friends and family, your school and work, and the needs of those around you. Most of all, you should pray to be filled with the love of Christ. This love is given to those who are true followers of Jesus Christ, who ask for it with all the energy of their heart.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> This love is the fruit of the tree of life,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> and tasting it is a major part of your conversion because once you have felt your Savior’s love for you, even the smallest part, you will feel secure, and a love for Him and for your Heavenly Father will grow within you. In your heart you will want to do what these holy beings ask of you. Go often to your closet, your secret place, your wilderness. Thank God for your blessings; ask for His help; ask Him to bestow upon you the pure love of Christ. Sometimes fasting will help.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p8" pid="O0OioblPu0uLyF4lK5RqMw" hash="GpAffA">After Amulek talked about prayer, he spoke about something else that is an important element of your conversion—serving others. Otherwise, he said, “your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> In other words, to be converted, you must not only open your heart to a knowledge of the gospel and the love of God, you must practice the gospel law. You cannot fully understand or appreciate it unless you personally apply it in your life. Jesus said that He came to serve, not to be served.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> So it must be with you. You must look outward and care about others. You can be compassionate; you can be friendly; you can share; you can help others in a hundred small ways. As you do, the gospel of Jesus Christ will become a part of you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p9" pid="Tn7LrwUPOUqVYxQlZTdyMA" hash="JxTh4Q">Let me mention one other thing. In ancient times when people wanted to worship the Lord and seek His blessings, they often brought a gift. For example, when they went to the temple, they brought a sacrifice to place on the altar. After His Atonement and Resurrection, the Savior said He would no longer accept burnt offerings of animals. The gift or sacrifice He will accept now is “a broken heart and a contrite spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> As you seek the blessing of conversion, you can offer the Lord the gift of your broken, or repentant, heart and your contrite, or obedient, spirit. In reality, it is the gift of yourself—what you are and what you are becoming.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p10" pid="9xDisu95i0GAQFJptLqx9w" hash="Ms8Azw">Is there something in you or in your life that is impure or unworthy? When you get rid of it, that is a gift to the Savior. Is there a good habit or quality that is lacking in your life? When you adopt it and make it part of your character, you are giving a gift to the Lord.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Sometimes this is hard to do, but would your gifts of repentance and obedience be worthy gifts if they cost you nothing?<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> Don’t be afraid of the effort required. And remember, you don’t have to do it alone. Jesus Christ will help you make of yourself a worthy gift. His grace will make you clean, even holy. Eventually, you will become like Him, “perfect in Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p11" pid="Xj3eF3DYwE6xq4CpTLT4Sw" hash="ovTgFw">With conversion, you will wear a protective armor, “the whole armour of God,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> and the words of Christ, which come by the Holy Spirit, “will tell you all things” you should do.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/when-thou-art-converted.p12" pid="aVrgiF__Uk25G1FI8glDsg" hash="rru_-Q">In 1992 two sister missionaries in Zagreb, Croatia, were returning to their apartment one evening. Their last teaching appointment had been some distance away, and it was getting dark. Several men on the trolley made crude comments and became rather menacing. Feeling threatened, the sisters got off the trolley at the next stop just as the doors closed so no one could follow them. Having avoided that problem, they realized they were in a place unknown to either of them. As they turned to look for help, they saw a woman. The missionaries explained that they were lost and asked the woman if she could direct them. She knew where they could find another trolley to take them home and invited them to follow her. On the way they had to pass a bar with patrons sitting along the sidewalk in the gathering darkness. These men also appeared threatening. Nevertheless, the two young women had the distinct impression that the men could not see them. They walked by, apparently invisible to those who might have had a mind to harm them. When the sisters and their guide reached the stop, the trolley they needed was just arriving. They turned to thank the woman, but she was nowhere to be seen.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span></p>

As you become converted, you will have comparable protections to keep you from temptation and deliver you from evil.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> Sometimes evil will not find you. Sometimes you will be protected when evil is made invisible to you. Even when you must confront it directly, you will do so with faith, not fear.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="46"></span>Years ago, when my brothers and I were boys, our mother had radical cancer surgery. She came very close to death. Much of the tissue in her neck and shoulder had to be removed, and for a long time it was very painful for her to use her right arm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/let-us-be-men.p2" pid="d-xKbaOQH0Sjyb-Mh_Ni7w" hash="aq0_rA">One morning about a year after the surgery, my father took Mother to an appliance store and asked the manager to show her how to use a machine he had for ironing clothes. The machine was called an Ironrite. It was operated from a chair by pressing pedals with one’s knees to lower a padded roller against a heated metal surface and turn the roller, feeding in shirts, pants, dresses, and other articles. You can see that this would make ironing (of which there was a great deal in our family of five boys) much easier, especially for a woman with limited use of her arm. Mother was shocked when Dad told the manager they would buy the machine and then paid cash for it. Despite my father’s good income as a veterinarian, Mother’s surgery and medications had left them in a difficult financial situation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/let-us-be-men.p3" pid="cf_iutAs_kWoOpl5LdBeHA" hash="2RzvJg">On the way home, my mother was upset: “How can we afford it? Where did the money come from? How will we get along now?” Finally Dad told her that he had gone without lunches for nearly a year to save enough money. “Now when you iron,” he said, “you won’t have to stop and go into the bedroom and cry until the pain in your arm stops.” She didn’t know he knew about that. I was not aware of my father’s sacrifice and act of love for my mother at the time, but now that I know, I say to myself, “There is a man.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/let-us-be-men.p4" pid="oT21Uy5frkWpu0nYqNspKQ" hash="4oVz3A">The prophet Lehi pled with his rebellious sons, saying, “Arise from the dust, my sons, <span class="emphasis">and be men</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 1:21</a>; emphasis added). By age, Laman and Lemuel were men, but in terms of character and spiritual maturity they were still as children. They murmured and complained if asked to do anything hard. They didn’t accept anyone’s authority to correct them. They didn’t value spiritual things. They easily resorted to violence, and they were good at playing the victim.</p>

Some act as if a man’s highest goal should be his own pleasure. Permissive social mores have “let men off the hook” as it were, so that many think it acceptable to father children out of wedlock and to cohabit rather than marry.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Dodging commitments is considered smart, but sacrificing for the good of others, naive. For some, a life of work and achievement is optional. A psychologist studying the growing phenomenon of what he calls “young men stuck in neutral” describes this scenario:</p>

It is a wonderful aspiration for a boy to become a man—strong and capable; someone who can build and create things, run things; someone who makes a difference in the world. It is a wonderful aspiration for those of us who are older to make the vision of true manhood a reality in our lives and be models for those who look to us for an example.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="76"></span>Fifteen years ago I stood for the first time at the pulpit in the Tabernacle as a newly sustained Seventy. I was 48 years old. I had thick, dark brown hair. I thought I understood what it meant to feel inadequate. At the end of my five-minute remarks, my shirt was dripping with perspiration. The whole thing was something of an ordeal. However, today, in retrospect, it seems a comparatively pleasant experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p2" pid="w1h2LyN4ZUu-fcr3UIOKSQ" hash="dQD8Cg">When President Dieter F. Uchtdorf and Elder David A. Bednar were first sustained as members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a witness of the divine origin of their calls came to me during the session. I was also given in that moment an understanding of the surpassing sacredness of the call and service of an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. I do not have the words to express that understanding because it was communicated Spirit to spirit without words. To think of it now reduces me to a depth of humility I have never before experienced, and I plead with my Heavenly Father to sustain me as He ever has that I might measure up to something that is far beyond my native capacity and be able to focus outwardly, losing myself in your service. I trust in Him, and I know that His grace is sufficient, and so I here unreservedly commit all that I have and am to God and His Beloved Son. I also commit myself, my loyalty, my service, and my love to the First Presidency and to my Brethren of the Twelve.</p>

I pay tribute to my parents and with love acknowledge my debt to them and to their parents and generations beyond. Not long after my call to the Seventy, I had occasion to be standing at the grave of one of those ancestors who had died years before I was born. As I contemplated the sacrifices entailed upon him and his family by their acceptance of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, a sense of gratitude flooded my heart and a resolve welled up in me to honor his sacrifice and that of those who came after by being faithful to God and the gospel covenants, as they were.</p>

My wife and I have four sons and a daughter, each married to a wonderful spouse or, in the case of our youngest son, soon to be married to a lovely young woman. We love them and our grandchildren and appreciate how they bless our lives by their loyalty to the Savior and His gospel. At the pinnacle is my wife, Kathy, the maker of our home, the light of my life, a steady and wise companion, filled with spiritual intuition, good humor, goodwill, and charity. I love her beyond expression and hope to show it more convincingly in the days and years ahead.</p>

Stone and Richard G. Scott, and their respective wives, Patricia and Jeanene. I thank God for their lasting influence in me. Following my graduation from law school, Kathy and I and our children made our homes successively in the states of Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and now Utah. Three precious years were spent in Mexico. In all of these places, we have been blessed with dear friends in and out of the Church who have loved and taught and befriended us and our children and who continue to do so. I take this opportunity to publicly express gratitude to all of them.</p>

I rejoice that my continuing service will keep me close to them and that there will be frequent opportunities to serve together. The unfolding revelations of <span class="pageBreak" page-number="77"></span>our time that have set the Seventy in place in the Church constitute one of the most profound and perhaps underappreciated miracles in the history of the Lord’s latter-day work. The Seventy are key to the success of the work now and in the years ahead, and I feel honored beyond measure that my name was ever included among theirs. God bless you, my Brethren.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p7" pid="hOrATlaxSk2H6WnWwcfPzQ" hash="oQRF1g">I wish to bear you my witness of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and the power of His infinite, atoning sacrifice. In doing so, I will call upon an experience from my years in Tennessee. One evening there I received a call at home from a gentleman I did not know. He introduced himself as a recently retired minister of another faith and asked to meet with me privately the following Sunday. When we met, my guest stated frankly he had come out of concern for the welfare of my soul. He pulled out of his portfolio a fairly long list of scripture citations from the New Testament and said he wanted to review these verses with me and see if he could help me be saved. I was a bit surprised at his directness, but I could tell that he was sincere, and I was touched by his genuine interest in me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p8" pid="FkGefabxP0e-HUcfn9vrxA" hash="fUCO4Q">We conversed for more than an hour, and he was open to hear me explain something of my faith as well as to read with me some teachings from the Book of Mormon with which he was not familiar. We found there was much we believed in common and some things we did not. We felt a bond of friendship and prayed together before he left. What remains with me is our discussion about being born again. It is spiritual rebirth through Jesus Christ that is the context of my witness of Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p9" pid="wEgKboloJEeQja_uCB7yfw" hash="llzzIA">It was Jesus who stated that entry into the kingdom of God requires that one be born again—born of water and of the Spirit (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.3-5" class="scriptureRef">John 3:3–5</a>). His teaching about a physical and a spiritual baptism helps us understand that both our own action and the intervention of divine power are needed for this transformative rebirth—for the change from natural man to saint (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>). Paul described being born again with this simple expression: “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/5.17" class="scriptureRef">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p10" pid="o4svsm_pgUS7Z7y6eqKArg" hash="Khr9QQ">Consider two examples from the Book of Mormon. About a century before the birth of Christ, King Benjamin taught his people of the Savior’s advent and Atonement. The Spirit of the Lord wrought such a mighty change in the people that they had “no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>). Because of their faith in Christ, they said, “We are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments … <span class="emphasis">all the remainder of our days”</span> (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.5" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:5</a>; emphasis added). The king responded, “Because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.7" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:7</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:24</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p11" pid="REpG3XCMj0aQdVjrQwnJAA" hash="fPr_Uw">The case of Alma is also instructive. As he and his companions went about seeking to destroy the Church of Christ, they were rebuked by an angel. There followed for Alma three days and nights that he described as being “racked with eternal torment. … Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.12-13" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:12–13</a>). Finally, after “repenting nigh unto death” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.28" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 27:28</a>), as he put it, there came to his mind the sweet message of Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Alma pled, “O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:18</a>). Forgiveness came to him, and he stood and publicly confessed:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p12" pid="ANvYR90-yUWDd0GN8sMrpQ" hash="K4EfRA">“I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p13" pid="99mXJS6Bg0Kv84s4XT4y0w" hash="TZmFSQ">“And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues <span class="pageBreak" page-number="78"></span>and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p15" pid="mNv1I27qq0-R64qy-sSKBg" hash="ler84Q">As we reflect on these examples and other scriptures, it becomes clear that spiritual rebirth originates with faith in Jesus Christ, by whose grace we are changed. More specifically, it is faith in Christ as the Atoning One, the Redeemer, who can cleanse from sin and make holy (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:2–3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p16" pid="2vFuCZYfDE6FLZC3kDHpHA" hash="R0G-9Q">When this true faith takes root in a person, it inevitably leads to repentance. Amulek taught that the Savior’s sacrifice would “bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men <span class="emphasis">that they may have faith unto repentance”</span> (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:15</a>; emphasis added).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p17" pid="E0jKMfjJTEa1FqWL60SYhg" hash="WCyqyA">To be complete, however, repentance requires a covenant of obedience. This is the covenant expressed by Benjamin’s people “to do [God’s] will, and to be obedient to his commandments” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.5" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:5</a>). This is the covenant witnessed by baptism in water (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.10" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:10</a>), sometimes referred to in the scriptures as the “baptism of repentance” or “baptism unto repentance,” inasmuch as it is the culminating step, the capstone of our repentance (see, for example, <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/19.4" class="scriptureRef">Acts 19:4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:14</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/9.27" class="scriptureRef">9:27</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:20</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p18" pid="eptGUfcYmk2b78zGfw282g" hash="fqMWFw">Then, as promised, the Lord baptizes us “with fire and with the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 9:20</a>). Nephi phrased it this way: “For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.17" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 31:17</a>).<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Having thus relied “upon the merits of him who is mighty to save” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.19" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 31:19</a>), we are “quickened in the inner man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.65" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:65</a>) and, if not yet fully born again, then certainly well into the path of spiritual rebirth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p19" pid="RjaFcNBQTUe55zq_Ea5nQw" hash="6PEp3w">Now, the Lord cautions us to take heed since “there is a possibility that man may fall from grace” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:32</a>), even those who are sanctified (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.32-34" class="scriptureRef">vv. 32–34</a>). As Nephi counseled: “Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 31:20</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/born-again.p20" pid="oo0WIMq7k0um37strbPPDg" hash="o_sKAA">You may ask, Why doesn’t this mighty change happen more quickly with me? You should remember that the remarkable examples of King Benjamin’s people, Alma, and some others in scripture are just that—remarkable and not typical.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> For most of us, the changes are more gradual and occur over time. Being born again, unlike our physical birth, is more a process than an event. And engaging in that process is the central purpose of mortality.</p>

Let us not be content to retain some disposition to do evil. Let us worthily partake of the sacrament each week and continue to draw upon the Holy Spirit to root out the last vestiges of impurity within us. I testify that as you continue in the path of spiritual rebirth, the atoning grace of Jesus Christ will take away your sins and the stain of those sins in you, temptations will lose their appeal, and through Christ you will become holy, as He and our Father are holy.</p>

Through his personal association with the Lord, his translation and publication of the Book of Mormon, and the sealing of his testimony with his martyr’s blood, Joseph has become the preeminent revelator of Jesus Christ in His true character as divine Redeemer. Jesus has had no greater witness nor more devoted friend than Joseph Smith. I declare my testimony of the calling of President Thomas S. Monson as prophet and President of the Church of Jesus Christ in this time and pledge my loyalty to him and his counselors in their sacred roles. I pray God’s blessings upon us all. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="37"></span>The Prophet Joseph Smith said: “The building up of Zion is a cause that has interested the people of God in every age; it is a theme upon which prophets, priests and kings have dwelt with peculiar delight; they have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live; and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipations they have sung and written and prophesied of this our day; but they died without the sight; we are the favored people that God has made choice of to bring about the Latter-day glory” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith </span>[Melchizedek Priesthood and Relief Society course of study, 2007], 186).</p>

Zion was the name given to the ancient city of Enoch in the days before the Flood. “And it came to pass in his days, that he built a city that was called the City of Holiness, even Zion” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.19" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:19</a>). This Zion endured for some 365 years (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.68" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:68</a>). The scriptural record states, “And Enoch and all his people walked with God, and he dwelt in the midst of Zion; and it came to pass that Zion was not, for God received it up into his own bosom; and from thence went forth the saying, Zion is fled” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.69" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:69</a>). Later, Jerusalem and its temple were called Mount Zion, and the scriptures prophesy of a future New Jerusalem where Christ shall reign as “King of Zion,” when “for the space of a thousand years the earth shall rest” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.53,64" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:53, 64</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/come-to-zion.p3" pid="1ZaziBIjLEOATBOoPUeBOQ" hash="fC_x-Q">The Lord called Enoch’s people Zion “because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:18</a>). Elsewhere He said, “For this is Zion—the pure in heart” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 97:21</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/come-to-zion.p4" pid="mH0ZoUF9OkGYfkOBRYGzcA" hash="KRdmQQ">The antithesis and antagonist of Zion is Babylon. The city of Babylon was originally Babel, of Tower of Babel fame, and later became the capital of the Babylonian empire. Its principal edifice was the temple of Bel, or Baal, the idol referred to by Old Testament prophets as “The Shame,” given the sexual perversions that were associated with its worship. (See Bible Dictionary, “Assyria and Babylonia,” 615–16; “Baal,” 617–18; “Babylon, or Babel,” 618.) Its worldliness, its worship of evil, and the captivity of Judah there following the conquest of 587 <small>B.C.</small> all combine to make Babylon the symbol of decadent societies and spiritual bondage.</p>

He called for the elders of His Church to be sent forth across the world to accomplish this gathering, commencing an effort that continues in full vigor today. “And behold, and lo, this shall be their cry, and the voice of the Lord unto all people: Go ye forth unto the land of Zion, that the borders of my people may be enlarged, and that her stakes may be strengthened, and that Zion may go forth unto the regions round about” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 133:9</a>).</p>

Nephi foresaw that these “dominions” would be small but that the Lord’s power would descend “upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, … who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they [would be] armed with righteousness” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.12-14" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 14:12–14</a>).

If we would establish Zion in our homes, branches, wards, and stakes, we must rise to this standard. It will be necessary (1) to become unified in one heart and one mind; (2) to become, individually and collectively, a holy people; and (3) to care for the poor and needy with such effectiveness that we eliminate poverty among us. We cannot wait until Zion comes for these things to happen—Zion will come only as they happen.</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 105:4</a>). Forgiveness of one another is essential to this unity.

We can unite with President Thomas S. Monson in love and concern for one another. In general conference last April, President Monson spoke to those estranged from the Church and to all of us when he said: “In the private sanctuary of one’s own conscience lies that spirit, that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential. In this spirit, we again issue that heartfelt invitation: Come back. We reach out to you in the pure love of Christ and express our desire to assist you and to welcome you into full fellowship. To those who are wounded in spirit or who are struggling and fearful, we say, Let us lift you and cheer you and calm your fears” (“Looking Back and Moving Forward,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 2008, 90).</p>

Among this group were 20 young men and women from Moldova who had spent days obtaining passports and visas and over 30 hours traveling by bus to get there. The conference program included some 15 workshops. Each person needed to select the two or three that he or she most wanted to attend. Rather than focus exclusively on their own interests, these Moldovan young adults got together and made plans so that at least one of their group would be in each class and take copious notes. Then they would share what they had learned with each other and later with the young adults in Moldova who could not attend. In its simplest form, this exemplifies the unity and love for one another that, multiplied thousands of times in different ways, will “bring again Zion” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/52.8" class="scriptureRef">Isaiah 52:8</a>).</p>

The law of the celestial kingdom is, of course, the gospel law and covenants, which include our constant remembrance of the Savior and our pledge of obedience, sacrifice, consecration, and fidelity.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/come-to-zion.p19" pid="e-7eaT5u3kimvWAJashPkQ" hash="hkDMFA">The Savior was critical of some of the early Saints for their “lustful … desires” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:6</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.121" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:121</a>). These were people who lived in a non-television, non-film, <span class="pageBreak" page-number="39"></span>non-Internet, non-iPod world. In a world now awash in sexualized images and music, are we free from lustful desires and their attendant evils? Far from pushing the limits of modest dress or indulging in the vicarious immorality of pornography, we are to hunger and thirst after righteousness. To come to Zion, it is not enough for you or me to be somewhat less wicked than others. We are to become not only good but holy men and women. Recalling Elder Neal A. Maxwell’s phrase, let us once and for all establish our residence in Zion and give up the summer cottage in Babylon (see Neal A. Maxwell, <span class="emphasis">A Wonderful Flood of Light</span> [1990], 47).</p>

Let us look after one another the very best we can. I remember the story of a Vietnamese family that fled Saigon in 1975 and ended up living in a small mobile home in Provo, Utah. A young man in the refugee family became the home teaching companion to a Brother Johnson who lived nearby with his large family. The boy related the following:</p>

He appeared the next day with an odd-looking but very functional table that fit nicely against the trailer wall across from the kitchen sink and counters. I say odd-looking because two of the table legs matched the tabletop and two did not. Also, several small wooden pegs stuck out along one edge of the worn surface.</p>

There in the nearby kitchen—I was surprised to see it—was a table practically identical to the one they had given to my family. The only difference was that where our table had pegs, the Johnsons’ table had holes! I then realized that, seeing our need, this charitable man had cut his kitchen table in half and had built two new legs for each half.</p>

Nash of the Seventy was in Chincha helping to coordinate the Church’s relief efforts there and met President Conde. As they talked about the destruction that had occurred and what was being done to help the victims, President Conde’s wife, Pamela, approached carrying one of her small children. Elder Nash asked Sister Conde how her children were. With a smile, she replied that through the goodness of God they were all safe and well. He asked about the Condes’ home.</p>

It is a simple illustration of a profound power that is much needed in our day and that will become increasingly crucial in days ahead. We need strong Christians who can persevere against hardship, who <span class="pageBreak" page-number="20"></span>can sustain hope through tragedy, who can lift others by their example and their compassion, and who can consistently overcome temptations. We need strong Christians who can make important things happen by their faith and who can defend the truth of Jesus Christ against moral relativism and militant atheism.</p>

The source is God. Our access to that power is through our covenants with Him. A covenant is an agreement between God and man, an accord whose terms are set by God (see Bible Dictionary, “Covenant,” 651). In these divine agreements, God binds Himself to sustain, sanctify, and exalt us in return for our commitment to serve Him and keep His commandments.</p>

Our foundational covenant, for example, the one in which we first pledge our willingness to take upon us the name of Christ, is confirmed by the ordinance of baptism. It is done individually, by name. By this ordinance, we become part of the covenant people of the Lord and heirs of the celestial kingdom of God.</p>

If we are faithful to the covenants made there, we become inheritors not only of the celestial kingdom but of exaltation, the highest glory within the heavenly kingdom, and we obtain all the divine possibilities God can give (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 132:20</a>).</p>

The new and everlasting covenant is the gospel of Jesus Christ. In other words, the doctrines and commandments of the gospel constitute the substance of an everlasting covenant between God and man that is newly restored in each dispensation. If we were to state the new and everlasting covenant in one sentence it would be this: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16</a>).</p>

Those blessings provide the resources we need to act rather than simply be acted upon as we go through life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> For example, the Lord’s commandments in the Word of Wisdom regarding the care of our physical bodies bless us first and foremost with “wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89:19</a>). Furthermore, they lead to a generally more healthy life and freedom from destructive addictions. Obedience gives us greater control over our lives, greater capacity to come and go, to work and create. Of course, age, accident, and illnesses inevitably take their toll, but even so, our obedience to this gospel law enhances our capacity to deal with these challenges.</p>

We are part of a covenant people, a community of Saints who encourage, sustain, and minister to one another. As Nephi explained, “And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.3" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 17:3</a>).<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Our willingness to take upon us the name of Christ and keep His commandments requires a degree of faith, but as we honor our covenants, that faith expands. In the first place, the promised fruits of obedience become evident, which confirms our faith. Secondly, the Spirit communicates God’s pleasure, and we feel secure in His continued blessing and help. Thirdly, come what may, we can face life with hope and equanimity, knowing that we will succeed in the end because we have God’s promise to us individually, by name, and we know He cannot lie (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.6" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.12" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:12</a>).</p>

It is the gift by which Adam was “quickened in the inner man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.65" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:65</a>).

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="105"></span>During World War II, President James E. Faust, then a young enlisted man in the United States Army, applied for officer candidate school. He appeared before a board of inquiry composed of what he described as “hard-bitten career soldier[s].” After a while their questions turned to matters of religion. The final questions were these:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p2" pid="R-CJYI_n802qO-kp19OeYA" hash="x-pTAw">“In times of war should not the moral code be relaxed? Does not the stress of battle justify men in doing things that they would not do when at home under normal situations?”</p>

I knew perfectly well that the men who were asking me this question did not live by the standards that I had been taught. The thought flashed through my mind that perhaps I could say that I had my own beliefs but did not wish to impose them on others. But there seemed to flash before my mind the faces of the many people to whom I had taught the law of chastity as a missionary. In the end I simply said, ‘I do not believe there is a double standard of morality.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p5" pid="gAJi0xVPaE6ESKRBSDQDJw" hash="5tf1ZA">“I left the hearing resigned to the fact that [they] would not like the answers I had given … and would surely score me very low.

He also understood and demonstrated that, for positive outcomes, moral agency must be accompanied by moral discipline.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p8" pid="pJommTjm8E2h6PxHG3mkDQ" hash="yU47ow">By “moral discipline,” I mean self-discipline based on moral standards. Moral discipline is the consistent exercise of agency to choose the right because it is right, even when it is hard. It rejects the self-absorbed life in favor of developing character worthy of respect and true greatness through Christlike service (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.42-45" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:42–45</a>). The root of the word <span class="emphasis">discipline</span> is <span class="pageBreak" page-number="106"></span>shared by the word <span class="emphasis">disciple,</span> suggesting to the mind the fact that conformity to the example and teachings of Jesus Christ is the ideal discipline that, coupled with His grace, forms a virtuous and morally excellent person.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p9" pid="h08XMvWJ_US5bCN9lHllnw" hash="Rzr2OQ">Jesus’s own moral discipline was rooted in His discipleship to the Father. To His disciples He explained, “My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/4.34" class="scriptureRef">John 4:34</a>). By this same pattern, our moral discipline is rooted in loyalty and devotion to the Father and the Son. It is the gospel of Jesus Christ that provides the moral certainty upon which moral discipline rests.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p10" pid="2WRKtO3WQUik93o12-qIvg" hash="4vqLdw">The societies in which many of us live have for more than a generation failed to foster moral discipline. They have taught that truth is relative and that everyone decides for himself or herself what is right. Concepts such as sin and wrong have been condemned as “value judgments.” As the Lord describes it, “Every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p11" pid="85x-JGNqkUm5WIaYOfTyTQ" hash="aDCUVw">As a consequence, self-discipline has eroded and societies are left to try to maintain order and civility by compulsion. The lack of internal control by individuals breeds external control by governments. One columnist observed that “gentlemanly behavior [for example, once] protected women from coarse behavior. Today, we expect sexual harassment laws to restrain coarse behavior. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p12" pid="DIwyoQtZ_E29mqVQp4D6Sw" hash="Tfw4fg">“Policemen and laws can never replace customs, traditions and moral values as a means for regulating human behavior. At best, the police and criminal justice system are the last desperate line of defense for a civilized society. Our increased reliance on laws to regulate behavior is a measure of how uncivilized we’ve become.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p13" pid="eV0p8BakCUiRvxilO4zFIQ" hash="RerCQQ">In most of the world, we have been experiencing an extended and devastating economic recession. It was brought on by multiple causes, but one of the major causes was widespread dishonest and unethical conduct, particularly in the U.S. housing and financial markets. Reactions have focused on enacting more and stronger regulation. Perhaps that may dissuade some from unprincipled conduct, but others will simply get more creative in their circumvention.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> There could never be enough rules so finely crafted as to anticipate and cover every situation, and even if there were, enforcement would be impossibly expensive and burdensome. This approach leads to diminished freedom for everyone. In the memorable phrase of Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, “We would not accept the yoke of Christ; so now we must tremble at the yoke of Caesar.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p14" pid="xyQacHtGOkelfG1Wf4bBnA" hash="Hk4uQg">In the end, it is only an internal moral compass in each individual that can effectively deal with the root causes as well as the symptoms of societal decay. Societies will struggle in vain to establish the common good <span class="pageBreak" page-number="107"></span>until sin is denounced as sin and moral discipline takes its place in the pantheon of civic virtues.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p15" pid="G-is1bHsPkKu6i2bnpWYOg" hash="DUOsbA">Moral discipline is learned at home. While we cannot control what others may or may not do, the Latter-day Saints can certainly stand with those who demonstrate virtue in their own lives and inculcate virtue in the rising generation. Remember from Book of Mormon history the young men who were key to the Nephite victory in the long war of 66 to 60 <small>B.C.</small>—the sons of the people of Ammon. Their character and discipline were described in these words:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p20" pid="hPMwKjtQq0mH_fIO_jT6WQ" hash="4btcXg">Here we find a standard for what should happen in our homes and in the Church. Our teaching should draw upon our own faith and focus first and foremost on instilling faith in God in the rising generation. We must declare the essential need to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before Him in soberness, or in other words, with reverence. Each must be persuaded that service and sacrifice for the well-being and happiness of others are far superior to making one’s own comfort and possessions the highest priority.</p>

They think that in this way they are allowing children to exercise their agency. What they forget is that the intelligent use of agency requires knowledge of the truth, of things as they really are (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:24</a>). Without that, young people can hardly be expected to understand and evaluate the alternatives that come before them. Parents should consider how the adversary approaches their children. He and his followers are not promoting objectivity but are vigorous, multimedia advocates of sin and selfishness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p25" pid="w6zUlema40W2DToWCITAyA" hash="g--gaw">Seeking to be neutral about the gospel is, in reality, to reject the existence of God and His authority. We must, rather, acknowledge Him and His omniscience if we want our children to see life’s choices clearly and be able to think for themselves. They should not have to learn by sad experience that “wickedness never was happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p26" pid="_9Y-JKWjLE65gnmNP8EpBA" hash="rkU_Fg">I can share with you a simple example from my own life of what parents can do. When I was about five or six years old, I lived across the street from a small grocery store. One day two other boys invited me to go with them to the store. As we stood coveting the candy for sale there, the older boy grabbed a candy bar and slipped it into his pocket. He urged the other boy and me to do the same, and after some hesitation we did. Then we quickly left the store and ran off in separate directions. I found a hiding place at home and tore off the candy wrapper. My mother discovered me with the chocolate evidence smeared on my face and escorted me back to the grocery store. As we crossed the street, I was sure I was facing life imprisonment. With sobs and tears, I apologized to the owner and paid him for the candy bar with a dime that my mother had loaned me (which I had to earn later). My mother’s love and discipline put an abrupt and early end to my life of crime.</p>

So did the Savior, but He “gave no heed unto them” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:22</a>). Similarly, we do not have to yield simply because a temptation surfaces. We may want to, but we don’t have to. An incredulous female friend asked a young adult woman, committed to living the law of chastity, how it was possible that she had never “slept with anybody.” “Don’t you <span class="emphasis">want</span> to?” the friend asked. The young woman thought: “The question intrigued me, because it was so utterly beside the point. … Mere wanting is hardly a proper guide for moral conduct.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p28" pid="i0uYXg4-80uRW2_xd3qlEA" hash="I3fkyQ">In some cases, temptation may have the added force of potential or actual addiction. I am grateful that for an increasing number of people the Church can provide therapeutic help of various kinds to aid them in avoiding or coping with addictions. Even so, while therapy can support a person’s will, it cannot substitute for it. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="108"></span>Always and ever, there must be an exercise of discipline—moral discipline founded on faith in God the Father and the Son and what They can achieve with us through the atoning grace of Jesus Christ. In Peter’s words, “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/2.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Peter 2:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p29" pid="sLuL9C0jFEyd_7GGXAXFog" hash="yM5dHA">We cannot presume that the future will resemble the past—that things and patterns we have relied upon economically, politically, socially will remain as they have been. Perhaps our moral discipline, if we will cultivate it, will have an influence for good and inspire others to pursue the same course. We may thereby have an impact on future trends and events. At a minimum, moral discipline will be of immense help to us as we deal with whatever stresses and challenges may come in a disintegrating society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p30" pid="x5ZCwlcXDkyiX6eJ9GfnUA" hash="RrMVZQ">We have heard thoughtful and inspired messages during this conference, and in a moment President Thomas S. Monson will provide concluding words of counsel. As we prayerfully consider what we have learned and relearned, I believe that the Spirit will shed further light on those things that have particular application for each of us individually. We will be fortified in the moral discipline needed to walk uprightly before the Lord and be at one with Him and the Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/moral-discipline.p31" pid="16cb99dVNkqGYsmcp3vw6w" hash="Xsjnsw">I stand with my brethren and with you, my brothers and sisters, as a witness that God is our Father and that His Son, Jesus, is our Redeemer.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="32"></span>On October 6, in the year 1536, a pitiful figure was led from a dungeon in Vilvorde Castle near Brussels, Belgium. For nearly a year and a half, the man had suffered isolation in a dark, damp cell. Now outside the castle wall, the prisoner was fastened to a post. He had time to utter aloud his final prayer, “Lord! open the king of England’s eyes,” and then he was strangled. Immediately, his body was burned at the stake. Who was this man, and what was the offense for which both political and ecclesiastical authorities had condemned him? His name was William Tyndale, and his crime was to have translated and published the Bible in English.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-blessing-of-scripture.p2" pid="GqvakgMeuk-ppiXE9KA4zg" hash="7Hjy2w">Tyndale, born in England about the time Columbus sailed to the new world, was educated at Oxford and Cambridge and then became a member of the Catholic clergy. He was fluent in eight languages, including Greek, Hebrew, and Latin. Tyndale was a devoted student of the Bible, and the pervasive ignorance of the scriptures that he observed in both priests and lay people troubled him deeply. In a heated exchange with a cleric who argued against putting scripture in the hands of the common man, Tyndale vowed, “If God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough, shall know more of the Scripture than thou dost!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-blessing-of-scripture.p3" pid="s-STQeS-gkKwNyv3-HUUFQ" hash="bStHHA">He sought the approval of church authorities to prepare a translation of the Bible in English so that all could read and apply the word of God. It was denied—the prevailing view being that direct access to the scriptures by any but the clergy threatened the authority of the church and was tantamount to casting “pearls before swine” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.6" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 7:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-blessing-of-scripture.p4" pid="dEHPxRpDbUO3TFlH9t2cqA" hash="CdPZxg">Tyndale nevertheless undertook the challenging work of translation. In 1524 he traveled to Germany, under an assumed name, where he lived much of the time in hiding, under constant threat of arrest. With the help of committed friends, Tyndale was able to publish English translations of the New Testament and later the Old Testament. The Bibles were smuggled into England, where they were in great demand and much prized by those who could get them. They were shared widely but in secret. The authorities burned all the copies they could find. Nevertheless, within three years of Tyndale’s death, God did indeed open King Henry VIII’s eyes, and with publication of what was called the “Great Bible,” the scriptures in English began to be publicly available. Tyndale’s work became the foundation for almost all future English translations of the Bible, most notably the King James Version.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-blessing-of-scripture.p5" pid="f-a_ukuiCEOThmjGjHow6g" hash="UPeiew">William Tyndale was not the first, nor the last, of those who in many countries and languages have sacrificed, even to the point of death, to bring the word of God out of obscurity. We owe them all a great debt of gratitude. We owe perhaps an even greater debt to those who faithfully recorded and preserved the word through the ages, often with painstaking labor and sacrifice—Moses, Isaiah, Abraham, John, Paul, Nephi, Mormon, Joseph Smith, and many others. What did they know about the importance of scriptures that we also need to know? What did people in 16th-century England, who paid enormous sums and ran grave personal risks for access to a Bible, understand that we should also understand?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-blessing-of-scripture.p6" pid="aFK0fMQWR0GFFhtAEHxRTA" hash="z19Nbw">Not long before his death, the prophet Alma entrusted the sacred records of the people to his son Helaman. He reminded Helaman that the scriptures had “enlarged the memory of this people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of <span class="pageBreak" page-number="33"></span>their God unto the salvation of their souls” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.8" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:8</a>). He commanded Helaman to preserve the records so that through them God might “show forth his power unto future generations” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:14</a>).</p>

By His word, as Alma said, He enlarges our memory, sheds light on falsehood and error, and brings us to repentance and to rejoice in Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-blessing-of-scripture.p8" pid="LjShF52VeECX1SgFCvwfJQ" hash="gBPXHw">The scriptures enlarge our memory by helping us always to remember the Lord and our relationship to Him and the Father. They remind us of what we knew in our premortal life. And they expand our memory in another sense by teaching us about epochs, people, and events that we did not experience personally. None of us was present to see the Red Sea part and cross with Moses between walls of water to the other side. We were not there to hear the Sermon on the Mount, to see Lazarus raised from the dead, to see the suffering Savior in Gethsemane and on the cross, and we did not, with Mary, hear the two angels testify at the empty tomb that Jesus was risen from the dead. You and I did not go forward one by one with the multitude in the land Bountiful at the resurrected Savior’s invitation to feel the prints of the nails and bathe His feet with our tears. We did not kneel beside Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove and gaze there upon the Father and the Son. Yet we know all these things and much, much more because we have the scriptural record to enlarge our memory, to teach us what we did not know. And as these things penetrate our minds and hearts, our faith in God and His Beloved Son takes root.</p>

Those who either don’t have or ignore the recorded word of God eventually cease to believe in Him and forget the purpose of their existence. You will remember how important it was for Lehi’s people to take the brass plates with them when they left Jerusalem. These scriptures were key to their knowledge of God and the coming Redemption of Christ. The other group that “came out from Jerusalem” shortly after Lehi had no scriptures, and when Lehi’s descendants encountered them some 300 or 400 years later, it is recorded that “their language had become corrupted; … and they denied the being of their Creator” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/omni/1.15,17" class="scriptureRef">Omni 1:15, 17</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-blessing-of-scripture.p10" pid="txclXSPBIkSSBfJdZnWrjA" hash="0YxR-g">In Tyndale’s day, scriptural ignorance abounded because people lacked access to the Bible, especially in a language they could understand. Today the Bible and other scripture are readily at hand, yet there is a growing scriptural illiteracy because people will not open the books. Consequently they have forgotten things their grandparents knew.</p>

He is a tender parent who would spare us needless suffering and grief and at the same time help us realize our divine potential. The scriptures, for example, discredit an ancient philosophy that has come back into vogue in our day—the philosophy of Korihor that there are no absolute moral standards, that “every man prosper[s] according to his genius, and that every man conquer[s] according to his strength; and whatsoever a man [does is] no crime” and “that when a man [is] dead, that [is] the end thereof” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.17-18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:17–18</a>). Alma, who had dealt with Korihor, did not leave his own son Corianton in doubt about the reality and substance of a divine moral code. Corianton had been guilty of sexual sin, and his father spoke to him in love but plainly: “Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.5" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:5</a>).</p>

Others would argue that it’s all relative or that God’s love is permissive. If there is a God, they say, He excuses all sins and misdeeds because of His love for us—there is no need for repentance. Or at most, a simple confession will do. They have imagined a Jesus who wants people to work for social justice but who makes no demands upon their personal life and behavior.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> But a God of love does not leave us to learn by sad experience that “wickedness never was happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/13.38" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 13:38</a>). His commandments are the voice of reality and our protection against self-inflicted pain. The scriptures are the touchstone for measuring correctness and truth, and they are clear that real happiness lies not in denying the justice of God or trying to circumvent the consequences of sin but in repentance and forgiveness through the atoning grace of the Son of God (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42</a>).</p>

In scripture, we find vivid portrayals of the blessings that come from honoring true principles, as well as the tragedies that befall when individuals and civilizations discard them. Where scriptural truths are ignored or abandoned, the essential moral core of society disintegrates and decay is close behind. In time, nothing is left to sustain the institutions that sustain society.</p>

Faith will not come from the study of ancient texts as a <span class="pageBreak" page-number="35"></span>purely academic pursuit. It will not come from archaeological digs and discoveries. It will not come from scientific experiments. It will not even come from witnessing miracles. These things may serve to confirm faith, or at times to challenge it, but they do not create faith. Faith comes by the witness of the Holy Spirit to our souls, Spirit to spirit, as we hear or read the word of God. And faith matures as we continue to feast upon the word.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-blessing-of-scripture.p16" pid="7-bVq9v2002T6-UbhbYCnQ" hash="GbncEA">Scriptural accounts of the faith of others serve to strengthen our own. We recall the faith of a centurion that enabled Christ to heal his servant without so much as seeing him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/8.5-13" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 8:5–13</a>) and the healing of a Gentile woman’s daughter because that humble mother would accept, as it were, even the crumbs from the Master’s table (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/15.22-28" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 15:22–28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/7.25-30" class="scriptureRef">Mark 7:25–30</a>). We hear the cry of suffering Job: “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/13.15" class="scriptureRef">Job 13:15</a>)—and professing, “I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: … [and] yet in my flesh shall I see God” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/19.25-26" class="scriptureRef">Job 19:25–26</a>). We hear and take courage from the determination of a tender boy prophet, hated and bitterly persecuted by so many adults: “I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.25" class="scriptureRef">Joseph Smith—History 1:25</a>).</p>

Therefore, being in the scriptures is one way we receive the Holy Ghost. Of course, scripture is given through the Holy Ghost in the first place (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Peter 1:21</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.26-27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:26–27</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.4" class="scriptureRef">68:4</a>), and that same Spirit can attest its truth to you and me. Study the scriptures carefully, deliberately. Ponder and pray over them. Scriptures are revelation, and they will bring added revelation.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-blessing-of-scripture.p18" pid="gtpvDlR-lEu5_D9ydSc7gQ" hash="oBWSYQ">Consider the magnitude of our blessing to have the Holy Bible and some 900 additional pages of scripture, including the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Then consider that, in addition, the words of prophets spoken as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost in settings such as this, which the Lord calls scripture (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.2-4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:2–4</a>), flow to us almost constantly by television, radio, Internet, satellite, CD, DVD, and in print. I suppose that never in history has a people been blessed with such a quantity of holy writ. And not only that, but every man, woman, and child may possess and study his or her own personal copy of these sacred texts, most in his or her own language. How incredible such a thing would have seemed to the people of William Tyndale’s day and to the Saints of earlier dispensations! Surely with this blessing the Lord is telling us that our need for constant recourse to the scriptures is greater than in any previous time. May we feast continuously on the words of Christ that will tell us all things we should do (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 32:3</a>). I have studied the scriptures, I have pondered the scriptures, and on this Eastertide, I bear you my testimony of the Father and the Son, as They are revealed in the holy scriptures, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The word <span class="emphasis">stewardship</span> calls to mind the Lord’s law of consecration (see, for example, <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.32,53" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:32, 53</a>), which has an economic role but, more than that, is an application of celestial law to life here and now (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 105:5</a>). To consecrate is to set apart or dedicate something as sacred, devoted to holy purposes. True success in this life comes in consecrating our lives—that is, our time and choices—to God’s purposes (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.1,4" class="scriptureRef">John 17:1, 4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:19</a>). In so doing, we permit Him to raise us to our highest destiny.</p>

While Jesus is the only one to have led a sinless life, those who come unto Him and take His yoke upon them have claim on His grace, which will make them as He is, guiltless and spotless. With deep love the Lord encourages us in these words: “Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.20" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 27:20</a>).</p>

Stubbornness, rebellion, and rationalization must be abandoned, and in their place submission, a desire for correction, and acceptance of all that the Lord may require. This is what King Benjamin called putting off the natural man, yielding to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and becoming “a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>). Such a one is promised the enduring presence of the Holy Spirit, a promise remembered and renewed each time a repentant soul partakes of the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77,79" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77, 79</a>).</p>

Roberts once expressed the process in these words: “The man who so walks in the light and wisdom and power of God, will at the last, by the very force of association, make the light and wisdom and power of God his own—weaving those bright rays into a chain divine, linking himself forever to God and God to him. This [is] the sum of Messiah’s mystic words, ‘Thou, Father, in me, and I in thee’—beyond this human greatness cannot achieve.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Beginning early in His life, Jesus was about His Father’s business (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.48-49" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:48–49</a>). God Himself is glorified by His work of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>). We naturally desire to participate with Him in His work, and in so doing, we ought to recognize that all honest work is the work of God. In the words of Thomas Carlyle: “All true Work is sacred; in all true Work, were it but true hand-labour, there is something of divineness. Labour, wide as the Earth, has its summit in Heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

I recall the Prophet Joseph Smith’s simple statement: “By continuous labor [we] were enabled to get a comfortable maintenance” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.55" class="scriptureRef">Joseph Smith—History 1:55</a>). By work we sustain and enrich life. It enables us to survive the disappointments and tragedies of the mortal experience. Hard-earned achievement brings a sense of self-worth. Work builds and refines character, creates beauty, and is the instrument of our service to one another and to God. A consecrated life is filled with work, sometimes repetitive, sometimes menial, sometimes unappreciated but always work that improves, orders, sustains, lifts, ministers, aspires.</p>

Just as honest toil gives rest its sweetness, wholesome recreation is the friend and steadying companion of work. Music, literature, art, dance, drama, athletics—all can provide entertainment to enrich one’s life and further consecrate it. At the same time, it hardly needs to be said that much of what passes for entertainment today is coarse, degrading, violent, mind-numbing, and time wasting. Ironically, it sometimes takes hard work to find wholesome leisure. When entertainment turns from virtue to vice, it becomes a destroyer of the consecrated life. “Wherefore, take heed … that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.14" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 7:14</a>).</p>

A central purpose of the mortal experience is that each spirit should receive such a body and learn to exercise moral agency in a tabernacle of flesh. A physical body is also essential for exaltation, which comes only in the perfect combination of the physical and the spiritual, as we see in our beloved, resurrected Lord. In this fallen world, some lives will be painfully brief; some bodies will be malformed, broken, or barely adequate to maintain life; yet life will be long enough for each spirit, and each body will qualify for resurrection.</p>

We who have a witness of the broader reality of premortal, mortal, and postmortal eternity, however, must acknowledge that we have a duty to God with respect to this crowning achievement of His physical creation.

No one in our time more perfectly incorporates this trait into daily life than President Thomas S. Monson.

Often it is in simple acts that confirm divine love and awareness, but always, always Thomas Monson responds.</p>

Grandpa was a strong man and was good at shearing sheep in the days before electric clippers. He got good enough, he said, that “in one day I sheared 287 sheep and could have sheared over 300, but we ran out of sheep.” During 1919 he sheared over 12,000 sheep, earning some $2,000. The money would have substantially expanded his farm and upgraded his home, but a call to serve in the Southern States Mission came from the Brethren, and with Louise’s full support, he accepted. He left his wife (then pregnant with their first son, my father) and their three daughters with the sheep-shearing money. Upon his joyous return two years later, he observed, “Our savings had lasted us throughout the two years, and we had $29 left.”</p>

The principals, two men who were friends and members of the same Christian congregation, had formed the company years earlier. They had a generally congenial relationship as business partners, but as they grew older and the next generation began to take part in the business, conflicts emerged. Finally, all parties decided it would be best to divide up the assets and go their separate ways. One of the two original partners devised a stratagem with his lawyers to secure for himself a significant financial advantage in the dissolution at the expense of the other partner and his sons. In a meeting of the parties, one of the sons complained about this unfair treatment and appealed to the honor and Christian beliefs of the first partner. “You know this is not right,” he said. “How could you take advantage of someone this way, especially a brother in the same church?” The first partner’s lawyer retorted, “Oh, grow up! How can you be so naive?”</p>

What <span class="emphasis">is</span> naive is to suppose that we are not accountable to God. The Savior declared: “My Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; … that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.14" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 27:14</a>). One who lives a consecrated life does not seek to take advantage of another but, if anything, will turn the other cheek and, if required to deliver a coat, will give the cloak also (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.39-40" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 5:39–40</a>). The Savior’s sternest rebukes were to hypocrites. Hypocrisy is terribly destructive, not only to the hypocrite but also to those who observe or know of his or her conduct, especially children. It is faith destroying, whereas honor is the rich soil in which the seed of faith thrives.</p>

Its strength and serenity are “as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 97:9</a>). Of particular significance is the influence of a consecrated man or woman upon others, especially those closest and dearest. The consecration of many who have gone before us and others who live among us has helped lay the foundation for our happiness. In like manner future generations will take courage from your consecrated life, acknowledging their debt to you for the possession of all that truly matters. May we consecrate ourselves as sons and daughters of God, “that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 7:48</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/3.2" class="scriptureRef">1 John 3:2</a>), I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

His expectations for us are expressed by His Son, Jesus Christ, in these words: “I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 12:48</a>). He proposes to make us holy so that we may “abide a celestial glory” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:22</a>) and “dwell in his presence” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.57" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:57</a>).

Some years ago Elder Dallin H. Oaks explained: “The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts—what we have <span class="emphasis">done.</span> It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts—what we have <span class="emphasis">become.</span> It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

It is this: willingly to accept and even seek correction. Correction is vital if we would conform our lives “unto a perfect man, [that is,] unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Ephesians 4:13</a>). Paul said of divine correction or chastening, “For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.6" class="scriptureRef">Hebrews 12:6</a>). Though it is often difficult to endure, truly we ought to rejoice that God considers us worth the time and trouble to correct.</p>

The Lord declared, “As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Revelation 3:19</a>). Again He said, “And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 105:6</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:27</a>). In a latter-day revelation, the Lord commanded four senior Church leaders to repent (as He might command many of us) for not adequately teaching their children “according to the commandments” and for not being “more diligent and concerned at home” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.41-50" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:41–50</a>). The brother of Jared in the Book of Mormon repented when the Lord stood in a cloud and talked with him “for the space of three hours … and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.14" class="scriptureRef">Ether 2:14</a>). Because he so willingly responded to this severe rebuke, the brother of Jared was later given the privilege of seeing and being instructed by the premortal Redeemer (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.6-20" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:6–20</a>). The fruit of God’s chastisement is repentance leading to righteousness (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.11" class="scriptureRef">Hebrews 12:11</a>).</p>

Said the Lord, “My people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/136.31" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 136:31</a>). In another place He said, “For all those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:5</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.10" class="scriptureRef">Hebrews 12:10</a>). As Elder Paul V. Johnson said this morning, we should take care not to resent the very things that help us put on the divine nature.</p>

President Hugh B. Brown, formerly a member of the Twelve and a counselor in the First Presidency, provided a personal experience. He told of purchasing a rundown farm in Canada many years ago. As he went about cleaning up and repairing his property, he came across a currant bush that had grown over six feet (1.8 m) high and was yielding no berries, so he pruned it back drastically, leaving only small stumps. Then he saw a drop like a tear on the top of each of these little stumps, as if the currant bush were crying, and thought he heard it say:</p>

I didn’t intend you to be a fruit tree or a shade tree. I want you to be a currant bush, and someday, little currant bush, when you are laden with fruit, you are going to say, ‘Thank you, Mr. Gardener, for loving me enough to cut me down.’”</p>

When a superior officer became a battle casualty, President Brown was in line to be promoted to general, and he was summoned to London. But even though he was fully qualified for the promotion, it was denied him because he was a Mormon. The commanding general said in essence, “You deserve the appointment, but I cannot give it to you.” What President Brown had spent 10 years hoping, praying, and preparing for slipped through his fingers in that moment because of blatant discrimination. Continuing his story, President Brown remembered:</p>

If we are open to it, needed correction will come in many forms and from many sources. It may come in the course of our prayers as God speaks to our mind and heart through the Holy Ghost (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 8:2</a>). It may come in the form of prayers that are answered no or differently than we had expected. Chastening may come as we study the scriptures and are reminded of deficiencies, disobedience, or simply matters neglected.</p>

Apostles, prophets, patriarchs, bishops, and others have been put into the Church today, just as anciently, “for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.12" class="scriptureRef">Ephesians 4:12</a>). Perhaps some of the things said in this conference have come to you as a call to repentance or change, which if heeded will lift you to a higher place. We can help one another as fellow Church members; it is one of the primary reasons that the Savior established a church. Even when we encounter mean-spirited criticism from persons who have little regard or love for us, it can be helpful to exercise enough meekness to weigh it and sift out anything that might benefit us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/as-many-as-i-love-i-rebuke-and-chasten.p22" pid="sWyRS_ZuO0-LPQ4fVhV7mQ" hash="daSxGQ">Correction, hopefully gentle, can come from one’s spouse. Elder Richard G. Scott, who just addressed us, remembers a time early in his marriage when his wife, Jeanene, counseled him to look directly at people when he spoke to them. “You look at the floor, the ceiling, the window, anywhere but in their eyes,” she said. He took that gentle rebuke to heart, and it made him much more effective in counseling and working with people. As one who served as a full-time missionary under then-President Scott’s direction, I can attest that he does look one squarely in the eye in his conversations. I can also add that when one needs correction, that look can be very penetrating.</p>

President Boyd K. Packer has observed that when a person in a position to correct another fails to do so, he is thinking of himself. Remember that reproof should be timely, with sharpness or clarity, “when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.43" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:43</a>).</p>

If we repeatedly fail to act on the chastening of a loving God, then He too will desist. He has said, “My Spirit will not always strive with man” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.15" class="scriptureRef">Ether 2:15</a>). Eventually, much of our chastening should come from within—we should become self-correcting. One of the ways that our late beloved colleague Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin became the pure and humble disciple that he was, was by analyzing his performance in every assignment and task. In his desire to please God, he resolved to determine what he could have done better, and then he diligently applied each lesson learned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/as-many-as-i-love-i-rebuke-and-chasten.p25" pid="hFqrruIg1USuJYf1hH6ljg" hash="7E7n-A">All of us can meet God’s high expectations, however great or small our capacity and talent may be. Moroni affirms, “If ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is [God’s] grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 10:32</a>). It is a diligent, devoted effort on our part that calls forth this empowering and enabling grace, an effort that certainly includes submission to God’s chastening hand and sincere, unqualified repentance. Let us pray for His love-inspired correction.</p>

I know that you and I can become one with God and Christ. Of our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son and the joyous potential we have because of Them, I humbly and confidently bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="38"></span>The Book of Mormon contains the account of a man named Nehor. It is easy to understand why Mormon, in abridging a thousand years of Nephite records, thought it important to include something about this man and the enduring influence of his doctrine. Mormon was seeking to warn us, knowing that this philosophy would surface again in our day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-divine-gift-of-repentance.p2" guid="e732d7ce-1535-41f5-b4f2-b93235b25f90" pid="F26ARLzL6Ui-QsgVkQxzCg" hash="I8EZaw">Nehor appeared on the scene about 90 years before the birth of Christ. He taught “that all mankind should be saved at the last day, … for the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.4" class="scriptureRef">Alma 1:4</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-divine-gift-of-repentance.p3" guid="212dd610-7ed3-4c31-8cca-9e95e370596e" pid="jSIX5C9jyEapHYLovHwpTQ" hash="3NS26Q">About 15 years later, Korihor came among the Nephites preaching and amplifying the doctrine of Nehor. The Book of Mormon records that “he was Anti-Christ, for he began to preach unto the people against the prophecies … concerning the coming of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:6</a>). Korihor’s preaching was to the effect “that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.17" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:17</a>). These false prophets and their followers “did not believe in the repentance of their sins” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/15.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 15:15</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-divine-gift-of-repentance.p4" guid="0c8e3c18-2cb5-4f5f-b894-eecabc8fe44c" pid="XSm4eBi0E0mKkqW40UNb1Q" hash="stGTsQ">As in the days of Nehor and Korihor, we live in a time not long before the advent of Jesus Christ—in our case, the time of preparation for His Second Coming. And similarly, the message of repentance is often not welcomed. Some profess that if there is a God, He makes no real demands upon us (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/18.5" class="scriptureRef">Alma 18:5</a>). Others maintain that a loving God forgives all sin based on simple confession, or if there actually is a punishment for sin, “God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.8" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 28:8</a>). Others, with Korihor, deny the very existence of Christ and any such thing as sin. Their doctrine is that values, standards, and even truth are all relative. Thus, whatever one feels is right for him or her cannot be judged by others to be wrong or sinful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-divine-gift-of-repentance.p5" guid="0509b7d8-4cad-4d66-a458-828409ea3859" pid="c4baqXJhtUi7vLf-1lhgFA" hash="PRkYmg">On the surface such philosophies seem appealing because they give us license to indulge any appetite or desire without concern for consequences. By using the teachings of Nehor and Korihor, we can rationalize and justify anything. When prophets come crying repentance, it “throws cold water on the party.” But in reality the prophetic call should be received with joy. Without repentance, there is no real progress or improvement in life. Pretending there is no sin does not lessen its burden and pain. Suffering for sin does not by itself change anything for the better. Only repentance leads to the sunlit uplands of a better life. And, of course, only through repentance do we gain access to the atoning grace of Jesus Christ and salvation. Repentance is a divine gift, and there should be a smile on our faces when we speak of it. It points us to freedom, confidence, and peace. Rather than interrupting the celebration, the gift of repentance is the cause for true celebration.</p>

It is His infinite sacrifice that “bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:15</a>). Repentance is the necessary condition, and the grace of Christ is the power by which “mercy can satisfy the demands of justice” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:16</a>). Our witness is this:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-divine-gift-of-repentance.p10" guid="3b4ddcff-52ef-45e0-ac44-853b47f14e7b" pid="-__Vm4Y5e02AE9LRg6fHYQ" hash="m1kOIw">First, the invitation to repent is an expression of love. When the Savior “began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.17" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 4:17</a>), it was a message of love, inviting all who would to qualify to join Him “and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life [itself] in the world to come” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.59" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:59</a>). If we do not invite others to change or if we do not demand repentance of ourselves, we fail in a fundamental duty we owe to one another and to ourselves. A permissive parent, an indulgent friend, a fearful Church leader are in reality more concerned about themselves than the welfare and happiness of those they could help. Yes, the call to repentance is at times regarded as intolerant or offensive and may even be resented, but guided by the Spirit, it is in reality an act of genuine caring (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.43-44" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:43–44</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-divine-gift-of-repentance.p11" guid="b99afaf8-a6da-48fd-b035-dce17ffa8f91" pid="DTz0nli_L0uXqSS8iYoCCw" hash="Hpy1ng">Second, repentance means striving to change. It would mock the Savior’s suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross for us to expect that He should transform us into angelic beings with no real effort on our part. Rather, we seek His grace to complement and reward our most diligent efforts (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 25:23</a>). Perhaps as much as praying for mercy, we should pray for time and opportunity to work and strive and overcome. Surely the Lord smiles upon one who desires to come to judgment worthily, who resolutely labors day by day to replace weakness with strength. Real repentance, real change may require repeated attempts, but there is something refining and holy in such striving. Divine forgiveness and healing flow quite naturally to such a soul, for indeed “virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light; [and] mercy hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.40" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:40</a>).</p>

The Bible Dictionary states, “Repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart and will to God, [as well as] a renunciation of sin to which we are naturally inclined.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> One of several examples of this teaching from the Book of Mormon is found in the words of Alma to one of his sons:</p>

We often speak of this covenant as the baptismal covenant since it is witnessed by being baptized in water (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.10" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:10</a>). The Savior’s own baptism, providing the example, confirmed His covenant of obedience to the Father. “But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 31:7</a>). Without this covenant, repentance remains incomplete and the remission of sins unattained.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> In the memorable expression of Professor <span class="pageBreak" page-number="40"></span>Noel Reynolds, “The choice to repent is a choice to burn bridges in every direction [having determined] to follow forever only <span class="emphasis">one</span> way, the <span class="emphasis">one</span> path that leads to eternal life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Attempts to create a list of specific steps of repentance may be helpful to some, but it may also lead to a mechanical, check-off-the-boxes approach with no real feeling or change. True repentance is not superficial. The Lord gives two overarching requirements: “By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.43" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:43</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/the-divine-gift-of-repentance.p18" guid="5b57b166-5e17-4840-be80-090d2bc781bd" pid="vzrTi75KR0Gat_UxRKarqQ" hash="SBKd9w">Confessing and forsaking are powerful concepts. They are much more than a casual “I admit it; I’m sorry.” Confession is a deep, sometimes agonizing acknowledgment of error and offense to God and man. Sorrow and regret and bitter tears often accompany one’s confession, especially when his or her actions have been the cause of pain to someone or, worse, have led another into sin. It is this deep distress, this view of things as they really are, that leads one, as Alma, to cry out, “O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:18</a>).</p>

One’s very heart and desires change, and the once-appealing sin becomes increasingly abhorrent. A resolve to abandon and forsake the sin and to repair, as fully as one possibly can, the damage he or she has caused now forms in that new heart. This resolve soon matures into a covenant of obedience to God. With that covenant in place, the Holy Ghost, the messenger of divine grace, will bring relief and forgiveness. One is moved to declare again with Alma, “And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I [do] behold; yea, my soul [is] filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.20" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:20</a>).</p>

The Savior spoke little about what He endured to satisfy the demands of justice and atone for our sins, but He did make this revealing statement:</p>

In a general conference address entitled “The Brilliant Morning of Forgiveness,” President Boyd K. Packer provided this analogy:</p>

This is something we welcome because, after all, our fundamental commission is to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ, His doctrine, in all the world (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.19-20" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 28:19–20</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 112:28</a>). But we must admit there has been and still persists some confusion about our doctrine and how it is established. That is the subject I wish to address today.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-doctrine-of-christ.p7" pid="gKg1SZDs5U2UmJwrXjaimA" hash="DA6pGQ">The Savior taught His doctrine in the meridian of time, and His Apostles struggled mightily to preserve it against a barrage of false tradition and philosophy.

This glorious day began when, in “a pillar of light … above the brightness of the sun” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.16" class="scriptureRef">Joseph Smith—History 1:16</a>), God the Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, visited young Joseph Smith and initiated what would become a virtual flood of revelation linked with divine power and authority.</p>

This is to say that while there is much we do not yet know, the truths and doctrine we have received have come and will continue to come by divine revelation. In some faith traditions, theologians claim equal teaching authority with the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and doctrinal matters may become a contest of opinions between them. Some rely on the ecumenical councils of the Middle Ages and their creeds. Others place primary emphasis on the reasoning of post-apostolic theologians or on biblical hermeneutics and exegesis. We value scholarship that enhances understanding, but in the Church today, just as anciently, establishing the doctrine of Christ or correcting doctrinal deviations is a matter of divine revelation to those the Lord endows with apostolic authority.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Speaking of members <span class="pageBreak" page-number="87"></span>of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he stated: “[We] should [bear] in mind that some of the General Authorities have had assigned to them a special calling; they possess a special gift; they are sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators, which gives them a special spiritual endowment in connection with their teaching of the people. They have the right, the power, and authority to declare the mind and will of God to his people, subject to the over-all power and authority of the President of the Church. Others of the General Authorities are not given this special spiritual endowment and authority covering their teaching; they have a resulting limitation, and the resulting limitation upon their power and authority in teaching applies to every other officer and member of the Church, for none of them is spiritually endowed as a prophet, seer, and revelator. Furthermore, as just indicated, the President of the Church has a further and special spiritual endowment in this respect, for he is the Prophet, Seer, and Revelator for the whole Church.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

He may act by messenger or in His own person. He may speak by His own voice or by the voice of the Holy Spirit—a communication of Spirit to spirit that may be expressed in words or in feelings that convey understanding beyond words (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.45" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 17:45</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 9:8</a>).

The first was a revelation directed to the head of the Church. Early in the book of Acts, we find the Apostles of Christ declaring the gospel message only to Jews, following the pattern of Jesus’s ministry (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/15.24" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 15:24</a>), but now, in the Lord’s timetable, the time had come for a change. In Joppa, Peter had a dream in which he saw a variety of animals lowered to earth from heaven in “a great sheet knit at the four corners” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.11" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:11</a>) and was commanded to “kill, and eat” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.13" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:13</a>). Peter was reluctant since at least some of the animals were “unclean” under the law of Moses, and Peter had never violated the commandment against eating such. Nevertheless, the voice said to Peter in his dream, “What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.15" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:15</a>).</p>

Cornelius had gathered a sizable group of relatives and friends, and finding them expectantly waiting <span class="pageBreak" page-number="88"></span>to receive his message, Peter said:</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-doctrine-of-christ.p21" pid="kmoyBjS62U2TrxgaImGMPQ" hash="iN7DnQ">“God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. …</p>

A controversy arose about whether circumcision required under the law of Moses should carry over as a commandment in the gospel and Church of Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/15.1,5" class="scriptureRef">Acts 15:1, 5</a>). “And the apostles and elders came together for to consider … this matter” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/15.6" class="scriptureRef">Acts 15:6</a>). Our record of this council is certainly incomplete, but we are told that after “much disputing” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/15.7" class="scriptureRef">Acts 15:7</a>), Peter, the senior Apostle, rose up and declared what the Holy Spirit had confirmed to him. He reminded the council that when the gospel began to be preached to the uncircumcised Gentiles in the house of Cornelius, they received the Holy Ghost just as had the circumcised Jewish converts. God, he said, “put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</p>

In the letter announcing their decision, the Apostles said, “It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/15.28" class="scriptureRef">Acts 15:28</a>), or in other words, this decision came by divine revelation through the Holy Spirit.</p>

The President of the Church may announce or interpret doctrines based on revelation to him (see, for example, <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 138</a>). Doctrinal exposition may also come through the combined council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (see, for example, <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2" class="scriptureRef">Official Declaration 2</a>). Council deliberations will often include a weighing of canonized scriptures, the teachings of Church leaders, and past practice. But in the end, just as in the New Testament Church, the objective is not simply consensus among council members but revelation from God. It is a process involving both reason and faith for obtaining the mind and will of the Lord.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

It is commonly understood in the Church that a statement made by one leader on a single occasion often represents a personal, though well-considered, opinion, not meant to be official or binding for the whole Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “a prophet [is] a prophet only when he [is] acting as such.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> President Clark, quoted earlier, observed:</p>

His story was that during the excitement incident to the coming of [Johnston’s] Army, Brother Brigham preached to the people in a morning meeting a sermon vibrant with defiance to the approaching army, and declaring an intention to oppose and drive them back. In the afternoon meeting he arose and said that Brigham Young had been <span class="pageBreak" page-number="89"></span>talking in the morning, but the Lord was going to talk now. He then delivered an address, the tempo of which was the opposite from the morning talk. …</p>

    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-doctrine-of-christ.p37" pid="rJIzPbgLEEGuaftZJ26sJA" hash="hNRbYg">The Prophet Joseph Smith confirmed the Savior’s central role in our doctrine in one definitive sentence: “The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Joseph Smith’s testimony of Jesus is that He lives, “for [he] saw him, even on the right hand of God; and [he] heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:23</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.22" class="scriptureRef">verse 22</a>). I appeal to all who hear or read this message to seek through prayer and study of the scriptures that same witness of the divine character, the Atonement, and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.

He is the Christ, who suffered in Gethsemane, died on the cross, was buried, and who indeed rose again the third day. He is the resurrected Lord, through whom we shall all be resurrected and by whom all who will may be redeemed and exalted in His heavenly kingdom. This is our doctrine, confirming all prior testaments of Jesus Christ and stated anew for our own time. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="47"></span>Brethren, much has been said and written in recent years about the challenges of men and boys. A sampling of book titles, for example, includes <span class="emphasis">Why There Are No Good Men Left, The Demise of Guys, The End of Men, Why Boys Fail,</span> and <span class="emphasis">Manning Up.</span> Interestingly, most of these seem to have been written by women. In any case, a common thread running through these analyses is that in many societies today men and boys get conflicting and demeaning signals about their roles and value in society.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/brethren-we-have-work-to-do.p6" pid="etV-JL4OxkWPbb1z-2WChw" hash="rJSqZQ">The author of <span class="emphasis">Manning Up</span> characterized it this way: “It’s been an almost universal rule of civilization that whereas girls became women simply by reaching physical maturity, boys had to pass a test. They needed to demonstrate courage, physical prowess, or mastery of the necessary skills. The goal was to prove their competence as protectors of women and children; this was always their primary social role. Today, however, with women moving ahead in an advanced economy, provider husbands and fathers are now optional, and the character qualities men had needed to play their role—fortitude, stoicism, courage, fidelity—are obsolete and even a little embarrassing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/brethren-we-have-work-to-do.p7" pid="Ii72xhtb8UCdYzmD_xpn9Q" hash="yiSIcA">In their zeal to promote opportunity for women, something we applaud, there are those who denigrate men and their contributions. They seem to think of life as a competition between male and female—that one must dominate the other, and now it’s the women’s turn. Some argue that a career is everything and marriage and children should be entirely optional—therefore, why do we need men?<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> In too many Hollywood films, TV and cable shows, and even commercials, men are portrayed as incompetent, immature, or self-absorbed. This cultural emasculation of males is having a damaging effect.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/brethren-we-have-work-to-do.p8" pid="G5YDPOlfb0uLsNeWW77yVA" hash="z-zwEQ">In the United States, for example, it is reported: “Girls outperform boys now at every level, from elementary school through graduate school. By eighth grade, for instance, only 20 percent of boys are proficient in writing and 24 percent proficient in reading. Young men’s SAT scores, meanwhile, in 2011 were the worst they’ve been in 40 years. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of both high school and college. … It is predicted that women will earn 60 percent of bachelor’s, 63 percent of master’s and 54 percent of doctorate degrees by 2016. Two-thirds of students in special education remedial programs are guys.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

In an observation that is too often accurate, one university professor remarked, “The men come into class with their backward baseball caps and [their lame] the ‘word processor ate my homework’ excuses. Meanwhile, the women are checking their day planners and asking for recommendations for law school.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> One female movie reviewer expressed the rather cynical view that “what we can count on men for, if we’re lucky and we choose to have a partner, is to be just that—a partner. Someone who stands in his own space even as he respects our standing in our own.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

As men of the priesthood, we have an essential role to play in society, at home, and in the Church. But we must be men that women can trust, that children can trust, and that God can trust. In the Church and kingdom of God in these latter days, we cannot afford to have boys and men who are drifting. We cannot afford young men who lack self-discipline and live only to be entertained. We cannot afford young adult men who are going nowhere in life, who are not serious about forming families and making a real contribution in this world. We cannot afford husbands and <span class="pageBreak" page-number="48"></span>fathers who fail to provide spiritual leadership in the home. We cannot afford to have those who exercise the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God, waste their strength in pornography or spend their lives in cyberspace (ironically being <span class="emphasis">of</span> the world while not being <span class="emphasis">in</span> the world).</p>

Some of you will want to pursue university studies and careers in business, agriculture, government, or other professions. Some will excel in the arts, music, or teaching. Others will choose a military career or learn a trade. Over the years, I have had a number of craftsmen work on projects and repairs at my home, and I have admired the hard work and skill of these men. In whatever you choose, it is essential that you become proficient so that you can support a family and make a contribution for good in your community and your country.</p>

He gets up early and works two jobs, before and after school, six and a half days a week. His income provides a substantial part of his family’s livelihood. He hurries home on his worn bicycle from his second job after dark and somehow squeezes in a few hours of homework before dropping onto his bed on the floor between sleeping siblings around eleven o’clock at night. Although I’ve never met him, I feel proud of him for his diligence and courage. He is doing the very best he can with his limited resources and opportunities, and he is a blessing to his family.</p>

Take heart and prepare the best you can, whatever your circumstances. Prepare to be a good husband and father; prepare to be a good and productive citizen; prepare to serve the Lord, whose priesthood you hold. Wherever you are, your Heavenly Father is mindful of you.

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="49"></span>Consider missionary work. Young men, you have no time to waste. You can’t wait to get serious about preparing until you are 17 or 18. Aaronic Priesthood quorums can help their members understand the oath and covenant of the priesthood and get ready for ordination as elders, they can help them understand and prepare for the ordinances of the temple, and they can help them get ready for successful missions. Melchizedek Priesthood quorums and the Relief Society can help parents prepare missionaries who know the Book of Mormon and who will go into the field fully committed. And in each ward and branch, these same quorums can lead out in an effective collaboration with the full-time missionaries who are serving there.</p>

Monson, to rescue those who have drifted from the gospel or who have become disaffected for any reason. We have had wonderful success in this effort, including excellent work by young men. An Aaronic Priesthood quorum in the Rio Grande (Spanish) Ward in Albuquerque, New Mexico, counseled together about whom they could bring back and then as a group went to visit each of them. One said, “When they came to my door, I felt important,” and another confided, “I feel happy inside that someone actually wants me to go to church; it makes me want to go to church now.” When the quorum members invited one young man to come back, they asked him to come with them on the next visit, and he did. They were not just inviting him to attend church; they were immediately making him a part of the quorum.</p>

President Gordon B. Hinckley once said: “It will be a marvelous day, my brethren—it will be a day of fulfillment of the purposes of the Lord—when our priesthood quorums become an anchor of strength to every man belonging thereto, when each such man may appropriately be able to say, ‘I am a member of a priesthood quorum of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I stand ready to assist my brethren in all of their needs, as I am confident they stand ready to assist me in mine. … Working together, we can stand, without embarrassment and without fear, against every wind of adversity that might blow, be it economic, social, or spiritual.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

An early Church welfare pamphlet stated: “A man out of work is of special moment to the Church because, deprived of his inheritance, he is on trial as Job was on trial—for his integrity. As days lengthen into weeks and months and even years of adversity, the hurt grows deeper. … The Church cannot hope to save a man on Sunday if during the week it is a complacent witness to the crucifixion of his soul.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

One of the quorum members offered that he had an old barn that perhaps could be used as a repair shop. Other quorum members could help gather needed tools and supplies to equip the new shop.

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, potential immigrant laborers were recruited in Great Britain, Germany, and other European countries, but many who were willing to go could not afford the cost of travel. It was not uncommon for these to travel under an indenture or contract, promising to work after their arrival for a certain period of time without wages as payment for their passage. Others came with the promise that family members already in America would pay their fare upon arrival, but if that didn’t happen, the newcomers were obliged to pay their own costs through indentured service. The term used to describe these indentured immigrants was “redemptioners.” They had to redeem the cost of their passage—in a sense, purchase their freedom—by their labor.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p6" pid="wqsQpspDkkm6GNVlZxxZWw" hash="eN3d8w">Among the most significant of Jesus Christ’s descriptive titles is Redeemer. As indicated in my brief account of immigrant “redemptioners,” the word <span class="emphasis">redeem</span> means to pay off an obligation or a debt. <span class="emphasis">Redeem</span> can also mean to rescue or set free as by paying a ransom. If someone commits a mistake and then corrects it or makes amends, we say he has redeemed himself. Each of these meanings suggests different facets of the great Redemption accomplished by Jesus Christ through His Atonement, which includes, in the words of the dictionary, “to deliver from sin and its penalties, as by a sacrifice made for the sinner.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p7" pid="4Bt4YsgU5kmVv46jsx_lyQ" hash="MWJBbw">The Savior’s Redemption has two parts. First, it atones for Adam’s transgression and the consequent Fall of man by overcoming what could be called the direct effects of the Fall—physical death and spiritual death. Physical death is well understood; spiritual death is the separation of man from God. In the words of Paul, “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>). This redemption from physical and spiritual death is both universal and without condition.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p8" pid="_2Ik3W6oiE-gvzNzPNWJ-A" hash="l8KJ4w">The second aspect of the Savior’s Atonement is redemption from what might be termed the indirect consequences of the Fall—our own sins as opposed to Adam’s transgression. By virtue of the Fall, we are born into a mortal world where sin—that is, disobedience to divinely instituted law—is pervasive. Speaking of all of us, the Lord says:</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p9" pid="t5z-9QGDcUK2v3J3Pq1drg" hash="FJsVRw">“Even so when they begin to grow up, sin conceiveth in their hearts, and they taste the bitter, that they may know to prize the good.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p10" pid="SfZd2OtpBkaOGaMgCLZpfA" hash="_5WF0w">“And it is given unto them to know good from evil; wherefore they are agents unto themselves” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.55-56" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:55–56</a>).</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p11" pid="6upVHLwEQU6i3_WwlKA4mA" hash="6Lpteg">Because we are accountable and we make the choices, the redemption <span class="pageBreak" page-number="110"></span>from our own sins is conditional—conditioned on confessing and abandoning sin and turning to a godly life, or in other words, conditioned on repentance (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.43" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:43</a>). “Wherefore,” commands the Lord, “teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.57" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:57</a>).</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p12" pid="mydXR_kkb0aQO6k6cAdGhQ" hash="2W285A">The Savior’s suffering in Gethsemane and His agony on the cross redeem us from sin by satisfying the demands that justice has upon us. He extends mercy and pardons those who repent. The Atonement also satisfies the debt justice owes to us by healing and compensating us for any suffering we innocently endure. “For behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 9:21</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–12</a>).<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p13" pid="T1f00u76qkS3ftHcDFKhZQ" hash="Ew5-aQ">Inasmuch as we follow Christ, we seek to participate in and further His redemptive work. The greatest service we can provide to others in this life, beginning with those of our own family, is to bring them to Christ through faith and repentance so they may experience His Redemption—peace and joy now and immortality and eternal life in the world to come. The work of our missionaries is a magnificent expression of the Lord’s redeeming love. As His authorized messengers, they offer the incomparable blessings of faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, opening the way to spiritual rebirth and redemption.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p14" pid="fYPcB8oUc06DzLohxo-7Ng" hash="DC29vw">We can also assist in the Lord’s redemption of those beyond the grave. “The faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart from mortal life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel of repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God, among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.57" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 138:57</a>). With the benefit of vicarious rites we offer them in the temples of God, even those who died in bondage to sin can be freed.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p15" pid="5ap4uXJnyUCvJ_VKx0qW7A" hash="O6MJVg">While the most important aspects of redemption have to do with repentance and forgiveness, there is a very significant temporal aspect as well. Jesus is said to have gone about doing good (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.38" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:38</a>), which included healing the sick and infirm, supplying food to hungry multitudes, and teaching a more excellent way. “The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/20.28" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 20:28</a>). So may we, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, go about doing good in the redemptive pattern of the Master.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p16" pid="KzgrzqERrEiwlLgFoYrEcg" hash="zVCdBQ">This kind of redemptive work means helping people with their problems. It means befriending the poor and the weak, alleviating suffering, righting wrongs, defending truth, strengthening the rising generation, and achieving security and happiness at home. Much of our redemptive work on earth is to help others grow and achieve their just hopes and aspirations.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p17" pid="Ed4jrx7dyka71d7q_9zRAA" hash="ccnfrQ">An example from Victor Hugo’s novel <span class="emphasis">Les Misérables,</span> though fictional, has always touched and inspired me. Near the beginning of the story, Bishop Bienvenu gives food and overnight shelter to the homeless Jean Valjean, who has just been released from 19 years in prison for having stolen a loaf of bread to feed his sister’s starving children. Hardened and embittered, Valjean rewards Bishop Bienvenu’s kindness by stealing his silver goods. Later detained by suspicious gendarmes, Valjean falsely claims the silver was a gift to him. When the gendarmes drag him back to the bishop’s house, to Valjean’s great surprise, Bishop Bienvenu confirms his story and for good effect says, “‘But! I gave you the candlesticks also, which are silver like the rest, and would bring two hundred francs. Why did you not take them along with your plates?’ …</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p18" pid="sspsst1v5UaIjDYVNmUyRQ" hash="ekOhGg">“The bishop approached him, and said, in a low voice:</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p19" pid="0_bv5vh4102OW1ViE_fbAA" hash="VTLZIw">“‘Forget not, never forget that you have promised me to use this silver to become an honest man.’</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p20" pid="wZYUybkbeU-s0U3Tive-mg" hash="064pzg">“Jean Valjean, who had no recollection of this promise, stood confounded. The bishop … continued, solemnly:</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p21" pid="uLVMJl4Ok0KF9yTwoxmx7A" hash="Vgi4Gg">“‘Jean Valjean, my brother: you <span class="pageBreak" page-number="111"></span>belong no longer to evil, but to good. It is your soul that I am buying for you. I withdraw it from dark thoughts and from the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God!’”</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p22" pid="X8JS9XwDWUWE6Qgjh_9ahQ" hash="NTR7WQ">Jean Valjean indeed became a new man, an honest man and a benefactor to many. Throughout his life he kept the two silver candlesticks to remind him that his life had been redeemed for God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p23" pid="yQ6uw2fKgESagZt0gxMN4A" hash="kve1aA">Some forms of temporal redemption come by collaborative effort. It is one of the reasons the Savior created a church. Being organized in quorums and auxiliaries and in stakes, wards, and branches, we can not only teach and encourage each other in the gospel, but we can also bring to bear people and resources to deal with the exigencies of life. People acting alone or in ad hoc groups cannot always provide means on a scale needed to address larger challenges. As followers of Jesus Christ we are a community of Saints organized to help redeem the needs of our fellow Saints and as many others as we can reach across the globe.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p24" pid="iOUcr8o8m0Gb2AU_bkAboQ" hash="3_Jm1A">Because of our humanitarian efforts, mentioned by Elder Dallin H. Oaks, specifically this past year, 890,000 people in 36 countries have clean water, 70,000 people in 57 countries have wheelchairs, 75,000 people in 25 countries have improved vision, and people in 52 countries received aid following natural disasters. Acting with others, the Church has helped immunize some 8 million children and has helped Syrians in refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan with the necessities of life. At the same time, members of the Church in need received millions of dollars in fast-offering and other welfare assistance during 2012. Thank you for your generosity.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p25" pid="fZs4Fq07U0i4FreBPrvAIQ" hash="E-w-Dg">All of this does not begin to count the individual acts of kindness and support—gifts of food, clothing, money, care, and a thousand other forms of comfort and compassion—by which we may participate in the Christlike work of redemption. As a boy I witnessed my own mother’s actions to redeem a woman in need. Many years ago when her children were young, my mother underwent a serious operation that nearly took her life and left her bedridden much of the time for nearly a year. During this time, family and ward members helped Mother and our family. For additional help, the ward Relief Society president, Sister Abraham, recommended that my parents hire a woman in the ward who desperately needed work. In recounting this story, I will use the fictional names Sara and Annie for this woman and her daughter. This is my mother’s account:</p>
				<span class="story">
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p26" pid="e5iMEVHSo0mCPGOwvPh9Cw" hash="BpBlmQ">“I can see it as plain as if it were only yesterday. There I lay in bed, and Sister Abraham brought Sara to the bedroom door. My heart sank. There stood the least attractive person I had ever met—so thin; scraggly, unkempt hair; round-shouldered; head bowed looking at the floor. She wore an old housedress four sizes too big. She wouldn’t look up and spoke so softly I couldn’t hear her. Hiding behind her was a little girl about three years old. What in the world was I to do with this creature? After they left the room, I cried and cried. I needed help, <span class="pageBreak" page-number="112"></span>not more problems. Sister Abraham stayed awhile with her, and they soon whipped the house into shape and prepared some good meals. Sister Abraham asked me to try it for a few days, [saying] that this girl had had a really hard time and needed help.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p27" pid="u-cg-sjX2U-iZ0W-JwYXBQ" hash="P4-tMA">“The next morning when Sara came, I finally got her to come over by the bed where I could hear her. She asked what I wanted her to do. I told her and then said, ‘But the most important thing is my boys; spend time with them, read to them—they are more important than the house.’ She was a good cook and kept the house clean, the washing done, and she was good to the boys.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p28" pid="5q3nvSbp4kKsU-HHOkGozQ" hash="q3oDhQ">“Through the weeks, I learned Sara’s story. [Because she was hard of hearing, she didn’t do well in school and eventually dropped out. She married young to a dissolute man. Annie was born and became the joy of Sara’s life. One winter night her husband came home drunk, forced Sara and Annie into the car in their bedclothes, and then dropped them off by the side of the highway. They never saw him again. Barefoot and freezing, Sara and Annie walked several miles to her mother’s home.] Her mother agreed to let them stay in exchange for doing all the housework and cooking, and caring for her sister and brother who were in high school.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p29" pid="RDTiZ45HVU-wTe75gtbRSw" hash="Vdq8gQ">“We took Sara to an ear doctor, and she got a hearing aid. … We got her to take adult schooling, and she got her high school diploma. She went to night school and later graduated from college and taught special education. She bought a little home. Annie was married in the temple and had two children. Sara eventually had some operations on her ears and was finally able to hear well. Years later she retired and served a mission. … Sara thanked us often and said she learned so much from me, especially when I told her that my sons were more important than the house. She said it taught her to be that way with Annie. … Sara is a very special woman.”</p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/redemption.p30" pid="GAHjMYWhc0WMOLY-w_y1fQ" hash="mLFcVQ">As disciples of Jesus Christ, we ought to do all we can to redeem others from suffering and burdens. Even so, our greatest redemptive service will be to lead them to Christ. Without His Redemption from death and from sin, we have only a gospel of social justice. That may provide some help and reconciliation in the present, but it has no power to draw down from heaven perfect justice and infinite mercy. Ultimate redemption is in Jesus Christ and in Him alone. I humbly and gratefully acknowledge Him as the Redeemer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

While certainly not the only positive influence at work in society, the moral foundation provided by women has proved uniquely beneficial to the common good. Perhaps, because it is pervasive, this contribution of women is often underappreciated. I wish to express gratitude for the influence of good women, identify some of the philosophies and trends that threaten women’s strength and standing, and voice a plea to women to cultivate the innate moral power within them.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-moral-force-of-women.p6" pid="L7l3c2VNHUKu49vmkxzfNA" hash="yDuasw">Women bring with them into the world a certain virtue, a divine gift that makes them adept at instilling such qualities as faith, courage, empathy, and refinement in relationships and in cultures. When praising the “unfeigned faith” he found in Timothy, Paul noted that this faith “dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

I recall a particular young mother, one of many among the women of the Church in Mexico whose faith in God graces their lives so naturally that they seem scarcely aware of it. This lovely woman radiated a moral authority, born of goodness, that influenced all around her for good. With her husband, she sacrificed a number of pleasures and possessions for their higher priorities, seemingly without a second thought. Her ability to perform feats of lifting, bending, and balancing with her children was near superhuman. The demands on her were many and her tasks often repetitive and mundane, yet underneath it all was a beautiful serenity, a sense of being about God’s work. As with the Savior, she was ennobled by blessing others through service and sacrifice. She was love personified.</p>

Among other women that I look to in gratitude is Anna Daines. Anna and her husband, Henry, and their four children were among the pioneers of the Church in New Jersey, in the United States. Beginning in the 1930s, when Henry was a doctoral student at Rutgers University, he and Anna worked tirelessly with school and civic organizations in Metuchen, where they lived, to overcome deeply rooted prejudice against Mormons and to make the community a better place for all parents to raise their children.</p>

Within a year she was appointed president of the Mothers’ Auxiliary and then “was asked to run for one of the three women’s positions on the YMCA board of directors. She won without opposition, and so joined the very council that only a few years before had refused to let the Saints meet in their building!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Sister Daines took notice of me and often expressed her confidence in my abilities and potential, which inspired me to reach high—higher than I would have without her encouragement. Once, because of a thoughtful and timely warning from her, I avoided a situation that would surely have led to regret. Although she is no longer here, Anna Daines’s influence continues to be felt and reflected in the lives of her descendants and countless others, myself included.</p>

She encouraged me to memorize the sacramental blessings on the bread and water, explaining that in this way I could express them with greater understanding and feeling. Observing how she sustained my grandfather, a stake patriarch, engendered in me a reverence for sacred things.

There is no better setting for rearing the rising generation than the traditional family, where a father and a mother work in harmony to provide for, teach, and nurture their children.

By the power of her example and teaching, her sons learn to respect womanhood and to incorporate discipline and high moral standards in their own lives. Her daughters learn to cultivate their own virtue and to stand up for what is right, again and again, however unpopular. A mother’s love and high expectations lead her children to act responsibly without excuses, to be serious about education and personal development, and to make ongoing contributions to the well-being of all around them. Elder Neal A. Maxwell once asked: “When the real history of mankind is fully disclosed, will it feature the echoes of gunfire or the shaping sound of lullabies? The great armistices made by military men or the peacemaking of women in homes and in neighborhoods? Will what happened in cradles and kitchens prove to be more controlling than what happened in congresses?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

In this way, they have been a civilizing influence in society; they have brought out the best in men; they have perpetuated wholesome environments in which to raise secure and healthy children.</p>

What I mean to say is that whether you are single or married, whether you have borne children or not, whether you are old, young, or in between, your moral authority is vital, and perhaps we have begun to take it and you for granted. Certainly there are trends and forces at work that would weaken and even eliminate your influence, to the great detriment of individuals, families, and society at large. Let me mention three as a caution and a warning.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-moral-force-of-women.p16" pid="lhqj_PuDh0W8hbONfk1UIg" hash="1Q4iog">A pernicious philosophy that undermines women’s moral influence is the devaluation of marriage and of motherhood and homemaking as a career. Some view homemaking with outright contempt, arguing it demeans women and that the relentless <span class="pageBreak" page-number="31"></span>demands of raising children are a form of exploitation.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> They ridicule what they call “the mommy track” as a career.

We do not diminish the value of what women or men achieve in any worthy endeavor or career—we all benefit from those achievements—but we still recognize there is not a higher good than motherhood and fatherhood in marriage. There is no superior career, and no amount of money, authority, or public acclaim can exceed the ultimate rewards of family. Whatever else a woman may accomplish, her moral influence is no more optimally employed than here.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-moral-force-of-women.p17" pid="FDQG6Kv77Eq2KkqutVUnJw" hash="PQoQhA">Attitudes toward human sexuality threaten the moral authority of women on several fronts. Abortion for personal or social convenience strikes at the heart of a woman’s most sacred powers and destroys her moral authority. The same is true of sexual immorality and of revealing dress that not only debases women but reinforces the lie that a woman’s sexuality is what defines her worth.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-moral-force-of-women.p18" pid="izUwMFJ-L0G9DwBxVfGXtQ" hash="wsa6hw">There has long been a cultural double standard that expected women to be sexually circumspect while excusing male immorality. The unfairness of such a double standard is obvious, and it has been justifiably criticized and rejected. In that rejection, one would have hoped that men would rise to the higher, single standard, but just the opposite has occurred—women and girls are now encouraged to be as promiscuous as the double standard expected men to be. Where once women’s higher standards demanded commitment and responsibility from men, we now have sexual relations without conscience, fatherless families, and growing poverty. Equal-opportunity promiscuity simply robs women of their moral influence and degrades all of society.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> In this hollow bargain, it is men who are “liberated” and women and children who suffer most.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-moral-force-of-women.p19" pid="aTZ0Xrgi2kaZO5EbyqEROQ" hash="7zlLbQ">A third area of concern comes from those who, in the name of equality, want to erase all differences between the masculine and the feminine. Often this takes the form of pushing women to adopt more masculine traits—be more aggressive, tough, and confrontational. It is now common in movies and video games to see women in terribly violent roles, leaving dead bodies and mayhem in their wake. It is soul-numbing to see men in such roles and certainly no less so when women are the ones perpetrating and suffering the violence.</p>

Nadauld taught: “The world has enough women who are tough; we need women who are tender. There are enough women who are coarse; we need women who are kind. There are enough women who are rude; we need women who are refined. We have enough women of fame and fortune; we need more women of faith. We have enough greed; we need more goodness. We have enough vanity; we need more virtue. We have enough popularity; we need more purity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> In blurring feminine and masculine differences, we lose the distinct, complementary gifts of women and men that together produce a greater whole.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-moral-force-of-women.p21" pid="H2pvz4aulEWuznBvrhDkhA" hash="TR8d2Q">My plea to women and girls today is to protect and cultivate the moral force that is within you. Preserve that innate virtue and the unique gifts you bring with you into the world. Your intuition is to do good and to be good, and as you follow the Holy Spirit, your moral authority and influence will grow. To the young women I say, don’t lose that moral force even before you have it in full measure. Take particular care that your language is clean, not coarse; that your dress reflects modesty, not vanity; and that your conduct manifests purity, not promiscuity. You cannot lift others to virtue on the one hand if you are entertaining vice on the other.</p>

He never varied from that which pleased His Father.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Strive to be that kind of disciple of the Father and the Son, and your influence will never fade.</p>

By praising and encouraging the moral force in women, I am not saying that men and boys are somehow excused from their own duty to stand for truth and righteousness, that their responsibility to serve, sacrifice, and minister is somehow less than that of women or can be left to women. Brethren, let us stand with women, share their burdens, and cultivate our own companion moral authority.</p>

			<span class="pageBreak" page-number="111"></span>A crushing sense of defeat and despair enveloped His disciples as Jesus suffered and died on the cross and His body was placed lifeless in the tomb. Despite what the Savior had repeatedly said of His death and subsequent rising again, they had not understood. The dark afternoon of His Crucifixion, however, was soon followed by the joyous morning of His Resurrection. But that joy came only as the disciples became eyewitnesses of the Resurrection, for even the declaration of angels that He had risen was at first incomprehensible—it was something so totally unprecedented.</p>

On this morning of mornings, they were greeted by an open sepulchre, the covering stone having been rolled away, and two angels who declared:</p>

In the dim light and partially disguised, King Henry wanders unrecognized among his soldiers. He talks with them, trying to gauge the morale of his badly outnumbered troops, and because they do not realize who he is, they are candid in their comments. In one exchange they philosophize about who bears responsibility for what happens to men in battle—the king or each individual soldier.</p>

Sometimes a sense of entitlement arises, and individuals or groups try to shift responsibility for their welfare to other people or to governments. In spiritual matters some suppose that men and women need not strive for personal righteousness—because God loves and saves us “just as we are.”</p>

God will not live our lives for us nor control us as if we were His puppets, as Lucifer once proposed to do. Nor will His prophets accept the role of “puppet master” in God’s place. Brigham Young stated: “I do not wish any Latter Day Saint in this world, nor in heaven, to be satisfied with anything I do, unless the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ,—the spirit of revelation, makes them satisfied. I wish them to know for themselves and understand for themselves.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Truly He loves us, and because He loves us, He neither compels nor abandons us. Rather He helps and guides us. Indeed, the real manifestation of God’s love is His commandments.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/free-forever-to-act-for-themselves.p15" pid="Z90snDsk4UaStRYWR-Ub0A" hash="f5iz6g">We should (and we do) rejoice in the God-ordained plan that permits us to make choices to act for ourselves and experience the consequences, or as the scriptures express it, to “taste the bitter, that [we] may know to prize the good.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> We are forever grateful that the Savior’s Atonement overcame original sin so that we can be born into this world yet not be punished for Adam’s transgression.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Having been thus redeemed from the Fall, we begin life innocent before God and “become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for [ourselves] and not to be acted upon.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> We can choose to become the kind of person that we will, and with God’s help, that can be even as He is.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and His grace, our failures to live the celestial law perfectly and consistently in mortality can be erased and we are enabled to develop a Christlike character. Justice demands, however, that none of this happen without our willing agreement and participation. It has ever been so. Our very presence on earth as physical beings is the consequence of a choice each of us made to participate in our Father’s plan.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Thus, salvation is certainly not the result of divine whim, but neither does it happen by divine will alone.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/free-forever-to-act-for-themselves.p17" pid="N2YXBBWZq0W7ivXpvVlcMg" hash="Xgfc6A">Justice is an essential attribute of God. We can have faith in God because He is perfectly trustworthy. The scriptures teach us that “God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither doth he turn to the right hand nor to the left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath said, therefore his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> and that “God is no respecter of persons.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> We rely on the divine quality of justice for faith, confidence, and hope.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/free-forever-to-act-for-themselves.p18" pid="2JsMPEpKVUWDAggrGxZEoQ" hash="CnF9Kg">But as a consequence of being perfectly just, there are some things God cannot do. He cannot be arbitrary in saving some and banishing others. He “cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> He cannot allow mercy to rob justice.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/free-forever-to-act-for-themselves.p19" pid="563lxoNs60WXr19jz6Ghgw" hash="SUmTLw">It is compelling evidence of His justice that God has forged the companion principle of mercy. It is because He is just that He devised the means for mercy to play its indispensable role in our eternal destiny. So now, “justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/free-forever-to-act-for-themselves.p20" pid="OtQxmEkAPUK0b_snXfXwUA" hash="-zdy9Q">We know that it is “the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom [the Father] wast well pleased; … the blood of [His] Son which was shed”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> that satisfies the demands of justice, extends mercy, and redeems us.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> Even so, “<span class="emphasis">according to justice,</span> the plan of redemption could not be brought about, <span class="emphasis">only on conditions of repentance.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> It is the requirement of and the opportunity for repentance that permits mercy to perform its labor without trampling justice.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/free-forever-to-act-for-themselves.p21" pid="1iLfXLQ-_Umn5FtY30nQNQ" hash="Yd5HnQ">Christ died not to save indiscriminately but to offer repentance. We rely “wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> in the process of repentance, but acting to repent is a self-willed change. So by making repentance a condition for receiving the gift of grace, God enables us to retain responsibility for ourselves. Repentance respects and sustains our moral agency: “And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/free-forever-to-act-for-themselves.p22" pid="7Oeh5p-_wESl5j2JTfYLqQ" hash="SMImrA">Misunderstanding God’s justice and mercy is one thing; denying God’s existence or supremacy is another, but either will result in our achieving less—sometimes far less—than our full, divine potential. A God who makes no demands is the functional equivalent of a God who does not exist. A world without God, the living God who establishes moral laws to govern and perfect His children, is also a world without ultimate truth or justice. It is a world where moral relativism reigns supreme.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/free-forever-to-act-for-themselves.p23" pid="oYrepGYD9kCQcCzA9fQWng" hash="aJm_JA">Relativism means each person is his or her own highest authority. Of course, it is not just those who deny God that subscribe to this philosophy. Some who believe in God still believe that they themselves, individually, decide what is right and wrong. One young adult expressed it this way: “I don’t think I could say that Hinduism is wrong or Catholicism is wrong or being Episcopalian is wrong—I think it just depends on what you believe. … I don’t think that there’s a right and wrong.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> Another, asked about the basis for his religious beliefs, replied, “Myself—it really comes down to that. I mean, how could there be authority to what you believe?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/free-forever-to-act-for-themselves.p24" pid="Pdc0_ILqqEiX_nTumNXSLw" hash="Tz6ATg">To those who believe anything or everything could be true, the declaration of objective, fixed, and universal truth feels like coercion—“I shouldn’t be forced to believe something is true that I don’t like.” But that does not change reality. Resenting the law of gravity won’t keep a person from falling if he steps off a cliff. The same is true for eternal law and justice. Freedom comes not from resisting it but from applying it. That is fundamental to God’s own power. If it were not for the reality of fixed and immutable truths, the gift of agency would be meaningless since we would never be able to foresee and intend the consequences of our actions. As Lehi expressed it: “If ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/free-forever-to-act-for-themselves.p25" pid="PiVsQmH5BkGa1GMKsKNnGQ" hash="ChVFOg">In matters both temporal and spiritual, the opportunity to assume personal responsibility is a God-given gift without which we cannot realize our full potential as daughters and sons of God. Personal accountability becomes both a right and a duty that we must constantly defend; it has been under assault since before the Creation. We must defend accountability against persons and programs that would (sometimes with the best of intentions) make us dependent. And we must defend it against our own inclinations to avoid the work that is required to cultivate talents, abilities, and Christlike character.</p>

He wanted to be taken care of in every need. To his way of thinking, the Church or the government, or both, owed him a living because he had paid his taxes and his tithing.

Out of desperation and disgust, those who had tried to help him decided that since he would not lift a finger to sustain himself, they might as well just take him to the cemetery and let him pass on. On the way to the cemetery, one man said, “We can’t do this. I have some corn I will give him.”</p>

But I know that beyond desiring His help, we must exert ourselves, repent, and choose God for Him to be able to act in our lives consistent with justice and moral agency.

Included among them is Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a brilliant German theologian born in 1906.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Bonhoeffer became a vocal critic of the Nazi dictatorship and its treatment of Jews and others. He was imprisoned for his active opposition and finally executed in a concentration camp. Bonhoeffer was a prolific writer, and some of his best-known pieces are letters that sympathetic guards helped him smuggle out of prison, later published as <span class="emphasis">Letters and Papers from Prison.</span>

It included these significant insights: “Marriage is more than your love for each other. … In your love you see only your two selves in the world, but in marriage you are a link in the chain of the generations, which God causes to come and to pass away to his glory, and calls into his kingdom. In your love you see only the heaven of your own happiness, but in marriage you are placed at a post of responsibility towards the world and mankind. Your love is your own private possession, but marriage is more than something personal—it is a status, an office. Just as it is the crown, and not merely the will to rule, that makes the king, so it is marriage, and not merely your love for each other, that joins you together in the sight of God and man. … So love comes from you, but marriage from above, from God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

In what sense does it come “from above, from God”? To understand, we have to go back to the beginning.</p>

In the scriptures it is given various names, including “the plan of salvation,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> “the great plan of happiness,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> and “the plan of redemption.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> The two principal purposes of the plan were explained to Abraham in these words:</p>

Now He was offering us a path to complete or perfect that being. The addition of the physical element is essential to the fulness of being and glory that God Himself enjoys. If, while with God in the premortal spirit world, we would agree to participate in His plan—or in other words “keep [our] first estate”—we would “be added upon” with a physical body as we came to dwell on the earth that He created for us.</p>

Could we bridle the flesh so that it became the instrument rather than the master of the spirit? Could we be trusted both in time and eternity with godly powers, including power to create life? Would we individually overcome evil? Those who did would “have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever”—a very significant aspect of that glory being a resurrected, immortal, and glorified physical body.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> No wonder we “shouted for joy” at these magnificent possibilities and promises.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p15" pid="yeRXVOB7NEajLt_7Q6jjIg" hash="Fg0Jww">First was the Creation of the earth as our dwelling place.

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p16" pid="2uhRD0rzqkStAnPbPH6tUw" hash="2E2KuQ">Second is the condition of mortality. Adam and Eve acted for all who had chosen to participate in the Father’s great plan of happiness.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Their Fall created the conditions needed for our physical birth and for mortal experience and learning outside the presence of God. With the Fall came an awareness of good and evil and the God-given power to choose.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Finally, the Fall brought about physical death needed to make our time in mortality temporary so that we would not live forever in our sins.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p17" pid="URo4D3MVf0qw80-r5vc5xw" hash="CFPo9w">Third is redemption from the Fall. We see the role of death in our Heavenly Father’s plan, but that plan would become void without some way to overcome death in the end, both physical and spiritual. Thus, a Redeemer, the Only Begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ, suffered and died to atone for Adam and Eve’s transgression, thereby providing resurrection and immortality for all. And since none of us will have been perfectly and consistently obedient to the gospel law, His Atonement also redeems us from our own sins on condition of repentance. With the Savior’s atoning grace providing forgiveness of sins and sanctification of the soul, we can spiritually be born again and reconciled to God. Our spiritual death—our separation from God—will end.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p18" pid="ehigVrBHiUiq76GFLBLTTw" hash="8e5K4g">Fourth, and finally, is the setting for our physical birth and subsequent spiritual rebirth into the kingdom of God. For His work to succeed to “[exalt us] with himself,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> God ordained that men and women should marry and give birth to children, thereby creating, in partnership with God, the physical bodies that are key to the test of mortality and essential to eternal glory with Him. He also ordained that parents should establish families and rear their children in light and truth,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> leading them to a hope in Christ. The Father commands us:</p>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p21" pid="juojAUuFHEWBRRBCHXmTUA" hash="-FC1kQ">Knowing why we left the presence of our Heavenly Father and what it takes to return and be exalted with Him, it becomes very clear that nothing relative to our time on earth can be more important than physical birth and spiritual rebirth, the two prerequisites of eternal life. This is, to use the words of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the “office” of marriage, the “post of responsibility towards … mankind,” that this divine institution “from above, from God” occupies. It is the “link in the chain of the generations” both here and hereafter—the order of heaven.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p22" pid="v5m3EDdNq0KhOjPCf8SgDA" hash="p6C0cg">A family built on the marriage of a man and woman supplies the best setting for God’s plan to thrive—the setting for the birth of children, who come in purity and innocence from God, and the environment for the learning and preparation they will need for a successful mortal life and eternal life in the world to come. A critical mass of families built on such marriages is vital for societies to survive and flourish. That is why communities and nations generally have encouraged and protected marriage and the family as privileged institutions. It has never been just about the love and happiness of adults.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p23" pid="gBjnCPHIR0CQVkGINvqIjg" hash="VPrF_A">The social science case for marriage and for families headed by a married man and woman is compelling.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> And so “we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> But our claims for the role of marriage and family rest not on social science but on the truth that they are God’s creation. It is He who in the beginning created Adam and Eve in His image, male and female, and joined them as husband and wife to become “one flesh” and to multiply and replenish the earth.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> Each individual carries the divine image, but it is in the matrimonial union of male and female as one that we attain perhaps the most complete meaning of our having been made in the image of God—male and female. Neither we nor any other mortal can alter this divine order of matrimony. It is not a human invention. Such marriage is indeed “from above, from God” and is as much a part of the plan of happiness as the Fall and the Atonement.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p24" pid="UIIqsGvtEUCOXo66NLSabA" hash="lN2I2Q">In the premortal world, Lucifer rebelled against God and His plan, and his opposition only grows in intensity. He fights to discourage marriage and the formation of families, and where marriages and families are formed, he does what he can to disrupt them. He attacks everything that is sacred about human sexuality, tearing it from the context of marriage with a seemingly infinite array of immoral thoughts and acts. He seeks to convince men and women that marriage and family priorities can be ignored or abandoned, or at least made subservient to careers, other achievements, and the quest for self-fulfillment and individual autonomy. Certainly the adversary is pleased when parents neglect to teach and train their children to have faith in Christ and be spiritually born again. Brothers and sisters, many things are good, many are important, but only a few are essential.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p25" pid="TKxTiGlnGEW0aEtYyY7AEg" hash="8d_KRg">To declare the fundamental truths relative to marriage and family is not to overlook or diminish the sacrifices and successes of those for whom the ideal is not a present reality. Some of you are denied the blessing of marriage for reasons including a lack of viable prospects, same-sex attraction, physical or mental impairments, or simply a fear of failure that, for the moment at least, overshadows faith. Or you may have married, but that marriage ended, and you are left to manage alone what two together can barely sustain. Some of you who are married cannot bear children despite overwhelming desires and pleading prayers.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p26" pid="_H6_v32Omk-tqbfbUrB76Q" hash="o1cSeA">Even so, everyone has gifts; everyone has talents; everyone can contribute to the unfolding of the divine plan in each generation. Much that is good, much that is essential—even sometimes all that is necessary for now—can be achieved in less than ideal circumstances. So many of you are doing your very best. And when you who bear the heaviest burdens of mortality stand up in defense of God’s plan to exalt His children, we are all ready to march. With confidence we testify that the Atonement of Jesus Christ has anticipated and, in the end, will compensate all deprivation and loss for those who turn to Him. No one is predestined to receive less than all that the Father has for His children.</p>

I felt that the issues that concerned her were small and she needn’t worry; she was doing fine. But I knew she only wanted to please God and to honor His trust. I offered words of reassurance, and in my heart I pleaded that God, her Heavenly Father, would buoy her up with His love and the witness of His approval as she is about His work.</p>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-why-family.p28" pid="5JXAu_q3IUKjAX3MrzMqIA" hash="aYzbyw">That is my prayer for all of us today. May we each find approval in His sight. May marriages flourish and families prosper, and whether our lot is a fulness of these blessings in mortality or not, may the Lord’s grace bring happiness now and faith in sure promises to come. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I realize that there are those who consider themselves religious or spiritual and yet reject participation in a church or even the need for such an institution. Religious practice is for them purely personal. Yet the Church is the creation of Him in whom our spirituality is centered—Jesus Christ. It is worth pausing to consider why He chooses to use a church, His Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to carry out His and His Father’s work “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

In Moses’s time, we read of a more formal structure, including elders, priests, and judges. In Book of Mormon history, Alma established a church with priests and teachers.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/why-the-church.p7" pid="7wJkm_qdwUihNzEtoJbBWg" hash="KGqnMw">Then, in the meridian of time, Jesus organized His work in such a way that the gospel could be established simultaneously in multiple nations and among diverse peoples. That organization, the Church of Jesus Christ, was founded on “apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> It included additional officers, such as seventies, elders, bishops, priests, teachers, and deacons. Jesus similarly established the Church in the Western Hemisphere after His Resurrection.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/why-the-church.p8" pid="zeeWhn0hmkSgwyOq_rxUMQ" hash="R--Oqw">Following the apostasy and disintegration of the Church He had organized while on the earth, the Lord reestablished the Church of Jesus Christ once again through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The ancient purpose remains: that is, to preach the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ and administer the ordinances of salvation—in other words, to bring people to Christ.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> And now, through the instrumentality of this restored Church, the promise of redemption is placed within reach even of the spirits of the dead who in their mortal lifetime knew little or nothing of the Savior’s grace.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/why-the-church.p9" pid="3KLzFp75ekqmLtQDRvro6A" hash="NM8lYw">How does His Church accomplish the Lord’s purposes? It is important to recognize that God’s ultimate purpose is our progress. His desire is that we continue “from grace to grace, until [we receive] a fulness”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> of all He can give. That requires more than simply being nice or feeling spiritual. It requires faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism of water and of the Spirit, and enduring in faith to the end.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> One cannot fully achieve this in isolation, so a major reason the Lord has a church is to create a community of Saints that will sustain one another in the “strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

As the body of Christ, the members of the Church minister to one another in the reality of day-to-day life. All of us are imperfect; we may offend and be offended.

He made this observation in a sacrament meeting: “My father cannot understand why anyone would go to church when they could go skiing, but I really like going to church. In the Church, we are all on the same journey, and I am inspired in that journey by strong youth, pure children, and what I see and learn from other adults.

We are prone to excuse and rationalize our faults, and sometimes we simply do not know where we should improve or how to do it. Without those who can reprove us “betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> we might lack the courage to change and more perfectly follow the Master.

One, we do not strive for conversion to the Church but to Christ and His gospel, a conversion that is facilitated by the Church.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> The Book of Mormon expresses it best when it says that the people “were <span class="emphasis">converted unto the Lord,</span> and were <span class="emphasis">united unto the church of Christ.</span> ”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span> Two, we must remember that in the beginning, the Church was the family, and even today as separate institutions, the family and the Church serve and strengthen one another. Neither supplants the other, and certainly the Church, even at its best, cannot substitute for parents. The point of gospel teaching and priesthood ordinances administered by the Church is that families may qualify for eternal life.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/why-the-church.p20" pid="ijNzwMz4Y0qKRaeM8zwHNg" hash="wnQnyw">There is a second major reason the Savior works through a church, His Church, and that is to achieve needful things that cannot be accomplished by individuals or smaller groups. One clear example is dealing with poverty. It is true that as individuals and families we look after the physical needs of others, “imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span> But together in the Church, the ability to care for the poor and needy is multiplied to meet the broader need, and hoped-for self-reliance is made a reality for very many.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span> Further, the Church, its Relief Societies, and its priesthood quorums have the capacity to provide relief to many people in many places affected by natural disasters, war, and persecution.</p>

Remember, “this Gospel of the Kingdom [must] be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span></p>

Joseph Smith stated that God’s objective in gathering His people in any age is “to build unto the Lord a house whereby He [can] reveal unto His people the ordinances of His house and the glories of His kingdom, and teach the people the way of salvation; for there are certain ordinances and principles that, when they are taught and practiced, must be done in a place or house built for that purpose.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_27">27</span></p>

But we speak not just of immortality but also of eternal life, and for that the gospel path and gospel covenants are essential. And the Savior needs a church to make them available to all of God’s children—both the living and the dead.</p>

		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p8" pid="jIdhKMAb0USrpws0P4Aftg" hash="iabbtg"&gt;Some see the good of fatherhood in social terms, as something that obligates men to their offspring, impelling them to be good citizens and to think about the needs of others, supplementing “maternal investment in children with paternal investment in children. … In short, the key for men is to be fathers. The key for children is to have fathers. The key for society is to create fathers.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; While these considerations are certainly true and important, we know that fatherhood is much more than a social construct or the product of evolution. The role of father is of divine origin, beginning with a Father in Heaven and, in this mortal sphere, with Father Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p9" pid="p_Kfw7G0s0u803GQMtuQ3A" hash="N8-H3Q"&gt;The perfect, divine expression of fatherhood is our Heavenly Father. His character and attributes include abundant goodness and perfect love. His work and glory are the development, happiness, and eternal life of His children.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; Fathers in this fallen world can claim nothing comparable to the Majesty on High, but at their best, they are striving to emulate Him, and they indeed labor in His work. They are honored with a remarkable and sobering trust.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p10" pid="4NV2fpAeb0mwg7QUXwgWwQ" hash="65MC6Q"&gt;For men, fatherhood exposes us to our own weaknesses and our need to improve. Fatherhood requires sacrifice, but it is a source of incomparable satisfaction, even joy. Again, the ultimate model is our Heavenly Father, who so loved us, His spirit children, that He gave us His Only Begotten Son for our salvation and exaltation.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; Jesus said, “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; Fathers manifest that love as they lay down their lives day by day, laboring in the service and support of their families.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p11" pid="FfkWpGBzFEuQN3P4cRL7_w" hash="1Jv7kQ"&gt;Perhaps the most essential of a father’s work is to turn the hearts of his children to their Heavenly Father. If by his example as well as his words a father can demonstrate what fidelity to God looks like in day-to-day living, that father will have given his children the key to peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; A father who reads scripture to and with his children acquaints them with the voice of the Lord.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I recall that when I was a boy of about 12, my father became a candidate for the city council in our rather small community. He did not mount an extensive election campaign—all I remember was that Dad had my brothers and me distribute copies of a flyer door to door, urging people to vote for Paul Christofferson. There were a number of adults that I handed a flyer to who remarked that Paul was a good and honest man and that they would have no problem voting for him. My young boy heart swelled with pride in my father. It gave me confidence and a desire to follow in his footsteps. He was not perfect—no one is—but he was upright and good and an aspirational example for a son.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p26" pid="i8Gg04F_Kk-D3KP75KhK7Q" hash="EQGAgQ"&gt;The Lord has said that “all children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt; Breadwinning is a consecrated activity. Providing for one’s family, although it generally requires time away from the family, is not inconsistent with fatherhood—it is the essence of being a good father. “Work and family are overlapping domains.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt; This, of course, does not justify a man who neglects his family for his career or, at the other extreme, one who will not exert himself and is content to shift his responsibility to others. In the words of King Benjamin:&lt;/p&gt;

There is no shame for those who, at a given moment, despite their best efforts, cannot fulfill all the duties and functions of fathers. “Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended families should lend support when needed.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p31" pid="ucSBP7t1LU2mtQEefeBnxg" hash="yjeb7w"&gt;Some men are single fathers, foster fathers, or stepfathers. Many of them strive mightily and do their very best in an often difficult role. We honor those who do all that can be done in love, patience, and self-sacrifice to meet individual and family needs. It should be noted that God Himself entrusted His Only Begotten Son to a foster father. Surely some of the credit goes to Joseph for the fact that as Jesus grew, He “increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p32" pid="hVu_8mZ30UCTyiLN78D8_A" hash="zvkNMg"&gt;Regrettably, due to death, abandonment, or divorce, some children don’t have fathers living with them. Some may have fathers who are physically present but emotionally absent or in other ways inattentive or nonsupportive. We call on all fathers to do better and to be better. We call on media and entertainment outlets to portray devoted and capable fathers who truly love their wives and intelligently guide their children, instead of the bumblers and buffoons or “the guys who cause problems,” as fathers are all too frequently depicted.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p33" pid="KN8P0DmXVUqhRK-touMp6g" hash="zedn3g"&gt;To children whose family situation is troubled, we say, you yourself are no less for that. Challenges are at times an indication of the Lord’s trust in you. He can help you, directly and through others, to deal with what you face. You can become the generation, perhaps the first in your family, where the divine patterns that God has ordained for families truly take shape and bless all the generations after you.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p34" pid="r3LgXctxNEK_bYWc6wUcJQ" hash="Oc0T-w"&gt;To young men, recognizing the role you will have as provider and protector, we say, prepare now by being diligent in school and planning for postsecondary training. Education, whether in a university, technical school, apprenticeship, or similar program, is key to developing the skills and capabilities you will need. Take advantage of opportunities to associate with people of all ages, including children, and learn how to establish healthy and rewarding relationships. That typically means talking face to face with people and sometimes doing things together, not just perfecting your texting skills. Live your life so that as a man you will bring purity to your marriage and to your children.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p35" pid="2oVqG7KJVke17xHuE6K_wA" hash="Ae0Tlw"&gt;To all the rising generation, we say, wherever you rank your own father on the scale of good-better-best (and I predict that ranking will go higher as you grow older and wiser), make up your mind to honor him and your mother by your own life. Remember the yearning hope of a father as expressed by John: “I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt; Your righteousness is the greatest honor any father can receive.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p36" pid="zHLc__Y9XEKFtwEw8w1Xkg" hash="kFKDuQ"&gt;To my brethren, the fathers in this Church, I say, I know you wish you were a more perfect father. I know I wish I were. Even so, despite our limitations, let us press on. Let us lay aside the exaggerated notions of individualism and autonomy in today’s culture and think first of the happiness and well-being of others. Surely, despite our inadequacies, our Heavenly Father will magnify us and cause our simple efforts to bear fruit. I am encouraged by a story that appeared in the &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;New Era &lt;/span&gt;some years ago. The author recounted the following:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p37" pid="Yv3aDx9uG0SELuImGWCZ4Q" hash="EPDxxQ"&gt;“When I was young, our little family lived in a one-bedroom apartment on the second floor. I slept on the couch in the living room. …&lt;/p&gt;

Every morning he would … tuck the covers around me and stop for a minute. I would be half-dreaming when I could sense my dad standing beside the couch, looking at me. As I slowly awoke, I became embarrassed to have him there. I tried to pretend I was still asleep. … I became aware that as he stood beside my bed he was praying with all his attention, energy, and focus—for me.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/fathers.p39" pid="1OXAHxULi0-OiLJLtqSebg" hash="LErtWw"&gt;“Each morning my dad prayed for me.

But as I got older, I came to sense his love and interest in me and everything I was doing. It is one of my favorite memories. It wasn’t until years later, after I was married, had children of my own, and would go into their rooms while they were asleep and pray for them that I understood completely how my father felt about me.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Rather, His love is described in scripture as “great and wonderful love,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> “perfect love,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> “redeeming love,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> and “everlasting love.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> These are better terms because the word <span class="emphasis">unconditional</span> can convey mistaken impressions about divine love, such as, God tolerates and excuses anything we do because His love is unconditional, or God makes no demands upon us because His love is unconditional, or <span class="emphasis">all</span> are saved in the heavenly kingdom of God because His love is unconditional. God’s love is infinite and it will endure forever, but what it means for each of us depends on how we respond to His love.</p>

Helen was born in the state of Alabama in the United States in 1880. When just 19 months old, she suffered an undiagnosed illness that left her both deaf and blind. She was extremely intelligent and became frustrated as she tried to understand and make sense of her surroundings. When Helen felt the moving lips of family members and realized that they used their mouths to speak, “she flew into a rage [because] she was unable to join in the conversation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span> By the time Helen was six, her need to communicate and her frustration grew so intense that her “outbursts occurred daily, sometimes hourly.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_27">27</span></p>

Just as we have in Jesus Christ one who understands our infirmities,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span> Anne Sullivan had struggled with her own serious hardships and understood Helen’s infirmities. At age five, Anne had contracted a disease that caused painful scarring of the cornea and left her mostly blind. When Anne was eight, her mother died; her father abandoned her and her younger brother, Jimmie; and they were sent to a “poor house,” where conditions were so deplorable that Jimmie died after only three months. Through her own dogged persistence, Anne gained entry to the Perkins School for the Blind and vision impaired, where she succeeded brilliantly. A surgical operation gave her improved vision so that she was able to read print. When Helen Keller’s father contacted the Perkins School seeking someone to become a teacher for his daughter, Anne Sullivan was selected.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_29">29</span></p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p10" pid="5_09NvWgBEalucuBSebXOA" hash="skY1Pg">Then speaking directly to Ezekiel, Jehovah declared, “So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them [for] me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> The warning was to turn away from sin.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p11" pid="im02j1qm3U6HeCx3BDRB3g" hash="KLpBtA">“When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p12" pid="vRr3kAPsV0O4wHyXRBKf4Q" hash="zhDRlw">“Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. …</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p14" pid="PwPUZF-Rx0-YVlZsKtA4Ng" hash="W1bR3Q">“None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p15" pid="Hkw2dGyoW0qwOBgQ4NJrrg" hash="przRtg">Interestingly, this warning also applies to the righteous. “When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his [righteous deeds] shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p16" pid="zaWUHVS4FkOUT-y_6UBGrg" hash="EwXJbA">Pleading with His children, God tells Ezekiel, “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p17" pid="hpOZEtgGF0eflYOYV5_0hw" hash="oaKjWw">Far from being anxious to condemn, our Heavenly Father and our Savior seek our happiness and plead with us to repent, knowing full well that “wickedness never was [and never will be] happiness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> So Ezekiel and every prophet before and since, speaking the word of God out of a full heart, have warned all who will to turn away from Satan, the enemy of their souls, and “choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p18" pid="ZO-GPh9oNkeaufko6_LUgw" hash="ERtXPw">While the duty to warn is felt especially keenly by prophets, it is a duty shared by others as well. In fact, “it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> We who have received a knowledge of the great plan of happiness—and its implementing commandments—should feel a desire to share that knowledge since it makes all the difference here and in eternity. And if we ask, “Who is my neighbor that I should warn?” surely the answer will be found in a parable that begins, “A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> and so forth.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p19" pid="Wg8tV5VLkkSCg6DmFik-Uw" hash="t-oacg">Considering the parable of the good Samaritan in this context reminds us that the question “Who is my neighbor?” was tied to the two great commandments: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> The motivation for raising the warning voice is love—love of God and love of fellowman. To warn is to care. The Lord instructs that it is to be done “in mildness and in meekness”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> and “by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness … , and by love unfeigned.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> It can be urgent, as when we warn a child not to put his or her hand in a fire. It must be clear and sometimes firm. On occasion, warning may take the form of reproof “when moved upon by the Holy Ghost,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> but always it is rooted in love. Witness, for example, the love that motivates the service and sacrifices of our missionaries.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p20" pid="-vaiO51j5024xtcVCHVVxA" hash="T4ZDiQ">Surely love would compel parents to warn their closest “neighbors”—their own children. This means teaching and testifying of gospel truths. It means teaching children the doctrine of Christ: faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> The Lord reminds parents, “I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p21" pid="jUb1XgNtmE-p2wepHuoVpw" hash="fojDrg">A crucial element of the parental duty to warn is to paint not only the demoralizing consequences of sin but also the joy of walking in obedience to the commandments. Recall the words of Enos about what led him to seek God, receive a remission of sins, and become converted:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p22" pid="WC74a1wGqUKcN5vB1CVr6w" hash="TjEVGg">“Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, <span class="emphasis">and the joy of the saints,</span> sunk deep into my heart.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p23" pid="iS1hJAwZX0ClQ0U8swlu7Q" hash="fxf3DA">“And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p24" pid="XYu6mBM1B0SM-PgOFM6M6A" hash="ZsjjJA">Because of His incomparable love and concern for others and their happiness, Jesus was not hesitant to warn. At the outset of His ministry, “Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> Because He knows that not just any path leads to heaven, He commanded:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p25" pid="-9E7arbVzUiLCM1CGPePMg" hash="aA4SKA">“Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p26" pid="7NQiT5cWbUWbxoeIiyAvvw" hash="UT7LSQ">“Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p27" pid="uiJf24qU_0GKyGY1KHgoHw" hash="377iaQ">He devoted time to sinners, saying, “I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p28" pid="gi5rHxPlw0OJsmBmsdxk7g" hash="WwCJmg">As for the scribes and Pharisees and Sadducees, Jesus was uncompromising in condemning their hypocrisy. His warnings and commandments were direct: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span> Surely no one would accuse the Savior of not loving these scribes and Pharisees—after all, He suffered and died to save them too. But loving them, He could not let them go on in sin without clearly correcting them. One observer noted, “Jesus taught his followers to do as he did: to welcome everyone but also to teach about sin, since love demands warning people about what can hurt them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p29" pid="UHFWSusoPUyJ64Ub2o23Hg" hash="By2UPg">Sometimes those who raise a warning voice are dismissed as judgmental. Paradoxically, however, those who claim truth is relative and moral standards are a matter of personal preference are often the same ones who most harshly criticize people who don’t accept the current norm of “correct thinking.” One writer referred to this as the “shame culture”:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p30" pid="h8Xz5P4CN0Syvv5ABTYRmw" hash="4OT6AA">“In a guilt culture you know you are good or bad by what your conscience feels. In a shame culture you know you are good or bad by what your community says about you, by whether it honors or excludes you. … [In the shame culture,] moral life is not built on the continuum of right and wrong; it’s built on the continuum of inclusion and exclusion. …</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p31" pid="s_oAsFQJlEmf0EyHNMbbWw" hash="5ysL0g">“… Everybody is perpetually insecure in a moral system based on inclusion and exclusion. There are no permanent standards, just the shifting judgment of the crowd. It is a culture of oversensitivity, overreaction and frequent moral panics, during which everybody feels compelled to go along. … </p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p32" pid="xQbRYi-XvEaxdlrlLnhqOQ" hash="o7yqpw">“The guilt culture could be harsh, but at least you could hate the sin and still love the sinner. The modern shame culture allegedly values inclusion and tolerance, but it can be strangely unmerciful to those who disagree and to those who don’t fit in.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p33" pid="lDvoybRqL0asprAM7NyVWg" hash="G5RwLQ">Contrasted to this is “the rock of our Redeemer,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span> a stable and permanent foundation of justice and virtue. How much better it is to have the unchanging law of God by which we may act to choose our destiny rather than being hostage to the unpredictable rules and wrath of the social media mob. How much better it is to know the truth than to be “tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_27">27</span> How much better to repent and rise to the gospel standard than to pretend there is no right or wrong and languish in sin and regret.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p34" pid="iEyOPpiPWEKoOtTXPxLi2w" hash="7OtlpA">The Lord has declared, “The voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span> As watchmen and disciples, we cannot be neutral about this “more excellent way.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_29">29</span> As Ezekiel, we cannot see the sword coming upon the land “and blow not the trumpet.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_30">30</span> This is not to say that we should bang on our neighbor’s door or stand in the public square shouting, “Repent!” Truly, when you think about it, we have in the restored gospel what people, deep down, really want. So the warning voice is generally not only civil, but in the Psalmist’s phrase, it is a “joyful noise.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_31">31</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p35" pid="WxZbXQIHbEiu_vUfd3Fpuw" hash="pfdltg"><span class="emphasis">Deseret News</span> opinion editor Hal Boyd cited one example of the disservice inherent in staying silent. He noted that while the idea of marriage is still a matter of “intellectual debate” among elites in American society, marriage itself is not a matter of debate for them in practice. “‘Elites get and stay married and make sure their kids enjoy the benefits of stable marriage.’ … The problem, however, is that [they] tend not to preach what they practice.” They don’t want to “impose” on those who really could use their moral leadership, but “it is perhaps time for those with education and strong families to stop feigning neutrality and start preaching what they practice pertaining to marriage and parenting … [and] help their fellow Americans embrace it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_32">32</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p36" pid="k6PgpMUEFk-NGtphWOkXdQ" hash="yG2RAg">We trust that especially you of the rising generation, youth and young adults on whom the Lord must rely for the success of His work in future years, will sustain the teachings of the gospel and the standards of the Church in public as well as in private. Do not abandon those who would welcome truth to floundering and failing in ignorance. Do not succumb to false notions of tolerance or to fear—fear of inconvenience, disapproval, or even suffering. Remember the Savior’s promise:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p37" pid="LxrOC7yxe0OLxK7nEa0jLg" hash="JEcTeg">“Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p39" pid="oRypecjIak-QdVrWz35tmA" hash="G3L0Bw">Ultimately, we are all accountable to God for our choices and the lives we live. The Savior declared, “My Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_34">34</span></p>

As the bread is broken, we remember the Savior’s torn flesh. Elder Dallin H.

But figuratively eating His flesh and drinking His blood has a further meaning, and that is to internalize the qualities and character of Christ, putting off the natural man and becoming Saints “through the atonement of Christ the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> As we partake of the sacramental bread and water each week, we would do well to consider how fully and completely we must incorporate His character and the pattern of His sinless life into our life and being. Jesus could not have atoned for the sins of others unless He Himself was sinless. Since justice had no claim on Him, He could offer Himself in our place to satisfy justice and then extend mercy. As we remember and honor His atoning sacrifice, we should also contemplate His sinless life.</p>

It was inscribed on sacrament cups and plates and printed on certificates of ordination of Seventies and on a Relief Society banner. “Holiness to the Lord” also appeared over the display windows of Zion’s Cooperative Mercantile Institution, the ZCMI department store. It was found on the head of a hammer and on a drum. “Holiness to the Lord” was cast on the metal doorknobs of President Brigham Young’s home. These references to holiness in seemingly unusual or unexpected places may seem incongruous, but they suggest just how pervasive and constant our focus on holiness needs to be.</p>
