Presidents of the Church called members on missions with no warning beforehand. I feel the same way today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-answers-will-come.p2" pid="QlRjBkj4pUKJb2D91LNutw" hash="NCIujw">It’s a long way from Switzerland to this stand in Salt Lake City. I had to cross many borders. I had to ask for a visa, for permission to enter this country. But I found out that wherever I had to cross a border or had to talk with people, the people were friendly. That’s exactly what I need in my assignment—friends. I have some sitting behind me. I have some sitting before me.</p>

I don’t know at the moment all the questions I will be asked or how I will find solutions for them. But I know that I will get an answer when I work on it and pray about it. If I do that, I know I will be blessed in all I do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-answers-will-come.p4" pid="7ulAWRvQyUax8moJtxjW2A" hash="wbwBQg">I am very thankful for my priesthood leaders, my parents, my sisters, my brethren, my teachers in Sunday School—all who have given me the strength to fulfill the assignments I get in my life. Hopefully, I can serve so that our Lord will be pleased. I am very thankful to the First Presidency for this privilege—for calling me to be a General Authority. I leave you my testimony that I know that our Lord lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a true prophet. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p1" pid="XDfHBQulsUmCQFcCVGflDw" hash="XYvwkA">After the resurrection of Christ, the Twelve Apostles preached the gospel in the city of Jerusalem. Their message touched the hearts of many people, and, upon testifying of the truthfulness of the Resurrection, they were asked, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.37" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:37</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p2" pid="xb7QSQ6g9UWo3HDZAaNw2Q" hash="HIDMHQ">Ever since, this very question has been asked by people all over the world, by people like you and me. Daily we are confronted with decisions concerning our physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being of those around us. Our decisions are based upon our understanding of what is good and right for us, and we try to avoid pitfalls and mistakes. We hope for happiness, and we wish for comfort.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p3" pid="uv0hgwvcJ0K241mep8TbAg" hash="qnIcxA">In my own life, this hope and wish for a happier and more meaningful life causes me to evaluate my daily decisions more carefully. And never do I feel the need for some guiding principle more than when I come to a crossroad, for without some direction I feel incapable of pursuing my course consistently.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p4" pid="V2kW5NOpF0q0P51SjNYueQ" hash="Vz6-eA">But it is one thing to know the way, and another to take it. Some of us probably struggle to find guiding principles, some sort of foundation on which to build, and others have designed the perfect plan but never find the motivation, time, or courage to use it. In one way or another, we are paralyzed by the lack of understanding that true happiness comes from realizing our plans, beliefs, and hopes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p5" pid="VmU5yGJo9U67RvdYyvT_hg" hash="MaeF5A">I believe that the foundation and guiding light for all our decisions is the gospel of Jesus Christ and His message to the world. The teachings of Christ must be embedded in our desire to choose the right and in our wish to find happiness. His righteous life must be reflected in our own actions. The Lord not only teaches love, He <span class="emphasis">is</span> love. He not only preached the importance of faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, He <span class="emphasis">lived</span> accordingly. His life reflected the gospel that He preached. There was and is total harmony between His thoughts and His actions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p6" pid="J2UaILXyjE-w756HW4uE9w" hash="GUmrnA">I believe that if we want to be true Christians, our lives must be founded on true principles and our actions must reflect that. But I do not believe that we can pick and choose which principles are the most convenient ones. Today, however, I would like to mention those that are true to my heart and that have helped me in my quest to take the Christian course.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p7" pid="OSTQNkdT6kGn94OTHCHt4w" hash="1uY73g">When a man asked Christ what he should do to inherit eternal life, He answered, “Love the Lord thy God … and thy neighbour as thyself.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.27" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:27</a>.) Love is the essence of the gospel and the guiding light for a Christlike life. It not only teaches us to look upward but also to look around us. Our heart, might, and mind must be dedicated to the Lord and to our fellow men, women, and children. But what does that really mean? It means that we follow the admonition of the scripture, “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.15" class="scriptureRef">John 14:15</a>.) It means that we live the example of the good Samaritan, who was free of prejudice and excuses and therefore truly loved his neighbor. He went the second mile and gave of what he had despite all the odds. His life was one of single-minded service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p8" pid="dQkmKdqxuUmihkfnYHpzWA" hash="wd7crA">By contrast, the Apostle James observed that “a double minded man is unstable in all his ways.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.8" class="scriptureRef">James 1:8</a>.) An old Swiss saying describes such indecision in the following words:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p11" pid="h4tqdgx6eE67jmKEir4tGg" hash="6rUCow">A Christian life demands decision and dedication. It is a dedication that is free of fanaticism but full of understanding and love. It is a dedication that knows no selfishness but yet knows of our personal needs. It is a dedication that embraces all mankind and yet keeps an eye single to the Lord. And it is a dedication that brings joy but is seldom free of hardship, disappointment, and discomfort.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p12" pid="zAYbmeR9aUSeSpRnrBb6tg" hash="4yqJ6Q">It is not always easy to make the right decision, and some of us struggle a life long to find the right course. Remember, it is not for us to judge those who might be confused or who have not the strength to change. What they need is our understanding and support.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p13" pid="776vaRs_O0OyAJwbVAEX5w" hash="5wsEFQ">When Jesus came to the coast of Judea, a young man said to him, “All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.20" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 19:20</a>.) The answer Christ gave was simple but powerful: “Go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 19:21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p14" pid="Dpa_7iX3zEatTJwNRwkv4A" hash="1cT55A">Christ speaks to all of us, not only to the young rich man who went away sorrowful. He commands us to give of our wealth, whatever it might be. For some it is material possessions, for others time or a talent. For those of us who have worldly riches, it does not mean that we cannot enjoy the commodities of life for which we work. But it means that we use them to do good and that we share them with those in need. Our hearts should be set upon helping those in need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p15" pid="bJT5y_f24k64Io_NayfyLA" hash="34pBjw">But money alone does not lift the burdens of our fellowmen, and many of us live in a time and place where there is little to spare. The world is in need of time, and if we have but one hour to spare, we are wealthy. It takes time to listen and to comfort, it takes time to teach and to encourage, and it takes time to feed and to clothe. We all have the gift to lift each other’s burdens and to make a difference in somebody’s life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p16" pid="IMxqMoJY2EqYX0GAnREF1Q" hash="aqkwGw">The needy are all around us. Too often, however, we are blind to those needs or fear those people whose company makes us feel uncomfortable. Yes, we admire people and organizations for the numerous services they render; and yes, we rejoice in the tremendous social changes many countries experienced during the last few months. But our admiration and interest are not enough. People at home and abroad need our help. Let us decide to serve now, even if that means leaving the comfort of our homes temporarily.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p17" pid="4FX6cHS2S0GojrZdOzbxuQ" hash="b0FKgg">Most of the time we do not even have to go too far; within our own communities there are people of all ages who are homeless, terminally ill, and lonely. We cannot hope for a better world, for more perfect governments and societies, if we are not willing to do our share.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p18" pid="M34iUY-2EU2tYJxv0Mn7zA" hash="K1rj-g">We need to look around us, and if we cannot see poverty, illness, and despair in our own neighborhood or ward, then we have to look harder. And remember, we cannot be afraid to go beyond our own social and cultural circles. We have to rid ourselves of religious, racial, or social prejudices and expand the boundaries of our service. Service should never discriminate and is hardly ever easy. Did not Jesus Himself mingle with those who were branded unfit by the self-righteous Pharisees? And were not those people the ones who needed Him the most?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p19" pid="7YhO4CvC10-283AZscPjmA" hash="8-0U_A">I understand that the needs of this world can overwhelm us and that injustices of life and the ills of society can paralyze us. But I believe that no good cause is in vain, and if we can only touch one life, the world is a better place. Choose your service today, and choose it wisely. Prepare yourself to be of help to others. There are many good causes inside and outside the Church. There is a need for volunteers who share their time and talents with those who are less fortunate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p20" pid="S7_25WYoXkCAVzwVCARZ6w" hash="usGICw">To love and care for others is a decision. It is the answer to the Lord’s exhortation, “Come follow me.” It is the answer the Apostles gave to those who asked, “What shall we do?” To say “I cannot” is a decision for <span class="emphasis">no.</span> It is a decision that will rob us of the very happiness we are seeking. And most of all, it is a decision against a Christlike life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/choose-you-this-day.p21" pid="TPNi70yGdEmVM3dg_NZQNg" hash="Ukxaog">I testify to you that we can only be in the service of our God if we are in the service of our fellowmen. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:17</a>.) I hope that we all have the wisdom and determination to decide today whom we want to serve. And I pray that we will decide together with the prophet Joshua, “As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/24.15" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 24:15</a>.) In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p1" pid="NECCxX15FEyfQM0rwbnTCg" hash="BF8ssw">A few years ago the world was at a political turning point. People believed that nations would achieve a long-awaited peace. Many overlooked, however, that we live in societies and cultures in which norms and values are changing and where secular reforms often define the nature of men and women. One injustice is often replaced by another injustice. We live in a time of ambiguous mores and of little direction. We are confronted with the same question that the disciples were asked after the resurrection of Christ: “What shall we do?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/2.37" class="scriptureRef">Acts 2:37</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p2" pid="coVNpbaUdUOzIx4lcxBZfw" hash="eaFh6w">This is the question we ask in uncertain times or when confronted with new challenges. We may answer with unreflective action, hoping to find solutions merely through results. Fortunately the Lord understands us better than we understand ourselves. The gospel teaches us first to ponder and develop faith. Only after we have honestly decided in favor of good, based on the gospel, can we bring forth righteous deeds. Active faith leads to good works. We will receive the strength from above to strive toward what is right. However, great works and deeds are not sustained in themselves. Continuity of great deeds requires our obedient dedication and the dedication of future generations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p3" pid="cd5ePoosUUO54HJoaxsjNw" hash="T_gV1A">The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only plan in which there are no calculated errors. After the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord warned His disciples of future adversities and the need for just works. He explained that they should not rely on their own strength when they served but on His name and His calling. We, too, are disciples and live in a world of many needs, be they spiritual, material, or emotional. Through gospel service our eternal needs can be satisfied, and we will be able to serve in the world. Our needs cannot be met through searching for the unenduring but only in discovering the eternal. When we look for answers on an eternal plane, we will secure our relationship to God and gain a better understanding of our fellow beings. We will thus be capable of serving; such is the purpose of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p4" pid="x0eOqL2_AkSA9nP79VKrQw" hash="IRDiPg">The visible expression of doing God’s will often results in personal cheerfulness—a silent, sunny brightness and a joy for life, feelings which are sung about in Psalms. We live, however, not without adversity and possible moments of deep despair. Our surroundings entice us to the unenduring, to injustice and disobedience. If we want to prevail, we must act in accordance with gospel principles. We cannot ask for more than to find the true meaning of life. “He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/10.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 10:39</a>). We are promised that we will receive plentifully and gain eternal life when we give up those things the Lord requires of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p5" pid="whutu4HxQEK1EOuaZkKCJA" hash="VfpMpA">We choose to accept or reject the gospel of Christ. Human life was created on the basis of freedom of choice. God wants free people and people who serve Him freely. It is therefore a challenge in everyone’s life to choose the straight and narrow path which avoids a life which lacks eternal direction. There are probably times in our lives when we wonder if there are other paths or shortcuts. The gospel gives us the answer, together with the promise of divine guidance. It is a path we can follow only one step at a time, with patience, hope, and faith. Decisions we make today will influence our future course, our future strengths and abilities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p6" pid="b1fglRrFWEGPWlfaDQv7jw" hash="_cmNXQ">Thomas Carlyle once remarked, “Know your destiny and follow it.” We are here today because we believe that our destiny in life is to gain eternal exaltation. This is the highest goal in life, and it demands all of our strength, devotion, and work. It is impossible to achieve our highest potential destiny without direction and guidance. The Lord gives us spiritual “road signs” which we should follow. Some signposts are:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p7" pid="pKEea31re0u3LOGgBkerBw" hash="1Ynhtw">First, be true. Stand up for the prophets and the scriptures. We want to be able to say, along with Nephi, “We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p8" pid="9YU6w4-ft0y-R1LelOWW_w" hash="MF0IOA">Second, keep the first of the Ten Commandments: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.3" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:3</a>). Through the choices and temptations of this world, we often lose sight of true values and turn our hearts to wealth, careers, hobbies, persons, honor, pride and, worst of all, to the gratification of our own ego.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p9" pid="VfHSVStg7k-6mBYilOmujw" hash="cFik0w">Third, distinguish between essence and appearance. God knows our heart, and He cannot be deceived. We might be able to fool the world at times, but we cannot fool God. We will never obtain the joy of loving and trusting relationships with our fellow beings unless they are based on honesty. The Psalmist David says of the Lord:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p10" pid="MVm1QL9-jU2FVzvczy7xYA" hash="SwrMFQ">“O Lord, thou hast … known me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p11" pid="JILZE5WebUK74MTFavhvYg" hash="kt9nZQ">“Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p12" pid="ZqtOMhrLTUW8isXJePa8lg" hash="Y4Vgtg">“There is not a word in my tongue, … thou knowest it altogether” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/139.1-2,4" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 139:1–2, 4</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p13" pid="Xa7NRe4HwUSazPijQA_Qwg" hash="C9VDxg">Fourth, rise above selfishness. This includes spiritual selfishness, when one looks toward personal edification and strengthening and has no other interest than one’s own salvation. To be blessed is not an end in itself; we must be a blessing to others. All people have a talent in one way or another to touch and inspire other people’s lives. Let us not only look inward and proudly say “All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:21</a>), but let us be a light unto a chaotic world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p14" pid="aBUIxZjuPkuwuCpbvR_u7Q" hash="FYQRSA">Are we able and capable of following such admonitions? How often have we made resolutions which we did not carry out? The only answer to these questions is to commit ourselves to serve the Lord and to meet His challenges. As Moroni wrote, the Lord’s grace is sufficient for all who humble themselves before Him. If we humble ourselves and have faith in Him, He will make our weaknesses into our strengths (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:27</a>). He will provide His strength to meet our challenges, and many things will take care of themselves. The Spirit of God strengthens us physically, spiritually, and emotionally. It is now up to us to choose the way! Caterina Di Genova, who died in the Middle Ages as a martyr and who inspired future generations, is believed to have said, “Once God possesses the will of a person, God will dwell within this person and will lead him to perfection.” To prevail in this world without God is difficult. Through God, however, all things are possible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p15" pid="Cslco2WjD0mvCs2_DoAeWg" hash="HzYc8g">Should we expect or ask for a reward for our efforts? The disciples asked Jesus about a reward. Instead of chastising them, He answered, “And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.29" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 19:29</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p16" pid="62VJ2xeHVk62iBkr0iO4aA" hash="4bscOg">The ills of today’s world and fleeting social peace are the result of past wrongdoings and disregard of godly principles. The spiritual strength of every new generation has its roots in parents’ and grandparents’ love for God and obedience to the gospel. As individuals and as a church, we must ask ourselves what we are contributing to our fellow beings. When Switzerland was in the process of political consolidation at the beginning of its new federation in 1862, the Swiss poet and novelist Gottfried Keller had questions similar to those of our time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p17" pid="7PeQpPXXYUiYBNaSdxJ00Q" hash="M_gB7g">“Have I and my house lived such that I am in a position to be of benefit to the whole and to contribute to the humble embellishment, not in the eyes of an ignorant world, but in the eyes of the highest judge? Then when we ask ourselves: how we fare today as a nation before nations and how we have held in trust the assets which have been given us, in that day we should not present ourselves in vain self-glory before the Lord of all nations, for He sees through all insufficiencies, understands how to distinguish between luck and honest efforts, and between substance and appearance.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/what-shall-we-do.p18" pid="KPM4xvqh80-l38QG3k2TMw" hash="vFhH4A">Let us search our hearts as we ask the question “What shall we do?” and follow the advice of Joshua: “Choose you this day whom ye will serve; … but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/24.15" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 24:15</a>).</p>

Many disciples followed him during these days. However, some of them were offended by Christ’s teachings and turned away from him. Upon their departure Christ asked his twelve disciples if they also wanted to leave him. Simon Peter answered Christ’s question by asking, “Lord, to whom shall we go?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.68" class="scriptureRef">John 6:68</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/lord-to-whom-shall-we-go.p2" pid="EwyUNx83hEOf8V9Ca-KBIg" hash="CKtT4A">This question is as relevant and urgent today as it was two thousand years ago. As Latter-day Saints we believe that Christ shows us the way and place to go and what we must do to find him. It is up to each of us to recognize Christ’s way and to follow it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/lord-to-whom-shall-we-go.p3" pid="BvF4xipSY0SGm-lBdFSIng" hash="LsdQ5g">A few months ago I had the privilege to hear a powerful testimony from a man searching for the truth. Through the gospel his eyes were opened to the eternal and he was able to redirect his life. At the same time I learned that a faithful member of the Church had distanced himself from the gospel and had changed his beliefs. Both men had tried with good intentions to find out to whom they should go but arrived at opposite conclusions and, therefore, went diverging paths. What can be the cause for such opposing actions?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/lord-to-whom-shall-we-go.p4" pid="pviX9U9_JUyjEgcRa_m53g" hash="s3y7JQ">I believe that words and actions are rooted in our thoughts and that our thoughts determine our deeds. Our daily decisions, planned or spontaneous, are the result of our thoughts, and we are responsible for them. Although we as individuals might think that we are and can act independently of God, we cannot escape the realization that we are subject to eternal laws. Our happiness and our peace in this life, as well as in the life after, depend on our readiness to base our thoughts and actions on God-given laws. True peace of mind and everlasting happiness come from being in harmony with God. If we are to be one with Deity, then it is we who must change—and not God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/lord-to-whom-shall-we-go.p5" pid="qG_fWMYnrkexDfO--a_B7g" hash="oYv01A">I believe that the two men chose different paths because their way of thinking and their understanding of God are different. It is essential to know God so that we can gain eternal blessings and salvation through living in accordance with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Gaining a knowledge of Christ and God is a prerequisite for a true understanding of our mission in life. Lowell L. Bennion writes in his book <span class="emphasis">Legacies of Jesus:</span> “One of the most important things we need to learn is what are the attributes of God. Christ came to earth to reveal to us the character of God. He is the revelation of God to human beings, teaching us by precept and example the meaning of faith, humility, integrity, and love” (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1990, p. 61).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/lord-to-whom-shall-we-go.p6" pid="zAvvLh7EqkeQUadAl7Peag" hash="u4ZTJA">We learn of God through Christ’s life; we know God through following Christ’s example. My dear brothers and sisters and friends and listeners, let us truly know our Savior and his Father. We should ask ourselves if our decisions are in accordance with the example of Christ, that we may follow in Christ’s footsteps. Let us not be deceived or dissuaded from Christ’s way, but let us reap the blessings of peace and eternal joy through following him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/lord-to-whom-shall-we-go.p7" pid="BGizG2rEGUeZ82T46THX_Q" hash="CAGGhA">Christ’s teachings, his example, and his perfection leave no question that he is the Son of God. He says of himself, “And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.11" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:11</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/lord-to-whom-shall-we-go.p8" pid="SiBxA6DNUkSRboWVPASt-w" hash="mMuGGQ">With that knowledge of him we are promised, as it is written in John, “And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which … believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.40" class="scriptureRef">John 6:40</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/lord-to-whom-shall-we-go.p9" pid="w_WKBfBKBUC_1tLDRBUw1w" hash="v-nBQA">In order to go the right direction in life and receive the blessings of the gospel, it is important first to be willing to accept the restored gospel in all its fulness. Christ said to Joseph Smith regarding the restoration of His gospel, “A light shall break forth … , and it shall be the fulness of my gospel” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:28</a>).</p>

Paul explained to the branch in Ephesus why authority was given and why we will be blessed when following the servants of the Lord. He wrote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/lord-to-whom-shall-we-go.p11" pid="ObRpJBQ160SSAmGMJTr8sA" hash="bgtqeg">“For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/10/lord-to-whom-shall-we-go.p12" pid="4Ww8BUN0yU-cNerty4xQ2Q" hash="G2JLDQ">“Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.12-13" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:12–13</a>).</p>

We are at times tempted to place less importance on the teachings of Christ in our lives for the sake of convenience, or we let external circumstances pollute our faith. In order to escape seductive influences that take us away from Christ, he commands us, “That thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:9</a>).</p>

I therefore ask everyone this day, “To whom shall we go?” Let us decide to follow Christ and be his true disciples, not offended by his message of truth but rejoicing in it. I know no other way or place where we can go, and thus add my testimony to the one of Simon Peter when he said to Christ:</p>

They are real. Jesus is risen. He is our Christ and Savior. He is the Son of the living God. This knowledge is my faith, my testimony, and my life. I pray that we all may come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and act accordingly with a pure heart, with hope, and with charity. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
