      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p1" pid="7Qh3UqiNXE-4bYqmyGrDyA" hash="wo1tBg">One Sunday morning, more than a year ago, we awoke to a beautiful day in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. The Caribbean sun was shining, and the sky was clear. A gentle breeze was blowing, barely ruffling the leaves on the trees; it was warm and peaceful and still. But far out to sea, beyond the reach of our physical senses that day, the deadly destroyer was coming our way, implacable and irresistible. The Hurricane Center, with responsibility to track and predict the path of Hurricane Georges, was constantly updating the information available on the Internet. In the peaceful, placid quiet of that morning, by virtue of those seeing eyes in the sky, I saw the predicted path of the storm, aimed like an arrow at the heart of Santo Domingo.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p2" pid="LUhqHMmL_kGnIwWyyY5YxA" hash="vIgi5g">Within 48 hours the storm struck the island with intense and insensate fury, leaving in its path destruction, desolation, and death. The raw, elemental power of nature was astonishing. From the relative safety of our house, we saw trees doubled over by the force of the wind, which alternately shrieked and howled and roared; the punishing power of that wind drove rain into the house around the window frames, and the surging three-foot river of water in the street outside, brought about by the intense rain, finally crested and began to subside when it was within an inch of coming into our house.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p3" pid="HGX_TqWSK0OYdEuj0z051A" hash="3JgaSA">Around the area where we lived, most of the trees were either uprooted or split by the fierce winds. Trees, branches, power lines, and telephone poles were down all over town. Streets were blocked, traffic was difficult, and power was cut off for more than a week. Although the damage was great, it would have been much greater but for the warnings from those who track and predict and counsel people to be prepared. Virtually all of those who were adequately prepared came through the hurricane relatively unscathed. I am grateful to those men and women who devote time and attention to track and monitor those storms. Their timely warnings and counsel save lives and protect people. Those who disregard the warnings pay the price of willful failure to listen to those guardians whose calling it is to watch and warn and save.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p4" pid="dil4BQsghkGeULc3Ckoa3A" hash="VLh-8w">Great as the damage and destruction and death from these awesome phenomena of physical force can be, there is even more desolation caused in people’s lives by spiritual hurricanes. These furious forces often cause far more devastating damage than physical cyclones, because they destroy our souls and rob us of our eternal perspective and promise. When the physical storm has passed, we can begin to put our lives and houses back in order. But some spiritual hurricanes sweep us into chaos, and we are encompassed and imprisoned by the shackles of powerful and ruinous influences whose consequences we can only dimly perceive at the time. Like those swirling cyclones, spiritual hurricanes can be virtually unnoticed until they are almost upon us, but they also can strike with intense and insensate fury.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p5" pid="QyUxzoEG5UCMhlqF0kwtHw" hash="JUvweg">We place ourselves in the path of these spiritual hurricanes when we indulge in anger, alcohol, and abuse; lust and licentiousness; promiscuity and pornography; drugs, pride, greed, violence, envy, and lies—the list is long. Perhaps, for a time, life seems to go on as before, and in that dormant period there is no hint of the terrible retribution to come, and then we are suddenly in the grip of their satanic power, and they lay waste our lives, bringing anguish and agony, depression, despair, and desolation. Too many times they also bring sadness, sorrow, suffering, and heartache to our loved ones. In the aftermath of their destructive path, it is often more difficult to restore a spiritually shattered soul than it is to rebuild a ruined city. There are whirling winds of malevolence, malice, and evil on the move in society today, and they will not spare those who wander into their path.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p6" pid="JgagjJb7Y0-4ViDJLN9M9g" hash="kHUAhA">But we also have our spiritual hurricane guardians, those whose calling it is to watch and warn, helping us avoid spiritual damage, destruction, and even death. Our watchmen on the tower are known to us as apostles and prophets. They are our spiritual eyes in the sky, and they know, through inspiration and insight and pure intelligence, the course these storms may take. They continue to raise their voices in warning to tell us of the tragic consequences of willful and wanton violations of the Lord’s commandments. To intentionally ignore their warnings is to court misery, sorrow, and ruin. To follow them is to follow the chosen servants of the Lord into spiritual pastures of peace and plenty.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p7" pid="BXFya3zZoEyepAFf7ByCLQ" hash="Hc2xkQ">From this pulpit they have counseled us about the cyclones in our society and civilization. They have warned us about evil in its many forms and guises and called us, again and again, to return to the ways of the Lord. There are times when we may not wish to hear what they say. There are times when we may refuse to believe that the hurricane will come; but in its own time, come it will, for those who sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/hosea/8.7" class="scriptureRef">Hosea 8:7</a>). The Lord knew this, and there is perhaps no more poignant moment in scripture than when the Lord, looking over Jerusalem, speaks with longing and love and sorrow, “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, … how often I would have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/13.34" class="scriptureRef">Luke 13:34</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p8" pid="nJucuHWCV024NaGt65Cyxg" hash="AY6paA">There is peace and tranquillity, there is solace and safety in His gospel. If we will but listen to those whose calling it is to watch and warn, if we will give heed to the words of the Master Himself, then our spiritual house will stand firm, and we can let the rain descend and the floods come and the winds blow and beat upon our house, because we are founded upon that rock (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.24-25" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:24–25</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p9" pid="1t3-g5RVPEWoHg98sUPwyg" hash="HSUCMg">The Lord has said, “And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:4</a>). He also said, “Whether by mine own voice, or by the voice of my servants, it is the same” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:38</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p10" pid="UvdFIncFgUagAhhXyjrPkQ" hash="aeyWiQ">I bear witness that there is a God in heaven, the framer of heaven and earth and all things that in them are. I bear witness that He has a plan for us, His children. I bear witness that in fulfillment of that plan His Son, Jesus Christ, came to earth to take upon Him the sins of the world and make it possible for us to be freed from the terrible consequences of sin and evil. He is our Savior and Redeemer, and, as it was for Jerusalem, His arms are outstretched towards us. He will be our shield and our protector, and we will have peace in the midst of storm and refuge from the raging wind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/spiritual-hurricanes.p11" pid="_v5ntiyLrkGGqWHhVIThAQ" hash="Isfekw">May we ever listen to those whose calling it is to watch and warn, to see and save. May we walk in the ways of the Lord and be preserved in paths of peace, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We saw two performances, because our daughter Carolyn was playing the part of one of the three witches in that play. Of course, we were delighted to see her in the play and even more delighted when, at a dramatic moment, she said those famous lines: “By the pricking of my thumbs, / Something wicked this way comes” (act 4, scene 1, lines 40–41).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p2" uuid="1a453e59-f075-46cb-b4ba-3655df346161" pid="EEBUqW64gEamHMpztrhdRg" hash="DWOD2g">When I heard that, I thought how useful it would be to have an early-warning system which would tell us about the approach of evil and allow us to be prepared for it. Evil is coming toward us, whether or not we have an early-warning system.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p3" uuid="24a6460c-361c-40a9-8de2-e3271b0d6070" pid="uCVU1FdprkK9mDTAi003sQ" hash="4ppl6A">On a later occasion, my wife and I were driving cross-country one night and were approaching a great city. As we came over the hills and saw the bright lights on the horizon, I nudged my wife awake and said, “Behold the city of Babylon!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p4" uuid="b8acdcca-93e7-4a2d-935d-75138748dd74" pid="VVj6-XqIj0CQhJPlL_qMAw" hash="FKPfqg">Of course, there is no particular city today which personifies Babylon. Babylon was, in the time of ancient Israel, a city which had become sensual, decadent, and corrupt. The principal building in the city was a temple to a false god, which we often refer to as Bel or Baal.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p5" uuid="0822797a-220d-41bb-b720-9291a4104b08" pid="YOi0-RlEDU2d-a6kP1jjFg" hash="RpuvKg">However, that sensuality, corruption, and decadence, and the worshipping of false gods are to be seen in many cities, great and small, scattered across the globe. As the Lord has said: “They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p6" uuid="9a9869b2-9263-423e-8b22-6d84d4d13ebf" pid="jrI1D45HCk6cuXOFnBvyWg" hash="DQbQsQ">Too many of the people of the world have come to resemble the Babylon of old by walking in their own ways, and following a god “whose image is in the likeness of the world.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p7" uuid="0a9cd5c0-1339-48f5-8392-2bb65ba119cb" pid="ycQLaz-7pUmWOK7ONrTdqA" hash="3SnSzg">One of the greatest challenges we will face is to be able to live in that world but somehow not be of that world. We have to create Zion in the midst of Babylon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p8" uuid="2de03d25-130d-45f9-b110-cb85dbff94fa" pid="V6eUXi5XGUeX1sNlKZamEw" hash="fwWsiA">“Zion in the midst of Babylon.” What a luminous and incandescent phrase, as a light shining in the midst of spiritual darkness. What a concept to hold close to our hearts, as we see Babylon becoming more widespread. We see Babylon in our cities; we see Babylon in our communities; we see Babylon everywhere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p9" uuid="76beb716-8b4c-43a8-b218-aedb6cfbba54" pid="L0T4DzFWgkWtNXFKOosUFQ" hash="NEKXVA">And with the encroachment of Babylon, we have to create Zion in the midst of it. We should not allow ourselves to be engulfed by the culture which surrounds us. We seldom realize the extent to which we are a product of the culture of our place and time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p10" uuid="c367f85b-41f5-4e8d-9f9d-20686a66cfca" pid="Yl1NZLnr-UaqV2Nlkt-vYg" hash="tzq7nw">During the days of ancient Israel, the people of the Lord were an island of the one true God, surrounded by an ocean of idolatry. The waves of that ocean crashed incessantly upon the shores of Israel. Despite the commandment to make no graven image and bow down before it, Israel seemingly could not help itself, influenced by the culture of the place and time. Over and over again—despite the prohibition of the Lord, despite what prophet and priest had said—Israel went seeking after strange gods and bowed down before them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p11" uuid="c713b44a-5f38-4391-b03c-86fa5f41e174" pid="f5Otx1om_UmVTURPvIWJtQ" hash="92cLsg">How could Israel have forgotten the Lord, who brought them out of Egypt? They were constantly pressured by what was popular in the ambience in which they lived.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p12" uuid="ecefd79d-07cc-46aa-9933-dea6243b38b0" pid="7jqk2Za_HketV4v2zdqqhw" hash="dkzsrQ">What an insidious thing is this culture amidst which we live. It permeates our environment, and we think we are being reasonable and logical when, all too often, we have been molded by the ethos, what the Germans call the zeitgeist, or the culture of our place and time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p13" uuid="c12e8119-e341-460f-b9d2-986cfc6f8b36" pid="b9qeb_uNEEirL78kPj3qsA" hash="xFPOhA">Because my wife and I have had the opportunity to live in 10 different countries, we have seen the effect of the ethos on behavior. Customs which are perfectly acceptable in one culture are viewed as unacceptable in another; language which is polite in some places is viewed as abhorrent in others. People in every culture move within a cocoon of self-satisfied self-deception, fully convinced that the way they see things is the way things really are.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p14" uuid="99408deb-4748-48dd-a46c-e6fc8638bbbd" pid="BBmx0tOgD0izX8V8OPLKgQ" hash="6PltUw">Our culture tends to determine what foods we like, how we dress, what constitutes polite behavior, what sports we should follow, what our taste in music should be, the importance of education, and our attitudes toward honesty. It also influences men as to the importance of recreation or religion, influences women about the priority of career or childbearing, and has a powerful effect on how we approach procreation and moral issues. All too often, we are like puppets on a string, as our culture determines what is “cool.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p15" uuid="0fcbab7a-2de1-4aab-b74d-a553dfd1aca0" pid="Ltc0MisXP0GX8MdBF8kmMg" hash="bhZhuA">There is, of course, a zeitgeist to which we should pay attention, and that is the ethos of the Lord, the culture of the people of God. As Peter states it, “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 2:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p16" uuid="ee70c216-188e-4fb2-af5e-5627bf80d5e9" pid="mmGpyZkR302g3aihOtw8Cw" hash="bLQgng">It is the ethos of those who keep the Lord’s commandments, walk in His ways, and “live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.44" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:44</a>). If that makes us peculiar, so be it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p17" uuid="3f9d93fc-12fb-4cd1-be51-dd1f5d08cd9e" pid="3kLNHrX7TUmRW8SJbb_-Pg" hash="5ojmCw">My involvement with the building of the Manhattan temple gave me the opportunity to be in the temple quite often prior to the dedication. It was wonderful to sit in the celestial room and be there in perfect silence, without a single sound to be heard coming from the busy New York streets outside. How was it possible that the temple could be so reverently silent when the hustle and bustle of the metropolis was just a few yards away?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p18" uuid="8d6ea45f-197f-41cd-a4bb-35a5be443481" pid="_A49fz2AWES1xmh6Clsczw" hash="t5QswQ">The answer was in the construction of the temple. The temple was built within the walls of an existing building, and the inner walls of the temple were connected to the outer walls at only a very few junction points. That is how the temple (Zion) limited the effects of Babylon, or the world outside.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p19" uuid="8d207273-3773-4229-9192-faad2ad752e1" pid="WYeWrKhe1k-Xz2QNaU9XiQ" hash="CcvAUA">There may be a lesson here for us. We can create the real Zion among us by limiting the extent to which Babylon will influence our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p20" uuid="bd48121b-3b33-4773-bca5-111d68674ec6" pid="D1-T-g5rU0eEnRf1CR9Tiw" hash="qGJp7g">When, about 600 years <small>B.C.</small>, Nebuchadnezzar came from Babylon and conquered Judah, he carried away the people of the Lord. Nebuchadnezzar selected some of the young men for special education and training.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p21" uuid="274fa258-5ee6-4980-a3fe-55859505f2ee" pid="tyGsecpY3Uq8Kesb8498QQ" hash="PuzUvg">Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. They were to be the favored ones among the young people brought to Babylon. The king’s servant instructed them that they were to eat of the king’s meat and drink of the king’s wine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/zion-in-the-midst-of-babylon.p22" uuid="33fafe46-2bf1-4c87-b5b5-f1497c3d4daa" pid="A_ySKaF90kq8pVwpL2oBsA" hash="N53hjA">Let us clearly understand the pressures that the four young men were under. They had been carried away as captives by a conquering power and were in the household of a king who held the power of life or death over them. And yet Daniel and his brothers refused to do that which they believed to be wrong, however much the Babylonian culture believed it to be right. And for that fidelity and courage, the Lord blessed them and “gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/1.17" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 1:17</a>).</p>

Indeed, as the poet Wordsworth said: “The world is too much with us” (“The World Is Too Much with Us; Late and Soon,” in <span class="emphasis">The Complete Poetical Works of William Wordsworth</span> [1924], 353). In his first epistle, John writes:</p>

We can create Zion in the midst of Babylon. We can have our own standards for music and literature and dance and film and language. We can have our own standards for dress and deportment, for politeness and respect. We can live in accordance with the Lord’s moral laws. We can limit how much of Babylon we allow into our homes by the media of communication.</p>

Will it be hard? Of course it will, for the waves of Babylonian culture crash incessantly against our shores. Will it take courage? Of course it will.</p>

Courage is the basis and foundation for all of our other virtues; the lack of courage diminishes every other virtue that we have. If we are to have Zion in the midst of Babylon, we will need courage.</p>

I know I did, as a boy. I imagined that someone was in peril and that, at the risk of my own life, I saved him. Or in some dangerous confrontation with a fearsome opponent, I had the courage to overcome. Such are our youthful imaginations!</p>

No photographer is there to record the heroism, no journalist will splash it across the newspaper’s front page. Just in the quiet contemplation of our conscience, we will know that we faced the test of courage: Zion or Babylon?</p>
