      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p2" pid="hVtWg2F7F0mQ1YOQGAWRrw" hash="xHW_TQ">There is no single word that better characterizes the life and mission of the Savior than the word<span class="emphasis"> love.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p3" pid="a0rAiFQlN0WuPMlqOcAQFg" hash="5clK8A">The Savior’s mission was begun out of love which the Father had for His children. In John we read, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p4" pid="H2VEoRzAU06QhS1nvj-4Vw" hash="6F8GYg">Thus, the greatest mission in the history of the world was ordained and begun because of the love of our kind and caring Eternal Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p5" pid="hPaizSZ4xEuwSIjTOSsjkQ" hash="UPyZ2A">You will recall that the Pharisees, in their effort to ensnare the Master, had the lawyer put the question to him: “Master, which is the great commandment in the law?” (I wish it had been someone other than a lawyer who had asked that question, but there is some comfort in the fact that the Pharisees put him up to it.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p6" pid="r6olJpOGokGJvftbIO0Zow" hash="9_S9Wg">You will remember the response:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p7" pid="qaODFIni00GbcMa2L9puqw" hash="4zjMZQ">“Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p10" pid="F9x_hTwIbkK7U3PGRADxnA" hash="cy2Dnw">“On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.36-40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:36–40</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p11" pid="UaoZiAPz6U-4csUxbIPTQA" hash="By2pRg">Elder James E. Talmage has commented that these two commandments “are so closely related as to be virtually one: … ‘Thou shalt love.’ He who abideth one of the two will abide both; for without love for our fellows, it is impossible to please God.” (<span class="emphasis">Articles of Faith,</span> 12th ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1968, p. 431.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p13" pid="i2jff8SKFEmO4fKiT41Zrw" hash="tQMgBQ">As a church, we are fortunate to be able to show love and render service in an organized way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p14" pid="11ebaejxWEm7u1XmZPVSEw" hash="66yV3A">Our missionary program is an expression of love for our neighbors as we share the message of the gospel. It is out of love and concern for others that our missionaries spend up to two years, largely at their own expense, living in all parts of the world. Many experience hardship, deprivations, and danger as they share the blessings of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p15" pid="qDSXZ9gWM06apAhXQZGLjA" hash="A6a4nQ">Our tithes and offerings, when given with the right spirit, are an expression of love and concern that we have for the Lord’s work and for those in need of material assistance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p16" pid="ciivzVxIU0yH8lTUkHPU8A" hash="Y5NS8g">The brotherhood and warmth of our priesthood quorums, Relief Society, and youth organizations are available to all who will “come unto Christ, and be perfected in him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p17" pid="CbsoN4r6Dkm0LijdbCZHFA" hash="pL6v9A">Countless thousands of hours are spent in meaningful Christian service by bishops, stake presidents, Relief Society presidents, home teachers, nursery leaders, and all who have accepted callings to do their part. They render this service not just out of a sense of duty, but out of genuine love for those they serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p18" pid="SegQ3vxh20mnuLAQdyA88g" hash="ZyUyVg">But for all of the good that is being accomplished, much remains to be done. Perhaps the greatest opportunity for improvement is in our individual relationships with one another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p19" pid="ckuwC6LrYkazCXcoJi5SXQ" hash="LJ8JXg">As the Savior was closing His ministry in preparation for the sacrifice that was to be the greatest of all gifts of love, He gave the powerful admonition, “Love one another; as I have loved you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.34" class="scriptureRef">John 13:34</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p20" pid="H6xQt4EoX0OZtFfJitbTXw" hash="_Vhf4w">May I offer four suggestions to help focus on principles that will make us kinder, gentler, more harmonious, and loving persons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p21" pid="upsS6-ulgEyXvRAwRuvJnA" hash="l79PBg">First, be considerate. Be sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of others, always careful not to demean or belittle by either word or act. Be encouraging, uplifting, careful not to break down a person’s confidence. It was my experience even in the legal profession—combative as it can sometimes be—that there was still much room to show consideration and respect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p22" pid="PGJIvT9xAkafbl6TVuYKdQ" hash="azS7ag">Second, be complimentary. Look for attributes and acts of others that you can be genuinely complimentary of. Everyone is lifted by sincere and deserved commendation. Third, be charitable. The prophet Moroni counsels us with respect to the need for charity: “For if he have not charity he is nothing.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.44" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:44</a>.) In his epistle to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul sums up the importance of charity in that familiar verse: “Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.1" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13:1</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p23" pid="UcO4c2uglkajShTp1FH2dg" hash="mY7GzQ">What does it mean to be charitable? Charity is the opposite of selfishness. It means being generous and giving of both one’s means and one’s time in the service of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p24" pid="M6vOMj1MG0uXFpgY9Z0HvA" hash="sWTGow">We should have an element of sacrifice in our offerings and in the consecration of our time. We should strive to lift those within our reach who are forlorn or who despair. We should take a special interest in the youth around us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p25" pid="k9e3DlPcQUuggbuGZ177Dg" hash="V8TKwg">“Charity is the pure love of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p26" pid="C2wKdPViDUm6UBzV4ziO_g" hash="0D0VkA">Fourth, be grateful. If we would show our love to our Heavenly Father, we would be grateful. We would show our gratitude by the way we live, not just by what we say or profess.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p27" pid="Q_XBOuzhS0asE561I1yVtQ" hash="oJyReQ">It has been said that the sin of ingratitude is more serious than the sin of revenge. With revenge, we return evil for evil, but with ingratitude, we return evil for good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p28" pid="NIO0lgbFnEGXl1CJ1Mw35g" hash="aa8Vyw">Years ago, when it was the practice to hold baccalaureate services at graduation time, President Harold B. Lee related a story to a group of college graduates that has always stayed with me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p29" pid="NpaTNcLvZ0eMCH3KLnh2uA" hash="momwnQ">He told of a woman who was widowed early in life and left with several children to support and care for. Money was scarce. The children had to work hard to supplement the meager amounts that the mother was able to earn doing washings and cleaning houses.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p30" pid="RXEvxWwj9EuCDMTG7t-uxg" hash="udPl5w">But as the children took top academic honors and went on to notable achievements in the community and business world, the family attracted the attention of the local newspaper. A reporter was sent to the home to interview this remarkable mother who, by now, was somewhat stooped and gray.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p31" pid="80BHlBbYhU-0CG_Vt2MGyw" hash="zsMitQ">Several questions were asked by the reporter in an attempt to learn the secret of her success. She had accomplished so much with so little.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p32" pid="cT-88W6XwEuCIKTFwyqrrQ" hash="BipShw">The reporter asked his final question: “With such a wonderful family of children, which one did you love the most?” With a tear softly moistening her eye she replied:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p33" pid="nf_MZ59lR0u134ZScdQPQw" hash="Wbm4wQ">“I loved most the one who was sick until she was better.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p37" pid="Itqb6U5j4UWeWMC7udlDZg" hash="BmYjHA">In closing, may I quote from Solomon Bennett Freehof:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p38" pid="MqQhbrLfWk6uWtKpj2Kohw" hash="pwCR3Q">“Years ago I preferred clever people. There was a joy in beholding … a mind … bearing thoughts quickly translated into words, or ideas expressed in a new way. I find now my taste has changed. Verbal fireworks often bore me. They seem motivated by self-assertion and self-display. I now prefer another type of person; one who is considerate, understanding of others, careful not to break down another person’s self-respect. … My preferred person today is one who is always aware of the needs of others, or their pain and [their] fear and [their] unhappiness, and their search for self-respect. … I once liked clever people. Now I like good people.” (Richard L. Evans, <span class="emphasis">Richard Evans’ Quote Book,</span> Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1971, p. 166.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/love.p39" pid="suC-lF9YIESgOQLBsMJPAg" hash="mapJyA">May we all strive more diligently to show our love of the Lord by the way we emulate Christlike love in our relationships with others, that we may lay claim to the “crown of life” referred to by James, “which the Lord hath promised to them that love him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.12" class="scriptureRef">James 1:12</a>), I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p1" pid="LiKHe2KZuUiBgS8FyW9BXg" hash="z8GJoA">From the beginning of recorded history, mankind has been constantly searching for happiness. I believe it’s fair to say that most of us are influenced greatly in our daily lives by what we perceive will result in happiness or joy for ourselves, as well as for others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p2" pid="sSOL6t_A2kKVwcomnEt71w" hash="KzOeZA">I submit this is certainly a laudable pursuit. The Lord has said, “Men are, that they might have joy” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.25" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:25</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p3" pid="UZPYNr-IyEqHDte4s5j7hg" hash="0WwTng">The founding fathers of our nation considered happiness to be of such importance that it was ranked with life and liberty. I refer to the Declaration of Independence:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p4" pid="H2pqUtIxbkmi4hYGnQJYxQ" hash="aPFBuQ">“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p5" pid="LlByXUZT6UytRg3GRB8NNQ" hash="Rjd0IA">What is happiness? Where do we find it? How do we obtain it? I remember reading the results some time ago of a national survey which attempted to summarize the responses as to what brings happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p6" pid="xHbVkWMS3UiQVvR6HZiBbw" hash="O4Iugg">While I don’t remember all the details of that survey, I do remember that most people felt money was a significant part of happiness. The author’s research, however, indicated that money alone seldom, if ever, resulted in true happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p7" pid="lEdnxlvENEuI2r7hC-NGbw" hash="TXihAQ">Two thoughts come to mind here. I recall a talk given by President David O. McKay. He made reference to a statement by John D. Rockefeller—then one of the world’s richest men—who apparently had stomach trouble and had purportedly said, “I would rather be able to enjoy a good meal than have a million dollars.” Then with a wink of the eye, President McKay remarked, “Of course, he had a million dollars when he said that.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p8" pid="HHWydmGvH02Ws6mF61VbSQ" hash="tLiGNQ">I readily concede that it’s important to have sufficient money for our needs, but beyond that, money has little to do with true happiness. Often it is the work and sacrifice one experiences in obtaining money for a worthwhile purpose that produces the most satisfaction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p9" pid="_I4PxxHU-U2AmpH0LU2akw" hash="mST3cQ">In my father’s personal history, he tells about Grandmother’s experiences growing up in Brigham City, Utah, in the late 1800s. Their family was very poor, having emigrated from Denmark with little more than the clothes on their backs. She wanted so much to have a pair of shoes she could wear on special occasions. To accomplish this worthy desire took a full summer’s work of picking berries and tending children, since money was very scarce and labor was cheap. But the joy Grandmother felt as she obtained those shoes is indescribable, for not only was she able to wear them, but her mother did also. In fact, they had it arranged so Grandmother would wear the shoes to Sunday School in the morning, and then her mother would wear them to sacrament meeting in the evening.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p10" pid="K-Tu0ofHtE-yK0glbe54Jw" hash="UgbxiA">The words of William George Jordan are instructive here:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p11" pid="K6Q3vpiVsUGd9X3tFAeqag" hash="TR6Kag">“Happiness does not always require success, prosperity or attainment. It is often the joy of hopeful struggle, consecration of purpose and energy to some good end. Real happiness ever has its root in unselfishness—its blossom in love of some kind” (<span class="emphasis">The Crown of Individuality,</span> 2d ed., New York: Fleming H. Revell Co., 1909, pp. 78–79).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p12" pid="zhS5NLz95keTdYMFb8RxCw" hash="eNZatg">One of the most critical challenges mankind faces today is to recognize the difference between happiness and mere pleasure. Satan and his forces have become extremely effective in their effort to convince people that pleasure should be the most sought-after objective. He slyly promises that wherever found, pleasure will bring happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p13" pid="e4UEpYSiWE2PWi9HS_orsA" hash="-_mjLA">Our television and movie screens are filled with not-so-subtle messages that encourage and persuade young and old alike to unbridle their passions and they will experience happiness. The results of this reckless course should be so apparent as we watch the tremendous social and psychological costs continue to mount. The increasing incidence of teenage pregnancy, abortion, rape, child molestation, sexual harassment, assault, drug addiction, disease, alcoholism, and broken homes are all influenced by this persuasion. And the alarming statistics continue to testify, but with little if any effect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p14" pid="z1S3Np4Fx02lKM1czB1xZA" hash="kjMpKw">Some years ago Elder James E. Talmage so aptly described what is taking place that it’s almost as if he were writing for our day. I quote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p15" pid="CRLaVuLpMkSrGr2ejedEnw" hash="FQoA2Q">“The present is an age of pleasure-seeking, and men are losing their sanity in the mad rush for sensations that do but excite and disappoint. In this day of counterfeits, adulterations, and base imitations, the devil is busier than he has ever been in the course of human history, in the manufacture of pleasures, both old and new; and these he offers for sale in most attractive fashion, falsely labeled, ‘<span class="emphasis">Happiness.</span>’ In this soul-destroying craft he is without peer; he has had centuries of experience and practice, and by his skill he controls the market. He has learned the tricks of the trade, and knows well how to catch the eye and arouse the desire of his customers. He puts up the stuff in bright-colored packages, tied with tinsel string and tassel; and crowds flock to his bargain counters, hustling and crushing one another in their frenzy to buy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p16" pid="GFmPvoo_7EKN2_wb6AkFbA" hash="i3rt0g">“Follow one of the purchasers as he goes off gloatingly with his gaudy packet, and watch him as he opens it. What finds he inside the gilded wrapping?

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/the-search-for-happiness.p17" pid="sEvNh3kFyEiBcSn5PO9f0g" hash="YbXa-g">How significant that Elder Talmage, writing several years ago, could so eloquently capture the conditions of this age in a way that it is perhaps even more descriptive today than it was then. Some may propose we take comfort from hearing the concerns of yesteryear and reason that things were as bad then as they are now. I choose not to regard it in that light. I suggest Elder Talmage’s words should have served as a warning from which we could have learned much more than we did as a nation.</p>

Of course you would immediately offer aid in both cases. Failure to do so would be irresponsible.</p>

You young men bring with you the special, vibrant, enthusiastic spirit of the youth of our time. So I would like to direct my remarks to you for the next few minutes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p8" pid="1HDPaFjSlkqKxIVPi9RWKg" hash="nTS16w">First, an experience that I had as a youth which helped to teach me an important lesson. It occurred when I was quite young—to be more specific, a boy of 10 or 11. I was herding our flock of sheep in the mountains of northern Utah to the east of East Garland. My grandfather had entrusted me with the sheep as we were moving them up the mountain to the summer range. I had just watered them in a small mountain stream and bedded them down for a short rest before going on.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p9" pid="RKg9hrSjbkSbDD902RUd5A" hash="1HLd9w">While they were settled, I went about to explore the terrain and check the route ahead. I was a couple of hundred yards up the canyon when I heard a sound that chilled me to the bone. Once you have heard a rattlesnake, a very poisonous reptile, you’ll never forget the sound.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p10" pid="4XQrc-w19UqLdW6k5yDwcA" hash="HeGh7A">Cautiously, I moved toward that sound. To my surprise I observed not one but three rattlers just a few yards away. They were on a rocky knoll that had been warmed by the spring sun. While the sight of three rattlers in a bunch intrigued me, because you seldom see more than one at a time, it also concerned me since the sheep would need to pass this way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p11" pid="ilaNDzui8UGAYLAv3q4pow" hash="UkXGYA">Before long the sheep roused and started moving up the canyon. As they came closer, the snakes seemed to sense the intruders and slithered down the incline toward the creek.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p12" pid="8jRTJwGbPkC0-EeIjOXBJw" hash="_JbRPg">Fearing the danger, I immediately turned my sheep up the hill away from the direction the snakes were moving. I was successful for a time, but then a couple of sheep broke away from the flock. As they did so, the entire flock seemed determined to follow those two errant old ewes, and there was no stopping them. You may have heard the characterization, “They all followed like a bunch of sheep.” Well, that’s what happened here. To make matters worse, they were moving directly toward the location of the rattlers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p13" pid="I5xLDbsJYEigyqtXuMaUew" hash="PUe6hA">I had hoped that the natural instinct of the sheep would keep them at a safe distance. But some of the flock were pushed directly into the path of the snakes. And there was no escape for the unfortunate ones that sustained the strikes of those disturbed reptiles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p14" pid="1mT4YreoO0GjOhAtwYZIhQ" hash="8OO_uw">It was a sad young shepherd who had to report to his grandfather a short time later the loss of two of his prized ewes. The experience of that day provided a very forceful illustration to me of what can happen when the sheep ignore their shepherd.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p15" pid="la2DFoBkRkmzQZS8pnzaug" hash="k9MfCg">I was there as the shepherd. I perceived the danger and was trying my best to protect my sheep. But as a few started to go in the wrong direction, others were determined to follow. Though only two of the flock were lost, it was a loss that need not have been.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p16" pid="Wau19SfIJUGw-8eQ5Ta9NA" hash="Li8zxg">Unfortunately, in life we all too often see the results of those who ignore the attempts of spiritual shepherds to guide their paths past hazards and dangers that may be unperceived at the time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p17" pid="-gOr_A42gEe65FB34tDsWA" hash="mzSaug">Parents, bishops, grandparents, Scoutmasters, advisers, and genuine friends often can provide spiritual shepherding. Note that I refer to genuine friends in the category of spiritual shepherds. Notice also that I did not include peers in that group. I readily acknowledge that peers in some cases can be and are an influence for good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p18" pid="z6AZG9P3r0it3XkImuFDDQ" hash="SIs_3g">A genuine friend who has another’s best interest at heart may often be the one who encourages or provides the strength in a weak moment to prevent that person from making a serious mistake. In so doing, he or she helps prevent the sorrow and sadness, the embarrassment, and loss of self-respect that nearly always accompany sin. But unfortunately, so many times there are situations where peer influence has a definite negative effect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p19" pid="JqGnKWxyJUGEvM9pZcJzTg" hash="NeDK1A">We read and hear of so many surveys and interviews where youth disclose that it was the influence and pressure of peers that led them to immoral and foolish behavior. Satan knows this. He is an expert at deceit. I suppose he should be; he’s had plenty of practice. He is aware of the tremendous influence a group of peers can have on an individual.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p20" pid="axY1ndXDw0SHj9I3ePhIpA" hash="GmgP-Q">There is a compelling desire to belong—to be one of the group. If he can get just one person to influence others to choose the wrong way for whatever reason, Satan wins. Often the easiest and simplest nudging is that “everyone is doing it” or “it’s the cool thing” or “how do you know it’s bad if you haven’t tried it?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p21" pid="ljNdtVXk-USwdAC448EpkA" hash="ZtA_sw">Don’t be deceived. Don’t be influenced with this kind of enticement. Keep your eyes above the crowd. Be your own person. You have been taught correct principles. Stick with those principles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p22" pid="TJIqkGFPtE6okKKuHrubdg" hash="3i4k6A">There is no neutral area between good and evil. If you are on the devil’s turf, get off it as fast as you can. As strong as Nephi was, I can’t forget his humble prayer: “O Lord, wilt thou … make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.31" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:31</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p23" pid="QAhzOkAwgEyzVAgH1yBKQw" hash="1sycYg">Some foolishly try and justify conduct they know is wrong with, “It’s such a little sin; it won’t matter.” While it may be true that the particular conduct is not at the top of the scale, the more dangerous part is the road that it puts you on. “Little wrongs” just seem to have a way of leading into “bigger wrongs.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p24" pid="gm_ztbhsX0u3JCKEnqQs0g" hash="OZAHCw">The words of the American clergyman Harry Emerson Fosdick provide further instruction here: “The tragic evils of our life are so commonly unintentional. We did not start out for that poor, cheap goal. That aim was not in our minds at all. … Look to the road you are walking on! He who picks up one end of a stick picks up the other. He who chooses the beginning of a road chooses the place it leads to” (<span class="emphasis">Living under Tension</span> [1941], 110–11).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p25" pid="b7AxRGwQQ0aKC1j8UOH5dQ" hash="5akv1g">Now, my young brethren, you know what is right. You have been taught well. You have the Holy Ghost. Your challenge is to remain strong and faithful. Keep your bodies and minds clean and pure. Make the decision early to get on the right road and then stay there. Your Heavenly Father loves you. He has confidence in you. He wants you to be happy. He has provided a pattern for you to follow (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/52.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 52:14</a>). That pattern is the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/spiritual-shepherds.p26" pid="yONZNao8UUCpDOVByvaQFA" hash="fa7pSQ">One of the greatest blessings of this dispensation is the presence of living prophets to provide direction and guidance.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p2" pid="QPiXtiZsM0SwnmrL9QCQ_Q" hash="DRSxig">In the New Testament, the Savior made clear the seriousness of anyone causing harm or offending “these little ones.” As recorded in Matthew, “It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p3" pid="aVUyKk2s2kqSRefbfqCU2g" hash="_m3SNg">One of the most touching scenes recorded in the Book of Mormon—which is another testament of Jesus Christ—occurred when the resurrected Lord appeared to the Nephite people who inhabited the Western Hemisphere at the time of the Savior. During that appearance, He ministered so tenderly to the little children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p4" pid="2baKjzEWXEyvNY0dDijh8g" hash="Jf5W4Q">We read how, as He stood in the midst of the multitude, He called upon the people to bring forth their little children, and He knelt among them and prayed to the Father for them. The words that He spoke were so sacred that they could not be written. He wept, and He took the children one by one and blessed them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p5" pid="LLknvhOZFEa4Hi2Qk92mnA" hash="Um2pFg">As the multitude looked heavenward, they saw the heavens open—angels appeared and descended. The children were encircled by fire, and angels ministered to them. As we acknowledge the love the Lord has for little children, it is not surprising that those who represent the Lord on the earth today have spoken out plainly and forcefully as to the responsibility parents have for their children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p6" pid="H5Spab-mOkyG0Qtg-hBhxw" hash="Gw7BTA">I refer to the document issued by the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles entitled “The Family: A Proclamation to the World.” From that document we read:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p7" pid="TCbrME-elkGnBwMUAdSS0w" hash="kHf6zw">“Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. … Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives—mothers and fathers—will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p8" pid="Pk05tNT15E6IRhMTZnaFrg" hash="pM3dCw">These are sobering words, particularly in light of the adversary’s continuing assault on traditional values and the impact it is having upon the family. It becomes obvious that much needs to be done to reverse trends that continue to place the family at risk.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p9" pid="xY_RcUshaEiMDA7jzZ_bMw" hash="_fsV1w">In desperation, society turns to the secular. Social programs are spawned. Government agencies are enlisted to provide public funding and programs in an attempt to change the destructive trends. While some spotty successes are observed, general trends remain alarming. I submit that if real and lasting change is to occur, it will come only as we return to our spiritual moorings. We need to be listening to the counsel of the prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p10" pid="cPftpdUX2kqURaW8WXtLhw" hash="0RCBug">Again the proclamation on the family, modern-day revelation: “The family is ordained of God. … Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners. Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended families should lend support when needed.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p11" pid="_eu9wBp08U643jyRdUX6sQ" hash="c7CetA">As we ponder these inspired words of modern revelation, I acknowledge the blessing of being raised in a good home, a home where parents were more concerned about the children God gave them than acquiring worldly fame or possessions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p12" pid="LRVqC82An0m9QgquRHpb_g" hash="eEUnfg">I was next oldest in a family of eight children. We lived on a small farm in northern Utah. Money was scarce, and thus I was blessed with the necessity of learning to work at a young age. In fact, our limited income required all of the children to be frugal and to contribute to the financial success of the family as soon as they were old enough. On the subject of loafing, my father had a favorite saying: “There’s nothing so boring as loafing, because you can’t stop and rest.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p13" pid="rr2ZAdqxEESNMCN_mDxwFA" hash="mr9fqQ">Although times have changed, the principles remain the same. Today’s parents need to give each of their children opportunities to contribute to the well-being of the family. In such a family, children are happier and there is a spirit of love and unity in the home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p14" pid="viEpgazfIUu0cU7Q1PdSUw" hash="UCtvZg">I learned on that little farm that money and material possessions are not the keys to happiness and success. Of course, there must be sufficient to supply basic needs, but money in and of itself seldom, if ever, results in happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p15" pid="ByuGlCbAv0q97v2zhftwlg" hash="YX3w3g">Our farm also provided the opportunity for learning humility. It seems that if we had a good crop and prices were high, an early frost or a hailstorm would manage to trim the income down to where we would barely get by.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p16" pid="-A41cFQNJ0W_a8lmMq4GOg" hash="LMUoJg">I heard my father remark on more than one occasion, “I don’t mind being educated in the school of hard knocks—it’s the refresher courses I keep getting that are the trial.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p17" pid="uhBsvRbvoUWARdzJg3Nbiw" hash="7nfQUw">Even with the constant financial challenge, we still had a good life. There was love in the home. Home was the place where we wanted to be. And it was good for us to have had the experience of forgoing some of our wants that others in the family would be able to have their needs fulfilled.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p18" pid="uhr9K6EEjUOC-XpaOf3nVQ" hash="j2WiIQ">Our living room furniture would never have made the cover of <span class="emphasis">House Beautiful,</span> but we did have two very significant items: we had a piano and we had a bookcase. How significant those two somewhat simple possessions were in the development of productive talents and interests so important in our early years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/children-and-the-family.p19" pid="AdePpxwvVUKAA8EASzgGQw" hash="S2b34w">The influence of good music and good books carried well over into the next generation. Even television has not replaced the piano and the bookcase in the lives of our families.</p>
