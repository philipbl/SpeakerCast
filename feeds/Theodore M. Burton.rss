      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p1" guid="3e0e3c7b-8a4c-490e-97e8-9e0945495d5e" pid="-t38IEqG2E-f3cFOxg7zvg" hash="B8n-cA">One of the most interesting stories in the Old Testament is the story of Daniel’s interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. In his dream the king saw a great image whose brightness was exceeding great and whose appearance was most terrible. Yet a stone rolling down from a mountain smashed the idol into a thousand pieces. This experience so disturbed the king that he sought an interpretation of his dream.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p2" guid="d79ab9a9-cd84-4dd8-bc74-f8a01dad223f" pid="AozkQVHw9kuEw7zpQcOJGg" hash="Co98OA">In his interpretation of this dream, Daniel the prophet said that later on God would set up a kingdom which would never be destroyed, and that kingdom would eventually consume all other kingdoms and would stand forever. The scripture then records his words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p3" guid="d46f2aad-50fb-49ca-88a2-4e1ecfd78f51" pid="xTq9xvBnfECO8gI4l_t5Hg" hash="0v79Dg">“Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/2.45" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 2:45</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p4" guid="54a58c55-1a3e-4949-b256-1851136a37df" pid="-PRu92R8T0q65-GQH3t7Bg" hash="RAIVpA">Most religious writers and certainly all Christian authors correctly assure us that this kingdom which was to come is the kingdom of Jesus Christ. A serious question arises, however, as to when that kingdom was to be set up. Most Christians assume that this dream referred to the ecclesiastical kingdom which began with the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ. They forget that Christianity as it was practiced through the centuries fostered kingdoms rather than replaced them. People also forget that Jesus Christ himself told of an apostasy to come. In speaking of the latter days, Jesus warned:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p6" guid="09f322b9-302f-4595-93cc-7ab616e38f52" pid="5geE5MPdcUKnFg_giUJIKg" hash="fBZEWA">He foretold the death of his apostles, which we now know actually took place. Before the destruction of these apostles, Paul warned the saints of his day:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p7" guid="72a3b0ee-442c-4981-bb78-51495d7761e8" pid="wO8RMRAOpEeNPfzSZKNheA" hash="Kl3thQ">“That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p8" guid="9ac322c2-b7e8-4672-9de0-314fb15511b2" pid="iv4BD9OvCU66v9FOAbhUyA" hash="g1_15Q">“Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first. …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.2-3" class="scriptureRef">2 Thes. 2:2–3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p9" guid="a82b0e23-01aa-45a5-8a4d-c14764c44f3f" pid="GxbmmCMfBU-bCvWsD0h24A" hash="vUQF-Q">The literal fulfillment of the scriptural predictions of a universal apostasy is made so plain by a reasonable study of ecclesiastical history as to be unmistakable. Nevertheless, Daniel’s prophetic interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream must eventually go into fulfillment. The question to be answered is: When?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p10" guid="62e74d70-6c5a-4973-8822-ced5005cb08b" pid="3EFOSwwBWU6xxcgt1lvlfA" hash="cddteA">There is a related prophetic utterance from the prophet Isaiah that I would like to cite at this time:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p11" guid="1415a154-5cfc-44c6-bca4-69ccfac30388" pid="KbQefLdD_0ukeL9MoV2bKg" hash="kbJHxA">“And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p12" guid="823914a7-f135-4181-ab5d-38bfe27b6c80" pid="rhgfWerOk0iMf-FiOff8Mg" hash="hD0ygQ">“And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/2.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 2:2–3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p13" guid="7eb61673-569f-467d-b63b-a271f96a8356" pid="ihhNUh65fUS_EnlWY1-8bQ" hash="axjf_g">It has been revealed in these latter days that the kingdom of Jesus Christ has already been restored again to man:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p14" guid="beec0559-dfd1-4e97-bcb5-c5779c81d090" pid="FXmM9f8bzU2T1M8UnyxL7Q" hash="H8mbLw">“The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 65:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p15" guid="02d36734-abf2-4a98-b0bc-50b7522b4112" pid="jObJXtVMfkOs8JMjKShFmg" hash="V_tsjQ">When the early missionaries of this church went forth into Canada, they preached that restored gospel of Jesus Christ. They announced grand and glorious tidings of great joy as they explained how God had spoken again from heaven. That gospel stone was not cut out of the mountain by the hand of any man. The stone was rolled forth by God himself when he revealed himself to Joseph Smith and, pointing to his Son, proclaimed: <span class="emphasis">“This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” </span>(<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p16" guid="d1fb73d0-c0ba-49af-b0dd-1fa220fb1fd2" pid="TlIfTpdX6kiRxAizr-xP6w" hash="c3oB4Q">It was Jesus Christ, the Son, who restored to man through the person of Joseph Smith a divine message of restored truth and hope. The gospel of Jesus Christ came from the “mountain.” The “mountain” is just another way of speaking of the kingdom of Jesus Christ. This restored kingdom of Jesus Christ was revealed in a day when other kingdoms on the earth were rapidly being eliminated. There are only a few kingdoms left, and these are principally constitutional monarchies. The day will soon come when the only kingdom to survive will be that ecclesiastical kingdom of Jesus Christ which is to replace all other kingdoms on the face of the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p17" guid="8bf9c1b8-512b-423c-87bb-f4f872999704" pid="3sTFlRXziUGgu2Rn15z-xw" hash="Us4edw">When the missionaries proclaimed that message of truth and hope in eastern Canada, my great grandfather, Samuel Burton, Jr., heard it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p18" guid="07756f5d-c873-4b73-a321-159fb8b1bf3a" pid="wRzspI6wVkylyWQVJFTvBg" hash="2kKxuQ">Because it had a familiar sound, he accepted it with his family as gospel truth. After becoming members of the Church, he and his family left to join the rest of the Church at Nauvoo. Before he arrived there, however, Joseph and Hyrum were martyred, so the family then turned west to join the Church on the prairies at Winter Quarters. His beloved wife, Hannah Shipley Burton, suffered from the hardships of the journey and died on the plains on the banks of the Missouri River. This grief-stricken man undoubtedly complained loudly as has many another man who has suffered hardships and trials while being proved by the Lord. If we understood completely the designs of the Lord, we would be more patient in our suffering and would not complain as much as we so often do when hardships come and we are asked to sacrifice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p19" guid="9c9f0215-3c5b-4e82-803d-5411fb3b2a14" pid="N4RgP8tSkE2nO_MHj1LTYw" hash="HZ1b6w">Joseph Smith, however, understood the plans of God better than did his contemporaries. Before his death he prophesied that the Saints would be driven into the Rocky Mountains and there become a great and a mighty people. It seems incredible, in the face of a prophecy such as this, that the Saints and some of their leaders would have tried to move elsewhere. I was recently on Vancouver Island off the west coast of Canada and thought it one of the loveliest places on earth. I can well understand why people love that beautiful area with its mild climate. In the early days of the Church when the Saints were seeking a new home, they petitioned the British government to let them settle on Vancouver Island. Many were bitterly disappointed when their request was denied.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p20" guid="095392f6-c943-4b8a-827b-825be882b750" pid="LySeICCmnkyDsBsHUGSLNA" hash="tJTkjQ">Later on other members even left the Church when Brigham Young refused their request to lead the migrating Saints on to settle in beautiful, prosperous California. Why should they stop to settle on a desert waste-land in the top of the Rocky Mountains? Because only there could the prophecy of Isaiah be literally fulfilled.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p21" guid="a88ee720-c949-4bbc-991b-abc0055f14cf" pid="0vhEF-CrS0iDEAtQ6qSHCw" hash="Qm6gBQ">Remember that the mountain or kingdom of the Lord had to be established in the top of the mountains. It had to be in mountains exalted above the hills. There the Saints were to gather instructions and strength, and the gospel, or stone, of Jesus Christ was to roll forth from there to fill the whole earth. This prophecy has been and is even now being fulfilled as thousands of missionaries go forth from this gathering place to proclaim the divine message that God lives and has spoken again from the heavens. Where else can you find such literal fulfillment of these two divine prophecies?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p22" guid="bbfc6328-5b01-4016-ac46-0f3f164af3e1" pid="mzfChBExGE-J2OrVa2DSpA" hash="3nyAwQ">That gospel of Jesus Christ is found contained in the Bible, which had its beginnings at Jerusalem; so the word of the Lord as found in the Bible did come from that very city. The Book of Mormon, which is the second divine witness of Jesus Christ, also had its beginnings at Jerusalem. Surely the word of the Lord has been sent forth from Jerusalem. On the other hand, the law of the Lord given in the Doctrine and Covenants, and which is also revealed through living prophets for the governing of the kingdom of Jesus Christ, comes from Zion, which is on this, the American continent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p23" guid="7466760f-8a16-446f-a63d-b45bf3bc983c" pid="oKkm9aKYSEubAMcu6QF1Fw" hash="y-fOHA">But there is one more part of this prophecy to be considered, and that concerns the house of the God of Jacob. The house of Jacob are the children of Israel, but what is the house of the <span class="emphasis">God </span>of Jacob? Why, the house of the God of Jacob consists of temples erected in the mountains, on the tops of the everlasting hills. There the people of the world have gathered, and there in the house of the God of Jacob they have been taught the ways of God. Now that the people have received this power and strength given in these temples, they have moved forth from the mountain stronghold to bring the message of the gospel to all the earth. As strength has been built up elsewhere, temples have been built in other places, and eventually they shall be found in every corner of the earth. In these temples, additional knowledge of God and his ways is revealed. In the house of the God of Jacob, the children of God receive needed spiritual strength to live better than they otherwise would have done.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p24" guid="4553d6ac-5c32-44e9-81c1-8029d5309507" pid="fBPoR4K0QEWrn0kZvfg9OQ" hash="CWvVVQ">As we understand this concept of going to the house of the God of Jacob to receive strength, we understand how important it is to attend the temple frequently. If members holding the priesthood reject the opportunity to go to the temple regularly, they reject the very God who made them and with whom they have covenanted to always remember him and to walk in his ways. The covenants we make in the temple of God are so important that we violate them at the peril of our eternal salvation. Therefore, as often as possible, the members of the Church who hold the priesthood should go to the temple as individuals, with priesthood quorums, and also with their wives, to have their spirits strengthened and their souls revived. Only by regular attendance at the temple can we remember the importance of the commitments we have made to serve the Lord with all our heart, might, mind, and strength.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p25" guid="9a4f604f-d545-447a-a938-d47b51086022" pid="em-WNxUjaUK6taTYbMJTPg" hash="2DnLQQ">I urge every Latter-day Saint to remember these two great prophecies. They have great significance to every one of us. Qualify yourselves as rapidly as you can by righteous living to go to the temple often and there worship and serve the true and living God. I plead with you for your own well being and happiness to practice the promises and covenants you make with the Lord in those temples. As the Lord has warned us: “For if you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you and required of you.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:7</a>.) If we desire to receive celestial blessings, we must keep the celestial law.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/kingdom-of-god.p26" guid="4b48952a-ef7e-4e6f-b7da-d4a66633cbcb" pid="bEb8ME_ZsUOlS0rCIxidEQ" hash="bA--1A">To those not yet members of the Church, I ask you to examine your own hearts. You will recognize that what I have said about these two great prophecies does have a familiar ring! These prophecies are going into complete fulfillment even now. Before your very eyes the plans of the Lord are being revealed to you, if you will only open your eyes and observe what is happening about you. Waste no more time in speculation and questioning, but investigate these principles more closely and you will know for yourselves the truth of what I have spoken. Come join with us in serving the only true and living God, and qualify yourselves to receive those great blessings which God has reserved for you in these last days. You too can become a savior on Mount Zion for your family and friends, as that stone cut out of the mountain without hands rolls forth to fill the whole earth. That the kingdom of God is now is process of expanding under the leadership of true prophets of God, I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Frankly, I didn’t know quite what to expect of that land. I had thought of South America as a rather primitive jungle area. I expected the people to be a little backward, perhaps in need of education and training in the ways of modern civilization. When I saw those countries and their people, I couldn’t have been more astonished.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/thus-saith-the-lord.p2" guid="34ebe547-180d-45fb-96cd-b3be18f8283a" pid="aZAui-BhAU6U6VEIugCjLA" hash="AKZZsw">I saw great cities there with ultra-modern, high-rise buildings and modern conveniences on every side. Traffic was as heavy as in our great cities in North America. They were building apartment houses, offices, subways, roads, and factories with feverish haste to try to meet the needs of an expanding economy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/thus-saith-the-lord.p3" guid="8ef67ce0-da06-4e01-8635-2f15e19e8851" pid="H2cASQi4J0CWqFNxZ0DYfQ" hash="BBlgTQ">Frankly, I fell in love with the people of South America. When I first went there I knew no one, but I was received with such warmth and hospitality that when I left a few weeks later I found myself with many new and choice friends, giving them a brotherly <span class="emphasis">abrazo </span>or hug of affection as we parted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/thus-saith-the-lord.p4" guid="ac351a1d-282b-421b-887e-a79166479505" pid="d8vNvAq2wUqpKWZBaM7KJw" hash="aZ7Sqw">In talking with Church leaders, I found that South Americans face the same problems people generally face in other areas of the world. My friends in South America told me that people there are so intent on filling their material needs that their spiritual needs are being neglected. Churches are losing their hold on their members. People are not interested in present-day religions, and church influence is declining. People are finding neither comfort nor solace in religious teachings and philosophies.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/thus-saith-the-lord.p5" guid="6b948ccc-a1a2-45c3-9fba-dc112346857a" pid="VcJtnFROukKdnm-j4SJgow" hash="a3X5Ow">The same thing is true in Europe and the United States. I suppose it is true all over the world. Churches in many areas are becoming centers of political activism. Ministers and priests are leading protest marches for political causes. Pastors are turning to psychology, psychiatry, and social science in an attempt to serve and fill the emotional and spiritual needs of their parishioners. When sermons are given, they are intellectual masterpieces of learned men trained in schools of divinity as orators, but the heart has gone out of their words. They give messages full of man’s wisdom, but not of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/thus-saith-the-lord.p6" guid="e2ef77f3-98e2-4e9e-80a0-cb9bc018d777" pid="VrA_-Gz7kEWYodPK3jkPjw" hash="99sUdg">Church leaders feel and know this. As a result, they are seeking to reform their churches. Great changes in doctrine and church procedures are being proposed, and some of these changes have actually been put into practice. Conferences and synods are called into session to try to define points of doctrine, methods of procedure, or the wording of gospel ordinances, etc. It appears to me that men are trying to speak <span class="emphasis">for </span>God instead of letting God speak for <span class="emphasis">himself.</span></p>

Which generation of men and women have ever needed more the voice of a prophet of God to guide them than we do today? In a time in history when we are beset by a clamor of voices from every side saying “Lo, here is truth” or “No, here is truth,” where can we find an authoritative voice saying “Thus saith the Lord”? Where is a Moses, or an Isaiah, or a Peter, or a Paul who can speak from personal knowledge of God?</p>

We read in papers and magazines and books various proposals of men who seek to solve moral and ethical problems by the passing of legislation. We see men and women turning to political theory or to science in an attempt to solve the spiritual and moral problems of today’s civilization. We are trying to solve our problems by man’s philosophy and learning and by human wisdom. I again hear Isaiah’s words as he spoke the mind and the will of God:</p>

Old Testament prophets made predictions that in the last days God would reestablish his kingdom upon the earth never again to pass away. Daniel spoke of a stone that God would cut out of the mountain by his own hand that should roll forth to fill the whole earth. Micah said this was to transpire in the last days when the earth would be filled with commotion and upheavals. Malachi foretold the coming of Elijah and the restoration of all things. Jesus said that a messenger, or Elias, would be sent before his second coming to restore all things in preparation for that coming event. Peter testified that in the last days a time of refreshing would come and that Jesus would remain in heaven “until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:21</a>.)</p>

It came as quietly and unobtrusively as “a thief in the night.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.2" class="scriptureRef">1 Thes. 5:2</a>.) It came not by man’s wisdom, but in answer to a simple prayer by Joseph Smith, a young boy in New York State who went into the woods near Palmyra to ask God a simple question: “Which church is right?” That young man had no idea that a new dispensation of God’s mercy and kindness was about to begin. At that time there was no prophet living on the earth who could answer Joseph’s question. There was no way for God to have that question answered, except for God to answer it himself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/thus-saith-the-lord.p17" guid="f61ac388-6c9d-4b87-9f1d-8e2316437607" pid="ls_Zig3CMU29pnMVYK7OsQ" hash="CPTB6w">The true knowledge of God had been lost during the centuries following the death of Christ. When Joseph Smith went into those woods to pray, he knew no more about God than did his contemporaries. Up to that time every Christian church believed and taught of a Godhead fused into one. They believed in a God of spirit, unknown and unknowable. You can well imagine the astonishment of Joseph when not one, but two Personages appeared to him in answer to that simple prayer. As the one Personage spoke and pointed to the other, he introduced him with these words: “This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>.) It was the living, resurrected Jesus Christ, the very Son of God, who instructed Joseph and who thus opened a new dispensation of the true knowledge of God. He told Joseph that no church then existed on the earth authorized to speak in his name. He told Joseph that after proper preparation and the bestowal of priesthood authority, Joseph was to be the first of a line of living prophets in this day and age who were to instruct and bless mankind, even as did the prophets of old.</p>

They gave those men authority to know the mind and the will of God for these latter days. That same power has continued to this very day.</p>

New revelations were given to restore proper priesthood procedures and to reestablish ordinances as they had been used and practiced in the days of Jesus Christ. The Church of Jesus Christ was restored again with the same powers, gifts, and authority as in former days. Again God had spokesmen upon the earth who had the gift to know the mind and will of God and who had authority to say, “Thus saith the Lord!”</p>

This is the genius of the Church of Jesus Christ today. It is the testimony and power of the Holy Ghost that distinguishes this church from others. We need not convene councils of learned men to debate the mind and will of God. We have living prophets and apostles to direct us. If we will follow their counsel, we can avoid the evils of today and have tranquillity of faith and peace of mind.</p>

Men and women who know they are doing the will of God will be ready to sacrifice, to share, to serve, and to live in peace one with another. Peace cannot come by legislation or through affiliation with any political philosophy. Man’s methods of solving his problems are subject to the misuse of power and the errors which come from inexperience and lack of knowledge. Peace, joy, and happiness can come only through an acceptance of God’s revealed plan of life.</p>

Our problem is not the problem of empty churches, but of church buildings filled to overflowing. We are building as rapidly as we can to fill those needs, but it is a continuing struggle. I was pleasantly surprised to find our buildings in South America used not only on Sundays, but also on weekdays. Our young people were busy almost every day of the week using the buildings and grounds like a social club. They were playing football on the grounds. They were holding theatrical and musical rehearsals in the cultural halls. Youth seminaries and children’s Primary classes were being held in the classrooms. I attended a banquet for young people in Buenos Aires. I visited a beginning Deseret Industries operation in Montevideo where our sisters were learning how to sew, to remodel clothes, to knit, to weave, while building fellowship one with another. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, young and old alike were working together without any generation gap to build a new athletic playing field.</p>

We spoke the same language of the heart. We had the same ideals, the same desires, the same goals. I attended a conference in Brazil where the people of the Church were having such a good time talking and visiting together that it was a little difficult to call the meeting to order. Those people loved one another. They were the smilingest, handshakingest, happiest people I saw in all of South America. With that kind of brotherhood, is it any wonder that the three stakes in Sao Paulo are growing at such a rapid rate that each year about a thousand new converts are absorbed into the Lord’s family in each of those stakes?</p>

When a man is convinced that he is truly a son of God or a woman is convinced that she is truly a daughter of God, there are no limits to the growth of that person. This is a fundamental concept of our Church membership. As members of a royal family, no longer will we be content to be like other men and women. We feel different. We realize that nothing can keep us from success when we are doing the Lord’s work. We are willing to work harder, to sacrifice more, and to share our talents and blessings with others because we know who we are. As Peter taught the members of the church in his day:</p>

Find out for yourself. Come and listen to a prophet’s voice. Join with the people of God to become a covenant son or daughter of the true and living God. Obtain your inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, be assigned your lineage rights, and obtain a knowledge of the real purpose of life. To the people already members of the Church of Jesus Christ, let us develop those gifts which are within us. Let us practice that kindness one for another, and let us show that love for our fellowmen which comes through wholehearted acceptance of the principles of truth.</p>

Generally it means they are saved from death. This type of general salvation comes to all people by the grace of God alone. General salvation comes regardless of obedience to gospel principles or laws and results solely in resurrection from the dead. In this respect, salvation is synonymous with immortality, in that the resurrected person will live forever. Resurrection comes to every person born into this world through the sacrifice made by Jesus Christ, whether one confesses Christ or not. Whether a person is wicked or righteous, each person will receive the gift of immortality through Jesus Christ.</p>

No works I do solely of my own power can bring this to pass. Only by the grace of God has this course been opened to me, but only through obedience to the laws of God can I claim my inheritance in the celestial kingdom of my Heavenly Father as a son within his family. I cannot be exalted in my sins, but must work until I overcome them.</p>

When he comes to Salt Lake City he usually drops into my office to say hello. I love to visit with him, for he always leaves me with a new gem of thought.

For almost forty years I have watched as the Lord has honed and polished and prepared President Lee as our teacher, as our stake president, whom we so much loved, as an apostle, and now as President of the Church. I am grateful and pledge my support to him and his counselors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p2" guid="cb5e7e24-13c2-4138-957c-cb830ce69dd6" pid="91oFKgRRukO5VSp0HX1C_A" hash="HIaY9w">President Tanner is our home teacher, who watches over us and cares for us in our home. We are grateful for him and pledge our loyalty to him. We are grateful for President Romney, who fourteen years ago came to Germany and helped me to become a better missionary. I have loved and respected him ever since. And these my brethren who sit before you today are men of God, and I am grateful for the teachings they have given me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p3" guid="37049112-ed67-4dea-bf26-ca11902e81a5" pid="JXkp2AwYIUO7B7tq7QY0Jg" hash="BDA5Ng">Now may I share a thought with you this afternoon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p4" guid="95fde26d-0b1e-446a-bb4e-6b7f38e026ff" pid="IFIGQNwGPkS1kVmSI2QphA" hash="6YDtGA">I received a letter recently in which I was asked why, as president of the Genealogical Society, I didn’t speak about genealogy. The writer also asked why my brethren did not preach about genealogy, when it was one of the fundamental priesthood programs of the Church. This quite startled me, for I have heard some excellent sermons on that subject given by my brethren and have given many sermons on genealogy myself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p5" guid="8e6bb653-9acf-4939-9542-52ada1fa2018" pid="WONEBXODjUu9-ZKuxdFqnQ" hash="Q9Yigg">Perhaps we have all been too subtle. Perhaps our understanding of priesthood genealogy is so broad that we expect all Church members to think of priesthood genealogy as we do. In our understanding it includes the whole plan of salvation, in which, through righteous living and revealed sacred ordinances, families are bound together eternally, worthy to live in the celestial kingdom in the very presence of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost in an exalted, resurrected state. Perhaps we <span class="emphasis">have </span>been too subtle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p6" guid="4babff55-af01-4448-88cb-5aba499d61f9" pid="ZzpVXq_xb0OswY3QfomWew" hash="maC1eQ">Stated, then, in simple words, I say to every member of the Church that you have a personal, individual responsibility to become engaged in priesthood genealogical activity. The real impact of the priesthood genealogy program is one of individual responsibility. The actual work must be performed by individuals, not by organizations. What is everybody’s business is nobody’s business, so I must say that this work is your individual responsibility and each of you, as an individual, must become converted to this work as a personal responsibility. It is not my responsibility alone, nor that of your stake president, nor that of your bishop alone. It is not confined to the high priests. Neither is genealogy and temple work reserved for older people. It should not be put off until you retire or become too old and infirm to do anything else.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p7" guid="a22f4a4c-acfb-44df-a912-71ea3cb1b618" pid="SoIz_RrZCUajfy2Zfpf1RA" hash="77tOXg">Priesthood genealogy is an exciting, living, vital program involving the whole family. Elijah came to turn the hearts of children to their parents and parents to their children, so priesthood genealogy and temple work is a family affair, a total family program involving children, youth, and parents. We ought to change our attitudes toward priesthood genealogy and realize that the real impact of this program converges on each individual member of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/genealogy-a-personal-responsibility.p8" guid="24c55406-c3ce-4cfb-8d8c-06e4721ce980" pid="DQ7FVGmrG0CGKIM-xuRlQQ" hash="Byf2KA">Some persons have asked me, “Just what <span class="emphasis">is </span>my personal responsibility in this work?” I answer that your individual responsibility is to be, or to become, worthy to enter the temple of God to participate in ordinances of salvation for yourself and for others. Youth are to be baptized in behalf of the dead. Young adults are to receive an endowment of power and to be married in the Lord’s appointed way. Wives are to be sealed to husbands and have their children sealed to them for all eternity. Thus, just as you can be saviors for the living through active missionary work, so you are to qualify yourselves to become saviors for those who are dead who rely on you for help and assistance.</p>

When I arrive in a city, a stake president or one of his counselors usually meets me at the airport. Although seldom if ever have I met him before, I can invariably find him among the crowd of watchers at the gate and can walk up to him and greet him. He can also recognize me among the crowd of deplaning passengers. A certain amount of publicity is associated with our work as General Authorities. Our pictures appear in various magazines and news articles, so I can explain how he can recognize me from having seen my picture. But how is it that I can so readily recognize him?</p>

I thought to myself, “If I could only speak Portuguese, there would be a fine missionary contact.” He stopped ahead of us to look in a shop window and as he did so, he turned facing us. When he saw us he waited until we came up to him and then spoke to us in English. We returned his greeting and he asked us if we were Americans. We replied in the affirmative and he asked, “Are you perchance Mormons?” I replied, “Yes. What do you know about the Mormons?” He told us he was a Mormon also and we had a lovely visit with him. We learned he was a bishop’s counselor in one of the Rio Wards. We met him again in a conference session, along with other wonderful Latter-day Saints who lived in that beautiful city. How was it that we could recognize one another among the teeming thousands of people walking along that busy street?</p>

We do, however, call ourselves saints as did the members of the Church of Jesus Christ in the days of the original apostles. When those apostles wrote letters to the members of the Church they addressed them as saints. A saint is not necessarily a person who is perfect, but he is a person who strives for perfection—one who tries to overcome those faults and failings which take him away from God. A true saint will seek to change his manner of living to conform more closely to the ways of the Lord.</p>

It appears to me that when we join the Church of Jesus Christ and especially when we receive the oath and covenant of the priesthood, we should commit ourselves wholly and completely to the cause of God. By this I do not mean we need give up our daily occupations or our interests in the daily affairs of mankind unless we are called by authority from God to do so. I do mean that a true change must occur in our thinking so complete and so total that our very lives are changed for the better as far as our attitudes and our actions are concerned.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-need-for-total-commitment.p13" guid="2445c6c1-7eb2-4f2d-85c1-d917852c468c" pid="gNl2ETozSEWDtHmjaK8BdA" hash="xD3Ncg">A person’s attitude is perhaps the hardest of all personal attributes to change. If your attitude is right, then your life is made right. If your heart is touched, your mind and way of thinking will change and your life will change for the better accordingly. I believe we must become so immersed in the gospel of Jesus Christ that we become physically as well as mentally more and more like the Lord himself. We must yield our whole hearts to him. What we then do is done not because we are asked to, nor because we are forced to, but because we want to. Neither pressure nor force can be exerted upon us from outside, when what we do is done because it is our own choice and desire. It then makes no difference to us what other men may think, or say, or do. Our hearts being committed wholly to God, what we do is done out of our love for and our trust in him. We then serve God in every way we can because we have been converted, our attitude has been changed and we now desire to become like him both spiritually and physically.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-need-for-total-commitment.p15" guid="6ad1194b-17b8-4305-b20d-61886f53cf60" pid="dcMZJnckKUmHPkanQAbSuQ" hash="F3ezJQ">“… because of the Spirit of the Lord God Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>.)</p>

I refer to a daily or continuing spirit of devotion and dedication which comes from keeping all the commandments of God every day. We must not pick and choose which commandment of God we will or will not obey. Every one is important. For example, we cannot postpone genealogical research, temple work, or missionary work until after we retire. When we accept Jesus Christ, we accept his apostles and prophets and his total concept of Christian living. We then gladly accept the admonition of God’s servants and willingly have family prayer, hold family home evening, keep a year’s supply of food on hand for emergencies, send our sons and daughters on missions, keep the fast, pay an honest tithe, care for the poor and the needy, and are kind and thoughtful and Considerate of others. We willingly become saviors for our families and go to the temple regularly to officiate in behalf of our kindred dead who have sacrificed so much for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-need-for-total-commitment.p17" guid="03c8f128-e985-485a-8f46-f0922b8dee3e" pid="G-X9lCJMk0GOl5NNRlDNvg" hash="uUFF9A">When we therefore understand this principle of commitment, we will realize the importance of priesthood genealogy and temple work. The Lord said that unless the hearts of the fathers are turned to their children and unless the hearts of the children are turned to their fathers, this earth life would fail its purpose. Genealogical work is therefore important and we should get on with it. Yet it will succeed no faster than the bishops in the individual wards give leadership to this program. It will succeed no faster than stake presidents in their individual stakes become actively involved in priesthood genealogical work. There are those who say that they are too busy to give leadership to this program, but I believe such persons fail to understand that it is a basic priesthood program given us by God. Will God’s work fail in its purpose? Is anything too difficult For God? The answer we all know. God’s purposes will be fulfilled by those servants he has chosen to lead out in this work. It is this total commitment, this dedication of purpose, this unfailing faith in God’s work that I am referring to, not only in this, but in all priesthood programs.</p>

It also means that there is a possibility that any one of us can fall out of good standing, even those who have already achieved a certain degree of righteousness. Therefore, we need to be on our constant guard, each of us, that we not allow ourselves to fall into habits of carelessness in our faith, in our prayers, or in our various Church activities or responsibilities. It is for this reason that I am resolving again to live closer to God each day and to follow his chosen prophets and apostles more diligently than I have ever done in the past.</p>

We will thus have to live closer to the Lord than we have ever done before. I resolve to do this for I know that God lives. I know that Jesus Christ is his Only Begotten Son, and that these brethren who we sustain as our leaders are true apostles and prophets. They have been called and ordained of God to lead us back into his very presence. I invite all of you who hear my voice or who read this message to take heed as the scriptures have indicated, and that you rededicate yourselves in a total commitment to serve the Lord with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p2" pid="AKH94dkoDEmhsp-lV7jKCg" hash="8ISX8Q">The Old Testament speaks of many great prophets. The last of the prophets in old Israel who held a fullness of divine authority was Elijah the Tishbite. A famine came in the land when Elijah, as commanded of God, sealed the heavens shut that it did not rain. During this famine, he was miraculously fed by ravens at the brook Cherith, which flowed into the Jordan River.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p3" pid="_phug7DGuEekUQZSarduHg" hash="HiW76A">Then God sent Elijah to the city of Zarephath and told him he had appointed a widow there who would feed him. Elijah met this widow at the outskirts of the city and asked her to give him food to eat.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p4" pid="FOgJrWPZhkeZO6DriGapIA" hash="kYfe8Q">“And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/17.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 17:12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p5" pid="JgG6dc_f0UOp3Gzx1xPfBw" hash="c7Rnbg">Elijah then promised her in the name of the Lord that if she would feed him, she would never lack for food. I have pondered on the faith of that woman, who, on the promise of a humble man of God, put her life and the life of her son in the balance. Obediently she baked food and fed Elijah, and then followed the miracle of the fulfillment of the prophet’s promise: “And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/17.16" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 17:16</a>.)</p>

These prophets hold the same fullness of authority given to Elijah. They have told us to keep at least a year’s supply of food on hand for any future emergency. We have only their word of prophecy to rely on, just as the widow relied on that of Elijah. We should obey as she did. By so doing, we will be able to save ourselves and our families from want.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p7" pid="G4vadBO4R06zJ7WMtcBO3Q" hash="-f_35A">Some members of the Church have said to me, “Why should we keep a store of food on hand? If a real emergency came in this lawless world, a neighbor would simply come with his gun and take it from us. What would <span class="emphasis">you</span> do if a person came and demanded <span class="emphasis">your</span> food?” I replied that I would share whatever I had with him, and he wouldn’t have to use a gun to obtain that assistance either.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p8" pid="qzHmtsONnke4SdKf_XTspg" hash="97BDrA">“I wouldn’t,” replied one man. “I have a gun, and I wouldn’t hesitate to use it to defend my family. Anyone would have to kill me first in order to get food away from me! After all, they bring their own misery on themselves by not being prepared!”</p>

If every family were provided for, our stores would be safe for the use of our families. But not all people have sufficient faith to share with others as did the widow who shared with Elijah. I remember the words of another prophet who loved the poor and the unfortunate. He said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p10" pid="NQlVNJOcoE2ronwa_GWnWQ" hash="yC2-3g">“And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.</p>

If we are obedient as true followers of Christ and share what we have with those less fortunate than we, the Lord will keep his promise to watch over us and care for us. I will then be glad that I have stores of food on hand so I can be of assistance to others. Perhaps like the widow who fed Elijah, the meal will then never fail in our barrels nor the oil ever fail in our cruses until prosperity comes again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p15" pid="3ydT-kwauEWcY3P06c-pOw" hash="keIwLw">If the power of Elijah is so important in temporal affairs, think of the spiritual power he possessed. You remember, he could bind or seal on earth and have it bound in heaven, or he could loose on earth and have it loosed in heaven. In his day, because of the wickedness of the people, he bound the heavens that it did not rain, and no rain fell until after he had shown the people the impotence and lack of power of the 450 priests of Baal. After they were destroyed and the people humbled, Elijah, by the power of God, opened the heavens again that rain fell to break the famine. This sealing power is characteristic of the prophets of God who hold full divine authority.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p16" pid="UAz2gb9Pb0qDlkf1XhW-aw" hash="FnYABw">Jesus promised this sealing power to Peter and said: “And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p17" pid="CrufbhlLg0COv4KrYLp0ig" hash="G8FFJQ">However, this power did not come to Peter until one week later, when Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him to the top of a high mountain. As they were there transfigured, Moses and Elias appeared to them and gave these apostles, under the direction of Jesus Christ, a fullness of divine priesthood authority. Remember that Elias is the Greek name for Elijah. Elijah, who was the last prophet of the Old Testament to hold the keys of that sealing power, passed this power on to the prophets of the New Testament. There is great order in the priesthood, and the transfer of keys of authority is carried out carefully in the Lord’s own way, under his direction. Once this power was restored, it was possible to pass it on to all the apostles, as recorded in the scriptures. Jesus told the Twelve: “Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.18" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:18</a>.)</p>

There was a prophet by the name of Elias whom we know more familiarly as Noah. (See Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class="emphasis">Answers to Gospel Questions,</span> Deseret Book Co., 1957–66, vol. 3, pp. 138–41.) This office of Elias is that of a precursor or forerunner. Those who have this power are forerunners, who prepare for greater things to follow. Such prophets carry the title of an Elias.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p19" pid="mPzE2cFKrkWRptLKlO0NFg" hash="BSozZA">The Twelve, after they heard that Moses and Elijah had come, told Jesus they understood that Elias was to come first and asked for an explanation. Jesus told them the scriptures did teach that Elias must first come and this doctrine was true and correct. Then he explained that John the Baptist was that Elias, who was to prepare the way before him, but the people had not recognized him as such. Following this forerunner comes Elijah with the power to place the seals of the Melchizedek Priesthood upon the house of Israel. Then comes the culmination of the Messiah or Anointed One, who is the Savior or Redeemer with the greatest power of all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p20" pid="dGcbvrNE20yplWNZsn-aCw" hash="ifuknw">So it has been done in our day also. The forerunner of priesthood restoration was the return of John the Baptist as an Elias to restore the power of the Aaronic Priesthood. Then came Peter, James, and John, who restored the greater or Melchizedek Priesthood. But our generation is that generation of the fullness of times spoken of by Peter to be established in the last days. In this generation, therefore, there must be a “restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:21</a>.)</p>

The prophet Elijah, with the keys of this sealing power, did come just as predicted. Those keys of the priesthood were restored in perfect order and harmony, as was done on the Mount of Transfiguration. Each prophet holding special keys of the priesthood appeared and restored them to prophets on the earth. Moses appeared. Elias came. Then Elijah appeared and said:</p>

Temples have been erected in which a fullness of these priesthood ordinances is made available for those who qualify themselves to receive them through faith and righteous living. Before the Savior comes again, power has been given us to proceed with a great priesthood work. We are to bind together the families of men in true patriarchal order, so that through worthiness we may have the privilege to live in the celestial kingdom as children of God, with resurrected bodies of flesh and bone, to dwell eternally in the very presence of God the Eternal Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/the-power-of-elijah.p31" pid="xbe5n3UBRUq8dzzbXUBrvQ" hash="0SrYjQ">Through this priesthood power which has been again restored to prophets of God, we can be sealed as families on earth and have that sealing be effective in heaven. As authorized disciples of Jesus Christ, we can become in turn saviors not only for our own living families, but also for our deceased progenitors. All it requires is the exercise of that simple faith to carry out this promise as the widow did for Elijah. She gave the last food she had as a token of her faith in God. Surely, out of the great abundance God has given us, we can share some of our time and our means to do this spiritual work for the living and for the dead under the direction of modern prophets who hold the same fullness of priesthood power as did Elijah the Tishbite. President Kimball holds the keys of this sealing power to bind on earth and to have it bound in heaven. He is a true prophet of God, of which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

When I read or hear of these continuing disputes, I am aware of their negative nature. People nowadays seem to be continually against something or somebody. We appear to live in a negative era.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/blessed-are-the-peacemakers.p3" pid="Y6b1r5Qg-kikJHukoeccvg" hash="Xcl-yw">The answer appears to me to be that each person today wants to “do his own thing,” to demonstrate his complete independence of everything and everyone. We forget that we are not, and cannot be, totally independent of one another either in thought or action. We are part of a total community. We are all members of one family, as Paul reminded the Greeks at Athens when he explained that God “hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/17.26" class="scriptureRef">Acts 17:26</a>.)</p>

He warned us not to place our trust nor build our sermons on one single verse of scripture. He said that God is the greatest of all teachers and understands the value of repetition. If an idea is true, we will find that concept repeated again and again throughout the scriptures. Instructions are not confined to any one generation, but are given repeatedly, often in other words so we will not miss their true meaning. However, we must not take ideas out of context. The truth that persons were chosen for certain work before this earth was formed is found in many places in the scriptures.</p>

Jesus Christ himself came through definite lineage lines. Thus there was, and is, planning for the preservation of priesthood lineage. Alma made this clear when he said of men holding the high priesthood that they were “called and prepared <span class="emphasis">from the foundation of the world</span> according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 13:3</a>.

That priesthood is the priesthood after the holy order of the Son of God. I remind you that Jesus Christ is the God of love. He came to bring peace to the world, but said himself that his word was really a sword, because men would fail to understand it and use it properly. He taught that because people would not comprehend his message, quarrels and misunderstandings would divide them. For this reason there is a great need for peacemakers in the world who know and understand Jesus Christ and who comprehend that the purpose of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ was to make it possible to restore all persons, if they would follow him, into the very presence of God, the Eternal Father.</p>

No! Such things make a hell and not a heaven. That is why we must learn to get rid of dissension, envy, hate, and discord in this life on earth.

If we would only follow the instructions of a perfect God, instead of following the instructions of men or blindly responding to our own selfish desires, we would have peace.

The closer we approach the second coming of Jesus Christ, the greater will be Satan’s efforts. He will try to influence men as never before to destroy one another by dissension, opposition, selfishness, wars, riots, and destructions. If he can get people to quarrel with one another, they will inevitably destroy themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/blessed-are-the-peacemakers.p30" pid="FEp_YvuvlUScj78ek_DkQA" hash="eIvjrA">God, who knows all things, knew from the very beginning that this would happen. It is for this reason that God reserved you and the holy priesthood against that time, so that you can exert this divine power to hold Satan in check. God reserved some of his choicest sons and daughters for this present day and age. These special children were to be leaders who would recognize the negative, self-destructive efforts of Satan and thwart them by the righteous use of divinely authorized priesthood power. That is the reason we need peacemakers today as never before.</p>

Unless we live very close to God and listen carefully to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit, we will find dissension creeping into our own lives, into our homes, and into the Church. We must be alert at all times in our homes, in our daily work, in our private lives, and in our branches, wards, and stakes to see that this does not happen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/blessed-are-the-peacemakers.p32" pid="zWWJaDdAskayebDJSeV4dA" hash="U59Tig">Whenever you get red in the face, whenever you raise your voice, whenever you get “hot under the collar,” or angry, rebellious, or negative in spirit, then know that the Spirit of God is leaving you and the spirit of Satan is beginning to take over. At times we may feel justified in arguing or fighting for truth by contentious words and actions. Do not be deceived. Satan would rather have you contend for evil if he could, but he rejoices when we contend with one another even when we think we are doing it in the cause of righteousness. He knows and recognizes the self-destructive nature of contention under any guise. You can recognize the Spirit of Christ within you when you speak to one another or speak of another person with a warm smile instead of with a frown or scowl.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/blessed-are-the-peacemakers.p33" pid="PVTEepb4bUe_LtqKTN6Lxw" hash="uYaiTA">Thus, from the beginning of creation, God planned to have leaders available in the last days holding the power of the holy priesthood. With this power we can help bring peace to the world by practicing peace. It must begin in our homes, in our quorums, in our auxiliaries, and within every single Church unit. People are so hungry for peace today that if we truly demonstrate peace among ourselves and to others, they will flock to the Church in great numbers. The greatest missionary tool we have is that of demonstrating friendliness, brotherly kindness, harmony, love, and peace in our homes and in all our Church meetings. If we follow the example of Jesus Christ and become true peacemakers, that flood of love will cover the earth as with a blanket. The only way Satan can ever be bound will be through the love of man for God and for one another.</p>

He was talking about your inherited right to receive and use priesthood power. This readiness to listen and believe is an inherited gift which enabled you to recognize and accept the truth. Jesus explained this thought as he said: “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.27" class="scriptureRef">John 10:27</a>.)</p>

Such willingness to believe does not represent predestination, but it does represent foreordination.

He means that according to the plan of salvation you were reserved or held back in the heavens as special spirit children to be born in a time and at a place where you could perform a special mission in life. This concept of being foreordained for a special mission is not new. It is referred to many times in the scriptures. Paul, in teaching the Ephesians, said:</p>

They will turn to the members of the Church in whose blood these priesthood promises have continued as a priesthood lineage blessing. If you join the Church, then you have the assurance that your parents and other blood relatives will join if you show them true love and affection. Every one of your blood relatives is a prospective member of the kingdom of God. With patient and kind teaching, they too will eventually join the Church, for they possess the same spiritual heritage and priesthood heritage you have.</p>

The Lord hath said it. Amen.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/86.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 86:11</a>.)</p>

First, he reminds us of our responsibility to do missionary work here on the earth. Second, he informs us that we are not only to be messengers of salvation to the living, but saviors for our ancestors who went before us and who, though now dead, have paved the way whereby we might receive our present blessings. It is through them we received our priesthood. The promise was made that, even if they were born at a time and place where they could not hear the gospel preached in life, God would provide saviors for them from among their descendants. We are those saviors God promised through whom they can have every priesthood blessing.</p>

This is as much a priesthood missionary responsibility as is our missionary obligation here in mortality. They are totally dependent upon us to open the doors of exaltation for them. If we neglect this priesthood responsibility, we do so at the peril of our own salvation. It was for this reason that Elijah restored the keys of the sealing power so that we could accomplish this work of salvation for our dead.</p>

A full knowledge of the gospel developed slowly as it was revealed by the Lord line on line and precept by precept. Timing was important. First things had to be developed first. The Church had to be established and Church administration had to be organized. Then a people had to be gathered and the Church developed and strengthened. It took time to build and strengthen a people and to prepare them for their future work. Temples had to be built and that required people, wealth, peace, and time.</p>

The time has come for God to hasten this aspect of priesthood growth. Salvation of the whole eternal family of God is the goal toward which we have been working and preparing ourselves from the very beginning. We must continue to gather the people. We must continue to strengthen them physically, mentally, morally, and spiritually so they will be prepared to go into the temples and there receive power with which to strengthen their earthly families. As this is done, they can be prepared to become saviors on Mount Zion to save their kindred dead.</p>

We must reconstruct our lineage eventually back to Adam, who made his covenant to become a son of Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh. Gaps, caused by unfaithful or disobedient ancestors, will have to be closed through revelation from God. The end result is that the family of God will be reconstituted so that in the resurrection all his faithful children will be sealed in perfect family order.</p>

We have spoken of salvation of the dead from time to time, but in great measure the family priesthood responsibility God has given us has been neglected. We cannot neglect it any longer, for it is a vital part of God’s overall missionary program.</p>

The Genealogical Society can gather names to keep the temples operating, but the Genealogical Society cannot do the research work of establishing family lines of priesthood heritage which God has assigned the priesthood to do. The Society does not have, and cannot obtain, all the records which are open to individuals. At the present time, the Genealogical Society is furnishing 77 percent of all the names officiated for in the temple. The balance is furnished through family research. It is your personal, individual missionary responsibility to see that your direct-line ancestors have been baptized, endowed, and sealed in proper family order.</p>

More males are born and reach the age of accountability than females. This means that more Aaronic Priesthood members must go to the temple than their sisters to be baptized for the dead, and it also means that brethren of the Melchizedek Priesthood must go to the temple more frequently than their wives. Unless more priesthood members go to the temple as individuals, or as quorums, to get this male ordinance work done, the male names will backlog in the temples. When that happens, the sealing of families cannot be completed.</p>

We don’t want to hinder in any way our sisters from attending the temple, so we must increase male temple attendance. Just as you go as individual men or as quorums to work on welfare projects without taking your wives with you, so we want you to go as individual men or as priesthood quorums or groups on extra trips to the temples to keep this problem solved. I appeal to you to cooperate with your temple presidents to keep male and female names in balance.</p>

I repeat the statement Jesus made to Peter when he said: “When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:32</a>.) I testify that the work for the salvation of our kindred dead is a personal responsibility for everyone who holds the priesthood. Salvation for the dead is a divine activity, of which I bear my witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p2" pid="YkaI7pplvUS-dv7zn0GElw" hash="08m6Aw">I was taught at home and in Church to keep the Word of Wisdom. So from my early youth I learned an important lesson: to avoid those things which were injurious to my body.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p3" pid="iZdZkgcKDk2ZFFh2Q-R_JA" hash="WV9AnQ">As a matter of fact, we seldom had a conference in those days without a talk about the Word of Wisdom. Today I would like to revert back to that practice and speak of that revelation which the Lord gave to Joseph Smith on February 27, 1833, found in the Doctrine and Covenants as section 89. [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89</a>] Although the evils connected with excessive use of alcohol had long been recognized, at that time it was not known how pernicious the use of alcohol could be. The dangers involved in the use of tobacco, tea, coffee, and the excessive use of meat were just not known in those early days. But the Lord knew of these perils and warned his children in order to protect them both in body and in mind. In my opinion, there is great need for such counseling in this day in which <span class="emphasis">we</span> live.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p4" pid="ukVDRCPzZUeKyA8GUCyioA" hash="18iQkg">During the decade of the 1960s there was much ado about the drug culture, and with very good cause. As we saw people, especially young adults, destroy their bodies and minds by the use of narcotic and habit-forming drugs, we were most alarmed. While this practice is still giving us great concern, so much publicity has been given to its destructive effects that the practice, at least by the older teenagers and young adults, has decreased somewhat.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p5" pid="KKS2gR2CTECbZBHPmDGT1A" hash="xOT8zw">The use of drugs, however, is still a very serious problem among younger teenagers, who have not yet reached the maturity nor gained the wisdom to know how destructive such practices can be. In their bravado and inexperience in life, such very young persons are tempted to try these drugs on an experimental basis, with resulting destruction of both body and mind. Before they are aware, they are made captives of these vicious habits. They find they have a tiger by the tail and can neither hold on, nor dare let go. Too late they find themselves caught in a terrible predicament.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p6" pid="3X_rSpMI0E-ouVLh_tqzhA" hash="eldytA">Frightening and vicious though drug use is, equally destructive in the long run is the use of alcohol and tobacco. They constitute our major drug problem today, for these substances are truly drugs and should be so regarded. The problem with these particular drugs is that their effects are more gradual. Because the destruction is not immediately apparent, young and old alike do not realize their harmful effects until the damage already has been done. When cancer, emphysema, and heart trouble result from prolonged use of tobacco, all the repentance in the world cannot save a person from the suffering caused by such bodily injury. When an alcoholic has lost health, job, family, and reputation, regretting the start of using alcoholic beverages is small consolation for a ruined life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p7" pid="z4ffFPOiOkartlkol9vwSg" hash="CR6Yuw">Some of my friends have asked me why, as a scientist, I do not speak out against the use of such substances. “Because of your scientific background as a former professor of chemistry, you can speak with authority,” my friends have said. “Because of your knowledge and scientific experience people will believe <span class="emphasis">you!</span> Think of the good you could do as a trained scientist to save our people!” All I can answer is that we have hundreds of well-trained and experienced scientists in our Church. They are just as well qualified as I am to speak about the Word of Wisdom and to show how this revelation has been scientifically corroborated and affirmed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p8" pid="9LC6nQlq8Eu6B-zvhOXoUw" hash="Rc7llQ">But let me make a further statement. Scientific confirmation of the Word of Wisdom has not kept our youth from experimenting with tobacco, marijuana, alcoholic beverages, or any other drug. Every package of cigarettes and every advertisement thereof carries a prominent label:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p9" pid="ezZGl_Y-tUKgtvPyOqL6Vw" hash="uy8zIA">
        <span class="emphasis">WARNING: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p10" pid="PVluzxbEjESvqVLoNn1SKQ" hash="5mGlww">But this warning from a scientist does not keep people from smoking. The 50,000 killed and 800,000 injured annually in the United States as a result of drinking drivers would cause a wave of protest marches if the United States were engaged in military action and had such casualties. Yet very little word of protest is raised about the continued, even increasing, use of alcohol among drivers of motor-driven vehicles. Neither of these confirmations of the Word of Wisdom deters people from smoking and drinking. Both are on the increase in spite of scientific evidence and experience which demonstrate how injurious these practices are.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p11" pid="HnCgIuDpKkGfmtmu5EYXTQ" hash="IvDJew">If a warning label such as is found on every package of cigarettes were placed on every can or package of dog or cat food, the purchase and use of such pet foods would come to a screeching halt. People would never even think of feeding such material to their pets. People think too much of their dog or their cat to so carelessly endanger its life. Yet they ignore those very same warnings when they are given to human beings. One must draw the conclusion that people have a higher regard for their pets than they have for themselves or for their own children. It is a sobering thought.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p12" pid="i7NMKIKTLEq-VMhUaeTeMw" hash="8Z7CAQ">However, there is a better reason why I should speak about the Word of Wisdom than because I am a scientist. I have been called as a General Authority and as such have been given a special stewardship to teach people the truth. As a General Authority I have a solid, personal witness that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. I know that he is the Creator and that he knows the end from the very beginning. As the Creator of man, he <span class="emphasis">knows</span> which things are good for our bodies and which things are injurious to us. Jesus Christ as the God of this world has told us that alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, and coffee are all destructive of our health. The continued use of these substances will cause us misery and sorrow. They are not only injurious to our health, but actually destructive of our bodies and minds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/the-word-of-wisdom.p13" pid="neJyh_-Oy0GP-iMucjK1NA" hash="2yqWQg">Since I know that God lives and that these instructions come from him, I am in a better position as a servant of God to warn the people of the world and members of the Church in particular against such dangers than I would ever be as a scientist. God has warned us and forewarned us by giving us the Word of Wisdom as a revelation. As God’s servant I pass on that knowledge for the benefit of those who hear or will see these words. I repeat that the use of tobacco, tea, coffee, and alcoholic beverages of any kind is not only displeasing to the Lord, but also destructive of your body and mind.</p>

Could this, then, be one way the Lord might use of separating the obedient from the disobedient? Could there be some connection between these forbidden substances and radioactive particles which could cause increased absorption in the bone marrow, with resultant increased possibility of damage? I do not know.</p>

I urge you, then, to listen carefully to these words of warning, not only to avoid the use of those things which are harmful to your bodies, but also to use those foods <span class="emphasis">recommended</span> by the Lord with prudence and thanksgiving.</p>

Those doctrines are given in a guarded fashion by his apostles as they wrote the saints. Not everyone would understand their writings, but certainly those to whom they wrote would understand. An example is given in John’s first letter, chapter 2, verse 20:</p>

Some were born at times and places where it was impossible for them to hear the message of salvation. To condemn them without an opportunity to accept the gospel while living would be unfair. Salvation for the dead was one of those concepts taught during the forty days following the resurrection of Jesus.</p>

Wise men were not able to restore these practices during the Reformation or since. These doctrines came from heaven by a restoration of the gospel. Nor could Joseph Smith of himself have thought out these doctrines. They were part of the stone cut out of the mountain without hands that would roll forth to fill the earth. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/2.34-35,44-45" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 2:34–35, 44–45</a>.)</p>

There are prophets again on the earth who teach those same sacred principles revealed by Jesus during the forty days immediately following his resurrection. A realization of this fact is a vivid warning to all present members of the Church to qualify themselves by righteous living to receive these blessings. They will be revealed to the righteous who will believe and practice them.</p>

It comes so naturally that few can see the hand of the Lord in it, but it is there. People interested in genealogy will undoubtedly ask the question, “Why?” If they will only search for an answer to that question, they will find the restored gospel and receive power from on high just as did those ancient members of the church of Jesus Christ.</p>

It is a warning to members of the Church to take this work more seriously. It is a continuation and a perfecting of missionary activity; in fact, it is a vital part of it. To neglect this responsibility is to endanger one’s own salvation.</p>

You can see the hastening hand of the Lord at work. You can sense the necessity to get on with this work. I feel I must teach it wherever I go so that member and nonmember alike may search for that knowledge, which is neither cryptic nor hidden to those who know and love the Lord. This is my testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="NdrpYBdNtEyk2_DnJpxGwg" hash="6Q7yrQ">My brothers, sisters, and friends, when the First Presidency invited me to speak at this conference, I asked myself: “What message do the people of Europe most need to hear?” These conference messages will be broadcast and this is my opportunity to speak to them. At the same time it appeared to me that their most basic need might well coincide with the fundamental need of people all over the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="xoayKQt-c0qgyK5YbHfVAQ" hash="5NQAkw">The basic need in Europe is for the people to be taught true principles of love. I speak of love as meaning a lack of personal selfishness. True love is the exact opposite of the present philosophy of selfishness which seems to permeate the world. Selfish interests color people’s dealings with each other and even color person-to-person contact within the family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="_DkCUXQgNUqCv9WxHPTesw" hash="bKB5Ww">True love is based on personal unselfishness, but our modern world does not seem to understand this. Modern man has lost his capacity to love. Jesus warned us that one of the principal characteristics of the last days would be that love among the people would gradually die. Jesus said, “Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.10" class="scriptureRef">JS—M 1:10</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.12" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:12</a>). My thesis is that the iniquity of which he spoke is based on personal selfishness. That is the reason why love among the people is dying.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="1ZGZEUeZEECGEhQPv3KINg" hash="1q0H8w">Jesus warned that iniquities in the last days would become so great “that, if possible, they shall deceive the very elect, who are the elect according to the covenant” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.22" class="scriptureRef">JS—M 1:22</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.24" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:24</a>). I understand this to mean that eventually even the most faithful of the Lord’s covenant Saints will become contaminated and threatened by modern-day philosophies. I believe it is for this reason that unless these days are shortened none of us could long remain unaffected by such trends.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="0WGp1ue6MkC9u2E6aAL8ow" hash="R5VqJA">It may well be that the present attitude of personal selfishness is the cause of most of the unhappiness with life among the people of the world. It shows up even in our daily occupations. For instance, when a person is offered a job, he seldom asks what opportunities the job offers to be of service to others. His first question is “What is there in this job for me?” The salary offered is too low. Having to move to or live in a given city is not convenient. He does not want to travel. He does not want to be confined to a desk, or he does not want to work such long hours. Before he even begins to work he asks, “What retirement benefits will I receive?” He is not interested in challenges, but only in security.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="3S9X7VMtLUGcvl7HyEPPYQ" hash="rW6_AA">May I first speak to young people about personal selfishness in courtship? Actually, what is the main purpose for dating? Isn’t it to get to know another person well enough to know what kind of a partner that person would be? Isn’t it to learn to know that other person’s character, interests, talents, and abilities? Or is dating merely an opportunity to satisfy one’s passions? Each person will have to answer that question for himself. However, a sure guide would be to follow the words of the Savior: “Again I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:25</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="Lcsl61lBf0KEeeUjFhbXPg" hash="YHI1iA">The necessity to practice unselfish love in courtship becomes imperative in marriage. Persons interested only in romance soon find the realisms of marriage too much to cope with. Yet in magazines and books emphasis is placed on romance and material pleasures. This is almost the exclusive appeal of advertising. It is demonstrated over and over again in moving pictures and on television. It is the exclusive appeal of pornographic literature. People become conditioned by this exposure and grow up expecting only personal gratification in marriage. Personal selfishness is the main reason for the present high divorce rate throughout the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="vQeXL7UMH0OvZEU9NnAmQA" hash="E_v8uA">This desire for personal gratification results in disharmony in marriage. Couples interested only in themselves don’t communicate. Lack of communication then becomes a major stumbling block in developing true love. Lack of communication coupled with the postponement of children is based on selfishness, as is the greater evil of abortion. We shudder as we read in Leviticus of the sacrifices of idol worshipers of that time who fed their children into the fiery maw of the iron god Molech. Is personal selfishness which results in abortion any less repulsive to God, as modern people through abortion offer the sacrifice of their children to their idol of selfish materialism?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="U4S-sIpQEky2sMAXcAzogg" hash="g3oYjA">In Europe families are limited to a point where couples are more or less ostracized by neighbors and friends if they have more than two children. Some European nations are even now beginning to decline in population as birth control and abortion become a way of life. Far too many wives are working in order that the couple may have its own home, a car, colored television, or extensive vacation trips. Children for such couples are an unwanted handicap and a needless expense.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="ECCKFlJhlEaNaVJlltre4w" hash="XWpudQ">Why bother to marry when children are neither wanted nor expected? Why burden oneself with marriage when couples expect to change partners when they tire of one another? What is the need for virtue when one’s goal is only self-satisfaction? If ever there was a need for the restoration of truth in a world where man is only interested in his own pleasure and self-gratification, it is now!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="BQl210uBGUexgNWgjHVYxg" hash="x78XOQ">As I see how many people, not only in Europe but everywhere, quarrel and antagonize one another, I understand better why Jesus continually emphasized the need for love. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of love. A life of love is not an easy life to live, especially when one lives in a world where strife with neighbors and strife within one’s own family is so common. People have been hurt so often in the past that they are constantly on guard one against another. They have drawn a defensive circle around themselves so tightly it is difficult to penetrate. Yet they need to be taught love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="BSqDoSzKn02IugyiRCMTrw" hash="8p8FoA">Strife in families leads to wife abuse and child abuse. This, too, comes through personal selfishness. It is so common in the world that we even find it creeping into the Church. As the Church grows rapidly we must teach love with increasing effectiveness. This is why our Church leaders continually caution home teachers to care for their families and “watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="2jy7EG_GmUWbbkOrcrFMhw" hash="aWXn2Q">“And see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.53-54" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:53–54</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="q5mh56LtUUuO8wuRCdWSIQ" hash="mi8HaQ">Jesus, out of pure unselfish love, gave his life for our sakes. Had he been as selfish as people are nowadays, there would have been no atonement. We would have been cut off from the presence of God forever and left to be carnal, sensual, and devilish. But Jesus was not selfish. He prepared a way whereby every man and every woman may find personal happiness and great joy in life. That joy, however, must come in the Lord’s way through unselfish love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/the-need-for-love.p" pid="8XTkzsrUdUSoY2l38MKFSg" hash="094I8Q">I understand now why Jesus always spoke out so strongly against disputations and contention. Contention is of the devil and not of God. I see the need for modern prophets to be in communication with God. I see their strivings to lead God’s children toward truth and righteousness. Their message may be unpopular, but it is needed, for it is the only way to happiness. O people both within and without the Church, please realize that we are living in the last days. It is a day when love is waxing cold. People who will not listen to these warnings are preparing themselves for destruction. Jesus Christ will soon come in power and glory. When he comes only those will be spared who have learned to love God and one another with all their heart, might, mind, and strength.</p>

Please listen! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In my earlier years as a scientist, I was interested in the concept of absolute zero, where, theoretically, there is a complete absence of thermal energy. Such a degree of coldness is difficult to comprehend. However, we all know how uncomfortable we feel when the temperature drops toward freezing. Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius and freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but absolute zero is about 273 degrees Celsius below freezing. Such temperatures are approached in outer space.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/light-and-truth.p2" pid="Q3cVD-UaPEqI8xa5w3mYWw" hash="lfSqfw">When I was a young boy, I went with my father to inspect a mine in Nevada. We each had flashlights, but took no extra batteries with us, for we did not expect to be in the mine very long. But the tunnel was longer, colder, and deeper than we anticipated. Before we got to the end of the mine, where the mineral was, father told me to turn off my flashlight to save my batteries. By the time father had finished inspecting the mine, his flashlight began to dim, and he suggested we had better turn back. Before long his flashlight gave out completely, and I can still remember—until I again turned on my light—the panic I felt to be in such cold and utter blackness. Although my own batteries gave out before we reached the mine entrance, we were by then guided by the dim light coming from the mouth of the tunnel. How good it felt to see the light increase as we made our way back to the entrance and found ourselves in warm, brilliant sunlight.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/light-and-truth.p3" pid="RAhUxzhf4Uu3PYQrRxhW-g" hash="vZqTqg">I have since wondered how anyone could knowingly prefer to live where it is dark and cold. How could anybody willingly prefer darkness and misery over light and warmth? Yet darkness, cold, and misery will be the lot of those who willingly and knowingly reject the Lord. John wrote, “God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/1.5" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 1:5</a>.)</p>

Those who follow Satan will be cast into outer darkness, “where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.73" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 133:73</a>.) How terrible to live in such a place of darkness and cold. It is entirely different from what we usually think of as “burning in hell.” That burning is the lasting regret one feels who has chosen the darkness of Satan in preference to the light of Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/light-and-truth.p5" pid="mq24yePZQ0-i1Ij7sdoP7Q" hash="ALRcAg">Through modern revelation we have been taught that “the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.” Such light and truth forsake the evil one.

Therefore, the spirit is more powerful than the body and is able to control the body. Sometimes we think ourselves sick. There are also times when we can think ourselves well. But there is no need to let the body and bodily appetites control our actions. The spirit within us is more powerful than the body, and we can use that spirit to commit ourselves to righteous actions. We <span class="emphasis">can</span> control the body and its bodily appetites. It is fallacious to say that we were created with propensities and appetites we cannot control. It is simply not true that people are born with such powerful appetites and passions that they are powerless to control them. God would not be a righteous God if man were created with drives he could not control.</p>

Is anything apparently more temporal than money, or any other offering that we can bring from the earth? Yet since that is a law of God, there must be a spiritual basis for it or eternal reason behind this payment of tithes and offerings. When God asked us to prove him to see if he will not open the windows of heaven to us (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:10</a>), what was he referring to? Was he referring only to the blessings of this earth and the promises of temporal rewards which come to us if we keep this law? Or was he referring to something spiritual, of an eternal nature, which I believe is the revelation of truth and wisdom, which can come to us from that opened window whereby we can communicate with God and know all things?</p>

God referred also to the “hidden treasures” of knowledge (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89:19</a>), which, in my opinion, constitute an eternal treasure, which if used will bring us back into the warmth and light of God. Those who sit in outer darkness, in the cold and misery of that existence, can never know such comfort.</p>

It is <span class="emphasis">the</span> Church of Jesus Christ. The gospel doctrine it teaches is the divine word of God. It is light. It is truth.

By applying this principle we can “succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/81.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 81:5</a>.) The most loving action the Church can take at times is to disfellowship or excommunicate a person. This statement may seem incongruous to someone who does not understand the true nature of repentance and forgiveness. And even within the Church, members sometimes have difficulty knowing how they should relate to such a person.</p>

Should I show my disgust that he or she would commit such a serious transgression, and take my business and friendship elsewhere? Should I act as if nothing had happened, or should I show forth increased interest in that person to demonstrate my love and concern? These are important questions which deserve genuine answers.</p>

I am even more concerned about the attitudes of the victims of transgressions—those who were hurt by the transgressor’s actions.</p>

Occasionally they quarrel or speak harshly one to another. But I am amazed and pleased when I observe how quickly the victim of a harsh word or action forgives and forgets. I am delighted that the offender is soon welcomed back into the fold of love by his brothers and sisters. Mother and father teach the offending child not to give offense again. So the family grows in affection.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/to-forgive-is-divine.p5" pid="ibHhZWm2D0GEEJRYB8dNUw" hash="3nWrcA">If we are going to teach our children the principle of forgiveness, we need to begin with our own lives. We must set our children a good example. In dealing with family or friends, we hurt them when we are selfish or thoughtless. But if we change our ways to avoid giving offense in the future, it is easier to receive forgiveness. Repentance is a change of behavior which invites forgiveness. If father and mother forgive each other quickly and afterward show increased love and consideration for each other, their children will quickly learn to act likewise. Repentance and forgiveness will become standards within that family.</p>

Like many good things, forgiveness begins in the home. We must remember to teach our children that even if others fail to be kind and considerate, we ought to be slow to condemn and very quick to forgive. We need not be tolerant of sin, but we must become tolerant and forgiving of the sinner. Jesus Christ gave his life to reconcile us to God so that through his atonement we can repent and receive forgiveness of our sins. We owe our Savior a great debt. Part of that debt is the obligation we have to forgive one another.</p>

That forgiveness which comes from our Heavenly Father is so complete that he will not even call to mind the sins we have committed. His forgiveness is so all-inclusive that the Lord will not even remember those sins. But there is a condition attached to that forgiveness:</p>

The injury people do us may appear at the moment to be very great. Yet, just as time heals the wounds of the body, so time also heals the wounds of the soul. As we apply disinfectants to aid in healing the wounds of the body, we need to apply love and understanding in disinfecting the wounds of the soul. To the extent we give forgiveness to others, we can expect to receive forgiveness for ourselves. It is all part of the process of repentance.</p>

I receive, organize, and summarize information for the First Presidency to use in making decisions. I must read the background material to make certain that all pertinent information is available to them. As I read the heartbreak contained in letters of people pleading for forgiveness, I realize the truth of Alma’s statement: “Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>.) My heart goes out to those sufferers in a spirit of forgiveness. And instead of dwelling on the wickedness and grief of those who have sinned, I rejoice to read how many have abandoned their sinful practices and are now on the road back to righteousness and happiness. People can and do change.</p>

Church discipline requires this action, but we should remember that the word <span class="emphasis">discipline</span> has the same root as the word <span class="emphasis">disciple.</span> A disciple is a student or follower—one who is learning. Church discipline, then, must become a teaching process. When a person is disciplined, he should not be thrust out and abandoned by his associates. It is exactly at that time that we need to show increased love for such people, to teach and show them the way back to God. It is wicked to reject a child of God simply because he made an error. We need to teach him how to start anew, to change evil practices into righteous deeds, and thus to transform his life. With repentance through service to others, he can be reinstated into fellowship or washed clean in the waters of baptism and brought back into the family of God.</p>

We must do everything in our power to help sinners to change their lives for the better. Otherwise, as the scriptures warn us, we will have to shoulder their sins ourselves. Our obligation is to teach and help them, and the sinner’s obligation is to listen and learn. He will have to bear the whole burden himself if he refuses. But regardless of his present attitude, we must never abandon him nor think his reformation is hopeless. There is hope for everyone, and we must never cease trying to help people understand that through the atonement of Jesus Christ not only the sins of mankind in general but also their personal sins can be forgiven.</p>

I am concerned with the feeling of resentment and hatred some individuals have expressed against the spouse that betrayed or abused them and their children. Occasionally a wife, for example, in a spirit of revenge may attempt to get even with her spouse by sinning in the same manner. But all she does by that tragic action is to destroy herself. Some individuals have expressed such resentment against a former spouse that they write that nothing that spouse could <span class="emphasis">ever</span> do could right the wrong he or she committed. They insist they can <span class="emphasis">never</span> forgive a spouse for the pain and suffering that spouse has caused.</p>

Even of those who were so wicked they crucified their Savior, he said: “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.34" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:34</a>.) So, when Peter asked the Lord how often he should forgive a person who sinned against him, “Till seven times?” Jesus answered, “I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.21-22" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:21–22</a>.)

I take that to mean that it is a greater sin to refuse to forgive a person than it is to commit the sin for which that person was disfellowshipped or excommunicated. The Lord went on to say, “I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:10</a>.)

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p1" pid="RVozxg1F30CYjBg_XmCNPQ" hash="cGzC5g">Many people, both Church members and nonmembers, wonder what General Authorities do. They ask me: “How do you spend your time? I know you travel a lot, hold stake conferences, and speak on Sundays, but what do you do with the rest of your time—just study and prepare your sermons?” When someone asks me that question, I feel like answering, “What extra time?” I prepared this sermon on planes and in airports waiting for planes to leave. If it sounds a little bumpy, I hope you’ll understand.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p2" pid="lwhKLqUm20mHwEZ8za9jKQ" hash="QcJdUQ">I was called to be a General Authority twenty-five years ago and had no idea at first what I would be asked to do. I was assigned to hold a stake conference the very next weekend and went for advice to my former stake president, Elder Harold B. Lee, who was then a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. I asked him to tell me what to do. His answer both shocked and frightened me. He said, “Theodore, you are a General Authority now. No one tells a General Authority how to act in his special calling. If you have questions, ask the Lord and He will instruct you.” I had prayed before, never expecting a direct answer, but now I prayed soberly and with real intent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p3" pid="n4UDUrHt60aG0ZjqbYkA6A" hash="sxmR3g">The Lord did answer my prayers—not in ways I expected, but by speaking things into my mind. But that only happened after I had studied the problem and prepared myself to receive an answer. I have been startled by some of the things that have come to me. Scriptures I had not understood before suddenly were made meaningful. Answers I had previously passed over in reading the scriptures took on new significance. I have truly learned over these years line upon line and precept on precept. I have learned to follow living prophets as well as those prophets who have passed on. Of necessity I have learned to live by faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p4" pid="y1DKhte4Q0eVk3gxjQ_Hiw" hash="OJVCuA">During the course of my service, I have been given many different assignments. Each General Authority is given one or more special duties to perform which occupy his full time. Some are research or teaching assignments; some are difficult administrative responsibilities. Some are highly spiritual experiences such as managing temples where work begins early in the morning and continues until late in the evening. All General Authority assignments require managerial ability, and General Authorities have to bring spiritual and organizational skills into financial, personnel, or other administrative work. The work is demanding of time and energy, and I often marvel at how well my associates carry out these assignments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p5" pid="q4OKu80HzESPLPc-wsokYQ" hash="FZQNrA">I am presently serving on a special committee to assist the First Presidency in bringing back into full Christian fellowship those individuals who have strayed from the fold and who now have reached a point in their lives where they feel a need to regain their full priesthood and temple blessings. Each case requires the personal approval of the First Presidency. Our committee assignment is to organize each of these cases with full information in concise form so that the First Presidency can make a final disposition of each case, based on justice and mercy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p6" pid="hdk8X4qrKkqawb8hMH1EsQ" hash="pKuLWw">I have been asked the question, “Isn’t it depressing to have to review the sins and transgressions of people involved in such difficulties?” It would be if I were looking for sins and transgressions. But I am working with people who are repenting. These are sons and daughters of God who have made mistakes—some of them very serious. But they are <span class="emphasis">not</span> sinners. They <span class="emphasis">were</span> sinners in the past but have learned through bitter experience the heartbreak that results from disobedience to God’s laws. <span class="emphasis">Now</span> they are no longer sinners. They are God’s repentant children who want to come back to Him and are striving to do so. They have made their mistakes and have paid for them. Now they seek understanding, love, and acceptance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p7" pid="9WemULTMqEutBhiM2eruxg" hash="iyuiVQ">I often wish that in the first place they had believed the words of the prophet Alma which he spoke to his wayward son, Corianton:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p8" pid="UBovmpFfSE-_wDfhbpYhuQ" hash="G6WAjA">“And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against your God upon those points of doctrine, which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin.</p>

Behold, I say unto you, wickedness <span class="emphasis">never</span> was happiness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.9-10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:9–10</a>, italics added.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p10" pid="gknNvSnbH0S9UfCMPtn-Fg" hash="bNoqZg">Just as a sewing pattern determines the dress or clothes we wear, so our present lives determine our future existence. Why do people have to go through the “school of hard knocks” to learn this truth? The scriptures and instructions from our spiritual leaders teach us how to avoid the heartache which <span class="emphasis">always</span> results from sin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p11" pid="I6eMIEh-cUiaGuexRLDtVw" hash="wqP-zA">I have had people tell or write me how much they have learned as they have overcome their sins and thus have brought new happiness to themselves and their families. But how much better had it been if husbands and wives had learned to be kind and considerate, loving and thoughtful, virtuous and true, and had avoided that heartbreak right from the beginning? Many people have done so and have been happy. Others have had to learn to do the right things the hard way before they found happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p12" pid="43HUShQ2PEeZsaYy_Xby_A" hash="kEXWhg">But the people I work with are on the road back. So I rejoice as I organize and summarize each case for First Presidency consideration. If an application from a former transgressor is approved by the Presidency, one of the General Authorities is assigned to interview that person to determine his or her present worthiness and readiness to receive back those priesthood and temple blessings which he or she possessed before excommunication occurred. Thus, when President Benson appoints me, for example, to such a task, I interview the applicant to determine that repentance truly has taken place.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p13" pid="MStgd9Q94UGorNfHwyGz5A" hash="18uvPQ">Then I take time to teach that person how to avoid a recurrence of the problem. Once a person has transgressed, Satan tries hard to discourage that individual and take away his (or her) hope of ever being completely freed from that sin. I explain that God truly loves him and that through the love and atonement of Jesus Christ even personal sins can and will be forgiven, and completely wiped away, if he will only forsake sin and never give way to that temptation again. As General Authorities, we are spiritual healers trying to help people put their lives—and where possible their families—back in order again so that the person involved, if he or she will continue to live righteously, can eventually return to the very presence of God, the Eternal Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p14" pid="-3GRZzEYak2Pi5xrrESdDg" hash="ozRTkw">It saddens me when I hear how some of our members and even sometimes our local leaders treat people who have to be disciplined for transgression. I realize there is a tendency to equate the word <span class="emphasis">discipline</span> with the word <span class="emphasis">punish,</span> but there is a difference between these words. In English, at least, the word <span class="emphasis">discipline</span> has the same root as the word <span class="emphasis">disciple.</span> A disciple is a student, to be taught. In dealing with transgressors, we must remember that they desperately <span class="emphasis">need</span> to be taught. Ofttimes the transgressor is so belligerent that it is impossible to teach him at the moment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p15" pid="ViTJiTcbfEGYjlOZigpc7A" hash="hzBx3g">However, if we can remember that he or she is a child of God, we will never abandon him or her. For a branch president or bishop to advise his people to avoid further contact with transgressors is most unwise and unkind. It is at such moments of rebellion or anger when they most need help. We should continue to make friendly overtures to them, not in a spirit of challenge or criticism, but in a spirit of compassion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p16" pid="5rYwDAvVfU6SeYOoiap7WQ" hash="nF2JrA">The more I study the Book of Mormon, the more I appreciate the spirit of kindness and love with which that book was written.

The Savior then continues: “Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.30" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 18:30</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p20" pid="qnZHLJ6Ys0GrNAHF9jc4xw" hash="Q8z_TQ">I understand that to “minister” means we should teach, befriend, and help that person to understand, repent, and return to God. If that person then repents and is baptized, that is good. But if that person refuses to repent, he or she is not yet ready to be numbered among the members of the Church of Christ. The Savior then instructs us how to treat those who have not yet repented:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p21" pid="J_2IExB_sky5Eu5WH67O3g" hash="GsO3ig">“Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.32" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 18:32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p22" pid="ZxV-UGnpCUmUmxwlq9tKeQ" hash="q_oqGw">I urge you especially to consider the problems which families of transgressors have to face. When a person has to be disciplined, remember the impact this has on his or her family. That family is already crushed by what has occurred. The family has been betrayed and abused, and individual family members often feel the taint of that transgression upon them even though they may be personally innocent. Do not abandon them in their hour of need. Never will they need friends more than at that moment. Never will they need acceptance, kindness, and understanding more than in those first few months after their betrayal. Do not widen the breach. Do not further condemn the offender in the minds of family members. That will only delay the healing process and make forgiveness more difficult. Put yourself in their place. They need strength and encouragement and often financial or physical aid. A spouse left alone finds it difficult to cope with the many changes that have to be made. I ask you just to <span class="emphasis">be</span> there—a pillar of friendship on which they can lean, a comforter and protector of the children within that family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/let-mercy-temper-justice.p23" pid="h1suWDsHo02_4UfDxmgS-A" hash="AR24AA">Thus, as one of the General Authorities, and in fulfilling part of my present duty, I plead with you to be kind to these distressed children of God who need you now more than ever. May we heed the advice of our Savior: “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</p>
