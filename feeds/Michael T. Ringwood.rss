    <div class="topic" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.t1">
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p1" pid="EUMMO-7_L0eMtvGFmAleKA" hash="tdPHZg">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="100"></span>Over the past several months I have been drawn repeatedly to a passage of scripture recorded in Helaman, chapter 6: “And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.36" class="scriptureRef">verse 36</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p2" pid="4LMPLoWSDUygtyuRCV8r-g" hash="NmqRHw">As I read this scripture during my personal study, it touched my heart deeply and caused me to reflect upon it for several weeks. I began to question if I found it easy to believe the word of God. And why was it easy for these Lamanite converts to believe? What happened to cause a people full of hatred and disbelief to have an easiness and willingness to believe in the word of God (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.39" class="scriptureRef">4 Nephi 1:39</a>)?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p3" pid="Hw6s8-qg9kCiAVn9T8F-xA" hash="dsvIoA">We learn about the cause of this change during a most remarkable year. During the 62nd year of the reign of the judges, 8,000 Lamanites in Zarahemla were converted as Nephi and Lehi taught with power and authority and had what they should teach given unto them (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.18-19" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 5:18–19</a>). Three hundred others were converted through a miraculous experience in which they heard a voice that did pierce them to the very soul (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.30" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 5:30</a>). These 300 had gone forth to kill Nephi and Lehi as they sat in prison, but the 300 found themselves calling upon God when Aminadab, who was a former Nephite and dissenter from the Church, remembered and knew they should pray till they had faith in Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.35-41" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 5:35–41</a>). Many more Lamanites were converted through the testimony of the 300 as they ministered unto the people, declaring what they had seen and heard (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.49-50" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 5:49–50</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p4" pid="St1sodnbiEeO7uzPYk3QWw" hash="jovEjg">The account of the 62nd year ends with this statement: “All these things had happened and the Lamanites had become, the more part of them, a righteous people” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.1" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 6:1</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p5" pid="HrNJJSBQh06iiy9Eq_HeFQ" hash="yEkg9w">The quality of their conversion led these Lamanites to lay down their hatred for the Nephites and their weapons of war (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.51" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 5:51</a>); they were firm and steadfast in their faith (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.1" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 6:1</a>); they kept the commandments and walked in truth and uprightness (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.34" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 6:34</a>); and they grew in their knowledge of God (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.34" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 6:34</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p6" pid="L7wR80jf0EmBJ3GpDVVY-A" hash="OseuYg">Yet most impressive to me was their easiness and willingness to believe in the word of God. This easiness and willingness to believe brought them the Spirit in great abundance and aided them to endure in faith to the end (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/15.5-9" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 15:5–9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p7" pid="0EVtvrgaCkuxe8X2wQ5OEw" hash="R3O-GA">Sadly, during this same period of time, the more part of the Nephites became “hardened, impenitent, and grossly wicked” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.2" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 6:2</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.31-34" class="scriptureRef">verses 31–34</a>). The opposite of what the Lamanites were experiencing was happening to the Nephites. The hardness of their hearts led to a withdrawal of the Spirit (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.35" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 6:35</a>), while the softness of the hearts of the Lamanites led to an outpouring of the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p8" pid="fXbpuDbSdkio3GEPD_QXkQ" hash="5UWf9Q">As I pondered what caused this mighty change in the hearts of these Lamanites, I came to realize this easiness and willingness to believe in the word of God comes from a softness of heart. It comes from having a heart that is sensitive to the Holy Ghost. It comes from having a heart that can love. It comes from having a heart that will make and keep sacred covenants. It comes from a soft heart that can feel the power of the Atonement of Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p9" pid="qU-l4yUL1kKoObfEsjeFOw" hash="vVBMjg">This easiness to believe comes from the example of others who have soft hearts and who model this easiness to believe, such as Nephi and Lehi. Their father, Helaman, named them Nephi and Lehi to remind them of the faith of their fathers (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.6" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 5:6</a>). <span class="pageBreak" page-number="101"></span>Likewise, many of us have embedded in our names a legacy of faith from ancestors who had soft hearts and found it easy to believe the word of God. Some of these were like my great-great-grandfather Ephraim K. Hanks, who, when he found out his older brother had “gone off with the Mormons,” was determined to bring him back home. Not surprisingly, Ephraim moved to Nauvoo and was baptized soon after he heard his brother bear testimony of Joseph Smith and the restored gospel (see Richard K. Hanks, “Eph Hanks, Pioneer Scout” [master’s thesis, Brigham Young University, 1973], 18–21).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p10" pid="7VbiUxPRiE6ftGA9o-Qshg" hash="M-pwDg">We are blessed with others in the scriptures who teach us how we can obtain an easiness and willingness to believe. Nephi, son of Lehi, is one example. His first act when he heard his father teach about the destruction of Jerusalem was to cry unto the Lord till his heart was soft and he believed all the words spoken by his father (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.16" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 2:16</a>). The Lord spoke directly to Nephi, saying, “Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 2:19</a>). Nephi teaches the importance of desire and diligence in keeping commandments and calling upon God in order to have the ability to say with ease, “I will go and do” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 3:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p11" pid="11EidgMd8U6tVsM2lp96RQ" hash="I7WZWQ">From Enos we learn the importance of allowing the words of God to sink deep into our hearts till we hunger for truth (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.3-4" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:3–4</a>). An easiness to believe will come when the word of God is etched into our hearts (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/31.33" class="scriptureRef">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/3.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p12" pid="-Ucp4KVXfES1TAjqNoFp-A" hash="MKLTAw">From the example of Lamoni’s father, we learn the importance of a soft heart that is willing to change. Lamoni’s father was willing to give up half of his kingdom to Ammon in exchange for his life (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/20.21-23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 20:21–23</a>). After Ammon simply requested that the king allow Lamoni to worship as he desired in his own kingdom, the generosity and greatness of Ammon’s words caused the king to be troubled in mind and heart (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/20.24" class="scriptureRef">Alma 20:24</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.3" class="scriptureRef">22:3</a>). When Aaron arrived to teach the king, his heart had changed and he had an easiness to believe, as he said to Aaron, “Behold I will believe” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.7" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:7</a>). He then expressed a willingness to give up all he possessed, even to forsake his kingdom, to have the joy of the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:15</a>). When he first prayed, he offered that which Heavenly Father wanted when he said, “I will give away all my sins to know thee” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:18</a>). An easiness and willingness to believe the word of God will come from repentance and obedience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p13" pid="Yl5N27_Y9U2wyK6t0inNkQ" hash="oG3aDQ">An examination of our lives will reveal periods when we found it <span class="pageBreak" page-number="102"></span>easier to believe the word of God. Periods of significant change, such as marriage or the birth of a child; periods of intense service from a new calling or a mission; periods in our youth with a wonderful bishop, youth leaders, and seminary teachers; periods of trials; and periods of growth from learning for the first time about the gospel are all periods of an easiness to believe. Perhaps the most significant period is childhood. As a child I found it easy to believe the word of God taught to me by valiant parents and grandparents. No wonder we are admonished to become as little children to inherit eternal life (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.38" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 11:38</a>). No wonder we are taught to “bring up [our] children in light and truth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.40" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:40</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p14" pid="mLLOJ2EvJ0yi_ynqosAPRQ" hash="yO2xGg">If you are like me, you will find what really brought an easiness and willingness to believe were not the circumstances but the commitment to live the gospel during these periods of life. You were found more often on your knees and immersed in the scriptures during these periods. You found it easier to gather for family home evening and family prayer. You found it easy to be in church and to worship in the temple. You found it easy to pay tithes and offerings. Indeed, the daily living of the gospel brings a softness of heart needed to have an easiness and willingness to believe the word of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p15" pid="FDJT71eK0k-PpIH7VEnMcA" hash="9SdkTg">My testimony is that the teachings from our prophet and apostles in this conference, if followed, will lead to an easiness and willingness to believe in the word of God. We have been counseled to worship in the temple; to strengthen families through consistent family prayer, scripture study, and family home evening; to serve diligently in priesthood and Church callings; to pay tithes and offerings; to have faith and to pray for guidance; and to live worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p16" pid="Kjw25tI5DUCkBIJRVHrqeg" hash="r5Ocig">Often we are like Naaman, the Syrian leper who was sent to the prophet in Israel to be cleansed. When Elisha simply sent a messenger with instructions to dip seven times in the Jordan River, Naaman went away angry. Thankfully, he had a servant who said, “If the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Kings 5:13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p17" pid="8akZarM-c0WtWc29fxAsRg" hash="rhIIyQ">I witness that this easiness and willingness to believe will come from doing those seemingly insignificant things taught to us repeatedly since our youth. Obedience will bring soft hearts and an easiness to believe in the word of God. I bear witness that an easiness to believe will bring an outpouring of the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p18" pid="isY2cK3iukuRJg1QNfdp8g" hash="05WeWA">A test to measure our easiness and willingness to believe can occur each week as we attend sacrament meeting. In this meeting we renew covenants by expressing our willingness to take upon ourselves the name of Christ, to always remember Him, and to keep His commandments (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>). As we sit in sacrament meeting, we should find it easy to make these covenants and easy to listen and learn through the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p19" pid="J8IJqSn3qE6qUxlpjTrqtA" hash="VUJiPg">I long to have the Spirit of the Lord poured out upon me because of my “easiness and willingness to believe in his words.” I have felt that this scripture has awakened me to a sense of my “duty to God”—that I should “be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience; … diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; … always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things [I] receive” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.22-23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:22–23</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/an-easiness-and-willingness-to-believe.p20" pid="qtghV_dN2EqTTbB7jS9Bww" hash="-4M0uw">May we always find it easy to believe His word. May you with easiness declare, as do I, that Jesus is the Son of God. He is our Shepherd, and those with an easiness and willingness to believe will know His voice. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

It really began innocently. As I was preparing to serve a full-time mission, my older brother was made a zone leader in his mission. I heard so many positive things said about him that I couldn’t help but want those things said about me. I hoped for and may have even prayed for a similar position.&lt;/p&gt;

Uchtdorf said: “Over the course of my life, I have had the opportunity to rub shoulders with some of the most competent and intelligent men and women this world has to offer. When I was younger, I was impressed by those who were educated, accomplished, successful, and applauded by the world. But over the years, I have come to the realization that I am far more impressed by those wonderful and blessed souls who are &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;truly good and without guile&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p8" pid="sHGBkxXTC0W5k0C6b_yieQ" hash="UCBAAg"&gt;My Book of Mormon hero is a perfect example of a wonderful and blessed soul who was truly good and without guile. Shiblon was one of the sons of Alma the Younger. We are more familiar with his brothers Helaman, who would follow his father as the keeper of the records and the prophet of God, and Corianton, who gained some notoriety as a missionary who needed some counsel from his father. To Helaman, Alma wrote 77 verses (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36-37" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Alma 36–37&lt;/a&gt;). To Corianton, Alma dedicated 91 verses (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39-42" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Alma 39–42&lt;/a&gt;). To Shiblon, his middle son, Alma wrote a mere 15 verses (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/38" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Alma 38&lt;/a&gt;). Yet his words in those 15 verses are powerful and instructive.&lt;/p&gt;

Alma said: “Have ye not observed the steadiness of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in keeping the commandments of God? Behold, has he not set a good example for thee?” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.1" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Alma 39:1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Helaman must have known and respected this about his brother, for he gave Shiblon custody of the sacred records he had received from his father. Surely Helaman trusted Shiblon because “he was a just man, and he did walk uprightly before God; and he did observe to do good continually, to keep the commandments of the Lord his God” (&lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/63.2" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Alma 63:2&lt;/a&gt;). As seems truly characteristic of Shiblon, there is not much recorded about him from the time he took possession of the sacred records until he gave them to Helaman’s son Helaman (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/63.11" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Alma 63:11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

He was a person who sacrificed his time, talents, and effort to help and lift others because of a love for God and his fellowmen (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/48.17-19" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Alma 48:17–19&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/49.30" class="scriptureRef"&gt;49:30&lt;/a&gt;). He is described perfectly by the words of President Spencer W. Kimball: “Great women and men are always more anxious to serve than to have dominion.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p14" pid="w1jz8WMGc0eVi_VNDIhoEg" hash="pdGeUA"&gt;In a world where praise, position, power, accolades, and authority are sought on every side, I honor those wonderful and blessed souls who are truly good and without guile, those who are motivated by a love of God and their neighbors, those great women and men who are “more anxious to serve than to have dominion.”&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p15" pid="yPC047ySF0qrmus3QYVgkg" hash="hULr_Q"&gt;Today there are some who would have us believe our search for relevance can be satisfied only by obtaining position and power. Yet, thankfully, there are many who are uninfluenced by this perspective. They find relevance in seeking to be truly good and without guile. I have found them in all walks of life and in many faith traditions. And I find them in large numbers among the truly converted followers of Christ.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p16" pid="hphQxsUGY0Wr7RCijuIZrA" hash="7aIYwg"&gt;I honor those who selflessly serve each week in wards and branches around the world by going above and beyond in fulfilling callings. But callings come and go. Even more impressive to me are the many who without formal callings find ways to consistently serve and lift others. One brother shows up early for church to set up chairs and stays after to straighten up the chapel. One sister purposely selects a seat near a blind sister in her ward not only so she can greet her but also so she can sing the hymns loudly enough that the blind sister can hear the words and sing along. If you look closely in your ward or branch, you will find examples like these. There are always members who seem to know who needs help and when to offer it.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p17" pid="1AwpcxElqUysIjoVt0LHVA" hash="W0EJYQ"&gt;Perhaps my first lesson about truly good Saints without guile was learned when I was a young missionary. I moved into an area with an elder I didn’t know. I had heard other missionaries talk about how he had never received any leadership assignments and how he struggled with the Korean language despite having been in the country a long time. But as I got to know this elder, I found he was one of the most obedient and faithful missionaries I had known. He studied when it was time to study; he worked when it was time to work. He left the apartment on time and returned on time. He was diligent in studying Korean even though the language was especially difficult for him.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/span&gt;

			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p18" pid="nlcsN0YZZ02WZjecqYJWDA" hash="cIduUQ"&gt;When I realized the comments I had heard were untrue, I felt like this missionary was being misjudged as unsuccessful. I wanted to tell the whole mission what I had discovered about this elder. I shared with my mission president my desire to correct this misunderstanding. His response was, “Heavenly Father knows this young man is a successful missionary, and so do I.” He added, “And now you know too, so who else really matters?” This wise mission president taught me what was important in service, and it wasn’t praise, position, power, honor, or authority. This was a great lesson for a young missionary who was too focused on titles.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p19" pid="Ma6hvImsX0qLc4_q6Dmwkg" hash="whfNgA"&gt;With this lesson in mind, I began to look back on my life and see how often I had been influenced by men and women who at the time held no great title or position. One of those Shiblon-like souls was my seminary teacher during my junior year in high school. This good man taught seminary for only two or three years, but he opened my heart in a way that helped me gain a testimony. He may not have been the most popular teacher at the school, but he was always prepared and his influence on me was powerful and lasting. One of the few times I saw this man in the 40 years since he taught me was when he came to see me at my father’s funeral. Truly, that was an act not motivated by title or power.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p20" pid="sWsz27OISkGYkK96O4bIEg" hash="1lN-LA"&gt;I honor that dedicated teacher and many like him who are truly good and without guile. I honor the Sunday School teacher who doesn’t teach his students just during class on Sunday but also teaches and influences these same students by inviting them to join his family for breakfast. I honor youth leaders who attend the sporting and cultural activities of the young men and young women in their wards. I honor the man who writes notes of encouragement to neighbors and the woman who doesn’t just mail Christmas cards but hand delivers them to family members and friends who need a visit. I honor the brother who routinely took a neighbor for a ride during that neighbor’s dark days of Alzheimer’s—giving both him and his wife a much-needed change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p21" pid="4KBd-UIr3kC7zEN7QIwzJA" hash="jHVgBA"&gt;These things are not done for praise or accolades. These men and women are not motivated by the possibility of receiving titles or authority. They are disciples of Christ, going about doing good continually, and like Shiblon, they are trying to please their Father in Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p22" pid="28nnuUmzn0Sb-Xb5SGfeYg" hash="bRw01Q"&gt;It saddens me when I hear of some who stop serving or even attending church because they are released from a calling or feel overlooked for a position or title. I hope they will one day learn the same lesson I learned as a young missionary—that the service that counts most is usually recognized by God alone. In our pursuit of me and mine, have we forgotten Thee and Thine?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p23" pid="90tNG2537Euri3uRrc-KYw" hash="CFSa2w"&gt;Some may say, “But I have so far to go to become like those you describe.” The good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that the desires of our hearts can be transformed and our motives can be educated and refined. When we are baptized into the true fold of God, we begin the process of becoming new creatures (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/5.17" class="scriptureRef"&gt;2 Corinthians 5:17&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.26" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Mosiah 27:26&lt;/a&gt;). Each time we renew the covenant of baptism by partaking of the sacrament, we are one step closer to that ultimate goal.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; As we endure in that covenant, we access the strength to mourn with those who mourn and to comfort those who need comfort (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Mosiah 18:9&lt;/a&gt;). In that covenant, we find the grace that enables us to serve God and keep His commandments, including loving God with all our hearts and loving our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; In that covenant, God and Christ succor us so we can succor those who stand in need of our succor (see &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.16" class="scriptureRef"&gt;Mosiah 4:16&lt;/a&gt;; see also &lt;a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.11-15" class="scriptureRef"&gt;verses 11–15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/truly-good-and-without-guile.p25" pid="IdQKGgXKmU-JgrmipVS1bw" hash="IS2VKw"&gt;I thank my Heavenly Father for Shiblon-like souls whose examples offer me—and all of us—hope. In their lives, we see a witness of a loving Father in Heaven and a caring and compassionate Savior. I add my testimony to theirs with a pledge to strive to be more like them, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;
