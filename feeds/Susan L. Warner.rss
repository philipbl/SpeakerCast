Automobiles did not have air-conditioning, so we traveled at night with a canvas water bag tied to the front of the car in case the radiator boiled over. I remember standing outside this building, singing the hymns of Zion in the darkness of the morning, waiting for the large wooden doors to open. I remember secretly hoping that I wouldn’t be seated behind one of the wide, round pillars, or worse, a lady wearing a large hat. Though I was scarcely tall enough to see, I remember the feelings that came over me as everyone rose when the prophet entered. Those feelings of excited reverence are spiritual feelings that return each time I enter this building or hear our leaders speak in general conference. I remember what I have received and heard. I remember what I know and what I have felt.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/remember-how-thou-hast-received-and-heard.p2" pid="j089f80vu0mj6fkqSDEm0w" hash="DGJzdg">Each of us has memories of spiritual feelings. Some of us remember spiritual feelings from our earliest childhood. Some of us may have memories of feelings when we first discovered the Lord’s true Church. Almost all have spiritual feelings connected with the love of mother, father, brothers, and sisters. We may remember feelings of love and belonging that have come while serving in the kingdom with our fellow Saints. We may remember feeling spiritually renewed on a Sabbath evening after attending church, studying the gospel together, and sharing testimonies. We may remember earnest feelings that have accompanied fervent prayer, the comfort of the Holy Ghost in times of trial or sadness. We may remember the sorrow and the joy of deep repentance—of feeling forgiven and cleansed. We may remember profound feelings of gratitude for the Savior’s atoning gift of love to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/remember-how-thou-hast-received-and-heard.p3" pid="8H05l5yN00mwWNXZkpP8RA" hash="Qce1mg">Remembering our spiritual feelings draws us to our Heavenly Father and to His Son, Jesus Christ. It gives us a sense of our true identity. It reminds us of what the prophets have recently proclaimed to the entire world, that “each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102). Recalling spiritual feelings reminds us of who we really are.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/remember-how-thou-hast-received-and-heard.p4" pid="x5A4do3QY0mcvdchLdfW7g" hash="JSdaHw">It is no wonder that over and over in the scriptures we are instructed, counseled, and commanded “O remember, remember.” This repeated invitation emphasizes the important connection between our recollection of spiritual feelings in our past and our faithfulness in the present. Through John the Apostle, the Lord gave this message: “Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/3.3" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 3:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/remember-how-thou-hast-received-and-heard.p5" pid="O79lAWen6Ei051Qc-GjIDw" hash="jjqo4A">Satan wants us to be slow to remember what we have received and heard. He wants us to minimize and even forget the quiet witnesses of the Spirit that have told us who we really are. Part of Satan’s evil design is to give our children mistaken ideas of who they are—lies for them to remember.</p>

In television programs, videos, and popular music, they are exposed to evil things that desensitize them, making sin seem normal and acceptable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/remember-how-thou-hast-received-and-heard.p7" pid="HGQRHGUc6EWUQKLsij5GYQ" hash="t46glw">Like all of us, our children are subtly and constantly encouraged to believe that life has no sacred purpose and that living selfishly is natural and commendable. Under such influences, children may grow up without understanding that they have a Father in Heaven who loves them, that their bodies are sacred temples, and that obedience brings good and happy feelings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/remember-how-thou-hast-received-and-heard.p8" pid="S5XoQzbfhk2GUU7hK2ZMZA" hash="gLkBRw">We can help counteract these influences in our families when we follow the counsel of our prophets and, in a spirit of love, study the scriptures together, pray, and hold regular family home evenings where we share experiences and bear testimony to one another.</p>

When we talk about these things in our families, share our feelings, and learn together at home, we build in each family member, young and old, a rich reserve of doctrinal knowledge and spiritual feelings which will come to their remembrance again and again.</p>

Enos had been given a reserve of doctrine and feelings to draw upon. He gratefully said of his father, “He taught me … in the nurture and admonition of the Lord—and blessed be the name of my God for it” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.1" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:1</a>).</p>

They are strengthened by their spiritual memories, and for them, repentance feels like coming home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/remember-how-thou-hast-received-and-heard.p12" pid="uAneh2-4_0CMX7r5y0wttQ" hash="QVxZ6w">Children come into this world pure and open and eager to learn. It is our happy privilege and solemn responsibility to lovingly teach them plain and simple gospel truths, provide opportunities for them to feel the Spirit, and help them identify and recognize their own spiritual feelings. Heavenly Father said to Father Adam, “Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto your children” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.58" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:58</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/remember-how-thou-hast-received-and-heard.p13" pid="Z8-tA1QkrkawhiXjpsT9MA" hash="JWBwtA">In our family we have tried to hold early-morning scripture study. But we were often frustrated when one son complained and had to be coaxed out of bed. When he finally came, he would often put his head right down on the table. Years later, while serving his mission, he wrote home in a letter: “Thank you for teaching me the scriptures. I want you to know that all those times I acted like I was sleeping, I was really listening with my eyes closed.”</p>

Sometimes, the seeds we plant may not bear fruit for years, but we may take comfort in the hope that someday the children we teach will remember how they have “received and heard” the things of the Spirit. They will remember what they know and what they have felt. They will remember their identity as children of Heavenly Father, who sent them here with a divine purpose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/remember-how-thou-hast-received-and-heard.p15" pid="aOTW6qsliUy0KkKpztoBHA" hash="2T006A">Each week, all over the world, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints come together and remember who they are. “I am a child of God,” sing Primary children in many languages. Young women everywhere repeat, “We are daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves us.” Young men remember when they serve and perform their duties as worthy Aaronic Priesthood bearers. And when we partake of the sacrament, all of us remember as we witness our willingness to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and covenant to always remember him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/remember-how-thou-hast-received-and-heard.p16" pid="I9wiBUvql0mgdU8kAH6EAQ" hash="-AhriQ">I recall a day when one of our children was leaving for school with his friend. I waved good-bye and called out, “Remember who you are.” As they walked away, I overheard the friend ask, “Why does your mother always say that to you? What does she mean?” I heard our son’s quick reply, “She means, ‘Be good.’” He was exactly right. We remember who we are by doing good, and we do good when we remember who we are.</p>

Have you ever counted all the things that bear record of the Savior? There are sunsets and seashells, lilacs and lakes, insects and animals, miraculous mornings and star-strewn skies.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p2" pid="L-JHMMuOgk2seVai3rzuBg" hash="I92NIw">The Lord Himself told Adam, “All things are created and made to bear record of me, both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual; things which are in the heavens above, and things which are on the earth, and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the earth, both above and beneath: <span class="emphasis">all</span> things bear record of me” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.63" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:63</a>; emphasis added).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p3" pid="icFyrZFDkUCdDUMSQtC_eQ" hash="_7WQWg">Wherever we live in this world, we see the glorious rising sun, which bears record of the Light of Christ that fills our hearts and enlightens our minds. The mighty rivers and the meandering streams bear record that the Savior is the source of the living water that can quench our thirst for spiritual things. The lilies of the field and even the smallest sparrow bear record of His generous and personal care.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p4" pid="XnDe3abye0WXEmTmcOQTbg" hash="Ka7MnA">But of all God’s remarkable creations, only we, His children, are created in His image and likeness. Only we, His children, have the capacity to develop our own spiritual convictions. And only we, His children, can give voice and expression to our witness of Him. We, His children, rejoice in our privilege and sacred obligation to bear record of Him and His gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p5" pid="TiA2OWl5KEuIT9NIG64HBA" hash="L3jqDA">Not long ago our granddaughter Susie received a copy of the scriptures. She lives in an area where her classmates and teacher are not members of the Church, so she wanted to share with them the Articles of Faith that were recorded in her new scriptures. She decided it would be appropriate to do this at school during the time that was scheduled for sharing something newsworthy. When the time came, eight-year-old Susie stood before her classmates and began, “We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.1" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:1</a>). She continued, but when she got to the seventh article of faith, one classmate loudly complained, “This isn’t a current event!” The teacher quickly responded, “Well, it’s news to me!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p6" pid="s8U_EYqPxE-R5CMATTUVUA" hash="zcnulw">Each of us can share the good news of the gospel and give words to our convictions. If we are sensitive to the whisperings of the Spirit, we can find opportunities to humbly express our beliefs. Even a shy, eight-year-old child felt the desire to share the articles of her faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p7" pid="gd54h9RnOUelq67BMJHHpQ" hash="dNcg9Q">When we bear record of the good news of the gospel, our spoken testimony invites the Holy Ghost to bear His witness of the truth of the message. It is not our words that carry the power but rather the Spirit of God that accompanies our words and confirms them in the hearts of the listeners. Nephi explained in the Book of Mormon, “For when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.1" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 33:1</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p8" pid="uLvvWfj6tUKMpmMapwhfLw" hash="yl0yeQ">When we declare where we stand and humbly give words to what we believe and feel, the Spirit also bears witness to our own souls that what we speak is true. President Boyd K. Packer said it simply, “A testimony is to be <span class="emphasis">found</span> in the <span class="emphasis">bearing</span> of it!” (“The Candle of the Lord,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Jan. 1983, 54).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p9" pid="J-hDi0NgN0O4F0wYbqaIcA" hash="LxjwFA">In a society of unstable values and confusing voices, testimony can be the means by which parents give children an anchor for their faith. We do this in our families by bearing record of Jesus Christ and His gospel with our actions and our words. We do this when we pray together, study the scriptures, and hold regular family home evenings. Around the dinner table, parents and children can share what they are learning in Church meetings and activities and their everyday experiences applying gospel principles. Within this sacred family circle, children can learn to express feelings of love and gratitude for Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, and for the blessings that come to us as we live together in families on this beautiful earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p10" pid="SYiAJ4mct0WAOtMB2bUbag" hash="Mbjrqw">Children have their own spiritual sensitivities, and they make their own observations of Heavenly Father’s creations. They are naturally interested in the worm that slithers in the rain puddle, enchanted by the sound of the ocean heard in a seashell, spellbound by the magical pattern of clouds moving across the sky. It is a delightful privilege for any of us to take the hand of a child and accompany him as he discovers this beautiful world, but it is an even greater and more sacred privilege to help a child know the Creator of this world and to bear record of the love that He has for every one of His children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p11" pid="KStFEzTd-kewpW2FYQ-ocw" hash="Y5UyaQ">When we share our feelings with our little ones and bear record of Him, we open the door for them to share their experiences and to give words to their own spiritual insights and feelings. And when we help children identify the divine source of those feelings, their understanding and love for the Savior will grow line upon line, precept upon precept.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p12" pid="6DQDm4UXeUS390DBkIindA" hash="mMM91A">As young children hear the words from the scriptures and later read the scriptures for themselves, they become familiar with a vocabulary that enables them to express their spiritual feelings. Even very young children, long before they are able to read, can feel the message of the scriptures and begin to understand God’s love for them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p13" pid="zc8oR1Lu5EyK64V-3i0Maw" hash="m4Q-mw">Bradley, though only two years old, loved to be a part of family scripture time. When it was his turn, he held his scriptures and carefully turned each page,saying, “Heavenly Father loves me; Heavenly Father loves me.” Experiencing the unfailing love of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ is the foundation of testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p14" pid="vqHxPc-2yESZQFHolU9y1Q" hash="oIBFsw">I know a grandfather who, at a recent family gathering in the mountains, took his grandchildren for a walk. As they came to a clearing in the trees, he invited the young children to sit down on a log while he told them about a 14-year-old boy named Joseph Smith, who wanted to ask Heavenly Father some questions that were troubling him. The grandfather explained that the boy Joseph went to a grove of trees near his home to pray, having faith that God would answer him. The grandchildren quietly listened, but four-year-old Johnny, who often has difficulty sitting still, could not contain himself. He blurted out, “I’ve heard that story before.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p15" pid="WJ_ujLCGYkmOhJO8Sym0oQ" hash="2TcP8Q">The grandfather told of Joseph’s sincere prayer and how it was answered with a glorious visitation from Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. As he finished, little Johnny grabbed his grandfather’s hand and said, “That was a good testimony, Grandpa.” He loved hearing the story again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p16" pid="uVju-AIyckuy8IzqPERGQg" hash="8eXVUg">Though the grandfather had repeated this sacred account many times throughout his life, he said, “Never did the Spirit of the Lord bear stronger witness than when I bore my testimony of Joseph Smith to my own grandchildren.” The grandfather and the children had felt the witness of the Holy Ghost. Like Johnny, our children may have heard the scripture stories before, but have they heard us bear our personal testimony of the truthfulness of the accounts and the principles they teach?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p17" pid="DBvrsknTEk2dqIIH3G6w6Q" hash="BFoPlQ">Who can measure the influence of simple, sacred words of testimony? Who can calculate the impact of the Spirit that confirms those words? The seeds of testimony that are planted in the hearts of children when they are young are nourished throughout their lives by hearing the testimonies of those who love them enough to bear witness of the truth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p18" pid="Xqhk73QSskC_NkVinZCeSQ" hash="aXjGiQ">Parents have been given a sacred responsibility. But parents need help. Uncles, aunts, friends, leaders, and teachers add their witness when they share their testimonies with children and youth. Several times the scriptures tell us that “in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:28</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/bear-record-of-him.p19" pid="wUSePqzJKEi0pNfq4oL9hg" hash="QSaTsQ">It is easy for those of us whose children are grown to feel discouraged and wish we had done more to bear record when our children were young. But it is never too late. My father, who passed away last year, was a living testimony to me throughout his life. But near the end of his life he also wrote his personal history in order to bear record not only to his children and grandchildren but to all of his posterity for generations to come. Nothing he could have left his family is more precious than the record of his testimony and love.</p>
