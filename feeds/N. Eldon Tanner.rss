As I have said before, I have met with men in high places in different countries, holding responsible positions, leaders, executives, and so on, but never do I feel the same as when I meet with the priesthood.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p3" guid="6257cf35-f566-479a-8cf4-ea83e6508545" pid="qUwF8TEJtUWX_Emc-QRvvQ" hash="SnGbEg">There are in every ward boys ranging in ages from twelve to seventy who, though they would deny it, are hungry for attention, for brotherhood, and for an active life in the Church.</p>

Everyone wants to be happy. It is our great privilege and responsibility to show him the way to happiness and success. Often some little thing, some slight, or a misunderstanding causes one to become inactive. There are those who are discouraged and inactive because they have felt neglected or have been offended; or they are guilty of some transgression of their own, and as a result feel that they are outcasts or that there is no place for them, that they are not worthy or wanted. They feel that they are lost and cannot be forgiven. We as leaders must let them know and make them know that we love them, and help them to understand that the Lord loves them, and that the Lord will forgive them if they will truly repent.</p>

If we had knowledge tonight that some young man was lost, if anyone knew of someone who was drowning, we wouldn’t hesitate one minute to do all in our power to save that individual, to save the one who was lost, the one who was drowning, the one who was in need of our help. These young men and these older men who are inactive in the Church, who have strayed away from the Church because of inactivity or for any reason, need our help and need our attention just as much. They need our prayers and our consideration, and nothing will bring us greater joy and happiness than to see one come back into activity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p17" guid="8cc77b5b-8877-4d3a-ac96-981be6822846" pid="_-KnTwSZmUWK426CXkcQYA" hash="SMRmCQ">By saving one, we might save a family. We might even save a generation. By losing one, we may lose not only the individual but a family and his posterity. The responsibility is great. Some of us seem to be very happy if we have from 40 to 70 percent attendance. If you have 40 percent attendance, you have 60 percent who are not in attendance. And if you have 70 percent in attendance, there are still 30 percent not attending, and those are the ones who need our attention, and they need it badly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p18" guid="517e4018-3c23-4920-818a-927e3f1b7668" pid="vDf-z-O5LkCEFjNQ5XH_qA" hash="9ImOWw">I was greatly impressed as I attended a stake conference and called on a bishop to speak. As he spoke, tears came to his eyes, and it was difficult for him to speak when he said, “I want to acknowledge here tonight at this meeting my home teacher. I was an inactive senior Aaronic Priesthood holder, and this home teacher worked with me. I didn’t want to see him at first; in fact, I refused, but he continued until I would let him come into my home and teach me. And here I am now, his bishop. I want to express to him my deep appreciation.” Thank the Lord for such worthy men, who will not fail to do everything in their power to save those who are wandering.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p19" guid="3e01ab1a-9325-4ae9-b558-ba9cb0834ad1" pid="Ut_j4drivUyE89Nw8gorNQ" hash="PEAB1Q">I think possibly I have told this experience that I had myself. I saw a young man when I was stake president; he was a very able young man; he had been trained in agriculture, and we needed an agricultural adviser in our welfare committee. He wasn’t active in the Church. I knew that he wasn’t keeping the Word of Wisdom, but I called and asked him to go to lunch with me one day; and as we sat and talked, I told him what I wanted of him. I said, “You are the best prepared, able young man to do this job. We need you, and you need activity.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p20" guid="141221a8-cebf-4c7d-919b-cf1da95f7be7" pid="iPBR1177IkC7a2_EQY8NzA" hash="vqFy7Q">We talked for some time, and he said, “Well, President Tanner, you know that I don’t keep the Word of Wisdom.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p22" guid="42f9abdf-5c5c-4e0b-8121-31395328beb6" pid="OH_ylkobqkegz6jOqmJuGA" hash="Ktmiag">And he said, “President, that is a different approach. My bishop came to me last month and asked me if I would take a job in the ward. I told him that I wasn’t keeping the Word of Wisdom. And he said, ‘Well, we will get somebody else.’”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p25" guid="acc0b837-0785-4f77-97f8-eedd911de94f" pid="2pcK0RhS1k-2YClUGIXvPw" hash="ZMd-_Q">I said, “Yes, that is exactly what I mean. Any leader must be a leader, and you must be an example. If you were taken into a stake committee, we would expect you to live the gospel the way a man should live it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p26" guid="4f7ba3e6-f2a9-467d-b514-ebfea54a525c" pid="kNRNQLR-iU6ZII_seUAz9Q" hash="s8cITw">He said, “Well, then, I shall have to think it over.” I said, “You think it over.

He didn’t call me the next day, and he didn’t call me the next day, and he didn’t call me the next day—and he didn’t call me the sixth day. And I thought, well, he doesn’t want to admit that he can’t keep the Word of Wisdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p29" guid="281763d0-8769-459b-83bb-133cd1a8098c" pid="AB5VotBW0EmdL_Mb3NWBZw" hash="eTqBeA">On the eighth day he called me. He said, “President Tanner, do you still want me to do that job?”</p>

He was a single man, but he was thirty-some years of age. He came into activity, and there was a young woman who was stake president of the Mutual, a very fine young woman, and he met her and became very well acquainted with her and fell in love with her and married her.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p33" guid="e13968da-38e8-4b4b-a5af-54444ad3295a" pid="ZqT1cdH5JkOpuDwf92OjxA" hash="DpKxtw">And then he became a bishop and then he became a high councilor and then he became a member of the stake presidency. You know, it has given me a great deal of satisfaction to know that that young man became active, and his family is active. He has children now that are active.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p35" guid="75e0b2c3-3270-40d7-8059-bcb3212d7a91" pid="-weyjgsyyE2trTUeqpez0A" hash="UPeRPQ">I would like to leave this challenge with you tonight, my brethren, that each bishop determine that within the next month he will begin very actively to bring some young man into activity; and each counselor would do the same thing; and each man who holds office in that ward or stake would do the same thing. Brethren, there is nothing more important in your whole lives than to save souls. We have programs and we have planning outlines for teachers, and we give them teacher helps, and all those things to take care of those who are attending, but I fear too often we are forgetting and neglecting and ignoring those who are not always there, satisfied to say we had 50 percent or 60 percent in attendance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p36" guid="3767b161-d04c-4fb7-917e-e4073cd8826a" pid="LK6DcVz9xU24CiZX2n2PqQ" hash="7MIVTA">I don’t care at all for percentages or statistics, but I do care for that boy and the outside young man, and I appeal to you tonight, my brethren, every one of you who is holding the priesthood of God, and particularly those who hold office in the Church, to set about to do as the Lord said, to find that lost sheep, bring him back into the fold, so that you will find joy with him when you meet your Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p37" guid="10d23b02-b961-4909-83a9-f902dd01fbb7" pid="ZSSAEWs-90CDfWqFvWMrgw" hash="uRgXTA">And to you young men, there is no fun in being lost, and you can keep from being lost if you will honor your priesthood all the time and help the boys who are having difficulty to honor their priesthood, that they might be happy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/search-for-the-wanderers.p38" guid="85537be8-7ff4-438c-85c2-e5da1e968426" pid="D8xCueIzD065uW1pzUcKDA" hash="-FnmaA">I bear you my testimony, my brethren, that we hold the priesthood of God. This is his church and kingdom. He has given us the responsibility of teaching and helping to save our fellowmen. May we do it in a way that will be acceptable to him, which will bring joy to us and help to prepare us for eternal life, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

A survey of the historical landscape in the light of our existing knowledge shows that, up to date, history has repeated itself about twenty times in producing human societies of the species to which our Western society belongs, and it also shows that with the possible exception of our own, all these representatives of the species of society called civilizations are already dead or moribund. Moreover, when we study the histories of these dead and moribund civilizations in detail, and compare them with one another, we find indications of what looks like a recurring pattern in the process of their breakdowns, declines, and falls. We are naturally asking ourselves today whether this particular chapter of history is bound to repeat itself in our case. Is that pattern of decline and fall in store for us in our turn as a doom from which no civilization can hope to escape?”</p>

He said: “As I approached his bedside he grasped my hand and through an oxygen mask, though gripped with pain and breathing in a labored manner, he muttered, ‘Oh, Doctor, can you save me? I have so many things I have been putting off and wanting to do.’</p>

Are we thinkers or are we doers? How many of us procrastinate the really important decisions in life? Will we be found wanting when we too are at the crossroads of life and death?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/choose-you-this-day.p39" guid="1433ee20-41b2-454d-9ab9-515d33709c84" pid="Gsy5FDmGYUGp-LA3HXM6Kg" hash="83ODag">This is a serious and urgent question indeed. We are all nearing the crossroads of life and death ourselves. How fortunate we are to be able to make a choice. What a glorious thing it is to know that we can choose our course, write our destiny and determine our blessings. It is not too late to choose. The choice is ours, but we must choose <span class="emphasis">this day </span>whom we will serve.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/choose-you-this-day.p41" guid="0e20246c-139c-4a86-ba01-0ed01b54de98" pid="5EriTy_5z0yId6AGRusGVg" hash="hqCcaw">“For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16-17" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16–17</a>.)</p>

As Richard L. Evans so beautifully stated: “Our Father in heaven is not an umpire who is trying to count us out. He is not a competitor who is trying to outsmart us. He is not a prosecutor who is trying to convict us. He is a loving Father who wants our happiness and eternal progress, and who will help us all he can if we will but give him in our lives an opportunity to do so.”</p>

In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

It is a privilege and blessing to all who have been here and to those who have listened in and who will apply what they have heard. Our challenges and our opportunities and our blessings are great and unnumbered; there is no greater power in all the world than the power of God delegated to the priesthood holders of the Church, if we will but magnify the priesthood which we hold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p2" guid="6b7e2675-7ffe-4f71-8299-7d7d70b4e159" pid="L48_plhN9E2109eI_hYEvg" hash="m9Jv9Q">Sister Tanner and I have just returned from visiting four missions and one stake in Japan, all of which are presided over by Japanese. One couple are natives who were born and raised there, who have filled missions in Japan, and who are doing a great job. We visited the mission in Korea and the one in Hong Kong, each of which is presided over by Americans who had filled missions only ten or twelve years ago; in fact, six of the mission presidents have served in the areas where they now preside, and five of the wives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p3" guid="85e8d856-e291-4371-b910-f7d6fc552423" pid="ZnaCd_qsdUK0QOsx77qTqA" hash="6J9ozQ">It thrilled me to see the marvelous work being done by the missionaries throughout these great countries, to see the growth of the Church, the quality and devotion of the members, old and new, most of whom are young people twenty to thirty-five years of age.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p4" guid="4abd484f-9701-4667-94f7-68e223b82fb4" pid="uICtfccXJUil6-QFlVQ1VA" hash="kFCirA">Outstanding leaders were observed in every mission and in the stake, and great strides are being made. We had from 300 to 1,000 people attending the meetings of the members, and one cannot help but have every confidence in the future growth and strength of the Church there. There was a great spirit in every meeting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p5" guid="a7ddbfa5-39c1-4bad-952c-7b5c5675f9b0" pid="iyCs_BQcekiUMZBEfkIE9Q" hash="ojq-hw">Impressions I received while I was there were that these are devoted, able, humble, prayerful, effective missionaries; boys who have developed into men; men with courage, understanding, and leadership ability; ambassadors of the Lord, admired, loved, and respected by the members, carrying heavy responsibility, filling all or any leadership positions and training others to fill these positions, such as branch presidents, heads of auxiliaries, and teachers; baptizing, confirming, and ordaining, etc., encouraging and strengthening the weak, administering to the sick. One bore testimony of a miraculous healing that he experienced where he was the one who gave the blessing to his father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p6" guid="9d953181-db0e-441e-9aac-10c5f39f58cb" pid="qkznj_B2ME-VwgM9VdlUrA" hash="jgVOhg">They are men and women with testimonies who have met and overcome temptation and evil; men who will come home prepared and ready and able to accept any position in a ward or stake; men who have felt important and have been important; men who will strengthen, inspire, and give leadership to your wards and stakes and inspire your youth if you will just give them an opportunity to do so; men deeply concerned about inactive members; men deeply concerned about anyone who has a problem and who are trying to help him solve it. This is one group of men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p7" guid="3ce41508-ec5f-4d94-9bc1-74b3f5569109" pid="8lRJenE8D0qRCyaZBMPhgQ" hash="7abyCg">I would like to refer to the servicemen. We met some while we were in Korea and in Osaka, and many of these young men are doing a tremendous work in the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p8" guid="5b3fa616-70c8-4d10-ade4-7c7f6d1f60be" pid="wY8ydzfjrkqMdWH83vNsBg" hash="aGsSQQ">When I was speaking to newly called missionaries, I asked for all who were twenty-four years of age to stand, because that is the age Joseph Smith was when the Church was organized. Five stood at this meeting, and I asked one of them to come up and tell us how he happened to come into the Church, and to bear his testimony. He said he was in the armed services in Vietnam, and that while there he met some of our young men, one in particular who was living and teaching the gospel, and as a result this young man is now a member of the Church. He explained the great difference it had made in his life, how he had repented of what he had done, and how he came to understand the purpose of life. And then I asked the other four. Two of them told the same thing in bearing their testimony—that they had joined the Church while in the armed services. It was a thrilling experience to realize the effect of young servicemen who were devoted, who had testimonies of the gospel and the courage to live and teach the gospel and bear testimony, while in the armed services.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p9" guid="51b23f04-f5c1-4ef7-b524-b91d07984e3b" pid="eXbGSgg8E0u1NPfUp7dv4w" hash="Q0CLZg">It was thrilling to see in the stake and missions how missionaries were able to bring people into the Church, people who regard them very highly. One convert was a university professor; another, a successful businessman; two, outstanding doctors, one of whom was a heart surgeon. It was most humbling to see how these men praised the work of the young men who had brought them into the Church and influenced their lives, and they bore testimony of the great things that the gospel has done for them since they joined the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p10" guid="d9026ddc-b36a-48af-bf00-553716f7d1e1" pid="9In0JfU3kUi5dhyxCWs55g" hash="HgSawA">I was greatly impressed by the leadership in each and every mission and in the stake.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p11" guid="d6c2ceec-fb09-4d85-b97f-2946affe6958" pid="7th9WjBJmkynJ4v6_OePrA" hash="BuBNaQ">I appeal to the bishops and stake presidents to see that these young men, when they return from their tour of duty, have an opportunity to serve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p12" guid="8af8dbec-aee6-4b03-afe8-7b2cfdd4869e" pid="clCkAG4Arkuud4HhisHBjw" hash="j-yc8A">And to the young men: Your study and your devotion and experience have prepared you for real service in the work of the Lord. Thank the Lord for the privilege you have had of testing in your lives and improving your testimony. Never feel that you have finished or completed your tour of duty in church service. You have only prepared yourself to be of further service in the work of the Lord. Seek and accept opportunities to serve. Never return to the old gang. Be an example. Let the young girls and boys see what a mission will do for a young man, and never let them down. These youth in the wards and stakes, when you return, will look up to you and expect great things of you; and if you live as you should, you will influence their lives for good, as much as you have the lives of those with whom you have come in contact when you were in the service—the service of your country or the service of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p13" guid="4c777107-0e2b-4b48-9fe8-58f44629e7c1" pid="nT_Ufple40C0FpmigkxOcg" hash="o-Gz3w">Encourage these young men with whom you meet when you come home to prepare themselves for missions, temple marriage, and the blessings that are available to faithful members of the Church. Help them to overcome evil and temptation, to appreciate the priesthood that they hold, and to sustain their leaders. That is the thing I hope these returning men will do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p14" guid="0d09eee5-0ef5-4175-8af0-fcfc04acbadb" pid="7LsFPHD21UqIxa2JCgONFw" hash="iw_VJw">Magnify your priesthood at all times. Honor and uphold one another. Never, never submit to temptation. Honor womanhood and virtue with your life, if necessary. Never become discouraged or quit. As you continue in active church service you will be more successful, more highly regarded, and happier than you will in any other way. And I want to promise you, my young brethren, that if you will seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and be prepared to serve the Lord wherever you can, the Lord will bless you with greater success and happiness and contentment than you could possibly enjoy otherwise. You will do better in your school work if you will be active in the Church, and you will be an influence for good in the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p15" guid="6fe731e2-ec5f-4960-82a2-aaa3953d0934" pid="ITX-YqkpDEmyejD4LhzL1A" hash="hXObLQ">A man with whom I am associated as a director in a large company said to me the other day (he is representing the government now, and he has been a very successful businessman in the lumbering industry): “We asked for applicants who were prepared to accept a certain job in the government. We had many applicants, and we got them down to ten, and as we were considering those ten, we noticed that one of them was a member of your church, and we took him just like that.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p17" guid="4b37236c-562c-4b57-9b2c-e73cc420d453" pid="hTYfj0xALkifznab68X48w" hash="k4I0LA">He said, “Because we knew that he wouldn’t be carousing at night; we knew that we could depend upon him, and we knew that he would do the work assigned to him.” And I thought, what a tremendous thing if our young men would all just realize that that is true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p18" guid="2de0cc5b-ce02-48ef-86e6-9fdd0fdfb50b" pid="KKJZ21WiXUGVsTBGIO4L-w" hash="lFFSkw">I could read you a letter here tonight that I read to the Regional Representatives, and I think I should read parts of it, at least. Maybe I can tell you what is in it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p19" guid="78dbc892-2cd6-4dd1-a9fb-92324103c37a" pid="DTjpPvgP10G03vMNPi4g-g" hash="FpSKvQ">The president of the Korea Mission, when I was over there, was telling me of the problems they have with young men in the service because the bishops were not sending the recommends for two or three months after they had arrived. He said that our servicemen do not enjoy—in fact, they resent—being there, and they become lonesome, and there are prostitutes there in great numbers. In fact, he told me that it was a common thing for these soldiers to have a prostitute companion. He told me an experience where one of our priests who was lonely, who had not been too active, became involved with one of these prostitutes. And then one of our young men who was living the gospel and who was interested in trying to save these young men contacted him, worked with him, and finally got him to acknowledge the value of the Church, to repent of his doings, and to strive to work as he should to be worthy of the blessings of the Lord. And then he said if he could have just got hold of that boy when he arrived, he could have helped him and probably prevented this tragedy. He goes on to tell of the experience with many of the young men there, and how many of them bear testimony that it was because somebody met them and worked with them, and gave them companionship and love, that they were able to withstand the temptations so prevalent there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p20" guid="28f3bc20-0718-4ef4-a7e3-79e84a7ef9b2" pid="GKcV6KEWkUqS0-ixd7S7Bw" hash="4Q_jmg">So, brethren, you bishops and stake presidents, when these young men leave home to go to school, be sure that you send the recommends and the information you have regarding them to that university or college. When they go into the armed services, for goodness’ sake, for the sake of these young men, be sure that you are not too busy and that your interest is keen enough to do all in your power to try to save these young men who are going into the armed services. Send information ahead of them to the group leaders or other proper people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p21" guid="7c8b49c7-d254-4e93-b2b6-619679f0a85e" pid="yls3oLKBuEe9zXssv4LoVQ" hash="I4QLXw">As for these missionaries, when they return, and the young men who are preparing, be close to them. Let your influence be felt. Encourage them. They are on fire when they return from a mission. You know when they are returning. Meet them, greet them, love them, and give them an opportunity to work. I have heard several examples of this—one just last week. A mother said to me, “When my boy returned from his mission, he wasn’t given an opportunity to speak in the ward, he wasn’t approached by the bishop other than to say, ‘Hello, it’s good to see you home,’ and no one seemed to take an interest in him.” Then she said, “I really had to work with that boy to keep up his interest and activity in the Church.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p22" guid="df9dea9b-c168-4dd3-a5d6-17128a8f0a18" pid="cVlH3rM7dkC-zC0USkpwoQ" hash="yOEGRw">Brethren, you who are returning from these armed services and school and missions, report to your bishops and offer yourselves to be of service. And bishops, I appeal to you to see that when these young people leave your ward, you send on information to the proper officials in schools, universities, and the armed services, so that they might know and be able to give the necessary help and encouragement when they arrive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/continuity-of-service.p23" guid="a552ee98-634c-4132-a042-277a090285af" pid="s13_2DyDxku5YpwJyX5OlA" hash="pPPuvg">May the Lord bless us that we might realize the importance of a soul; that right in our midst we have people needing attention and help, and it is our responsibility to keep them active, to encourage them, and to reach them if they are having problems. May we realize that the priesthood of God is the power of God given us to act in his name. May we do it wise]y, humbly, effectively, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

I sincerely pray that the Spirit and blessings of the Lord will attend us as we discuss the significance of God’s first question to Adam, “Where art thou?”—a direct and searching question that applies to every one of us today.</p>

Temptations come to all, but long before we are faced with them, we and our children must have determined what our course will be.

In fact, it is so general that one would think that gossiping about and judging others was the thing to do.

McKay, when she began teaching school. As the principal introduced her to the class, he pointed to a certain boy and said he was a troublemaker. She sensed the boy’s embarrassment and feared he would live up to his reputation, so she wrote a note and slipped it to him as she passed his desk. It said, “Earl, I think the principal was mistaken about your being a bad boy. I trust you, and know that you are going to help me make this room the best in the school.” Earl not only became a paragon of scholastic virtue but also one of the town’s most important people.</p>

One of our most respected community-minded citizens began to act as though his feelings had been hurt and to stay away from socials where, in the past, he had gone and taken a most active part. People started accusing him of being a sorehead, a poor sport, antisocial, etc., and even evaded him whenever possible. Later, a medical diagnosis showed he was suffering from a brain tumor, which had been the cause of his lack of interest in activities that he had previously attended and even sponsored.</p>

First, a bishop who needs additional officers sees a member of his ward who, though not active, seems to have ability, but he says to himself, “Oh, he wouldn’t be interested. He wouldn’t want to accept a position.” So he does not approach him, and the man remains inactive for years.</p>

You would think he would know better.” Here he is judging the bishop without the facts, which, if known to him, would be full justification for the action taken. The man’s judgment was not only unrighteous, but it had probably prejudiced his children and caused them to lose respect for the bishop and had weakened their faith.</p>

By referring to Samuel’s experience while choosing a king, we may get a better understanding of the fact that man is not qualified to judge. The Lord had rejected Saul as king of Israel and instructed the prophet Samuel to choose a new king. He told him to go to the house of Jesse, who had eight sons, and that while there the anointed one would pass before him and Samuel would know who was to be chosen. When the first son, Eliab, came before him, Samuel thought he was the chosen one, but the Lord refused him and then gave the prophet Samuel the key as to how to judge:</p>

Because of a different environment, unequal opportunity, and many other things, people are not in the same position. One may start at the top and the other at the bottom, and they may meet as they are going in opposite directions. Someone has said that it is not where you are but the direction in which you are going that counts; not how close you are to failure or success but which way you are headed. How can we, with all our weaknesses and frailties, dare to arrogate to ourselves the position of a judge? At best, man can judge only what he sees; he cannot judge the heart or the intention, or begin to judge the potential of his neighbor.</p>

It is hard to understand why we are ready to condemn our neighbors and our friends on circumstantial evidence while we are all so determined to see that every criminal has a fair and open trial.

The tongue is the most dangerous, destructive, and deadly weapon available to man. A vicious tongue can ruin the reputation and even the future of the one attacked. Insidious attacks against one’s reputation, loathsome innuendoes, half-lies about an individual are as deadly as those insect parasites that kill the heart and life of a mighty oak. They are so stealthy and cowardly that one cannot guard against them. As someone has said, “It is easier to dodge an elephant than a microbe.”</p>

These lessons will have been well taught if parents can bring up their children without prejudicing them by precept or example against any other children on the grounds of color, race, religion, social status, or intellectual capacity, and if they teach them to love the Lord.

I thought this might be of interest to the Aaronic Priesthood as well as others. First, I wish to explain how, following the death of the President of the Church, a new president is chosen, ordained, and set apart and the presidency is reorganized, following which they are sustained in a solemn assembly by the quorums of the priesthood and by those members of the Church present at general conference, as they were yesterday, and then by members throughout the Church in their stake conferences. Also, I shall refer to some of the authority, duties, and responsibilities of the President.</p>

He was certainly a true servant of the Lord and a prophet of God, who from his childhood lived to the best of his ability the teachings of the gospel and kept his covenants. He was a man without guile, and his passing was as near a translation as possible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p15" guid="000c9dd6-384f-4d46-b8d8-fe89eaae2c95" pid="kmxIlq2Q40eCnMZ-x4YwbQ" hash="380Bpw">The Thursday before his death he gave a powerful address to the seminar of the Regional Representatives and Mission Representatives assembled in Salt Lake City. Sunday, July 2, the day of his death, he attended his Sunday meetings in his ward and participated as usual. He returned home, and after his evening meal he sat in his favorite chair talking to his daughter and quietly passed from mortal life.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.23-24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:23–24</a>.) The Church, therefore, is never left without a presidency. The President of the Quorum naturally is the chief or executive officer, and the Twelve continue as the presidency of the Church until such time as the First Presidency is reorganized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-priesthood-and-its-presidency.p17" guid="708205e2-642b-4100-b4ee-73bac66cad2e" pid="JCwuGDW5skeUAQYgLpE9FA" hash="NeTUHw">While Joseph the Prophet was President of the Church, the Lord through him bestowed all of the keys of the priesthood upon the Quorum of the Twelve with equal authority with the First Presidency. Therefore, with that authority, following the death of Joseph the Prophet, the Twelve, with Brigham Young as President of the Quorum, presided over the Church for a number of years. Finally they were moved upon by the Holy Spirit to reorganize the First Presidency of the Church with Brigham Young as President and with Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as his counselors. In reality this organization might have been effected within twenty-four hours after the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>

When at last he became convinced it was his duty and was necessary in order to carry out the purposes of the Lord, he, with the Twelve, reorganized the presidency of the Church.</p>

He desired it understood that in all future times if the President of the Church should die and thereby the First Presidency become disorganized, it would be the duty of the proper authorities of the Church to proceed at once, without any unnecessary delay, to reorganize the First Presidency, which procedure has since been followed.</p>

At this meeting we called upon the Lord in solemn prayer. Then each member of the Twelve, starting with the junior member, was called by the President of the Quorum to express his feelings regarding the matter at hand.</p>

Lee as President of the Church, which motion was duly seconded and put to the Twelve, and carried unanimously. President Lee responded to the nomination and the action of the Twelve, accepting the high and holy calling. He then nominated, for the consideration of the Twelve, N. Eldon Tanner as first counselor and Marion G. Romney as second counselor. This was unanimously approved.</p>

Kimball as senior member of the Twelve, was nominated and approved as President of the Quorum of the Twelve. Following this, President Kimball joined with other members of the Twelve as they placed their hands upon the head of President Lee and ordained him and set him apart as President of the Church and as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, and Trustee-in-Trust for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Lee then set apart President Tanner and President Romney as his counselors and President Kimball as President of the Twelve.</p>

I am most thankful unto the Lord for the signal privilege I have had of associating so closely with and laboring under and sustaining three of the prophets of God and to see how the Lord works through them. I humbly pray continually that I may serve in an acceptable manner unto the Lord and to them.</p>

And while I am speaking of love, I should like to express my love for the members of the Council of the Twelve and the other General Authorities, and for all members of the Church.

The Lord has certainly prepared him for this high and holy calling by giving him responsibilities in stakes, as director of the welfare program, and for more than thirty years as a member of the Council of the Twelve. President Lee has proven his faithfulness, dedication, and ability, as referred to by Brother Hinckley here tonight and by many of the speakers during our conference thus far. He has been chosen to preside over the Church in one of the most critical periods of time in the history of the world. He is a prophet of God and speaks the will of the Lord. President Joseph Fielding Smith made this astute observation at the solemn assembly where he was sustained as President of the Church:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/warnings-from-outer-space.p3" guid="535f902f-cadc-46fd-828b-870f3eac1b3c" pid="siaWYJNF_k6KgYsNFAQ73w" hash="h-1Cng">“A German astronomer believes that ‘the earth’s young civilization is now approaching its first great crisis because of its newly found powers of self-destruction,’ and ‘man’s best hope of avoiding disaster is to listen hard for radioed advice coming from far out in starry space.’</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/warnings-from-outer-space.p5" guid="91fe329d-d501-4cec-9042-5e1fde6b3ee3" pid="UBXr7lZFYEmzgKMhcpbafQ" hash="r2Om8g">“What an astute observation! Yet, for thousands of years the Master Creator from his world has been trying to get his earth people to listen hard for advice and wisdom. Either they haven’t tuned in or they have been dull of sight and hearing. There have been many messages from other worlds.” (Church Information Service, September 1970.)</p>

The first instance is where the Lord God appeared to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden; and after they were driven out of the garden, they called upon the name of the Lord, and though they did not see him, they heard his voice. He gave them commandments that they should worship the Lord their God and offer sacrifices unto him.</p>

And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</p>

This is an evidence that, as Amos said, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>.)</p>

Especially have men through the ages refused to accept prophets of their own time, and many of them have been persecuted, ridiculed, and slain.</p>

You will remember what the Savior said to the multitude when denouncing the Scribes and the Pharisees:</p>

Throughout the ages these messages have come to the inhabitants of the earth from a loving Father whose spirit children we are. They are for our benefit and blessing. He is interested in us and wants us to succeed and be happy in this life and throughout eternity. He created the world and sent us here and knows what is best for us, and through his prophets and his Son Jesus Christ he has given us the plan of life which will lead us to salvation and exaltation. God’s love for his children and his desire to direct them are evident in so many ways.</p>

You will recall that Pharaoh was troubled by a dream he had, and learned that Joseph might be able to interpret it, so he sent for him, saying, “I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.”</p>

Because of Joseph’s faithfulness and his responsiveness to inspiration and revelation, he found himself in a position where he was able to save his family when his father, Jacob, sent his other sons to buy corn from their brother whom they had sold into Egypt.</p>

Prophecies concerning the birth, mission, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus Christ are foretold many times by different prophets, both in the Bible and in the Book of Mormon, some of them hundreds of years before his birth. We have the words of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Lehi, Alma, and many others prophesying of this great event.</p>

He beheld Mary, the mother of Jesus, bearing a child in her arms, even the Lamb of God, the Redeemer of the world.

In his overruling providence he has prepared a way for us to gain immortality and eternal life, which Jesus said was his work and his glory. Before and since Christ’s great sacrifice for us the message has been revealed through the prophets that we must be obedient to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, and by repenting of the sins of the world, we can gain exaltation.</p>

Man has a long way to go before he comes into the realm of inhabited planets. Yet there is such a thing as space communication. Man has spoken to God and received answers from him. Such messages have been coming for the benefit and blessing of the inhabitants of the earth for upward of 6,000 years.” (Ibid.)</p>

Next in importance to mankind was the restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. God called to him and he listened, and through revelation he brought forth a sacred record containing the gospel in its fullness, which with the Bible and modern revelation gives the world the same plan of life and salvation as given by Jesus when he was upon the earth.</p>

At the end of four years he was given the plates, which contained a record of God’s dealings with the ancient people on the American continent and contained the gospel in its fullness. He translated the engravings on these plates by the gift and power of God and by revelation, and to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.</p>

There exists this eternal law that each human soul, through the choices he makes, will shape his own destiny. Our success or failure, peace or discontent, happiness or misery, depend on the choices we make each day.</p>

Before the world was, and in a great council in heaven, God the Father presented his plan to organize and people the earth.</p>

Then Christ presented his plan, which was to follow the will of the Father and allow all men to choose for themselves, and the glory would go to the Father. Christ’s plan was accepted, and all who come to dwell upon the earth in bodies of flesh and blood elected in that great council to follow Jesus Christ.</p>

He influenced Cain to slay his brother Abel, which resulted in great suffering and sorrow. The Book of Mormon is replete with examples of the destruction of individuals and groups who refused to follow the teachings of the Lord and instead succumbed to the influence of Satan.</p>

In secular history we read of the fall of the Roman Empire; and accounts are too numerous to mention of the destruction of other civilizations, cities, and individuals who chose to turn away from the Lord.</p>

He points out that Rome did not fall because its walls were low, but because Rome itself was low. The sensuality, orgies, and gradually weakened fibre of a once self-disciplined people brought Rome down. (Speech delivered to the American Society of Newspaper Editors.)</p>

As we make our choices each day, we must keep in mind that as we sow, so shall we reap. We cannot sow seeds of iniquity and reap a harvest of blessings. Let me relate a story to illustrate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/thou-mayest-choose-for-thyself.p23" guid="3c8e149d-59c1-4479-a840-3cce47dc66cf" pid="wJZGKQoagEiAPE2hjZ7usw" hash="b8-JsA">A certain man, well up on the ladder of success, had great prospects for a very bright future. Then one day at a businessmen’s luncheon he decided that social drinking would make him more popular and successful. He soon began looking forward to the cocktail hours, and then found they didn’t come often enough. Finally he became an alcoholic, lost his job, his wife, and his friends. Because of the wrong choice at a moment of decision, he had lost everything he once so hopefully and diligently set out to accomplish.</p>

They, with many others, had the courage to say no to temptation and to choose the right, and thereby save themselves and their people from destruction.</p>

It is much easier to drift than to row, to slide downhill than to climb up. Satan is constantly at work to drag us down by placing temptations in our way in the form of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, pornography, deceit, dishonesty, and flattery, always waiting to catch us in our misdeeds.</p>

Satan is trying harder than ever before to claim souls for his own domain. We must and we can thwart him, but only by choosing to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and making our influence an active and positive force. As leaders, as parents, as teachers, and as neighbors, all good people everywhere who are striving for liberty and freedom, peace, success, happiness, and for eternal life with our Father in heaven must by example and precept be actively engaged in fighting against those forces which are threatening us and endangering our well-being and that of our children.</p>

In promoting a permissive and unrestricted society, they would have a child undisciplined for misbehavior. This is a false premise, and we are better advised to heed the counsel of the Lord when he said:</p>

Parents have to determine the child’s readiness to assume responsibility and his capacity to make sound decisions, to evaluate alternatives, and the results of doing so. While we are teaching them, we have the responsibility to discipline them and to see that they do what is right. If a child is besmudged with dirt, we do not let him wait until he grows up to decide whether or not he will bathe. We do not let him wait to decide whether or not he will take his medicine when sick, or go to school or to church. By example, persuasion, and love we see that he does what we know is best for him. We cannot overemphasize the importance of example. The late J. Edgar Hoover said that if fathers and mothers would <span class="emphasis">take </span>their children to Sunday School and church regularly, they could strike a felling blow against the forces that contribute to juvenile delinquency.</p>

They must be taught that Satan is real and that he will use all agencies at his disposal to tempt them to do wrong, to lead them astray, make them his captives, and keep them from the supreme happiness and exaltation they could otherwise enjoy.</p>

We do not want our civilization to decay and fall because we failed to keep it on a high spiritual plane and allowed it to sink to the level where the animal instincts and passions dominate.</p>

He said that we are suffering from a collapse of moral standards and the blunting of our capacity for righteous indignation. Then, referring to our Puritan ancestors, he said: “For all their exaggerated attention to sin, their philosophy rested on a great granite rock. Man was the master of his soul. You didn’t <span class="emphasis">have </span>to be <span class="emphasis">bad. </span>You <span class="emphasis">could </span>and <span class="emphasis">should </span>be <span class="emphasis">better. </span>And if you wanted to escape the eternal fires, you’d well better be.”</p>

But they don’t call it dirt. They call it ‘realism.’ Why do we let them fool us? Why do we nod owlishly when they tell us that filth is merely a daring art form, that licentiousness is really social comment? Isn’t it plain that the financially-harassed movie industry is putting gobs of sex in the darkened drive-inns in an effort to lure curious teenagers away? … Last week the screen industry solemnly announced that henceforth perversion and homosexuality would no longer be barred from the screen provided the subjects were handled with ‘delicacy and taste.’” What nonsense!</p>

Now, what must we do? If there is pornography or obscenity in bookstores, on television or radio, or in places of entertainment, if there are those who would make more easily available to the young and inexperienced alcohol and its attendant evils, including drunken driving, highway fatalities, broken homes, and if we are threatened with the passage of laws which violate the commandments of God, it is our duty and responsibility as individuals to speak out, to organize, and to protect ourselves and our community against such encroachments. We have seen how people react to the high price of food. It is far more important that we react effectively against the immorality and evil in our communities which threaten the morals and the very lives of our children. As President Nixon has said, the only way to attack crime in America is the way crime attacks the people—without pity.</p>

While many of our problems are caused by those who are deliberately trying to further their own selfish and devilish interests, there is also a vocal, misled minority which is responsible for other problems as they exist in our country and in our communities. We must be equally vocal and firm in our efforts to maintain the quality of our surroundings, where we can enjoy family solidarity, which is the strength of any nation. We must take a firm stand against the concerted efforts in many areas to destroy the family unit.</p>

Even though the innocent suffer with the wicked in many instances, all the strife and contention and wickedness abroad in the land today is because man has chosen to follow Satan instead of accepting and living according to the teachings of Jesus Christ. From the beginning we have been told that there must be opposition in all things in order that we might progress according to God’s plan for us. Again we turn to the scriptures:</p>

To assist us and guide us in our choices, to counteract the forces of Satan, and to give us the joy and happiness for which we are all seeking, God has seen fit through his Son Jesus Christ to reestablish upon the earth in these, the latter days, his church and kingdom, with the restored gospel in its fullness. He has reestablished the priesthood, which is the power to act in God’s name, with a prophet through whom God speaks to direct us. I join with thousands of others in bearing witness to all the world that the gospel alone offers the only true way to happiness and peace which passeth understanding, and eternal life to all who will accept it and <span class="emphasis">keep the commandments.</span></p>

This is the largest group of priesthood ever gathered to hear the voice of the Prophet, and when we think that they can hear this through closed circuit transmission as he speaks to them, it reminds me that we have an open conduit and a private closed circuit or wave length by which we can speak to our Heavenly Father and hear him, if we keep in tune and try to listen to him.</p>

President Romney, who is so close to the Lord, has given us some instructions tonight which, if we would follow, would help us to appreciate the priesthood and enjoy the blessings of those who magnify their callings in the priesthood. If I should say in my talk tonight to magnify the priesthood, I should like it to mean to be in complete harmony with President Romney, to magnify the priesthood in the office which you hold, because that is what we should do, my brethren. We have this heavy responsibility placed upon us when we are given the priesthood of God.</p>

I often say, “What are we going to do about it? Are we going to realize who we are, what we have, and what our responsibilities are?”</p>

The father must realize always that the family is the most important thing in his life. He should never neglect his family. As he looks after his family, he should remember that if he is going to enjoy the family now and throughout eternity, it is essential that they live according to the teachings of the gospel, and remember that “no other success can compensate for failure in the home.” Remember too that it is in the home that the most impressive teachings are taught and where the lives of our children are shaped.</p>

If all the priesthood would do that throughout the world, what a great influence we would have. Some will be saying: “What about the girls, and the mothers, and the women?” The same is true for them, but I am speaking to the priesthood and how they should act.</p>

Keep the Word of Wisdom strictly. Pray always, and be honest with one another and with your fellowmen. Study the gospel. Know what is expected of us, why we are here, that we are actually spirit children of God, and as such we must keep ourselves morally clean. And that is one thing, fathers, that we should teach our boys to do.</p>

McKay: “I am very, very proud of my husband. He is just as lovely, just as courteous, just as polite, just as kind and just as sweet in our home as he is anywhere else, and I am very proud of him. And I am grateful for him. I cannot see anything wrong with him. I pray that our brethren will try to follow his example in every way, shape, and form.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p10" guid="9df75b48-e481-4a8f-ba90-e71302882a4e" pid="3L9nulxfeEivqd9riNf4nw" hash="q0-1tA">As an example of good teaching, I remember a young man telling me one day about his parents and how they taught him the importance of going to the temple and preparing himself to be worthy to go into the house of the Lord by going to the temple regularly. As they were preparing to go to the temple, they would talk about it, and the experiences they would have, and what a great privilege it was to go to the temple, and to go regularly. When they would return from the temple, they would talk about it, and how lovely it was to see a young couple married in the temple, realizing that they could then be parents of spirit children of God, and what a great privilege it was for them to be there in the temple. This boy could hardly wait then for the time to come when he could go in and receive his own endowments, and he knew how important it was to prepare himself to be clean and pure and to go there knowing that the Lord would accept him.</p>

Father taught us to pray. It seemed that he was talking directly to the Lord when he kneeled down in family prayer. He taught us to pray privately. He was honest and honorable in all of his dealings. I wish I had time to tell you some of the experiences I had to let me know that he was honest and upright in his dealings with his fellowmen. He magnified his priesthood, and he expected us to do it. He always showed great love for Mother.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p12" guid="09220b38-ba53-4a7f-9e8e-bc26815a61a2" pid="sNOEX5VM6EqvSqNxqqGVdQ" hash="jQrwMA">He used to take us hunting or fishing, as busy as we were on the farm. He found it difficult, I am sure, to leave, but he would go with us, and he would never go on Sunday; he never thought of that. We always attended our meetings regularly with him. I remember some of my friends saying, “I wish I had a dad like yours. It is sure great to be with him.” And I can tell you that we boys—there were four of us—would rather be with our dad than anybody else because he was a good father. Fathers, it is important that you be with your boys so they can see how you live, and you can see how they live.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p13" guid="719261d0-6030-4eb1-9b1b-d28f5e6229b0" pid="ShlZ97QAHkmAp_lXphY8Xw" hash="7jPIwg">I remember Father’s placing confidence in me. We used to work on the farm, as I said before, and he would call me in the evening or early morning to discuss his plans, his program for the day, and ask me what I thought about it. Should we do this or should we do that? I felt that I was a part of it. I know now that he had his plans pretty well formed, but he showed that confidence in me. And realizing that I was part of it, I worked my head off to accomplish it, and I loved my dad for it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p14" guid="d3d1d124-5ebe-41c7-a10c-a560d5bfdabb" pid="PFtBh-PNXEGJkrFsxxdhkw" hash="_fpExg">And then I remember him saying to me one day, “You know, my son, I would rather have you helping me than any hired man I have. I have full confidence in you, and you surely do a good day’s work.” Such an expression of confidence and appreciation makes one more determined to do well what he is expected to do.</p>

We must understand that Satan is there and is real, as has been told us twice tonight, and is determined to destroy us, to discourage us, to tempt us, and to lead us astray.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p16" guid="0f6e3222-9d5a-4784-a177-1d2fa0d6e8dc" pid="C1BUWhWTFEuxPOexVtxYtA" hash="HcaAIA">I should like to repeat a beautiful experience, which is very touching to me. I hope Bishop Featherstone won’t mind my mentioning him as the one about whom I am going to speak. This happened just after they moved here from their lovely home, where they had many friends and were very popular. He had come home after work and had gotten into his lounging clothes, and his young son, Joe, said, “Dad, I wish you would give me a special blessing so that I can adjust and feel at home and be happy here.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p17" guid="f238f42c-7688-4298-a7c4-67ee187b0af2" pid="-O1b9zbprUKmtk69vwC5qg" hash="oCt8ew">His father went upstairs and changed his clothes. As he was coming down, his wife said, “Surely you are not going out tonight.” He said, “I am going to give someone a blessing.” And then he said, “Joe has asked for a special blessing, and I wanted to be dressed and ready to honor the priesthood and to show Joe the interest I have in him, and to make it possible for him to enjoy the blessings through the faith he has in me and the priesthood.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p18" guid="70163a7f-dee2-441d-9959-b9d50e2fdee3" pid="486QfW8HTU6CaUpW9RhN8g" hash="NFiyGg">Brethren, that is the spirit to have. And, of course, as he told his wife, you can naturally imagine what happened. She shed tears as she realized she had a husband, the father of her son, who would be an example and be so interested in him that he would be prepared to represent the Lord in the priesthood that he holds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p19" guid="a6df8715-19b1-4095-83cb-dd3e9b525013" pid="fzHDwsvwA0eFvMqCgHtOZw" hash="hAARjg">I would like to say just a few words to the bishops, to the other officers in the wards and stakes, including the stake presidents, and to mission presidents. We have a heavy responsibility; and especially the bishop, with his counselors, has the responsibility for the Aaronic Priesthood. Much has been said about that tonight, but I would like to say just a few words. You should know every boy by his first name. Show an interest in him; stay close to him. When you know his first name, use it. You remember when God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph, and he asked the question, God turned to him and said, “Joseph,” calling him by name, “this is my beloved Son.” (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>.) A boy likes to hear his name called.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p20" guid="1f2d19f3-bdf5-47c6-81c0-c62e424646f3" pid="0vwRoYtxEE-6Mp2nCyA-uQ" hash="Zu-gyg">Let us remember and remind our boys always, when they are officiating as holders of the priesthood, that they are representing the Lord. They can have their good times every other place and play the way they want to do, but when they are officiating in the priesthood, they should realize that they are representing the Lord, and be so dressed and so prepared and humble and reverent as to properly represent him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p21" guid="970c18c8-a9b7-4cbe-8f60-05fc5c21bc2e" pid="IPH2WOPd_kmqhKuSnXqJZg" hash="o19YhA">And bishops, it is important that we help them to understand and appreciate what the priesthood means. When I was a bishop I had six boys in my ward old enough to be ordained elders. I could only recommend five of them, because one of them wasn’t ready. We had talked about it several times, and he had said to me, “I am not worthy.” He felt very bad about it, but he didn’t expect to be recommended to the stake president. His uncle came to me and said, “You are surely not going to hold that boy back with his five friends going forward.” He pled with me to let him go. He said, “You will be driving him out of the Church if you don’t.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p22" guid="8177e3a5-2f57-411a-9a70-2a8741aaba6b" pid="FTl0dJJqYEKV3qy-ZhdqxA" hash="8QUiPA">I explained to this man, “The priesthood is the most important thing that we can give this boy. We are not handing the priesthood out on a silver platter. This boy and I understand each other, and he is not ready to be ordained an elder.” And he wasn’t recommended.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p23" guid="66f6ec43-adb3-4d79-83c8-89839154ae80" pid="xJrUlLQDVEW3ugrv5iql7g" hash="Ue0bYA">A few years later I was attending a general conference right here on this Temple Square, and a young man came up to me and said, “President Tanner, you wouldn’t remember me. I am the boy whom you didn’t recommend to be ordained an elder.” As he put his hand out, he said, “I want to thank you for it. I am a bishop now in California. If you had recommended me when I wasn’t worthy, I possibly never would have appreciated what the priesthood is and what is expected of one, and surely I would never have been a bishop as I am today.”</p>

They don’t appreciate anything they get for nothing, and they should realize and appreciate just what the priesthood means and then be prepared to qualify and be worthy before they are advanced.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p25" guid="e3b89591-1180-4876-ba5a-8638d2c00d3d" pid="3HECYvPuX0CqSjyS1xTz7w" hash="85b5rg">By a searching interview, know that they are ready for a temple recommend, for advancement in the priesthood, for a mission, or anything that you are considering them for, and be sure they are ready. It is certainly no kindness to recommend someone when he is not ready—in fact, it is a great disservice and it shouldn’t be done. Help them to appreciate what it means and the importance of being ready and worthy. Encourage them, let them know that you love them, and do all you can to help them prepare.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p26" guid="1fd8426b-ee85-49df-9408-6a8adac39705" pid="loYCQmsp2ESsiFdzVajNag" hash="3-OI6w">I would like to say, bishops, that as fathers of the wards you have the great privilege, the great joy of directing all the affairs in the ward and of helping these young men to become the kind of young men who will be the leaders in the ward and in the stake, and someday sitting on this stand—some of them certainly will be. Help them to prepare and help them to appreciate that they might be holding responsible positions. And let me say this to you tonight: It is not possible for everyone holding the priesthood to be called to positions of leadership, but holding the priesthood of God is a great privilege, a great blessing, and it alone, if we honor it, will prepare us for salvation and exaltation, if we are ready to serve the Lord wherever we are called. The priesthood of God is something the world doesn’t have.</p>

You are judges in Israel, and you should always judge and deal with the transgressor with love and confidence, with a desire in your heart to help him, and carry out your responsibilities to deal with him. Stake and mission presidents also have this responsibility. It is important that when you know there is iniquity, you be kind enough to show an interest in the transgressor and bring him to repentance, and that is a kindness. Love all, but tolerate no iniquity. When it appears that something is wrong, it is your duty to investigate and handle all cases of transgression according to the seriousness of the case. By moving promptly, you might be able to prevent further transgression.</p>

Bishops and stake presidents must not shirk this responsibility. Anyone who says that he has never disciplined, disfellowshiped, or excommunicated anyone, and that he never intends to, has an entirely wrong attitude and may himself be held accountable.</p>

Do you hear it, you Bishops and you Presidents? God will require it at your hands. You are not placed in a position to tamper with the principles of righteousness, nor to cover up the infamies and corruptions of men.” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report, </span>April 1880, p. 78.)</p>

Experience has proven that every transgressor who is dealt with as he should be, with love and a desire to help and with the proper discipline, is able to start out anew with a clear conscience and can then and only then progress as he could not do otherwise. He will thank you for it, and as you try to help him, the Lord will bless both you and the repentant individual.</p>

You have been told what your responsibility is tonight. I want to impress upon you the importance of keeping morally clean. Prepare yourselves for the great blessings that come only through the priesthood, such as temple blessings, filling missions, and doing other things that you can do in the offices you hold. No man, young or old, who holds the priesthood of God can honor that priesthood without honoring and respecting womanhood. Any young man should be prepared to protect a woman’s virtue with his life, if necessary, and never be guilty of lusting after a woman or doing anything that would degrade her or cause her to lose her virtue. Every young woman has a perfect right to feel safe in going out with a young man holding the priesthood, knowing that he will respect and protect her in every way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p34" guid="927bfea1-f7ab-4f41-ba1f-07f8621b7c4f" pid="phDNcw5cwEqhuIpXBx1G-Q" hash="ZGgU3w">We all know that the morals of the world are loose. Though we are in the world, we must not be of it. Whether your associates are members of the Church or not, and whether or not they are transgressors, they will expect you who hold the priesthood to honor that priesthood and will respect you if you do. Otherwise, they lose confidence in you and respect for you and for the Church.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/04/priesthood-responsibilities.p36" guid="ac082007-71b4-45cb-b041-b4b948a5e803" pid="8Ar2ICVlGEyoQvq8wY8TWg" hash="Awe9Uw">No young man guilty of serious transgression should apply for a temple recommend or expect to be called on a mission or wish to be advanced in the priesthood until he has repented and is worthy of such a call. I can think of no greater disappointment, sadness, or sorrow that can come to anyone than to have a missionary who is not worthy, not dedicated, and guilty of transgression, be sent home dishonorably released, disfellowshiped, or excommunicated. This is a great disappointment to his companion, and it makes the mission president’s heart bleed to have to deal with one of his missionaries who is guilty of transgression either before coming or while in the mission field, and then to have the difficult responsibility of sending him home. It distresses the parents and grieves the bishop and stake president and those with whom he has worked so closely. It is an affront to the Lord and seriously affects the life of the missionary.</p>

Assembled here tonight in these different buildings, every priesthood office of the Church is represented, and the success and progress of this church depend on you as individuals who hold the priesthood. May we prove worthy, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/obedience.p52" guid="d0df64db-938f-45d0-a6cb-65a6d3dcc4c4" pid="yL3Se8LQDU-Vh-h-3wAEZg" hash="1Czb1A">I said, “Brother, this Church demands nothing of you. It just offers you a better way of life.” He said, “But it is awfully hard.” I said, “Let’s see if it is. Let’s go and get a cigar and have a good smoke. Let’s go and hold up a bank and see what happens. Let us go and join a group tonight as they go out on a big drunk.” He said, “President Tanner, don’t be ridiculous.” I said, “All right, I won’t if you won’t.” Then I said, “Just name one commandment that you think you shouldn’t keep, or you would advise your son not to keep.” He could not.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/obedience.p53" guid="45db7627-26f6-4745-ada9-8497d7b07620" pid="KpZ1xiYPBkyc8Ktv-XYx4A" hash="rccuuQ">Regarding our tithing, surely, brethren, we should be prepared to pay one-tenth of what the Lord has given us, especially when we realize that it could be taken away from us overnight with fire or hurricane, or any other thing that might take it away from us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/obedience.p54" guid="c48ce9f8-36ba-4a3a-818c-92d9531af671" pid="1Z3eVpLrn0CaSAhSPI8aDw" hash="5Nl9XA">When I was presiding over the Edmonton Branch a man came to me and said, “I can’t pay a full tithing this year. I have had to do some building, some remodeling, and so on.” I told him that the Lord had said that he would pour out blessings that we would hardly be able to contain. He said, “I still can’t do it.” Right after the first of the year that man spent several days in the hospital with a high doctor bill, and he paid it. I am not suggesting that he was there because he didn’t pay a full tithing, but I am suggesting that the evidence is there that he could have paid a full tithing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/obedience.p55" guid="9428e229-7ddb-43d9-9adb-d25d629f21cd" pid="RjtKgqE0lk-5-2-o-2ReKw" hash="sJWkfw">How would you like the Lord to figure out his blessings on the same basis that you do when you are figuring out your tithing? If you were in deep trouble, had physical or mental illness, or your family were suffering and causing you much concern, would you want him to say, “Well now, just how much can I keep from giving him? How close can I figure this blessing?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/obedience.p56" guid="002c4fa2-fbd2-4cb7-b5dc-28c345ed3b86" pid="rqIStdsIbUyKUM-4turpsw" hash="l-PE4g">Brethren, let us be obedient to the commandments of God. Let us prove faithful, let us be an example to the world, a light unto the world. Appreciate the priesthood which we have and the calling that is ours. We have been given the great privilege of holding the priesthood and the responsibility of taking the gospel to the world. We can do it by our actions as well as by precept, which is much more effective. Only as we live and keep the commandments of God, being obedient in all things can we fully enjoy life here and eternal life in the world to come, and be able to influence the world for good, and help build the kingdom of God here upon the earth.</p>

Amen.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p1" guid="5f526494-46a0-4602-a224-bd0587998a34" pid="lR9ujBhTdESJvvRSZQv-lg" hash="WDBWDg">Those two beautiful songs, “All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name,” and “Arise, Shine, Thy Light is Come,” together with that comprehensive prayer, have made me feel this morning to bear testimony to the world that I know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, who came and gave his life for us. Though he gave us the plan of life and salvation, he was crucified. Through his resurrection it is possible for us to enjoy eternal life. Prophets of God have always been persecuted, and many of them killed when they taught the word of the Lord. What a serious situation to think of!</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p2" guid="86a9c2d4-a28b-45e6-95fd-0e9be78f9cb1" pid="rHsaeZ3fL0WcRDInoCVxow" hash="LHCwVg">Also, I wish to bear my testimony to you today that his Church, with the gospel in its fulness, has been re-established through one of his chosen prophets; that the Church of Jesus Christ is here upon the earth today; and that Jesus is directing his Church through a living prophet, Harold B. Lee. I would appeal to men everywhere to listen to the word of the Lord as given unto us by the voice of his Prophet for the salvation of all mankind. Do not ignore, ridicule, or try to destroy.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p3" guid="f17b6d90-1eae-417f-9201-902968d6d609" pid="OIusrx3HXkeNgXVgUQsYvQ" hash="57cBow">Today I should like to speak about the role of womanhood in this Church, where we have such a great body of wonderful women—wives, mothers, and single women engaged in the work of the Lord and in the service of their fellow men. They are affiliated with the Relief Society, the principal women’s organization; the Primary, where our children are instructed; the Sunday School, where the gospel is taught to all members; the MIA (Mutual Improvement Association), which is the activity and social organization for youth and adults; and our women serve with dedication and skill in various other capacities.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p4" guid="0c113943-2366-4100-841d-d7c534a52a04" pid="O6vqZRkI4UeDN9MCI_4gQw" hash="f50HrA">After I had discussed business matters with some men the other day, the conversation took on a more personal, informal note when one man said: “I have the most wonderful wife in the world.” Another said: “That’s what <span class="emphasis">you </span>think. I think <span class="emphasis">I</span> have the best.” A third man said: “Isn’t it a great blessing to have a wife you love, who loves you, one who is a good mother and homemaker, with high ideals, who believes in God and wants to help her family accept and live the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p5" guid="dd32b213-460c-4410-93d5-2467e39c4564" pid="0sA8x9F8nECGfDh-dg8ArA" hash="iQyJ6g">What woman could want any greater glory or tribute than that which comes from an appreciative and loving husband? The applause and homage of the world fades into insignificance when compared with the approbation of God and expressions of love and appreciation which come from the hearts and lips of those who are nearest and dearest to her.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p6" guid="fb294922-e6ce-4861-9d9a-fc38a1408f26" pid="0cio5Lv0FkKn-EAZ4u26Gw" hash="4yQDbQ">From the beginning God has made it clear that woman is very special, and he has also very clearly defined her position, her duties, and her destiny in the divine plan. Paul said that man is the image and glory of God, and that woman is the glory of the man; also that the man is not without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.7,11" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 11:7, 11</a>.) You will note that significantly God is mentioned in connection with this great partnership, and we must never forget that one of woman’s greatest privileges, blessings, and opportunities is to be a co-partner with God in bringing his spirit children into the world.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p7" guid="3edb359c-55f4-4164-aa43-e5f8512a14ec" pid="fMtOIQ9-QEilznhkwrlGiQ" hash="k9nXEg">It is of great concern to all who understand this glorious concept that Satan and his cohorts are using scientific arguments and nefarious propaganda to lure women away from their primary responsibilities as wives, mothers, and homemakers. We hear so much about emancipation, independence, sexual liberation, birth control, abortion, and other insidious propaganda belittling the role of motherhood, all of which is Satan’s way of destroying woman, <span class="emphasis">the home, and the family—the basic unit of society.</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p8" guid="5bc9a967-e823-48be-96ae-895be82bcb35" pid="4JtydelJzU2u_oQoJP0pyQ" hash="BGNTbw">Some effective tools include the use of radio, television, and magazines where pornography abounds and where women are being debased and disgracefully used as sex symbols—sex-ploited, some call it. Immodest dress, drugs, and alcohol daily take a tremendous toll through the destruction of virtue and chastity and even lives. With modern electronic devices of communication and speedy transportation, much more is being heard throughout the world by many more people than would be possible otherwise, and it is having its degrading influence and effect.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p9" guid="e3497435-21b8-40c8-95c8-fde774611c19" pid="PChYUmvB-0Gymd2IapH1gw" hash="vPXPig">Yes, pornography, drugs, and alcohol are available to young and old in alarming quantity, and are destroying the moral values, and further deteriorating the minds and thought processes of those who succumb to these devilish wiles.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p10" guid="ae4ffaa6-a19f-4bd0-a680-1cc793999add" pid="yLCKiMe_uUWD4pY-jFNyPg" hash="qPa89g">President Dallin Oaks recently said to the student body at Brigham Young University: “We are surrounded by the promotional literature of illicit sexual relations on the printed page and on the screen. For your own good, avoid it. Pornographic or erotic stories and pictures are worse than filthy or polluted food. The body has defenses to rid itself of unwholesome food, but the brain won’t vomit back filth. Once recorded it will always remain subject to recall, flashing its perverted images across your mind, and drawing you away from the wholesome things in life.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p11" guid="e29b70ad-fff4-4af0-a3ff-49f50237a37f" pid="wYf2GJ5aTU2Fs9cYkjU-8g" hash="QLIeMA">It is so important that our young girls keep themselves from this kind of pollution. The girls of today will be the women of tomorrow, and it is necessary that they prepare for that role. Can you imagine the kind of world we will have in the future if the girls of today are weakened morally to the extent that virtue will not be taught in their homes, and if their children, if any, are not nurtured within the walls of homes sanctified by the holy laws of matrimony?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p12" guid="05de2d2f-529d-4c94-8c5b-1c25e676873e" pid="Gh_P5XM3X0SIUHM-tSsxnw" hash="SMmyYA">Marriage is ordained of God, and we must do everything we can to strengthen the ties that bind, to strengthen our homes, and to prepare ourselves by exemplary living to teach our children the ways of God, which is the only way for them to find happiness here and eternal life hereafter.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p13" guid="c9ee5d7a-d122-40ae-a9d3-c441c30a6ba1" pid="kFeqwavbtUSmPgsPGuMjCQ" hash="W2X-Bg">As we enumerate the many important responsibilities a woman has in connection with her duties as a wife, a mother, a homemaker, a sister, a sweetheart, or a good neighbor, it should be evident that these challenging responsibilities can satisfy her need to express her talents, her interests, her creativity, dedication, energy, and skill which so many seek to satisfy outside the home. It is impossible to estimate the lasting influence for good a woman can have in any of these roles. Let me remind us all of her primary responsibilities.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p14" guid="7bdeb016-14c5-48ca-99d3-5ce122e06b7f" pid="573t6cdCc0u8-olYrBrGFg" hash="54_DdQ">First of all, as I mentioned before, she is a co-partner with God in bringing his spirit children into the world. What a glorious concept! No greater honor could be given. With this honor comes the tremendous responsibility of loving and caring for those children so they might learn their duty as citizens and what they must do to return to their Heavenly Father. They must be taught to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ and to accept and live his teachings. As they understand the purpose of life, why they are here and where they are going, they will have a reason for choosing the right and avoiding the temptations and buffetings of Satan, who is so very real and determined to destroy them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p15" guid="506d1ab5-c1e4-4afe-92a4-4a9e49ddbd16" pid="4tp2qkkCgEy35Uj5YbJB3Q" hash="rqUECg">A mother has far greater influence on her children than anyone else, and she must realize that every word she speaks, every act, every response, her attitude, even her appearance and manner of dress affect the lives of her children and the whole family. It is while the child is in the home that he gains from his mother the attitudes, hopes, and beliefs that will determine the kind of life he will live, and the contribution he will make to society.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p16" guid="f8769be3-c3b1-4662-b90b-e4d576fc3004" pid="jWq592_eJkKJlXEdWumwGw" hash="0FgFEA">President Brigham Young expressed the thought that mothers are the moving instruments in the hands of Providence and are the machinery that give zest to the whole man, and guide the destinies and lives of men and nations upon the earth. He further said, “Let mothers of any nation teach their children not to make war, and the children would not grow up and enter into it.” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Brigham Young, </span>p. 199.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p17" guid="eda54557-9968-4570-9f7d-dba96b7c4565" pid="4zSv7T3xjUOeBeOmwo7ejw" hash="s2O9dw">When the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet …”, he meant just that, and so presented Eve to Adam. (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/2.18" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 2:18</a>.) We are taught that a man should leave his father and mother, and cleave unto his wife, and that they should be one flesh, and thus is described the relationship that should exist between husband and wife. (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/2.24" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 2:24</a>.) It is said that behind every good man there is a good woman, and it is my experience and observation that this is generally true.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p18" guid="acaeb0f9-e989-4ce4-a443-04f96881b830" pid="lifDuCa0-EK9Z5bg32T2iA" hash="D_GM7g">It is interesting to note that when executives of companies look for new employees, or are planning promotions for their experienced ones, they always want to know what kind of wife a man has. This seems to be very important. In the Church when men are being considered for new priesthood offices, the question is always raised about the worthiness of the wife and whether or not she can give him full support.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p19" guid="c0bb4f23-2917-4f88-84d1-646fead4f383" pid="N3189lnaZUW8wLtGB_GaFw" hash="ms22WA">Women, you are of great strength and support to the men in your lives, and they sometimes need your help most when they are least deserving. A man can have no greater incentive, no greater hope, no greater strength than to know his mother, his sweetheart, or his wife has confidence in him and loves him. And men should strive every day to live worthy of that love and confidence.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p20" guid="0de7701c-6ed4-41f2-a078-e6ebd0018ab3" pid="Aea2UecDJ0aZ-TDsMbI4kg" hash="zaF_GA">President Hugh B. Brown once said at a Relief Society conference: “There are people fond of saying that women are the weaker instruments, but I don’t believe it. Physically they may be, but spiritually, morally, religiously, and in faith, what man can match a woman who is really converted to the gospel! Women are more willing to make sacrifices than are men, more patient in suffering, more earnest in prayer. They are the peers and often superior to men in resilience, in goodness, in morality, and in faith.” (Relief Society Conference, Sept. 29, 1965.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p21" guid="dc7dda52-2522-4e73-aa3b-c70021665e44" pid="97M1Jv-EMEmmv47oBa4XdQ" hash="O2VLJQ">And girls, don’t underestimate your influence on your brothers and your sweethearts. As you live worthy of their love and respect you can help greatly to determine that they will be clean and virtuous, successful and happy. Always remember that you can go much further on respect than on popularity. I was reading the other day of a report of a conversation between two young prisoners of war in Vietnam. One said: “I am sick of war, bombers, destruction, prison camps, and everything and everybody.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p22" guid="38eb13c5-f861-4ea2-a6fe-ab4a6484e58f" pid="2oq3v_mEcEO5KpwADtL_kg" hash="NvaPDw">“I feel much like that myself,” said the other. “But there is a girl back home who is praying that I will come back. She cares, and it really helps me endure all these atrocities.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p23" guid="1c0d8179-bb82-4eca-bb00-7f07ccdb7e7f" pid="WDHYZ-IwpkiREcoDZAwmfw" hash="kp0Mgw">To mothers, daughters, and women everywhere, let me stress the fact that because of your great potential and influence for good in the lives of all of us, Satan is determined to destroy you. You cannot compromise with him. You must have the courage, the strength, the desire, and the determination to live as the Lord would have you live—good clean lives. Girls, keep yourselves virtuous and worthy of a fine young man who has likewise kept himself clean, so that together you can go to the House of the Lord to be sealed in the holy bonds of matrimony for time and all eternity, and prepare a home where God will be pleased to send his spirit children. Then you will be able to face your children secure in the knowledge that your own example is the way to happiness and eternal progression. They are entitled to this heritage. I humbly pray that you will so live as to give it to them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p24" guid="d1d6340a-f259-4988-8095-fc813653eda8" pid="dPLMCKk_wka62HiDb5QqWw" hash="cGS2sA">The whole purpose of the creation of the earth was to provide a dwelling place where the spirit children of God might come and be clothed in mortal bodies and, by keeping their second estate, prepare themselves for salvation and exaltation. The whole purpose of the mission of Jesus Christ was to make possible the immortality and eternal life of man. The whole purpose of mothers and fathers should be to live worthy of this blessing and to assist God the Father and his son Jesus Christ in their work. No greater honor could be given to woman than to assist in this divine plan, and I wish to say without equivocation that a woman will find greater satisfaction and joy and make a greater contribution to mankind by being a wise and worthy mother raising good children than she could make in any other vocation.</p>

President Herbert Hoover gave this incentive: “If we could have but one generation of properly born, trained, educated and healthy children, a thousand other problems of government would vanish. We would assure ourselves of healthier minds, more vigorous bodies, to direct the energies of our nation to greater heights of achievement.” (Quoted by President David O. McKay, Conference Report, April 1931, pp. 79–80.)</p>

We are blessed to know the personality of God, his attributes, and his characteristics. We have been given the plan of life and salvation. We are continually directed as to how we should live so we may have happiness here and eternal life hereafter. We have organizations set up to instruct and educate us in all matters pertaining to our temporal and spiritual welfare.</p>

It is quite thrilling to me when I contemplate that each Monday evening all over the Church throughout the world our families are gathered together in their homes, and the father, where possible, as head of the house, is directing his family in a discussion of all problems pertaining to their spiritual and temporal welfare, using a manual which has been carefully prepared and distributed to each family in the Church. Where these gatherings are held regularly and properly, they are of inestimable value to the family unit, as is evidenced by the many testimonies we receive. I wish to urge every family to follow this program, and I can promise you that as you do so you will be greatly blessed in unity, love, and devotion, and will be delighted with the outcome. Of course, family prayer should be a significant part of this evening, as well as regular family and individual prayer every day.</p>

This may sound like an impossible dream, but I can assure you that there are thousands of such families within the Church, and it is something that can be a reality for every one of us as we accept and live the teachings of Jesus Christ. How fortunate a child is to live in such a home, and how great will be the joy of the parents in their posterity!</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/no-greater-honor-the-womans-role.p29" guid="758a2401-76fd-43c8-9429-3a9e8e0e1f9c" pid="UGS3Aq4NFkSQmKmTxgDrRA" hash="NlslAQ">I repeat: Satan is trying to keep us from the full enjoyment which comes from keeping the commandments of God. We must never forget, and we must teach our children to know, that Satan is real and determined to destroy us. He knows the importance and significance of the family unit. He knows that entire civilizations have survived or disappeared depending on whether the family life was strong or weak. We can keep him out of our homes by living and teaching our children to live the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, thereby resisting temptation when it comes, as it surely will.</p>

We teach that the glory of God is intelligence, and so we must all be aware of what is going on around us and be prepared to thwart Satan in his attempts to divert us from our divine destiny. With knowledge, wisdom, determination, and the Spirit of the Lord to help us we can succeed.</p>

Children must be made to feel that mother loves them and is keenly interested in their welfare and everything they do. This cannot be turned over to someone else. Many experiments have been made and studies carried out which prove beyond doubt that a child who enjoys mother’s love and care progresses in every way much more rapidly than one who is left in institutions or with others where mother’s love is not available or expressed.</p>

Children need both parents. While they are at home fathers should assume with mothers the duties attendant upon the young children, the discipline and training of the older ones, and be a listening ear for those who need to discuss their problems or want guidance and counseling. Through love establish a good relationship and line of communication with your children.</p>

There is no surer way for a man to show his lack of character, of good breeding, and of quality than for him to show lack of respect for woman or to do anything that would discredit or degrade her. It is unchristianlike, unfair, and displeasing to God for any husband or father to assume the role of dictatorship and adopt the attitude that he is superior in any way to his wife.</p>

There will be peace and satisfaction in the accomplishments of children who succeed, and in turn make their own contribution to making this a better world for generations yet unborn. What a joyous privilege and blessing it will be for those families who, through obedience and love, have prepared themselves to go back into the presence of our Heavenly Father and have it said of each of them: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant … enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:21</a>.)</p>

We were all shocked and saddened indeed at his passing. We realize, however, that the Lord has called him home to his great reward and to a different service. Following his passing, our beloved President Spencer W. Kimball was called, set apart, and ordained as prophet, seer, and revelator, and as president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

Miracles have been performed in his behalf in order to make it possible for him to be here in good health to receive this high honor and to assume the heavy responsibility placed upon him. He has been enthusiastically sustained by the stakes in their stake conferences and in the solemn assembly this morning. It is truly an honor, privilege, and blessing for me to be called as his counselor, and I do hope and pray that the Lord will give me the wisdom, judgment, inspiration, and ability, together with my determination, to serve under his direction in an acceptable manner to him and to the Lord in helping to build the kingdom of God here upon the earth.</p>

He is our Creator and the Giver of all things. He has given us a brain by which we can think and reason and learn, and he expects us to use our knowledge and the skills we develop to produce abundantly that we may supply our own needs and share with our neighbors. We are admonished to pray regarding all our personal needs and over everything that pertains to our welfare. How important it is to be worthy to call upon our Heavenly Father and ask for his help and express our gratitude for the bounties of life and all his wonderful blessings. As we pray, we should determine to use these blessings wisely for the benefit of ourselves and others, for furthering the Lord’s work, and for the glorification of his name.

Keeping the commandments and following the teachings of Jesus Christ will give us the strength to resist temptation, and we will be delivered from evil because we will not be associating ourselves with evil or putting ourselves in a position where we will be tempted to do that which is wrong.</p>

The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/14.38" class="scriptureRef">Mark 14:38</a>.) We must pray for courage and strength, desire, determination, and ability to be honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and to do unto others as we would have others do unto us. As we prayerfully and continually search for truth, we should seek after anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy.

We are further admonished to forgive many times, even seventy times seven. We should stop and ask ourselves if we are prepared to ask the Lord to forgive us of our sins and trespasses only as we forgive our friends and neighbors. How wonderful it would be if we would all forgive and love our neighbors. Then it would be much easier for us to call upon the Lord to forgive us of any of our wrongdoings, and as we repent and bring forth fruits meet for repentance, we can expect God’s forgiveness and mercy to be extended in our behalf.</p>

He then explained that the Twelve would remain and act in their place and that the keys of the kingdom were with them and that they would manage the affairs of the Church and direct all things aright until the organization of a new First Presidency. This procedure has been followed ever since the death of Joseph Smith. In this case the Twelve continued to direct the Church for three and a half years before the First Presidency was organized and Brigham Young was then made President of the Church.</p>

It is the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, ordained and organized by the revelation of God and none else. Then while these Twelve Apostles preside over the Church, who is the President of the Church? It is the President of the Twelve Apostles, and he is virtually as much the President of the Church while presiding over the Twelve as he is when organized as the Presidency of the Church and presiding over two men.” This information is taken from a letter which was written to Elder Heber J. Grant on March 28, 1887, and signed by Wilford Woodruff. This principle has been carried out now for over a hundred years.</p>

It is reported that Joseph the Prophet at his first meeting with Brigham Young said that Brigham Young would one day be president of the Church. When we reflect on the remarkable combination of events which caused Brigham Young to be president of the Twelve and then president of the Church, it is plain that long before he was born he was foreordained and chosen, just as Jeremiah and others were.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p18" pid="3ZqkJgdK3UGgUTclCwRryA" hash="qv0QCQ">When Joseph the Prophet died, it seemed to all that there was no one ready and prepared to assume the responsibility as president of the Church. Joseph had been especially endowed to receive revelation for the Church and inspired beyond many of the prophets. He was especially fitted for the performance of his great mission. However, following his death, Brigham Young, who was made president of the Church, proved to be the man of the hour. He too had peculiar gifts and endowments to do the things which needed to be done at that time. Brigham Young was a great leader, colonizer, and organizer. He was certainly the man to lead the Church and establish it in the Rocky Mountains, as previously predicted by Joseph the Prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p19" pid="8r4ui3sU4EOhPldEk6zkbw" hash="ELztyw">It is also most reassuring to see how President John Taylor was preserved. He was a man who had been a martyr, you might say, in that he bore to his grave wounds received when the Prophet Joseph was killed. Throughout his administration, there was great evidence that he was certainly the man needed at that time. The same can be said of others who followed as presidents of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p20" pid="drMRZjAUkkq2e3HkapQjQw" hash="pCefCQ">We must realize that though President Lee presided over the Church for such a very short time, great progress was made under his direction, and much accomplished, and the foundation laid for further development and growth of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p21" pid="PSodi2AGs0C3tMEM8gE5kQ" hash="naeg4w">Now we have a new president of the Church who was chosen by the Lord and foreordained—one who as an apostle has been tried, tested, trained for over 30 years, and who has been miraculously saved on three different occasions for this high and holy position.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p22" pid="-UO3aZw8X06PwxxK39ihqA" hash="sjdk5g">As we read in the <span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> “Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was” (p. 365.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p23" pid="DHtKTSq4nES0iU1nRP9A8A" hash="LiHeEg">We must always remember, as has been said so many times, the Lord calls his prophets and the Lord releases his prophets. They cannot be called or released by any other power. As I have pointed out previously, at the passing of the president of the Church, the Quorum of the Twelve takes over and the senior member, or the president of the Twelve, becomes the presiding officer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p24" pid="4IObexOyOEe37TnRRQ0IuA" hash="awHH0Q">It is significant to note just what took place at the time of the passing of President Harold B. Lee. President Romney had been called to the hospital and as they talked, President Lee, realizing that he might be incapacitated for some time, said to President Romney: “President Tanner is away, and I want you to take over and carry on the affairs of the Church.” President Kimball, who came in later, offered his services to President Romney. However, immediately upon the announcement of President Lee’s passing, President Romney turned to President Kimball and said: “You, as the president of the Quorum of the Twelve, are now in charge. I am at your disposal and prepared to do anything I can to help.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p25" pid="HdMpU5qdUUaaO05Y_yIqGg" hash="-_NJ8w">This was entirely in keeping with the order of the Church and is a great example of how the Church is never left without a presidency and how smoothly it passes from one to another. Immediately President Kimball, as president of the Twelve, became the presiding authority of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p26" pid="bfSL1K4AkUuUL1JCQT7TcQ" hash="N8CKAA">I should like to outline the procedures followed at the time of his appointment and ordination as president of the Church. Before doing so, however, let me quote from President Kimball’s conference address of April 4, 1960—14 years ago:</p>

As he is nestled in her arms, she sees him a statesman, a leader, a prophet. Some dreams do come true! One mother gives us a Shakespeare, another a Michelangelo, and another an Abraham Lincoln, and still another a Joseph Smith!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p28" pid="RGSqQqKr0UqD9ZFvviF9Yw" hash="t3onIw">“When theologians are reeling and stumbling, when lips are pretending and hearts are wandering, and people are ‘running to and fro, seeking the word of the Lord and cannot find it’—when clouds of error need dissipating and spiritual darkness needs penetrating and heavens need opening, a little infant is born.” How prophetic! (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> Apr. 1960, p. 84.)</p>

Therefore, on December 30, 1973, just four days after President Lee’s death, President Kimball, the president of the Twelve, called the members of the Twelve together in the upper room of the temple for the purpose of discussing the reorganization of the First Presidency and to take whatever action was decided upon. Those who had been counselors to the President—that is, President Romney and myself—took their respective places in the Quorum of the Twelve.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p32" pid="HtcoYcyMyE2kgBhX-UEeGQ" hash="NlCQPg">As each member of the Twelve spoke, he expressed himself as feeling that now was the time to reorganize the First Presidency and that President Spencer W. Kimball was the one whom the Lord wanted to preside at this time. The sweet Spirit of the Lord was present in rich abundance and there was complete unity and harmony in the minds and spoken words of the Brethren. The only purpose and desire was to do the will of the Lord, and there was no question in anyone’s mind but what the will of the Lord had been expressed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p33" pid="JMdukFjnKk6Y8r9Lrw83ng" hash="igV33g">Elder Ezra Taft Benson then made the formal motion that the First Presidency of the Church be reorganized and that Spencer W. Kimball be sustained, ordained, and set apart as the president, prophet, seer, revelator, and as trustee-in-trust of the Church. This motion was seconded and unanimously approved.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p34" pid="oaDtMJKaPkCgty8_pJ3GHg" hash="nJ0UAw">In all humility, President Kimball stepped forward and made his speech of acceptance, praying that the Spirit and blessings of the Lord would attend him that he might be made able to carry out the will of the Lord. He said he had always prayed for President Lee’s health and strength and vigor and for the blessings of the Lord to attend him as he carried on as the president of the Church. He emphasized the fact that he had prayed sincerely with his lovely wife, Camilla, that this position would never come to him and that he felt sure that President Lee would certainly outlive him.</p>

Eldon Tanner and as his second counselor Marion G. Romney, each of whom expressed himself in all humility and pledged himself to support and sustain President Kimball as the president of the Church and to fill his office to the best of his ability, and prayed for the blessings of the Lord to attend him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p37" pid="ADrp66ctbES8xreCDQAbKg" hash="ntpt8w">Following this, President Benson was sustained as president of the Council of the Twelve. President Kimball then took his seat in the middle of the room, and as all those present placed their hands upon his head, we felt the Spirit of the Lord was truly with us, and this sweet Spirit filled our hearts. Then, with President Benson being mouth, in a beautiful prayer and blessing, Spencer Woolley Kimball was ordained and set apart as prophet, seer, and revelator and president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p38" pid="rBeRuiVxiE6xUihffIJLJw" hash="nmyuYA">It is my testimony to you and to the world that the plan and order of the Church has been followed, that the will of the Lord has been done, and that Spencer W. Kimball is his prophet and president of his church and kingdom here upon the earth. In the stake conferences since his appointment and in the solemn assembly today, the people have enthusiastically sustained him. It is the great privilege, honor, and responsibility of each and every one of us to accept and support President Kimball as a prophet of God and under his direction do all in our power to help build the kingdom, to further the cause of righteousness, and prepare the world for the second coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p39" pid="RErM4lzlsEiWwcssbOv3Wg" hash="JJdLfA">However, as in the past, there are still some who question the procedure and the choice of the president, and one in particular has written expressing his feeling that he himself should be the president of the Church, but let me remind you that the procedures of the Church and the teachings of Jesus Christ are not on trial. We as individuals are on trial, and have the great privilege and responsibility and blessing of being members of his church and kingdom, and of approving and sustaining the prophet, and it is up to us to prove ourselves worthy of the membership and priesthood which we hold.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p40" pid="CFimwKnN8UWdgGQTLN1slA" hash="4osFdA">Let us always remember that leaders of the Church are responsible to the Lord, and it is for him to straighten them out if they go wrong and to release them when they have finished their mission. We have been warned and forewarned that if we raise ourselves against the authority which God has placed in the Church for its government, unless we repent, he will withdraw his Spirit from us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/04/chosen-of-the-lord.p41" pid="Av8zLYEUPUGicdcW5uVJnA" hash="P_LQhQ">Brethren, if we wish to be guided by the Spirit of the Lord and enjoy his blessings, we must be true to the one who has been chosen as our leader and never murmur, complain, or find fault, or feel that someone else should be in his position. Men in high places, even one of the Three Witnesses, Oliver Cowdery, who had also received the priesthood under the hands of heavenly beings, and then Sidney Rigdon, a counselor in the First Presidency, fell away from the Church because they criticized and questioned the prophet of God.</p>

As we do this, we will be blessed and the Spirit of the Lord will linger with us and with our families as we teach and encourage them to be faithful and active. God’s work will be accomplished and his will will be done. As the Lord has said of his prophet:</p>

What a glorious privilege it is to hold the priesthood of God—from the newest deacon in the smallest and most distant branch of the Church, to the high priest holding the highest office in the Church. As such we have made certain covenants with the Lord and are entitled to his many promised blessings as we keep those covenants and walk uprightly before him.</p>

He had never been taught of the restoration of the gospel, that there was a living personal God, and that Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, lives; that he was literally the Son of God in the flesh.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/our-responsibility-to-the-transgressor.p4" pid="sAMhmPYtBU6fPAqTMx610g" hash="4Wj7EQ">While working at a summer resort where a number of young people were employed, and where all seemed to be having a good time, this boy’s attention was drawn to three young men who seemed to be living apart from the others and not participating in the smoking, drinking of alcoholic beverages, and using drugs, etc. They were living very high standards in every way and seemed to be morally clean.</p>

They told me they were Mormons, that they observed a Word of Wisdom, which they explained to me, and that the Lord had said, ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery’ (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.14" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:14</a>), and that sexual transgression was considered by the Church as one of the most grievous sins.”</p>

They were very free in telling me about the Church. They seemed to be proud of it and were not ashamed of the fact that they were not living as other young men were living. They did point out, however, that some of the young men who were members of the Church and living in the camp were not living the principles of the gospel.”</p>

If they had been converted and <span class="emphasis">not</span> ashamed of the gospel of Christ and its teachings, they too could have been influencing some others for good and changing their lives in preparation for ultimate blessings promised to the faithful.</p>

I corresponded with my parents and told them what I had found. They were very disappointed and unhappy; but when I returned home and told them all about it, and they saw the good effect all this had on my life and the change in habits, they gave me permission to be baptized, for which I was most thankful.”</p>

He went on to say what a great privilege it was when he was given the Aaronic Priesthood and he was able to administer and pass the sacrament in remembrance of the Lord’s crucifixion. He said it made him very humble as he felt the sacredness of this ordinance, and he always tried to be worthy and well-groomed and to act as the Lord would have him do were he standing by his side.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/our-responsibility-to-the-transgressor.p10" pid="9CN-8ztueEqsehgHpsoogg" hash="-ACClA">He felt greatly blessed when as a priest he was given the privilege of baptizing new members, realizing that this gave him the same privilege and authority that was given to John the Baptist who baptized the Savior. And as he talked, I wished that every young man could feel and realize just how important that is and what a great privilege it is to be able to perform these ordinances and know that the Lord depends on all of us to live worthy of and magnify the priesthood which we hold.</p>

He felt so good about this and was so very glad that he could go into the mission field as an ambassador of the Lord, feeling that the Lord would approve his going as his representative. He told of the glorious feeling he had as he baptized and confirmed his first convert.</p>

He realized how important it is that a man be worthy of these privileges to act in the name of the Lord and that the man he ordained was just as much an elder as if the president of the Church had ordained him. He felt most humble and grateful to the Lord.</p>

And now you will enjoy all the added blessings and privileges that will come from being sealed by the holy priesthood in the temple of God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/our-responsibility-to-the-transgressor.p15" pid="KgCfJpf1ykmJZmfGNSM-Tw" hash="ADFbJA">Too many young men today who have been raised in the Church seem to take the priesthood for granted and feel that it is a right rather than a privilege for them to hold the priesthood. Many seem to think it is smart to break the Word of Wisdom and be loose in their morals. I want to emphasize that the Lord is not pleased with this. It is most important that a young man live worthy of that priesthood and that he not be advanced until he is worthy.</p>

I cannot imagine an executive of any great corporation choosing and authorizing a person to represent the company and making any kind of contract unless that person has proven himself knowledgeable, capable, and worthy—one on whom the executive can depend entirely.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/our-responsibility-to-the-transgressor.p17" pid="1Lqc2GcQx0Wt7UL0XEoxaw" hash="DLROCg">It is even more important that one representing the Lord, speaking in his name, be equally worthy. I am sure the Lord is greatly pleased with all those who are prepared to do the things that make them worthy and who are prepared to stand up and be counted and defend the Church and the gospel of Jesus Christ by bearing testimony of the truth and denouncing evil and unrighteousness. He is equally disappointed and grieved when those who have made covenants with him fail to keep them, just as he grieves for any of his children who fall by the wayside.</p>

They expect us to keep our covenants and our commitments, to stand up for our beliefs, and to be different. This fact has been evident so often when a member of the Church is found guilty of any crime. It is pointed out that he is a Mormon or a member of the Mormon Church while the religious affiliation of others who may be involved with him is never mentioned.</p>

Through our teachings, worthy example, and testimony we must help them to understand the gospel and their responsibilities and the importance of living according to the teachings of the gospel.</p>

It is no kindness to advance anyone in the priesthood or give him a temple recommend if he is not worthy or to send him on a mission in order for him to repent and adjust. Rather, he should prove himself worthy before he is called. The Lord wants worthy representatives.</p>

Some have lied to their bishops and to their stake presidents in order to go into the mission field or to go to the temple. Such are certainly not worthy of these privileges. The Lord will not be mocked.</p>

Never hesitate to make a searching interview so that you will know if he is worthy or is guilty of any transgression and how he feels about a mission call. Then together consider how the Lord would feel about it and then act accordingly.</p>

He cannot get the spirit of his calling. And while he is in the mission field he is a burden to the mission president and a deterrent to the missionary work. I know how heartrending it is for a mission president to have to excommunicate and send a missionary home because of transgression.</p>

Remember that Satan is on the loose and his cohorts are striving with all their might to lead these young men and women astray. Always be prepared to encourage, guide, and help direct these young people to live according to the principles of the gospel. Be determined that no boy or girl is going to be lost because of your neglect.</p>

A person who is guilty of a serious transgression cannot progress, and he is not happy while the guilt is upon him. Until he has confessed and repented he is in bondage. The transgressor who is dealt with as he should be, with love and with proper discipline, will later express his appreciation for your concern, your interest, and your leadership. As he is properly dealt with, he is in a position to repent and come back to full activity. <span class="emphasis">But he must be dealt with.</span></p>

This attitude is entirely wrong. Judges in Israel have the responsibility to sit in righteous judgment where it becomes necessary. Let me read from the twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants an important reminder to those who have the responsibility of judging: “Any member of the Church of Christ transgressing, or being overtaken in a fault, shall be dealt with as the scriptures direct.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.80" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:80</a>.)</p>

Do you hear it, you Bishops and you Presidents? God will require it at your hands. You are not placed in position to tamper with the principles of righteousness, nor to cover up the infamies and corruptions of men.” (<span class="emphasis">Conference Report,</span> Apr. 1880, p. 78.)</p>

Also, George Q. Cannon makes this significant statement: “The Spirit of God would undoubtedly be so grieved that it would forsake not only those who are guilty of these acts, but it would withdraw itself from those who would suffer them to be done in our midst unchecked and unrebuked.”</p>

We are different from the world. We cannot accept their modes or standards of living. We have had revealed to us the gospel of Jesus Christ, which sets out clearly what our standards should be.

This one especially I call to your attention:</p>

Adam and Eve were the first wanderers of record when they listened to Satan rather than the Lord. They were cast out of the Garden of Eden and had a period of wandering until they committed themselves to keeping the commandments of God.</p>

He too was cast out and forced to wander in the wilderness of his transgressions, as were many other individuals and even larger groups of people of whom we read in the scriptures. Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of the wickedness of the people, and there were not sufficient righteous to save those cities. You all know the story of Noah and the ark, wherein we find that all the people in the world, excepting eight souls, were destroyed because they refused to listen to or accept the teachings or warnings of the Lord.</p>

The use of alcohol and tobacco in the home gives license to their children to do the same, and to indulge in other drugs and narcotics, which result too often in their leaving home and wandering as hitchhikers with packs on their backs, with no purpose, no particular destination, except away from the straight and narrow path of truth and righteousness. They are really no longer free, but while claiming that they are seeking freedom, they become slaves of their own bad habits, and it is most difficult for them to come out of the wilderness and back into the light and the love which they need so badly.</p>

The first was about a young man who came from a family of wealth and position in their community. He had a bright mind, did well in school, excelled in engineering, and had all the promise of a good career and the hope of a good life. Somewhere along the way, and in the manner of free thinkers of this day, he chose the companionship of some who were “doing their own thing,” I suppose they called it.</p>

Eventually he left his home and family, traveled across the country, took up residence in a community comprised of nomads, or wanderers, we might say. They were accountable to no one; they were free to come and go as they pleased; they had no responsibilities and seemingly were leading the kind of carefree lives that they thought they wanted.</p>

Such a tragedy ended the life of the young man to whom I refer. Under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and motorcycling with his companions late one night, he plunged through the rails of a bridge over a murky river and was killed. In agreement with some facetious pact he had supposedly made with his friends, they, without consulting his parents, conducted his funeral service, cremated the body, and strewed the ashes over the spot where he died.</p>

Something deep within kept the boy in touch with his family. Something stirred his memory of the teachings learned in his youth, and as his family strained to the breaking point to reach out and express their love on those occasions when he made contact with them, he eventually reluctantly consented to attend a family reunion, which was being held during one of his trips home. Unshaven, unkempt, long hair and all, he went.</p>

I envisioned what a beautiful, heavenly experience it must have been for those early Nephite people in the Western Hemisphere who were privileged to have a visit from the resurrected Lord himself, who came to visit his other sheep, that they too might be brought into the fold and have an organization for teaching and practicing his gospel.</p>

When we understand how the Book of Mormon came forth—that an angel actually came down and delivered to Joseph Smith the records from which it was translated—it is clear what John the Revelator meant when he said, “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p8" pid="pbUpWElj4EKlPDUs7aSyig" hash="9S38Ig">“Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/14.6-7" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 14:6–7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p9" pid="i5sByBI7_U6ac2vc1uYruQ" hash="1AkNRA">There are many scriptures which assure us that God is as interested in us today as he has been in all his children from the beginning, and thus we believe in continuous revelation from God through his prophets to guide us in these latter days. The Prophet Amos said, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p10" pid="Ht4BAIad70yi3Us9B68Kng" hash="voDErg">The Savior made this statement as recorded in John: “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.16" class="scriptureRef">John 10:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p11" pid="ISNykiggPU6SzPLbeaBvlA" hash="PeWwKQ">Thus it is clear why the Savior, following his crucifixion and resurrection, came to the Western Hemisphere amidst the signs and wonders which had been foretold, that these people might have the same advantages and opportunities for learning and living his gospel as those among whom he lived in mortality.</p>

I commend to all the reading of this account. Surely we can find nothing there except some warnings and beautiful teachings which, if accepted and lived, will do more than anything else to bring peace and happiness to the world and to the individual seeking such a way of life. Here we can find explanations for many unanswered questions in the Bible.</p>

For this reason there are many who refer to Third Nephi as the “fifth Gospel.”</p>

But, as has been true from the beginning, and as is true today, there were many who scoffed and said the time was past for the fulfillment of the words of the prophets. They went so far as to set apart a day when the believers should be put to death except the signs be fulfilled.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p15" pid="DW88sx7icU-x6LXICWMt8w" hash="TRuSNQ">We are told that Nephi “cried mightily unto the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.12" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 1:12</a>), whereupon the Lord came unto him and answered him that the time was at hand for all that had been spoken by his holy prophets to be fulfilled. All the signs came to pass, the new star appeared in the sky, and the unbelievers “fell to the earth and became as if they were dead.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.16" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 1:16</a>.) Here is one of the first lessons we learn. The words of God’s prophets are always fulfilled.</p>

We read of wars and the Gadianton robbers and the desolation of the land. But those Nephites who remembered to call upon the Lord in righteousness were able to subdue their enemies, and they praised God for their deliverance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p17" pid="fxgBofGIqkGaM0r_OidXzg" hash="XdYUAw">We are told that they “did forsake all their sins, and their abominations, and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence day and night.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5.3" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 5:3</a>.)

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p20" pid="E3pmGZMISkKEI9sAcQrRgw" hash="9YVuPA">Here is evidence of earlier civilizations in these areas, as recorded in the Book of Mormon, which was translated through the gift and power of God by a young, unlearned man, which gives vivid descriptions and much detail concerning things which science is now proving to be factual. Yes, it is indeed a true record, preserved by the hand of God to come forth in these latter days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p21" pid="WsqTqCRsgEWhdD3dtiFgIg" hash="tVwL8g">Returning to our story, we find, as is so common in the world today, that as the people prospered they began to have disputations among themselves because of pride, and some did willfully rebel against God. Within only six years the majority of the people had turned to wickedness, and Nephi began to preach repentance boldly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p22" pid="KnQHVjlhJ0O78BZ7zZoN4Q" hash="2AeZLA">This is the mission of the prophets of God: to preach repentance. And though it does not make for popularity, it must be done. We are told that the people were angry with Nephi but that he ministered with power and with great authority. We read: “So great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p24" pid="D8zIzBv2Q0KNU5JUtx545Q" hash="P7e3sw">Then once again, as foretold by the prophets, the signs of Christ’s crucifixion came to pass, attested by storms and earthquakes, by darkness, by thunder, and by fire. Cities sank into the depths of the sea, mountains were raised, and the whole face of the land was changed. This lasted for three days, and the people were heard to cry, saying, “O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been spared, and they would not have been burned in that great city Zarahemla.</p>

And thus were the howlings of the people great and terrible.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.24-25" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 8:24–25</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/christ-in-america.p26" pid="dtcAfGfPrUGvy2ID2AeFKQ" hash="tCLZmw">Here another lesson is obvious. Throughout ecclesiastical history we find that those who rejected the prophets and failed to repent of their wickedness were struck by calamities which caused them literally to weep and to mourn and to regret their failure to heed the warnings of the prophets. We know that Christ was crucified and some of his apostles persecuted and stoned simply for trying to establish the kingdom of God and bring people to repentance and a happier way of life.</p>

Is it not true that there is weeping and wailing over the face of the land because men are at war one with another? Do we not have among us many who lament the waywardness of their youth and the tragedies that befall them as they turn away from righteousness and suffer the consequences of tampering with alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, and other forbidden things? How many mourners do we have as a result of the lawlessness that is extant in our communities? We need to heed the lessons from the history of the past lest <span class="emphasis">we</span> be consumed as were some of those earlier civilizations.</p>

He reminded them of their iniquity and abominations and of the cities which had been destroyed because of the wickedness of the inhabitants, and then he said, “O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than they, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?</p>

He gave them the words they should use and instructed them to baptize by immersion as they performed the ordinance of baptism. This is the same form of baptism practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He made it clear to them that there should be no disputations among them as to points of doctrine which he would expound, which he said was the doctrine his Father had given unto him.

He performed miracles and gave promises, reminding them to search the writings of Isaiah and all the prophets for the signs of his Second Coming. He warned of the judgments to come and taught about tithing and work for the dead. He told them that his church should be called in his name. He again warned them to repent, saying:</p>

How glorious to belong to the church of Jesus Christ and to hold the priesthood of God and be allowed to act in his name! When we think of the thousands of priesthood holders throughout the world, it gives us great encouragement and we feel to praise the Lord.</p>

At the general conference sessions there were assembled over 5,500 in Brazil and over 10,000 in Argentina.</p>

As we attended a meeting of the Saints and investigators there one evening, the President estimated about 500 people in attendance. As I got up to speak I asked those who had been baptized in 1974 and ‘75 to stand, and then in ‘73, ‘72, ‘71, ‘70. I then asked those who had been in the Church over five years to stand. Only three stood, and they were visitors. This gives you some idea how the work of the Lord is going forward in that area.</p>

No greater goal could be set, no greater progress could be made, and no greater joy and satisfaction could be experienced than to determine that we will accept Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world, and live his teachings.</p>

However, there are many who do not keep this in mind, and some who are not prepared to put forth the effort to live worthy of these blessings. With this in mind I should like to say a few words about self-discipline, self-control, or self-mastery which is so important to all of us if we are to accomplish what we set out to do and enjoy the blessings which we desire so much.</p>

He who cannot establish dominion over himself will have no dominion over others.” In other words, he cannot be a worthy father or leader.</p>

The first is to determine your course or set the sails, so to speak, of moral standards; the other is the willpower, or the wind in the sails carrying one forward. As I said before, character is determined by the extent to which we can master ourselves toward good ends. It is difficult to say just what builds good character, but we know it when we see it. It always commands our admiration, and the absence of it our pity. But it is largely a matter of willpower.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Narrow</span> is a very meaningful word. Often people accuse us of being narrow-minded if we are following the straight and narrow path, which certainly does require self-restraint and self-denial. We must realize and be prepared to accept the fact that it confines us, restricts us, and limits us in certain areas. But let us fully realize that it does not fetter or shackle mankind. On the contrary, it is the way to emancipation, independence, and liberty.</p>

John said, “Is there any place I can attend my meetings on Sunday?” and as he was told there was not, he said, “No, I can’t go.

I was greatly impressed, and almost overwhelmed, with the realization of the great power and authority assembled to listen to the prophet’s voice and to hear the word of the Lord, to be built up and motivated to even better works and living.</p>

I realize how difficult it is in this day for young men and young women to overcome the evils of the world, to honor the priesthood, and appreciate their membership in the church of Jesus Christ.</p>

You have been chosen and permitted to come forth in this day. Our priesthood is very important, and our task is enormous. Nothing will bring greater joy and success than to live according to the teachings of the gospel. Be an example; be an influence for good; be prepared and worthy to accept any call that comes from the Lord.</p>

Always remember that people are looking to you for leadership and you are influencing the lives of individuals either for good or for bad, which influence will be felt for generations to come.</p>

The world needs that power and strength and influence to give leadership in helping to meet, solve and overcome the problems caused by the wickedness so rampant in the world.</p>

The future progress of the Church, and, in fact, the future of the world, depends on how we magnify the office which we hold in the priesthood. Every deacon, every teacher, every priest, every holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood has an individual responsibility and privilege to combine forces with the Savior in being tools in his hands and helping him to accomplish his work and his glory, which is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. No other people have this same authority or special call.</p>

Too many of us seem to take the priesthood which we hold for granted; we fail to realize what the Lord expects of us, or we don’t have the conviction, courage, and fortitude to stand up for the right and be counted, to be different when necessary.</p>

One young man on the football team, or the campus, or among his fellow workers can, by living the gospel, honoring his priesthood, and taking a stand for the right, do untold good. Often you will experience much criticism and ridicule even by those who believe as you do, even though they may respect you for doing right. But remember that the Savior himself was tormented, ridiculed, spat upon, and finally crucified because he would not waver in his conviction. Have you ever stopped to think what would have happened had he weakened and said, “Oh, what’s the use?” and abandoned his mission? Do we want to be quitters, or do we want to be valiant servants in spite of all the opposition and evil in the world? Let us have the courage to stand up and be counted as true, devoted followers of Christ.</p>

How important it is that we remember who we are, servants of the Lord, and then act accordingly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p25" pid="I1Oh2t_qMEyGiHQJq5hZOA" hash="v6nIAg">As I said before, we just cannot imagine or calculate in any way what a great influence for good we would have in the world if every holder of the priesthood would magnify his calling, and how much happier and more successful each individual would be if he would always choose the right. How sad it is to see one who would rather be popular than do what he knows is right. I have in mind and remember so well a good member of the Church who was elected to the legislature but who wanted to be a good fellow, popular with everyone. He, wanting to be popular, let down his standards and took one drink at a social and then another. It happened again and again. He began drinking with the fellows at lunch and at dinner. And then, unintentionally I am sure, and contrary to his greatest desire, he became an alcoholic and lost the support of his constituency and the respect of his friends and family who loved him and sorrowed for him. He died an early death as an alcoholic. What a sad situation—all because he sought the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>

We have examples of congressmen and senators who have lost their positions and self-respect and the respect of others because they wanted to be popular or didn’t have the strength to resist the temptations. We have the promise of the Lord that if we seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, all these things will be added unto us, meaning, of course, the things that are for our good.</p>

Nor was I impeded in any way in my progress. On the contrary, I feel that I was respected and I was blessed by the Lord, and always felt free to call upon him for strength and guidance, which I often received.</p>

One of the General Authorities, whom I will call George, was telling an experience he had when a priest. A friend of his was taking his girl home from a party, and her younger sister was going with them. He asked George to accompany them. George accepted. He said that shortly after they arrived home and were sitting in the living room together, the girl whom he took home went over, turned off the lights, came back and sat on his lap, and started to make advances. He said that though he knew he would be unpopular and even offensive, he excused himself, got up, and went home. As he was telling the story, he said that he knew that many young men today would consider him a sissy, but he remembered so well the story of Joseph who was sold into Egypt.</p>

Even the strongest must always be on guard.</p>

Young men and some adults have trials or tests of this nature. There are different kinds of temptations where their loyalty and strength of character are really tested. If we will always remember who we are and that God is watching over us, we will be able to shun, or avoid and withstand such temptations. Always remember that you cannot play with fire without danger of being burned.</p>

Unless we are continually on guard we will find ourselves gradually off the straight and narrow path until we have completely gone astray, becoming a great disappointment to ourselves, our families, and the Lord, and certainly not what we had anticipated or intended or wanted to be.</p>

So often athletes get so carried away with their success and desire for praise that they forget their duty to God and the importance of his approval and as a result lose their way. This applies equally to politicians, members of fraternal organizations, professions, and business. This craving for praise and popularity too often controls actions, and as they succumb they find themselves bending their character when they think they are only taking a bow.</p>

He was more concerned with credit than with results; glory and praise were the end in themselves. My friend went on to say that on the crucial issues, if individuals are more concerned with pleasing men than pleasing God, then they suffer from the same virus Satan had, for there are many situations where seeking the praise of men will clearly result in their hurting, not helping, mankind for they will do expedient and temporary things instead of those which are lasting and beneficial.</p>

It is permissive legislation of the worst kind. Brethren, the Lord expects us as his priesthood holders to take a stand for right and do all in our power to oppose and discourage such action and to encourage our people to live according to the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

Nothing is more cruel than that leader who, in order to have the praise and plaudits of his followers, entices them from safety into the swamp out of which some may never return. The straight and narrow way is just that—straight and narrow. It is an arduous up-hill journey. The way to hell is broad and wide and slopes ever so gently, and those who walk that path scarcely notice the descent; sometimes they don’t notice the descent because praise of men distracts them and they do not see the warning signs! The choice is still between the golden calf and the Ten Commandments.” (Unpublished letter dated Aug. 12, 1975, “Some Thoughts,” from Neal A. Maxwell to President Tanner.)</p>

When I finished my warning, I left him. He followed me from his house with the intention of killing me. I have no doubt about his intention, for it was shown to me in vision. When he came to where I was, he fell dead at my feet, as if he had been struck with a thunderbolt from heaven. I was then a Priest, but God defended me and preserved my life. I speak of this because it is a principle that has been manifest in the Church of God in this generation as well as in others. I had the administration of angels while holding the office of a Priest.

When I was president of the Edmonton Branch in Canada, I was in charge of our priests group. We used to meet in the basement of an IOOF Hall, which had dirt walls and a dirt floor. One of the priests, named Max, was playing on the school basketball team. He was the only member of the Church on that team. The other boys, naturally, had no qualms about using tea, coffee, or tobacco, and sometimes using alcohol. Max, of course, kept the Word of Wisdom strictly. He used to tell the boys about the Word of Wisdom and the evils of breaking it, and he told them that the Lord had promised that they should run and not be weary, and walk and not faint, if they kept the Word of Wisdom. He assured them they would be better basketball players if they refrained from the use of these things. He was one of the top players, and the boys respected him. It was not long until all of them were keeping the Word of Wisdom.</p>

The discovery of the Americas was not an accident. The event had been foreordained in the eternal councils. The prophets of old had it in view. Jacob foresaw it when he blessed his son Joseph, calling him “a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches run over the wall … unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/49.22,26" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 49:22, 26</a>.)</p>

These are just some of the <span class="emphasis">biblical</span> prophecies, and we have the Book of Mormon record which tells of the Jaredites who were the first to come to America. They came at the time of the confusion of languages during the building of the tower of Babel.</p>

When all was in readiness, they boarded their vessels and “set forth into the sea, commending themselves unto the Lord their God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/6.4" class="scriptureRef">Ether 6:4</a>.)</p>

Because of the things which he had testified concerning the wickedness of the people and the pending destruction of Jerusalem, he was mocked and scorned, and the people sought to take his life. In obedience to the Lord’s instructions, he departed with his family and others, and after a period in the wilderness, they too were instructed to build a ship and sail for the promised land. We read, “And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of many days we did arrive at the promised land; and we went forth upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised land.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 18:23</a>.)</p>

He said, “And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 13:12</a>.)</p>

Those who heard of my emprise called it foolish, mocked me, and laughed. But who can doubt but that the Holy Ghost inspired me?” (Quoted in Mark E. Petersen, <span class="emphasis">The Great Prologue,</span> Deseret Book Co., 1975, p. 26.)</p>

Finally, Columbus promised the captains of the <span class="emphasis">Pinta</span> and the <span class="emphasis">Niña,</span> both of whom wanted to turn back, that if no land was sighted in forty-eight hours, they would turn back. Then he went to his cabin and, in his words, “prayed mightily to the Lord.” On October 12, the very next day, they sighted land.</p>

He foresaw the coming to America of peoples from many nations, their wars and contentions. As Nephi said, they did humble themselves before the Lord and “the power of God was with them, and also that the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together against them to battle.</p>

That this too was divinely inspired is attested by the word of the Lord when he said, “According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles;</p>

We seek, and usually find, the answers to today’s questions in this document of yesterday. It was and is a miracle. Both Washington and Madison referred to it as such. It is an inspired document written under the guidance of the Lord. James Madison, commonly called the father of the Constitution, recognized this inspiration and gave the credit to “the guardianship and guidance of the Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations, whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising republic.” (Petersen, <span class="emphasis">Prologue,</span> p. 95.)</p>

Joseph Smith said, “The Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard—it is founded in the wisdom of God—it is a heavenly banner.” (Petersen, <span class="emphasis">Prologue,</span> p. 75.)</p>

Many of these great reformers stated that their effort was to reassert the basic Christian teachings of the Bible—but they acknowledged that they possessed no authority to administer the ordinances of the Church, or to reestablish the original church of Jesus Christ. Luther said, “Christianity has ceased to exist among those who should have preserved it.”</p>

That restoration began in the United States of America in the 1820s through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who was chosen by the Lord and who, through personal manifestations from heavenly messengers, received pertinent records which contained the authentic record of early American peoples and God’s dealings with them. He received the priesthood and authority to reestablish the church of Jesus Christ in these latter days.</p>

They announced to him that Christ’s church would be reestablished upon the earth, with a restoration of the same principles and ordinances an organization which existed in the primitive church, from which there had been an apostasy as documented by irrefutable evidence. This restoration was the greatest event in the history of mankind since the birth, death, and resurrection of our Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>

And this is to be moral and spiritual—that which the ancients lacked.”</p>

All of us want to be actively engaged in helping to build the kingdom of God and be prepared to answer the clarion call of our president, Spencer W.

Let us never weaken or forget that we have been called by the Lord. He expects all of us to honor the priesthood and magnify our calling.</p>

Howard, president of Rockford College in Rockford, Illinois, as he spoke to the graduates of Brigham Young University last April. He referred to the problems and sacrifices made by our early pioneers who crossed the plains to the Salt Lake Valley and said:</p>

The deserts you must bring to blossom are no less arid, but your mission may demand even more of you, for unlike the early pioneers of this state you are confronted by a wilderness which is subtle and fluid and elusive. Indeed the wilderness which you must conquer is <span class="emphasis">disguised as a civilization</span> so that there is the <span class="emphasis">double necessity</span> to <span class="emphasis">unmask the deceit,</span> to <span class="emphasis">distinguish between what is authentic</span> and <span class="emphasis">what is counterfeit,</span> and to <span class="emphasis">labor to support</span> the one and <span class="emphasis">oppose</span> the <span class="emphasis">other.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/ready-to-work-long-hours.p8" pid="6hVvaNEypUut0wGFgIKS3w" hash="JXklAg">“The moral depravity which appears on television is rivaled by the moral tone of campuses where cohabitation is commonplace and where the use of illegal drugs doesn’t even raise an eyebrow anymore. The swelling tide of crime is matched by the deluge of dishonesty—and I think that word is adequate and accurate. The tide of crime is matched by the deluge of dishonesty on the part of politicians who promise what they know they cannot deliver and who try to deceive the people into believing that projects can always be paid for out of somebody else’s pocket.</p>

Coeducational dormitories were unthinkable <span class="emphasis">anywhere</span> in this country. Most people had no worry walking out alone late at night in the city streets. Salacious literature was not publicly available on the newsstands or bawdy cards available in the lobby of the local motel, nor was salacious literature available in the bookstores publicly.”</p>

If that estimate is correct, you are greatly blessed and highly privileged.”</p>

Remember that it is given by a nonmember of the Church who is president of another university and is acquainted with the conditions in the world today and is qualified to speak on this subject. He has clearly pointed out what the responsibilities of BYU are.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/ready-to-work-long-hours.p18" pid="Y4sCehFG1k-qCwxS10e9xg" hash="DZVcyg">If what Dr. Howard said about the responsibility of BYU students is true—and it is—it applies even more to the Church, its officers, and its members. As mentioned before, this is the church of Jesus Christ, the only church led by and holding the priesthood of God, and it has been given the charge to teach the gospel to all people and prepare them for the second coming of Christ. This can be done only as we honor the priesthood of God and magnify the office and calling which has been given to us individually.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/ready-to-work-long-hours.p19" pid="AVxneXI3BU-zewc_9dHUzQ" hash="hJKikg">It is evident that we must put forth greater effort as a church and as individuals if we are to withstand the evils of the world. The First Presidency and General Authorities are greatly concerned about the fact that evil and temptation are reaching into the Church and affecting the lives of many of our youth and even adult members. It nearly breaks our hearts to see how many and how seriously they are being affected. We realize that the worth of a soul is great in the sight of the Lord, and we want to do all in our power through love and kindness and warning to help strengthen and guide all members in the paths of truth and righteousness. We feel as Nephi did when “iniquity had come upon the Nephites … and … his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/7.6" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 7:6</a>.) Our concern is—and it should be the concern of every family, every father, every adult, and every priesthood holder—how can we best guard and protect ourselves and our children and others against the evils of the world?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/ready-to-work-long-hours.p20" pid="lLUbVpyf7Ees-Tcv7NdTZg" hash="THUpJA">Let me refer to and sort of paraphrase “The Parable of the Defective Battery,” written by Elder James E. Talmage. (See Albert L. Zobell, Jr., <span class="emphasis">The Parable of James E. Talmage,</span> Deseret Book Company, 1973, pp. 7–12.) He said that in order to carry out a certain laboratory experiment he needed a powerful primary electric current. He asked his assistant to prepare a battery consisting of a dozen cells of simple type. His assistant followed the usual procedure. He prepared twelve jars containing acid solution, in which were immersed a pair of plates, one of carbon and one of zinc. The cells were then connected “in series.” This should have resulted in the series giving out strength equal to the total force. It was discovered, however, that he had not given sufficient attention to details—those <span class="emphasis">seeming trifles</span> that <span class="emphasis">make</span> or <span class="emphasis">mar</span> perfection.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/ready-to-work-long-hours.p21" pid="BOAcAdMQlECh8LOJysPnGw" hash="OTYSwQ">Elder Talmage said he was disappointed when he tried to use the battery because it was not functioning as it should. As he inspected it he found that the cells were not all working alike; some of them were intensely active, and the liquid seemed to be like boiling water because of the escaping gases. Its current was very weak. The energy from it was practically used up in overcoming its own internal resistance, and it had no power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/ready-to-work-long-hours.p22" pid="2lTI0aOVZU-yVzozmTO-nw" hash="-aTcJw">He took the battery apart and made an individual examination of each cell. The first eight cells proved to be in good condition. The ninth, however, was seriously at fault. This cell was set aside and the others tested and found to be good. It was plain to see that number nine cell was the cause of the trouble. It was the one, too, that had been fuming and fussing more than the others. Leaving it out, he hooked up the other eleven and found them to form a good, strong current, ample to operate an electric receiver or to fire a blast on the opposite side of the globe.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/ready-to-work-long-hours.p23" pid="2jZlm459iUaJBCazIZtBTA" hash="uZAPsw">Later he began to inspect the rejected unit and found that it had short-circuited itself through its foaming and fuming. The acid had destroyed the insulation in some parts, and the current was wholly used up in destructive corrosion within the jar. It had <span class="emphasis">violated the law of right action.</span> It had <span class="emphasis">corrupted itself</span> in its defective state. It was not only worthless as a working unit, but an <span class="emphasis">unproductive member</span> in a <span class="emphasis">community of cells.</span> It was worse than worthless in that it caused an effective resistance in the operation of the other clean and serviceable units.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/ready-to-work-long-hours.p24" pid="-3zPCH7R7kqXR7FbejriDw" hash="YxPnoA">He did not destroy the unit, however. He thought there was a possibility of restoring it to some usefulness. He searched its innermost parts and with knife and file removed the corroded crustment. He baptized it in a cleansing bath and set it up again and tried it out. Gradually it developed energy until it came to work almost as well as the other cells. However, he continued to watch the cell with special care, not trusting it as fully as he had before it had defiled itself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/ready-to-work-long-hours.p25" pid="-fFAnllbYki3wJpl-ycB1Q" hash="gJalRg">Elder Talmage said this was an actual experience, but he called it a parable and said how much we are like the voltaic cell. There are men who are loud and demonstrative, even offensive in their abnormal activity. Yet what do they accomplish in effective labor? Their energy is wholly consumed in overcoming the <span class="emphasis">internal resistance</span> of their <span class="emphasis">defective selves.</span></p>

They are slothful, dormant, and, as judged by the standard of utility, dead. There are men who labor so quietly as scarcely to reveal the fact that they are hard at work. Through their earnest devotion they greatly influence the lives of those with whom they associate. <span class="emphasis">The unclean cell, however, was much like the sinner. Unfitness</span> was the direct effect of internal disorder, self-corruption. Such a defection in men we call sin, which is essentially the breaking of the law. They, in association with others who are clean, able, and willing, are an obstruction to the current, and the efficiency of the whole is lessened, if not entirely neutralized, by a single defective unit.</p>

All of us would like to live so that the Lord would be happy with our devotion and activity, and we would like to feel that we are helping to build the kingdom of God. To do this it is necessary that we be alert and do all in our power to thwart the evil designs of Satan and his cohorts—especially in times of prosperity when the people are inclined to turn away from the teachings of the Lord.</p>

The Church is growing rapidly and being more generally accepted in the world than ever before. There seems to be a greater feeling of security. All of this has a tendency to cause us to fall away from the Church because we set our minds too much on the things of this world. Nephi warned his people against the onslaught of the temptations of Satan in these words:</p>

I will simply say that neither adult nor youth can see or listen to or communicate in pornography without becoming contaminated and endangering the moral fiber of the community. The sex pervert, the rapist, and the thief have become what they are because of what has been fed into their minds, which in turn has prompted the deeds they perform.</p>

I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of keeping ourselves clean and pure and chaste in order to be worthy to bear this holy priesthood and to prepare ourselves and our families for eternal life.</p>

We just cannot follow the ways of the world. We must dare to be different. We must not be influenced by those who would call us peculiar. The Lord said to the children of Israel:</p>

He is interested in us and wants us to succeed. He “so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son [Jesus Christ], that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16</a>.) He has given us the way by which we should live and act as priesthood holders, which we are; and He and His Son, Jesus Christ, came to this earth and restored the gospel in its fulness. We are so fortunate to have that gospel, to understand who we are and why we are here and how we can get back into the presence of our Heavenly Father. He expects every boy to so live all the time to be an example for good.</p>

If each of us will do this we will be welcomed back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p1" pid="-3zQCIVU0kKRYK2GObgRcg" hash="nMBfTw">Wherever I go, people seem to be interested in hearing about the area conferences we hold throughout the world. Today I should like to tell briefly why we hold them, how they are conducted, how the people respond, and the effect they are having in the different areas. I shall deal specifically with the area conferences held in Europe this summer.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p2" pid="muTb6_rjCk6ZHcm67_0a-w" hash="c0Io4w">President Kimball has explained that the Church has grown so rapidly throughout the world that it is no longer practicable to limit our general conferences to those held in April and October at the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City. First, it would be impossible to accommodate all the people who could come from around the world; and also, many who would like to come are unable to. So we are taking the conferences to the people.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p3" pid="snm2LP915Ui4xiRrxKN-Ng" hash="uOTgwA">Area conferences are held in strategic locations throughout the world in order that the president may meet the people, and the people in turn may see the prophet and the other General Authorities and their wives face to face. The primary purposes are to take the gospel to the people in their own environment and in their own language, encourage the Saints in their duties, increase their faith and devotion, and raise the voice of warning.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p4" pid="e3UP-3Xfr0q56fSKoe390Q" hash="A6ymmg">Though we now have members in 75 countries, we have Church organizations in only 58, where many different languages are spoken. And as of this date we have held ten series of area conferences in 28 different countries, with attendance ranging from 1,600 to 16,000 in each session—with a total of nearly 200,000 attending from 34 countries throughout the world.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p5" pid="4ScocVOGyEK_G2I9UdXxlA" hash="QWUVEA">Usually attending from headquarters are two members of the First Presidency, two members of the Quorum of the Twelve, and two or three other General Authorities, including the area supervisor of the area in which the conference is held, together with the wives of all.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p6" pid="khRTWRWY40mgLfHMyYYgRg" hash="VSi4Rw">The format usually followed in each conference is as follows:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p7" pid="dcKYo_yGFkOisuTts17w8g" hash="jMTeYw">An evening cultural program, representative of the countries in the area, which have been extremely well done and exhibit the great talent of the local members.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p8" pid="i8PHpyR_AEK4huZGiplLpA" hash="1OW0uw">A mothers and daughters meeting, at which talks are usually given by wives of the First Presidency, by a member of the First Presidency, by other General Authorities, and by a local sister. The speakers emphasize the great role women have in the Church and its auxiliary organizations and in the community, and the great influence they have in the lives of their families. They are reminded that they could have no greater responsibility or satisfying experience than to be copartners with God in the divine plan of bringing his spirit children into mortal existence, to teach them the gospel, and to help prepare them to go back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p9" pid="kwQRV93OIEyOimZ9HOGi0A" hash="OM9Clg">There is also a priesthood meeting for fathers and sons.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p10" pid="IC72Hanjf0ahUmV78ex-5Q" hash="AZwKoA">At each conference there is a special dinner where the General Authorities and their wives have the opportunity of meeting and mingling with the priesthood leaders and their wives from the stakes and missions. There are also general sessions, usually addressed by members of the First Presidency, other General Authorities, and local leaders.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p11" pid="NcL6X7oHK0CfLsVhXfg_Aw" hash="tkdZfQ">People attending these conferences come from villages and towns or cities where in every case the members of the Church are in a minority and often few in number. Many of them have traveled hundreds of miles and some for several days, and have made great sacrifices in order to attend.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p12" pid="HVi5OzwGJUC8GAvPy5DOlQ" hash="YBaZlg">The area supervisors attending (who are also General Authorities) always speak, and at this time I should like to acknowledge the splendid service they are giving in their respective areas. Their understanding of the people and the locale is most beneficial to all, and their messages are always inspiring. Likewise the local people rise to great heights as they demonstrate their faith and keen understanding of the gospel, with a determination to live and help others live its teachings.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p13" pid="-42rV30xEkiTqkAxF9Cxfw" hash="GqigTQ">Music is furnished by local combined choirs and choruses, made up of from 100 to 300 members, many of whom have traveled great distances and practiced many hours to give the best performance possible. I certainly wish to congratulate them. I am always greatly impressed with the fine music directors coming from the different communities, and there are many emotional moments and many tears shed as our conferences conclude and they sing such songs as “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet” and “God Be with You Till We Meet Again.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p14" pid="S90GgmwmK0CvIBc36B7pYQ" hash="7RhBCw">We often hold press conferences in the cities we visit which focus attention on the Church and the fruits of the gospel. The favorable reports always emphasize that Mormons who live the gospel are healthier, happier, more successful, and live longer. This publicity, together with the spiritual meetings, results in increased faith and devotion, enthusiasm and activity.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p15" pid="-yfZ6nb1pka-HV6uIfFekA" hash="zHfuQQ">It is a joy to talk with new converts to the Church. One woman told me how thrilled she was because she had never before realized that God was a living, personal being, or that she was a spirit child of God; that she would have a literal resurrection, and by living the gospel and keeping the commandments she could enjoy eternal life in the presence of God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p16" pid="GnqE-xbffUyl5p4aWZMLxA" hash="Vktd7w">Another, who had lost a child in death, said everything seemed hopeless until she learned through the teachings of the gospel that she could be sealed to her husband by divine authority for time and all eternity, that they could have their little one sealed to them, and that children born to such a marriage would be part of an eternal family unit.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p17" pid="PNM7DMj6wUWY2HKuTnBqqQ" hash="EybMxQ">Our messages to these devoted members is plain and simple as we speak to them—through interpreters where necessary. I point out to them that they have a great responsibility to make their influence felt for good in their respective areas. They must not be discouraged, but should live exemplary lives, teach their families to keep the commandments, and spread the gospel message to their neighbors.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p18" pid="z9TyU4ai70al4ZtwUvGM6A" hash="zCJq5g">In referring to their minority status as Church members I like to remind them that there were only six registered members when the Church was organized in 1830, and at that time the Lord told them to take the gospel to all the world. This must have been a discouraging challenge, but in the face of hardships and persecution they set out to meet it; and in spite of being driven from place to place, having their homes burned, their chattels taken, and their temples destroyed, for the gospel’s sake they remained true to the faith. Today we have over 3 1/2 million members, and more than 24,000 missionaries to help spread the gospel message.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p19" pid="W1NKmlVfV0q9-LIyE4MTkg" hash="Tf77dw">I remind them of the great sacrifices made by those early pioneers who had to leave their comfortable homes in Nauvoo and travel through the wilderness, during which journey they suffered death and deprivation. But knowing they belonged to the church of Jesus Christ, they carried on, remembering, as we all should, that our Lord and Savior himself was persecuted and finally crucified, giving his life for us that we might enjoy immortality and have eternal life with him if we accept and live his teachings.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p20" pid="NfuZyVM_vEarJa-rHoF6Tg" hash="hlJdHA">Our members need to understand about the apostasy and the restoration and have a testimony of the divine mission of Joseph Smith. They must understand and live the Word of Wisdom and be fully converted to the concept that the Spirit of God cannot dwell in an unclean body.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p21" pid="bGf5LXF0kUG2Zm1gaHvgrw" hash="3bzCAg">I wish it were possible for me to convey to you the sweet spirit and inspiring words of all the speakers, but since time will not permit, I should like to give you some excerpts from talks given at our last series of conferences.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p22" pid="XDxdPN2qTkC7SqMv8ssD0g" hash="evsIMQ">President Kimball, in his sweet and loving manner, expressed greetings and pronounced the blessings of the Lord upon the people. He urged them to keep the commandments, to live honest and upright lives and be an example to the world.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p23" pid="9YW1yMzKw0S9hrZV3c1ynw" hash="jG5Ljg">One talk to which I should like to refer was on chastity. The president spoke plainly and in a way that the people not only could understand, but could not misunderstand. He used the analogy of a ship on a stormy sea, and said that many ships had been lost, with their cargo and passengers, through collision with other ships, icebergs, and rocky shoals. He explained that a new signaling device was being perfected that would detect any danger of collision and keep signaling to the captain until the danger was averted.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p24" pid="oKCP9HaEGU22lHZ_PfIyJg" hash="3bALIg">He said our young people are traveling oceans where great disasters can come unless warnings are heeded, and added:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p25" pid="sufVPV4qMEmYZh8TinJClw" hash="7HpbiA">“As a leader of the Church, and in a measure being responsible for youth and their well-being, I raise my voice loud and strong and unfalteringly to say to the youth: ‘You are in a hazardous area and perhaps in a period of your lives where there are some dangers. Tighten your belts, hold on, and you can survive this turbulence.’ When we have been warned we should listen and put it into our lives and be sure that we avoid the shoals and the rocks and the danger points.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p26" pid="kVN8nZtu3kaz95iyYYA_fA" hash="aAi6lw">The President spoke very strongly against fornication, adultery, and other perversions. He quoted Paul, who cautioned not to “company with fornicators. … Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/5.9,13" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 5:9, 13</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p27" pid="As5Tj1l8vEOhnqrr3kPmPw" hash="0e7HNA">President Kimball continued: “Oh, if our young people could learn this basic lesson—to always keep good company, to never be found with those who tend to lower their standards! We must repeat what we have said many times: Fornication with all its accompanying sins, great and small, was evil and wholly condemned by the Lord in Adam’s day, in Moses’ day, in Paul’s day, and in 1976. The Church has no tolerance for any kind of perversions.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p28" pid="PMkJaxaP-EqI7RJcDQJV3w" hash="-TbAVw">He emphasized the gravity of such sins, but opened the door for forgiveness as he talked about true repentance. He quoted from the Doctrine and Covenants as follows:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p29" pid="2BkFoSxjkkOQ9_Kx_8rm3w" hash="cVr-iw">“Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p30" pid="F1HY_U7adUaY9T8i6fHrYw" hash="uETsVw">“By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.42-43" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:42–43</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p31" pid="ZxFUIsZMbUWoGEXbVjMQvQ" hash="smv4Ig">Then he said:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p32" pid="ReV_fYgHVUiIIdUQZCvQxA" hash="HJ4fMA">“That the Church’s stand on morality may be understood, we declare firmly and unalterably it is not an outworn garment, faded, old-fashioned, and threadbare. God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and his covenants and doctrines are unchanging: Old values are upheld by the Church, not because they are old, but rather because through the ages they have proved right.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p33" pid="E7kn5k8_EESiYPeaCPNe6w" hash="vyBz6g">“Improper sex can bring only unhappiness, disappointment, disgust, and usually rejection. In one dark, unglorious hour, lives can be shattered. Chastity lost is gone forever, and virtue stolen cannot be returned. Our final words are those of the Prophet Isaiah: ‘Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.’” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/52.11" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 52:11</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p34" pid="-nBYYsnyCE6APZnELVo7Kw" hash="zUY9aA">Elder Thomas S. Monson described an area conference as a time to ponder, a time to pray, a time to reflect, and a time to resolve. He spoke of free agency, saying:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p35" pid="B6IOWUrfY0GMlBt-6cgV1Q" hash="EskLxA">“This gift of agency, this right to choose, is overwhelming in its importance, everlasting in its significance. What choices will you make? From this area conference let us not return to our homes unchanged. Rather let us stride from this building with our heads uplifted, our minds filled, our hearts touched, and our souls stirred.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p36" pid="j3Y_cczLJUSj0qkFXP-NXA" hash="xiRZMg">He made suggestions to be incorporated into each life to achieve the goals set, and the first was to <span class="emphasis">listen.</span> He emphasized the importance of listening to the Lord, to the prophets, to parents, and to the still, small voice which whispers to each of us. He asked that each in attendance “close his ears to that lilting melody sent forth by that pied piper of sin, even Lucifer, and rather listen carefully to the voice of truth.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p37" pid="d7ExEXN-uUWEUmlJs8Lv2w" hash="hbBncg">He gave as a second suggestion that we must also <span class="emphasis">learn.</span> Then he quoted from James: “Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.22" class="scriptureRef">James 1:22</a>.) We must learn from the scriptures and from good books, he told them, and also from the lives of good men, such as the General Authorities.</p>

The throngs will leave, the lights will dim, the strains from the organ will fade and disappear; but you and I, we will never again be the same. We have heard a prophet’s voice, even that of President Spencer W. Kimball. We have worshipped together in love. We have felt our Heavenly Father’s divine approval. Hopefully each has decided: I will listen; I will learn; I will labor; I will love. To assist us in our determined course the ever-present help of the Lord is assured. ‘Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him.’” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/3.20" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 3:20</a>.)</p>

Packer on “the voice of warning.” He began by quoting from the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, wherein the Lord said:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/the-purpose-of-conferences.p43" pid="AvQIzo192kqWcPlYWuGkxg" hash="HtRwQg">“The voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.</p>

In all, 790 homes were destroyed, and 800 others were severely damaged, as were schools, churches, business houses, etc. About 7,800 people were in the immediate path of the flood, and farther down the valley another 25,000 or 30,000 were in danger. I quote:</p>

My friend said, “There goes a man full of integrity. He has worked for my company for thirty years, and never at any time have I observed any thought or action of dishonesty or disloyalty. It gives a man a good feeling of confidence to have such an employee.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p3" pid="RQRuLr6myk-RSzgRS2Kb8g" hash="-B0lpA">I have thought much about the word <span class="emphasis">integrity</span> since that day, as I often had before, and only wish that we and those with whom we deal would be completely honest and trustworthy, whether it be in matters pertaining to religion, science, economics, or local or national politics. Particularly in the home should integrity be taught and practiced as a basis for its extension into community life and all other phases of living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p4" pid="48z043TTjkyY3gRzCqugxg" hash="g32hbQ">Aware of the need for a revival of this “old-fashioned” virtue, I concluded to address my remarks to this subject. Integrity, or the lack of it, touches almost every facet of our lives—everything we say, every thought and desire.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p5" pid="29oZqZNnVE6PlW3kTsMnvg" hash="TqjZuQ">From this very pulpit, and by some of the greatest religious leaders of modern time, we have heard sermons and exhortations upon honesty, trust, righteousness, dependability, truthfulness, kindness, justice, mercy, love, fidelity, and many other principles of right living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p6" pid="GLg6fMbLrE-2cKnQyMDP5A" hash="1b5Uyw">When one has integrated all of these attributes within his being, when they become the moving force of all his thoughts, actions, and desires, then he may be said to possess integrity, which has been defined as “a state or quality of being complete, undivided, or unbroken; moral soundness, honesty and uprightness.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p7" pid="Zn5QEVXoPEm6KNXJe2QUYg" hash="GLJEvA">Let us pursue this thought of a man being whole within himself, or undivided. Such a one would never find himself at war within himself as to which course to pursue or which decision to make. Constantly there would be a unity of purpose. There would not be, as someone has said, “one self for church, another self for business, another for recreation, home, travel, and so on.” This point is well expressed in the following verse by Edward Sanford Martin:</p>

Not only were Christ’s teachings directed to a oneness of purpose, but his own life was the personification of integrity. This virtue is one of our greatest needs today.</p>

We need as our elected and appointed officials those whose characters are unsullied, whose lives are morally clean and open, who are not devious, selfish, or weak. We need men and women of courage and honest convictions, who will stand always ready to be counted for their integrity and not compromise for expediency, lust for power, or greed; and we need a people who will appreciate and support representatives of this caliber.</p>

Concerned that they might ride into a field where the crop could be damaged by the tramp of horses, he sent one of his workmen to shut the gate and then keep watch over it and on no account to open it. He had scarcely arrived at his post when the hunters came up and ordered that the gate be opened. He declined to do so, stating the orders he had received, and steadfastly refused to open the gate in spite of the threats and bribes as one after another of the hunters came forward.</p>

Business leaders and financiers should be the very epitome of integrity. Fortunately most of them are—but when we learn of wide-scale bribery, fraud, cheating, deceit, power plays to gain control of vast financial empires; when we have to legislate to make our dealings with one another honest and prevent one group from taking undue advantage of another, we know that integrity is lacking. If it were not, businesses could operate more successfully, employees would be more honest in their performance, and the products of their labor would not be inferior or shoddy. Even now the United States government is considering new ways to protect the consumer from fraudulent practices and inferior merchandise.</p>

Nowhere else, save in the home, is there greater opportunity to practice and to educate in the principles of integrity. There is an undeniable correlation between it and education. The famous English author, Samuel Johnson, understood it and expressed it in these few words: “Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful.” (<span class="emphasis">Rasselas,</span> ch. 41.)</p>

We bring upon ourselves much of the distress, heartache, and suffering we endure because of moral unsoundness and dishonesty, which are creeping into every vocation and realm of activity. As long ago as 1666, Jean Baptiste Molière, a famous French dramatist, wrote, “If everyone were clothed with integrity, if every heart were just, frank, kindly, the other virtues would be well-nigh useless, since their chief purpose is to make us bear with patience the injustices of our fellows.” (<span class="emphasis">Le Misanthrope,</span> act 5, scene 1.)</p>

With such erosion come heartaches, untold suffering and distress, through the sins of adultery, fornication, and promiscuity when husbands and wives are unfaithful.

When the boy told him, he said if he would show him the way he would be rewarded handsomely. When Gerhardt replied that he could not leave his sheep for fear they might be lost, the hunter said, “Well, what of that?

In fact, we should all be convinced that it is far easier to emulate the example of our Savior than it is to follow Satan, whose path leads us away from integrity and into darkness and misery. There is no happiness in sin, and when we depart from the path of righteousness we begin to do those things which will inevitably lead us to unhappiness and misery and loss of freedom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p31" pid="4F87Ur4RGkOpaSX_JbUI-w" hash="qsWBpQ">Now, what can we do to improve the conditions we have been discussing? Let each of us begin with himself to find out how he stands on the principle of integrity. Let us make an honest assessment of our hearts, our lives, our desires and goals, involving a recognition of all our faults. Then we should make a serious effort to set them right, to change directions toward the ideal of integrity and its associate virtues.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p32" pid="2MolJ3bEtkGHIDR4XVyHjQ" hash="SMn-tg">Our eternal salvation and exaltation in the kingdom of God, our Heavenly Father, will be determined by how we live the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The early leaders of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, including the Prophet Joseph Smith and his associates, understood the importance of integrity in their lives. They would not and could not make any compromise with revealed truth. Though Joseph Smith was ridiculed and persecuted for stating that he had seen a vision of the Father and the Son, he reported that he felt much like Paul when he made his defense before King Agrippa. Some said Paul was dishonest, others that he was mad. He was ridiculed and reviled.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p33" pid="XP489N6T5EGGf4zd3ALWWA" hash="xV_v3Q">So it was with the Prophet Joseph. He said, “I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.25" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:25</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p34" pid="zYkK7Oxpm0qnwgL8hsKgUw" hash="AnJJzw">Joseph Smith also gave us another declaration incorporating integrity. In writing the Articles of Faith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he gave us these words as the Thirteenth Article:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p35" pid="R-8-hKBorkG64Qdgjw_XxQ" hash="_OBYwA">“We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul—We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.” [<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:13</a>]</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p36" pid="lv8ysbJQHkO9XFi3KNj2iQ" hash="wZe6Qg">Let each and every one of us incorporate this admonition into our everyday living.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p37" pid="mGymvSl88E2e1Tmp0TF-pQ" hash="YL75QA">Among the Prophet’s close associates were those who led our pioneer forefathers across the wilderness to the Great Salt Lake Valley, to become a great and a mighty people according to divine prophecy. They could not have done so by compromising their principles.</p>

Kimball, grandfather of our present-day prophet and leader, President Spencer W. Kimball. On one occasion he said:</p>

All such people will prevail. If they fail in their integrity and firmness to the cause of righteousness, and repent not, they will lose all they have already gained, all they have expected, and all that has ever been promised to them that overcome.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 8:89.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p40" pid="W2JWvGKlyE2DqKl1JhmXIg" hash="dv8TGQ">To win the approbation of our Eternal Father and Jesus Christ, his Son, should be the supreme reward for integrity; and let us never suppose that such righteousness will ever go unnoticed or unrewarded. This is evident in a revelation given to Joseph Smith in January 1841, which made reference to his faithful brother, Hyrum, whose devotion brought him a martyr’s death when the two were murdered in Carthage Jail in 1844. I quote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p41" pid="Abt7hTFpskKMARvMyrU4wQ" hash="-iM1yw">“And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p42" pid="UL2uKWaeVkm-yJPlHAj_Wg" hash="IbWDzA">This applies equally to the multitudes of righteous people throughout the world who deal with their fellowmen with integrity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p43" pid="XJALCUtSw0KhXPz-hCPt-Q" hash="EKveOw">The prophets of the Old and New Testaments, and those of the Book of Mormon, attained that integrity of heart that brought them the companionship of the Holy Spirit. Likewise, those who have presided and today preside over this restored kingdom of God do so with integrity, with complete devotion. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the world over can be eternally grateful to know of the unwavering faith of these devoted General Authorities who sit upon the rostrum of this great Tabernacle today. They, with thousands of other leaders throughout the Church, are upright, sincere, and devoted to the trust placed upon them. They are unselfish in their service, humble and submissive to the mind and will of our Lord and Savior. Their utmost desire is to seek salvation and exaltation for themselves and their fellowmen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p44" pid="KGKyLggSZUW8hO2CyvHilQ" hash="kBJ-zQ">I bear witness that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Savior of the world, is the head of this church and directs its activities through his prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/integrity.p45" pid="-4jAdJSaKUmK4H-IeR55xQ" hash="susW3A">I would this day, with all my soul, pray that the hearts of men everywhere will be touched by that divine spark which will cause them to understand, accept, and live the teachings of Jesus Christ, which will prepare them for eternal life with God, our Heavenly Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

This is a national organization with councils in cities all across the country, manned by local officers and committees. In Salt Lake City, a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew, and a Mormon all work together as co-chairmen in the interest of promoting fellowship and brotherhood. And I have thought what a wonderful thing it would be to extend this kind of fellowship to all religions and people throughout the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-greatest-brotherhood.p2" pid="rBda2ojdWUS7iSwtv1bJXQ" hash="98yNRg">The president of this organization, Dr. David Hyatt, has stated:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-greatest-brotherhood.p3" pid="myEWFRtyHUWtS9OYfyIu5A" hash="sqOWXw">“Brotherhood—the respect for the dignity and worth of another human being—must become a part of our conscious activities, not just philosophical rhetoric or afterthought. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-greatest-brotherhood.p4" pid="-mDiQ9f3FE2OmzPONHLpJQ" hash="gBzzmA">“Brotherhood is democracy at work! It is giving to others the rights and respect we want for ourselves. It can be that simple and that profound!” (“We Need You to Combat Intergroup Bigotry and Prejudice,” NCCJ pamphlet, December 1974, p. 3).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-greatest-brotherhood.p5" pid="MbOrmcm4QUOtnES6_zXE7g" hash="X44MeQ">As I have observed the members of this organization and have studied their aims and ideals, I have been impressed with what I have seen them accomplish by people working together in harmony and in unity to achieve their purposes. And I thought of other groups working for brotherhood or sisterhood, or to promote other causes or projects, and my mind always came back to the organization of the priesthood of God, which is the greatest and most important brotherhood association in all the world. How fortunate we are to be members of it!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-greatest-brotherhood.p6" pid="qHO7sIvJSESjp4S5AcBsvw" hash="HL5nRg">But, as I seem to be always reminding us, with that membership comes great responsibility and great opportunity. It is not enough for us to be members, and to be satisfied with the numbers we have in our respective quorums. We want to reach out and embrace all the world in our brotherhood, which is the only organization designed to bring them the greatest gift they could receive—eternal life!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-greatest-brotherhood.p7" pid="-73Br-syckq85MCmDkYBzw" hash="pJcvBA">The members of the Church are in a very unique position because they know and understand that all human beings are literally the spirit children of God, and that the family unit is eternal and can enjoy eternal progression, which should be the goal of all. Because we know that God is our Father, we refer to one another as brothers and sisters, just as children in families do, and we enjoy a true feeling of brotherhood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-greatest-brotherhood.p8" pid="9C1DAgxEK0alsFX_5SK61A" hash="MgDIhw">Some people ask the reason for an organized church. They feel they can work out their salvation alone, and that there is no need to attend church meetings or fill other requirements as long as they are honest and honorable and do good to their fellowmen. But the Lord has given us instructions that we should belong to a church; and this, his church, has the same organization that Jesus Christ himself established while he was on the earth. We have many explicit declarations from the Lord that make this clear, and also that we need to encourage and help one another.</p>

There was a gigantic tree which he observed standing all alone on the top of a small hill. The boy, full of awe, called out excitedly, ‘Uncle George, look at that big tree! It will make a lot of good lumber, won’t it?’</p>

It might make <span class="emphasis">a lot</span> of lumber but not a lot of <span class="emphasis">good</span> lumber. When a tree grows off by itself, too many branches grow on it. Those branches produce knots when the tree is cut into lumber. The best lumber comes from trees that grow together in groves. The trees also grow taller and straighter when they grow together.’”</p>

Men and women spend countless hours working together in welfare projects, which will be stocked against the time of need therefore by persons other than themselves. What a great feeling it is to realize that all throughout the Church we have facilities for producing and dispensing commodities which have been placed in storehouses ready to be distributed to the needy among us.</p>

It is easy to do things for our own families and loved ones, but to give of our substance for the stranger who is in need is the real test of our charity and love for our fellowmen.</p>

These projects strengthen personal relations between those who are working together and build testimonies of the truthfulness of a gospel which teaches that we are our brother’s keepers and that “inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>.)</p>

Some of them do not like to pray. They hesitate about standing in public to preach, and some of them would rather go fishing or playing golf on Sunday than attend meeting. But, not one of those indifferent elders will refuse an invitation, for example, to come to a funeral of one of the townsfolk, or one of their members, or of one of their members’ wives, and if you will come as a quorum and sit together as a quorum, there is one means of fellowship. Our High Priests are doing it more than Seventies or Elders.</p>

Get together and harvest it. One of your members has a son on a mission, and his funds are getting low. Just ask if you can be of help to him. Your thoughtfulness he will never forget.

This is because they have caught the spirit of missionary work and become persuaded that all men are brothers and children of God. As they teach the gospel, they learn to replace with love any prejudice they might have felt for the people among whom they labor. It is remarkable what the Spirit of the Lord can do for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/the-greatest-brotherhood.p38" pid="NHAaoCeaWUm0kWJgRTwyug" hash="KmhwdA">We pray every day that governments of countries which are now closed to our missionaries will open their gates to make it possible for us to teach them the gospel, which alone will bring full understanding of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.

We express this feeling of brotherhood through the principles we teach and the work we do. We have mentioned temple work for the dead, our welfare services, and the great missionary program. We also express our concern and interest in our fellows through the home teachers of the priesthood organizations and the visiting teachers of the Relief Society. Where these visits are made as they should be, members of the Church should feel that they are fellowshipped into a great brotherhood or sisterhood.</p>

A man in one of our organizations was transferred to New York City to direct the work of one of our radio stations. He had never been to New York before, but he located one of our chapels and attended church the first Sunday he was there. He was welcomed into the priesthood quorum as a brother, and his wife and children were similarly welcomed and were soon right at home.</p>

Though he was a member of a church with many times the membership of the LDS church, he found it most difficult to feel at home and soon asked for a transfer back to his original station. It might have been his fault, or it might have been the fault of his church. However, in our Church if the individual and the quorum are functioning as they should, all Church members should feel happy, wanted, and accepted wherever they go.</p>

After three or four days my wife and family returned home to Phoenix, and the members of the ward rallied around my family to help wherever they could. One good brother offered the use of his private plane or motor home to bring me back home. We used the motor home, which made it possible for them to slide the stretcher into it.</p>

May we assist our prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, in accomplishing his great desires for the benefit and blessing of all mankind. His primary and most worthy goals are to take the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, and to build temples wherein the work can be done to seal on earth and in heaven those blessings reserved for the faithful righteous.</p>

I fully believe that when he comes he will call on the faithful brethren who hold his priesthood in preference to any others to assist him in the consummation of his glorious work. I know he lives, that he will come again; and it is my earnest prayer that we will be worthy to meet him and assist him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We have heard the prophet of God emphasize the importance of this great work and encourage each and every one of us to become fully engaged in the programs. We have heard his call and must respond wholeheartedly. President Romney, the great authority on welfare and chairman of the Church Welfare Committee, has spoken to us and instructed all of us in our duties.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/latter-day-samaritans.p18" pid="I36uHbMBYU29U2USSNtwvw" hash="MrJhAg">First, the Samaritan “had compassion.” He had the urge to help, for he felt sympathetic to the wounded man’s problem. This kindly affection is brought forth in the heart of anyone who has been touched by the Spirit of the Lord. These empathetic feelings should be felt by each of us toward one another. Indeed, the Savior said that covenant Israel should be known and distinguished by the love they show one for the other. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.35" class="scriptureRef">John 13:35</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/latter-day-samaritans.p19" pid="twATYvzqTkGn5tyMRIwPDA" hash="qTG_Ww">Second, the Samaritan “went to him.” He did not wait to be approached by the one in need, but rather perceived the need and stepped forth without being asked to do so. In that great hymn “A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 153), so loved by the Prophet Joseph, we sense that the high reward promised by the Savior came not just because acts of kindness were performed, but also because they were done spontaneously, consistently, and selflessly.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/latter-day-samaritans.p20" pid="YX7NzSeIZkS85TrDUudwrA" hash="oCCCZA">Third, the Samaritan “bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine.” He provided medical attention and refreshed the sufferer’s thirst. This immediate relief may well have saved the man’s life.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/latter-day-samaritans.p21" pid="ZKqnvNHAU0C9CSC2t9lANA" hash="3XmFxg">Fourth, the Samaritan “set him on his own beast”—that is, he provided transportation and “brought him to an inn,” a place of rest and care. By providing this appropriate accommodation he ensured the proper conditions for healing to take place.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/latter-day-samaritans.p22" pid="fBjRC8b6RECv7QGjl_JAYg" hash="mYyxLQ">Fifth, the Samaritan “took care of him.” Notice that during the critical stages of healing, the Samaritan did not turn the care of the wounded man over to others, but sacrificed of his own time and energy to perform this healing service <span class="emphasis">himself.</span> In a time when it is so easy to leave things to someone else, it is important to have so powerful an example as this good Samaritan.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/latter-day-samaritans.p23" pid="j13881l-hkKf07KGxe3FDQ" hash="Vu3_8A">Sixth, the Samaritan “on the morrow … took out two pence, and gave them to the host.” He took of his own money, not someone else’s, and paid for the services he could not render himself. He thus consecrated of his means for the care of the poor and the needy.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/latter-day-samaritans.p24" pid="NC6aJsrqI0ycyvoj2YCRyA" hash="QSZnAQ">Seventh, the Samaritan, needing to continue earning his own living, told the innkeeper to “take care of him.” In this way he enlisted <span class="emphasis">others—resource persons—</span>to help and to continue the care.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/latter-day-samaritans.p25" pid="rkwsFVh-gkSnTdKullp_WA" hash="jcn_ow">Eighth, the Samaritan then promised that “whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.” Here the ultimate in compassion is shown! He puts no limit on the extent to which he will help. And, perhaps even more significant, he does not drop it there and forget it, but commits himself to return and ensure that all that could be done has been done.</p>

As was stressed last April, I want to give emphasis to the three crucial meetings that must be held if Welfare Services is to be carried forward as the Lord intended. These three are the weekly Ward Welfare Services Committee meeting, the monthly Stake Welfare Services Committee meeting, and the monthly Stake Bishops Council meeting. (See <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1977, pp. 88–90.)</p>

I believe it was President Lee who said that we must never let this program become one of professionals. To the extent possible, we should rely on church service—brothers and sisters—to accomplish much of this work. When it is required that we have full- or part-time employees, then let us make certain that those we hire are fully qualified.</p>

We all know that the priesthood is the power of God delegated to man to act in His name in the office which he holds. No greater blessing can be given to a man than to have a testimony of the gospel and to hold the priesthood of God.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/the-blessing-of-church-interviews.p6" pid="gsTsG_WdOUCbQlLNqTGoJQ" hash="1ahYkg">What a tremendous thing to think about as we contemplate the power and authority and the various functions of the offices of these two priesthoods. The Aaronic Priesthood can administer the sacrament and pass it to the members of the Church and perform other duties as assigned by the bishop. The priests can actually baptize people in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost; and it is so important that each and every one participating in such ordinances be clean and worthy to justify the confidence placed in them by the Lord.</p>

I was fortunate enough to have my father as my bishop all the time I was in the Aaronic Priesthood. When he was interviewing me, I didn’t know if he was interviewing me as a father or as a bishop, but he interviewed me, and he told me how important the priesthood was and what was necessary for me to do to be worthy of that priesthood. He was the best friend I had, and I think every bishop should be the best friend a boy has outside of his family. He should know that the bishop is trying to help him to live worthy and prepare himself for the great blessings promised by the Lord to those who will keep the covenants and live according to the teachings of the gospel. It’s wonderful to live in a home where the father is exemplary, where the influence is good, where regular family home evenings are held.</p>

And finally “God created man in his own image … male and female created he them” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.1-27" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:1–27</a>).</p>

Belief in the fact that God exists is of first importance, but it is not <span class="emphasis">all</span> that is necessary in order to exercise an intelligent faith that will lead us back into his presence for eternal life with him.</p>

Faith will avail us nothing unless it is based on true principles. This is illustrated in a story I have told before about the meeting of the Indians with the Europeans when they first began their explorations in the New World. The Indians were amazed at the power and explosive qualities of gunpowder and asked many questions about how it was produced. Taking advantage of the ignorance of the savages and seeing an opportunity to increase their wealth through deception, the Europeans told them it came from the seed of a plant. The Indians believed them and purchased some seed in exchange for gold. They carefully planted the seed and watched it grow, but of course they did not get any gunpowder. No matter how sincere one’s belief may be in an error, it will not change the error into truth.</p>

Unless we know him and understand his nature and character, we cannot have perfect faith in him. There was no question about God in Old Testament times. He walked and talked with Adam and Eve, and even after their transgression they continued to call upon him and to sacrifice to him. He gave them commandments which they obeyed.</p>

Through Noah and his family, a knowledge of God by direct tradition was carried beyond the Flood; moreover, Noah held direct communication with God and lived to instruct ten generations of his descendants. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 6:9</a>.) There followed Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (or Israel), and among the children of Israel, God wrought great wonders.

As man proceeds to the closer examination of things he finds that by study and scientific investigation these proofs are multiplied many fold. He may learn of the laws by which the earth and its associated worlds are governed in their orbits; by which satellites are held subordinate to planets, and planets to suns; he may behold the marvels of vegetable and animal anatomy, and the surpassing mechanism of his own body; and with such appeals to his reason increasing at every step, his wonder as to who ordained all this gives place to adoration for the Creator whose presence and power are thus so forcefully proclaimed; and the observer becomes a worshiper.” (<span class="emphasis">The Articles of Faith,</span> 42nd ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1961, pp. 32–33.)</p>

The early scriptures do not attempt to demonstrate God’s existence or to argue on the sophistries of atheism, so it seems that the errors of doubt crept in at some later time. With the death of Christ and the apostles, and during the period of apostasy when revelation ceased, the simple, consistent, and authentic doctrine about the character and attributes of God became distorted, and numerous theories and dogmas of men appeared, many of which are utterly mystical and incomprehensible.</p>

It is recorded that when the Savior was baptized, John recognized the sign of the Holy Ghost, he saw Jesus in the flesh, and he heard the voice of the Father. Each personage of the Godhead manifested himself separately (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/3.13-17" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 3:13–17</a>). Later, the Savior separately defined the three members of the Godhead when he told his disciples that when he left them, the Father would send a comforter, who is the Holy Ghost (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>).</p>

With the increased growth and internationalization of the Church and the great responsibility to promote the ecclesiastical and temporal work throughout the world in a more unified fashion, we are introducing an emphasis on the role of councils in Church government.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/new-emphasis-on-church-councils.p" pid="IiaQG_g0KECIqWbD97mmAA" hash="Mpkvaw">This action will maintain the orderly management of Church activity at all administrative levels. President Ezra Taft Benson, of the Council of the Twelve, and Bishop Victor L. Brown, Presiding Bishop of the Church, will explain details and indicate how this modification is to be implemented in the various parts of the Church.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/new-emphasis-on-church-councils.p" pid="h_xkEC9woU6F-fK9zNqTjw" hash="7hxjsg">Since its beginning, the Church has been governed by leadership councils. Priesthood councils are a fundamental order of the Church, as illustrated repeatedly in the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/new-emphasis-on-church-councils.p" pid="7nSMBzX2yEG3kMGX9QCosg" hash="4_0WXA">Sometimes these councils are advisory in nature, such as with the ward council, where auxiliary leaders advise the bishop and Melchizedek Priesthood leaders in the affairs of the ward.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/04/new-emphasis-on-church-councils.p" pid="DPU69UqULEOq_vkM27zghw" hash="Yo_SSw">Sometimes these councils are regulatory bodies, such as with the General Church Coordinating Council which was announced by the First Presidency in 1977. This council consists of the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric. In this council, policies and procedures are agreed upon, and the work of the Church is coordinated and correlated.</p>

These councils, properly organized and functioning, assure a unified approach to move forward the ecclesiastical and temporal work of the Church for the blessing of individuals and families.</p>

As Paul beautifully states in Ephesians, chapter 4, the Church organization is given “for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</p>

With this action today, we are completing the <span class="emphasis">linkage</span> of the priesthood chain both ecclesiastically and temporally.

This is the way we deal with a dissenting vote: all the people other than this one voted to sustain those who were presented, so I asked him to see a member of the Twelve. The purpose of asking him to see somebody is so that he can report why he was not prepared to support the slate of officers. That gives him an opportunity, if he knows some good reason why a person should not be or is not qualified to be sustained, to tell the person assigned to see him; this person can then advise the First Presidency.</p>

They are responsible for the administration of all the temporal affairs assigned to them by the First Presidency. This includes physical facilities, where they act as a service department to acquire land and to build and maintain buildings as required by the ecclesiastical division. They also supervise matters pertaining to finance, membership records, fast offerings, tithing, central purchasing, translation, and distribution. Then they have the heavy responsibility of administering the Welfare Services Department, whose vital program and policies are determined by the Welfare Services Committee, which is composed of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Presiding Bishopric, and the Relief Society Presidency. Included in the Welfare Services program are the Deseret Industries operations throughout the world; stake, ward, and mission welfare programs; bishops’ storehouses; and so on.</p>

I am sure it is evident to everyone that much training and assistance must be given to this kind of organization in these developing areas.</p>

Let us consider some of them. Perhaps most important is the concept of the Godhead. The New Testament clearly established that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are three separate and distinct beings, yet there are many in the Christian world who do not accept this or believe in a personal God in whose image we were created. The Father and the Son actually appeared personally to Joseph Smith to establish their personality and image. When the boy came out of that grove he knew the facts—that God is in form like a man. He speaks, he is considerate and kind, he answers prayer. He is a personal God for he called Joseph by name. His Son is a like and distinct person and is the Mediator between God and man.</p>

Neither his divorced wife nor any of his five children cared enough to come to the hospital to see him. As President Brown thought of the things his friend “had lost which money could not buy and noted his tragic situation and the depth of his misery,” he asked his friend how he would change the course of his life if he had it to live over again.</p>

If we are laid off work, disabled, or encounter serious emergencies, we have difficulties meeting our obligations. Installment buying is the most expensive way to purchase.

He concluded by saying that if we fail as a species it will have nothing to do with energy or any other technological obstacle, but with the way we regard ourselves and others as threats and enemies rather than as members of the same family.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/he-is-there.p3" pid="zRLZdI5OnU6YB8Ppu_ctyA" hash="FYCJOw">As I think of that first article of faith, do we really believe in God and in his Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost? And to what extent do they influence our lives? We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved. As I think about that, I want you to know how God, the Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, have helped me through my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/he-is-there.p4" pid="TISTM3ihmkOvIsdg_m_CDg" hash="A-hE-Q">I am sure that my mother, being the kind of woman she was, thanked God when I was born for the blessing of being a co-partner with God in bringing this spirit child into the mortal world. I am sure she expressed her thanks to God through his Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/he-is-there.p5" pid="nnIdEfzMM06t7MpUFD1hrg" hash="qI4mrg">In my home, prayers were offered on many different occasions. When I was taught to pray, I learned that I was actually talking to God, in the name of Jesus Christ, through the power of the Holy Ghost. When I was eight years old, I was taken by my father to be baptized. I had been told that I was a son of God, a child of God, and that he was interested in me, that he knew me and knew best what was right for me. We were taught to pray at meals; we were taught to pray in the morning; we were taught to pray at night. And we were taught that our Father in Heaven was the one to whom we were talking.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/he-is-there.p6" pid="PqtWTH2aLECgnvQywQnApA" hash="AsolYQ">I wonder how many of us know that we are spirit children of God; and when we are praying, whether it’s over a meal, beginning or closing of a meeting, or at a baptism or confirmation, or the blessing of the bread and water in the sacrament, that we are actually talking to God. He is there, he hears our prayers, and he blesses us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/he-is-there.p7" pid="cfeBpInE_EChNEqgXBTx0g" hash="q5d6cw">But the one prayer which impressed me was when Joseph Smith went into the woods to pray. He had read, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, … and it shall be given.” If <span class="emphasis">any of you</span> lack wisdom, ask of God and you will receive your answer. Pray with faith, not wavering. “For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.6" class="scriptureRef">James 1:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/he-is-there.p8" pid="LD24uB1EAESaYetDXRkG_Q" hash="DW1Mow">God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph—actually appeared to him—and told him they had a work for him to do. He had talked to God; God heard his prayers; his prayers were answered. And I bear testimony to you this morning that these things which I have expressed to you are true. This is the Church of Jesus Christ, under the direction of Christ himself through a prophet of God whom I love, admire, and appreciate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/04/he-is-there.p9" pid="l4DojOQtuEyAmWBAmqgn_w" hash="qAdaPA">I love you people out there and humbly pray we may always realize that when we pray to God we are talking to him, and that he is interested in our welfare. The prayer that I pray at this time is that we will all realize who we are and act accordingly and be an example to people in the world. This is the Church of Jesus Christ; and he will hear all who ask, to help them understand who they are and why they are here. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I have felt that this is one of the finest conferences I have ever attended. Probably we needed the Spirit of the Lord here in our President’s absence, and it has certainly been here. I want to congratulate the speakers, and express my appreciation to this lovely choir.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/remember-who-you-are.p2" pid="Q2rZvxW0gkSY5C3OhZL2NA" hash="07j7uA">As we have attended sessions in this conference, we have been informed, we have been advised, we have been counseled in what we should do as members of the Church. When I was with President David O. McKay and he was not able to attend conference, he said, “President Tanner, you remind those people who they are and to act accordingly.” This “acting accordingly” is very important to me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/remember-who-you-are.p3" pid="64vwrj2gcE-6AcJUrOKWQQ" hash="G8aquA">When I remind people who they are, I express some of our articles of faith. First, “We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.1" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:1</a>) Now, we believe that. But I wonder how we would act if we realized every day that we are spirit children of God and that Jesus Christ is our Savior. Would we do some of the things we do? Would we do them more emphatically, or would we not do them at all? We have had that Spirit with us today. And I would like to say that the thing that appeals to me and seems more necessary than anything else in the gospel is that we live every day the teachings of the Lord. I ask you to remind people who they are and ask them to act accordingly. If we act accordingly, we will be keeping the commandments of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/remember-who-you-are.p4" pid="1-ChSoTfkkKA6mWXVqxNzQ" hash="WeHHHA">We say, “We believe in God, the Eternal Father.” Do we really believe that he is the Father of our spirit, and act accordingly? We say, “We believe in … His Son, Jesus Christ.” Do we really believe that Jesus Christ is our Savior, and act accordingly? Would we live the way we do if we were conscious of that all the time?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/remember-who-you-are.p5" pid="_SU_NLudrEK3eTTXZymjtw" hash="6GZ_iw">We say, “We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:13</a>) Are we honest every day? True, chaste, benevolent, and virtuous? Are we, brethren and sisters of this Church, living that in our homes, with our children, with our neighbors, in our businesses? What a tremendous thing it would be if we were doing that and being conscious of it at all times!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/remember-who-you-are.p6" pid="V0RNET-4dk-GYqriPuWdwQ" hash="6Owi8g">I would just like to give you an example of what I’m thinking of. (It may not be as good as some that I have used before.) I was invited when I was with the Alberta, Canadian government to go down to Dallas, Texas, to speak to a large group of oilmen. I was introduced by the governor of Texas. As he introduced me, he said I had been a bishop in the Mormon church and I was now president of the Edmonton, Canada Branch. He said, “I’d like to tell you men that anybody who is worthy to be a bishop in that church needs no other introduction as far as I am concerned.” He wasn’t complimenting me, but those whom he knew who were members of the Church and holding office there and were dependable. I thought, “What a wonderful thing it would be if each returned missionary could say, ‘I am a returned missionary in good standing,’ and it could be said of him, ‘You need no other introduction.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/remember-who-you-are.p7" pid="cDpPQj1Jk0OeK7ErBrmkqQ" hash="_Kuxwg">How wonderful it would be for every holder of the priesthood if he knew that the Lord knew he could count on him because of the way he lived. I’d like to say today that it is a tremendous responsibility for members of this church to so live that others, seeing their good works, can be led to glorify the Lord’s name. We must do so every day! If this church, this four million people plus—everyone who is living the gospel or the gospel principles—were honest, honorable, and upright in their dealings and could be depended on in every way, that is all the introduction we should need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/remember-who-you-are.p8" pid="EpX6tJy3Hkmz4PKuDinkFA" hash="wU4wqg">I pray as we leave this conference that each one of us who has had a feeling that he would like to do better from now on will turn that feeling into action; that each of us will be honest and be a full tithe-payer; that we will prepare ourselves to go to the temple where we can be married for time and all eternity and have our families sealed to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/remember-who-you-are.p9" pid="oH3N0YcRlEi2R4awIaRY9A" hash="Ju1LOQ">My appeal to you today, brothers and sisters, is that all of us who desire to be better will go home with that determination and do it the rest of our lives, that we might be an example of good, an influence for good, and a great strength to the Church. That is my prayer for us, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
