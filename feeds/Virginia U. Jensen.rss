      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p1" pid="yfaL6zHtqUaHdoymEoDN8g" hash="vrvrew">Greetings, sisters. We have looked forward to meeting with you this evening.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p2" pid="XWLJ8kU7AkGPhDWFKuwhLA" hash="HQ0DyQ">I want to thank you for your many cards and letters, and most of all, I want to thank you for your prayers in our behalf. We gratefully, humbly acknowledge the guiding, teaching hand of great priesthood leaders and of our Father in Heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p3" pid="N3c2AEswx0aI7vFzik17Sw" hash="qWOi6Q">Recently I took my three-year-old granddaughter to a sacrament meeting where a young man was speaking prior to leaving for a mission. I had brought the usual books and things to encourage her to be reverent, but she’s a bright and energetic little girl, so at one point I stood her beside me on the bench so she could see the missionary who was speaking. Then I whispered in her ear, “This young man is going on a mission, and that means he is going to live far away from home and go around telling people all about Jesus.” She looked all around the chapel filled with people and said, “Well, where is Jesus anyway?” She had seen His picture in Primary, but she could not find Him in the audience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p4" pid="bzSpY3dYhEGP6Uiiyd-UmQ" hash="bwHXiw">I cannot tell you how glad I was that I could tell her where Jesus is. As she can understand, I will tell her who He is, what He has done for her and for me, and what He can mean in her life. I was reminded on that occasion what a great opportunity we as women have to influence the lives of those around us. I love my children and my grandchildren, and I desire to keep them safe. Sometimes this world is a frightening place to be. I believe, however, that women have unique opportunities and special gifts and talents to protect, nurture, and influence others. We can create places of security where marriages, children, and families can thrive and avoid the evil of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p5" pid="o3GBebthEkCQuPNn_D1DPg" hash="QgFQBw">In 1978, speaking to a general women’s meeting, President Spencer W. Kimball said: “To be a righteous woman is a glorious thing in any age. To be a righteous woman during the winding up scenes on this earth, before the second coming of our Savior, is an especially noble calling. The righteous woman’s strength and influence today can be tenfold what it might be in more tranquil times. She has been placed here to help enrich, to protect, and to guard the home—which is society’s basic and most noble institution. Other institutions in society may falter and even fail, but the righteous woman can help to save the home, which may be the last and only sanctuary some mortals know in the midst of storm and strife” (“Privileges and Responsibilities of Sisters,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1978, 103).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p6" pid="ElU4Iuzp2Uy-6GPjxZ2TxA" hash="ENhU6g">In 1996 President Gordon B. Hinckley said: “You sisters are the real builders of the nation wherever you live, for you have created homes of strength and peace and security. These become the very sinew of any nation” (“Women of the Church,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1996, 68).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p7" pid="YvpKx-aHgEeyfb-cJghBSg" hash="i1fmrQ">This is a marvelous time to live on the earth. Ours is a day seen in vision by many of the prophets down through the ages of time. It was to be called the dispensation of the fulness of times because the gospel was to be fully restored that the lives of those who live in this day might be blessed. All who will hear the glad tidings may have the privilege of full access to the saving and exalting ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the peace and the happiness they bring to individuals and families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p8" pid="fOF5OqQA7UuurkYVKMfpRQ" hash="Rpn0sQ">And yet, as Father Lehi taught, “It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:11</a>). As the prophets foresaw and prophesied regarding this day of gladness, they also warned that it would be a day of wickedness (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.1-9,13" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 3:1–9, 13</a>), a day of tribulation (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:21</a>), and an evil day (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 27:15</a>) when “all things shall be in commotion” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.91" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:91</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p9" pid="ZqqOXxYFEEyr9jHuDHRXug" hash="DFv5bg">Sisters, I do not believe that you and I are here at this unique time by accident. I believe that, like Esther of old, we are “come to the kingdom for such a time as this” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/esth/4.14" class="scriptureRef">Esth. 4:14</a>), when our influence, our example, our strength, and our faith may stand as a bulwark against the rising tide of evil that threatens to engulf our homes, our families, and our loved ones.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p10" pid="XFqXMiXxoUSDmW4_cfJtWw" hash="ywaZ7g">There is an exciting story in the Book of Mormon beginning in chapter 48 of Alma. It is a time of peril and commotion for the Nephite nation. Their enemies have sworn to defeat them and take them into bondage. Against what appears to be all odds, Captain Moroni must find a way to defend his people—to create places of security for them. He directs his people to dig deep ditches and build up huge banks of earth around the cities. Later he improves upon his earlier defenses by adding works of timber topped with a frame of pickets and eventually towers to overlook the pickets. So effective is his strategy that the Lamanite armies are astonished and rendered powerless, even though they greatly outnumber the Nephites. The Nephites are safe within their cities and repel the Lamanite attacks.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p11" pid="24JKzbRCgEy5e5dEqG3a2Q" hash="FSCCzQ">While his enemies gained power through fraud and deceit, Moroni empowered the Nephites by teaching them to be faithful to God (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/48.7" class="scriptureRef">Alma 48:7</a>). How do we, like Captain Moroni, create places of security for those around us in these sometimes frightening and perilous times? We can begin by following the admonition found in 1 Timothy 4:12 [<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 4:12</a>]: “Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p12" pid="JzS0QxPYnkuah7vL3LlSBw" hash="kKKwpg">When I was 10 years old, I sat in a sacrament meeting and watched my beautiful mother as she stood at the pulpit and told of her experiences as a young missionary in the Southern States Mission. She likened bringing someone to baptism to the thrill of giving birth and bringing a new child into the world. She bore her testimony with strength and conviction. She didn’t need to tell me that missionary work was important; her example said it all. She didn’t need to tell me what a testimony was because I felt it that day as I heard her share hers with the ward and with me. There are people all around us who need the benefit of our good example. President Gordon B. Hinckley said, “The most persuasive gospel tract is the exemplary life of a faithful Latter-day Saint” (“Five Million Members—A Milestone and Not a Summit,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1982, 45).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p13" pid="dsxns2_-v0yvqTXC1K0XpQ" hash="hQFv6A">In Primary we sing, “Keep the commandments! In this there is safety; in this there is peace” (<span class="emphasis">Children’s Songbook,</span> 146). Above all, Captain Moroni showed his people the Lord would guide their efforts if they followed His commandments. A woman who keeps the commandments is using our Heavenly Father’s blueprint to build a place of security for herself and her family. Those around her know they can trust her. They can feel safety and peace within her influence. Adherence to the Lord’s commandments is the foundation of her fortress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p14" pid="jePsOFu3ZkOkApPdjrBqbg" hash="tsBpoA">To provide safety for those around us, we as sisters need to expand our knowledge of all things spiritual. We need to learn and progress in understanding and teach our children those things that will make them less vulnerable to deceit and to the designs of those who conspire against righteousness. Ignorance is not bliss; it is dangerous.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p15" pid="smWjmN-W7kqzny4wrC4GRQ" hash="scRhug">In the 68th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, parents have been commanded to teach their children the simple, lifesaving truths of the restored gospel. Our homes should be the great centers of gospel learning. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said: “When parents fail to transmit testimony and theology along with decency, those families are only one generation from serious spiritual decline, having lost their savor. The law of the harvest is nowhere more in evidence and nowhere more relentless than in family gardens” (“‘Take Especial Care of Your Family,’” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1994, 90). Like the stripling warriors in the Book of Mormon, our children can be motivated, blessed, and, most of all, protected by the faith and wise counsel of righteous mothers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p16" pid="usdPgbcsI0-KkSMEqBUjpw" hash="TZONDw">Sincere prayer can be more effective in protecting our families than the earthen walls Moroni erected around the Nephite cities. It’s impossible to kneel down and take your problems to the Lord without having your heart softened. The changes prayer effects in our homes are multiple. It restores peace and gives hope. It lightens heavy hearts and heals the wounds of sin. It restores perspective, allowing us to recognize our blessings even in the midst of our trials. Finally, it guides us in making decisions. It was in prayer that the Prophet Joseph Smith began the glorious restoration of the true gospel in these latter days. He had been taught to pray by the great example of his mother, Lucy Mack Smith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p17" pid="RCphknW1vkSFjXG2vohecw" hash="RBTPFA">On a Monday evening not long ago, I was walking past a playground where a young family was choosing up sides for a game. I overheard one of the children call out, “Mom, choose me.” As I walked on, these words rang in my ears. Life in today’s world places a multitude of demands on a woman’s resources of time and energy. We can choose to apply our talents in more arenas than ever before, but there are only a few of those places in which our influence is irreplaceable. I can imagine children the world over saying, “When you decide where to spend the time and the gifts that God has given you, Mom, choose me.” Then I thought of elderly grandmothers who might be lonely or too frail to enjoy going out alone saying, “Granddaughter, when you’re looking for a friend to take to a movie or out to lunch, choose me.” I thought of single mothers who might appreciate the chance to have their children be influenced by a righteous priesthood bearer saying, “Neighbor, when you’re looking for someone to invite over for family home evening, choose me and mine.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p18" pid="OWnwf0Iaek6bzJIwL_UVFg" hash="-cvmiw">These choices, sisters, create places of security not only for our own homes but for our neighborhoods, our wards, and our communities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p19" pid="efCjAyBi4UGJW4IMxts3GA" hash="9F73gA">Joseph Smith compared life to a wheel around which we move. He said: “There are times when we are up [at the top of the wheel] and someone else is down. But in due time it [will be] the other way around” (quoted in Truman G. Madsen, <span class="emphasis">The Highest in Us,</span> 26). That is why we need each other. There are times when we are on top and can lift others. But our turn to be lifted will inevitably come!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p20" pid="UtGg2HaYxk6iP4NEgc2Qlg" hash="Nxtepg">One year ago in October conference, President Hinckley petitioned us, saying: “There are widows who long for friendly voices and that spirit of anxious concern which speaks of love. There are those who were once warm in the faith, but whose faith has grown cold. Many of them wish to come back but do not know quite how to do it. They need friendly hands reaching out to them. With a little effort, many of them can be brought back to feast again at the table of the Lord” (“‘Reach with a Rescuing Hand,’” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1996, 86).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p21" pid="fB5VNUxsfkCNDbwAb3iegg" hash="ZSqaCA">Anytime we lift someone else we are in essence creating places of security for them. President Kimball was right. A righteous woman’s strength and influence are great. Her opportunities to create safe havens for struggling souls are abundant.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/creating-places-of-security.p22" pid="5PaC5ieiSkut6bW-0JaxGw" hash="Ak_QCg">I want you to know of my knowledge that our Father in Heaven is real. He lives and He loves us beyond our ability to understand. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. Through Joseph Smith, He restored the true gospel to the earth. He guides and directs our prophet today. Let us be like Captain Moroni in using all available resources to protect that which is precious to us and to our Heavenly Father. That we might do so with wisdom, devotion, and renewed commitment is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p1" pid="C08OsiCsPUa1mXuicFk6cg" hash="beiQbw">During last April’s general conference, we as a Relief Society presidency rejoiced as President Boyd K. Packer stood at this pulpit and said, “It is my purpose to give unqualified endorsement to the Relief Society—to encourage all women to join in and attend, and priesthood leaders, at every level of administration, to act so that Relief Society will flourish.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p2" pid="RouOMjW32UiMPz9OT0xh1Q" hash="e09WRg">Sisters, that is also my purpose tonight. President Mary Ellen Smoot has spoken to you about invitations. Well, I have an invitation for you: Come to Relief Society!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p3" pid="iyHCMj3MVku4uP8wf4KX5A" hash="TjZXXA">The Relief Society was organized through the authority of the priesthood and is directed today by that same authority. The Prophet Joseph Smith said of the priesthood, “It is the eternal authority of God by which the universe was created and governed, and the stars in heaven came into existence.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Speaking specifically to the women of the Church, President George Albert Smith said of Relief Society, “It was God that gave it to you and it came as a result of revelation to a Prophet of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> How should we view an organization that was created through this prophetic priesthood authority? As Relief Society leaders, we serve as an auxiliary to the priesthood to help bring women and their families to Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p4" pid="5m8DwyBlhUK7rHrZZ0-FoA" hash="GIHZOA">What is it about Relief Society that should compel you to “join in and attend,” as President Packer said?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p5" pid="y-cLjHCiFUOiCXUct04iYg" hash="nDII4Q">Within Relief Society are programs designed to help us as women to find meaning and purpose in life for ourselves and for our families. According to President Spencer W. Kimball, “There is no greater and more glorious set of promises given to women than those which come through the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> This is a time when everywhere we look in society, women and their families are in crisis. Marriages are failing at alarming rates. Far too many children are abused and neglected. Women struggle to hear the voice of righteous truth amid a confusing cacophony of voices persuasively urging them toward expediency and political correctness. There are many among our own 4.2 million Relief Society members who are hurting and confused. Do we realize what we have, sisters? Do we understand who we are? Do we fully appreciate that within the organization of the Relief Society we have all of the tools and resources we need to soothe a single soul or to heal a troubled world?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p6" pid="hsOI1_qzRkmFk_JzIw8IhQ" hash="EhJeeA">The first objective of Relief Society is to build faith in Jesus Christ and to teach one another the doctrines of the kingdom of God. Through Relief Society lessons, activities, and shared experiences, you can gain a testimony or you can strengthen the testimony you already have. When it comes right down to it, that may be the single most important thing we do in Relief Society, for the spiritual strength and secure testimonies of the women of the Church are absolutely vital—to themselves, to their families, to their branches and wards, and to the world itself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p7" pid="ROeQXdEizUeSUFEKn0k1uA" hash="vPK7Ew">The second objective of Relief Society is to help each sister understand that she is a beloved spirit daughter of Heavenly Father, and as such she has a divine nature and destiny, including the most marvelous of all possibilities: eternal life in the presence of God as His heir. Once again quoting President Kimball: “Where else can you learn who you really are? Where else can you be given the necessary explanations and assurances about the nature of life? From what other source can you learn about your own uniqueness and identity?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p8" pid="RXPo5hifjkausgUGnLfbkg" hash="goCX6w">When we fully understand that we are daughters of God with rights and privileges that extend throughout eternity—that we are entitled to blessings from Him, dependent upon our faithfulness—then we will look at the world, and our place in it and our responsibility to it, in a different way. Listen to what President Gordon B. Hinckley tells us: “Know that you are daughters of God, children with a divine birthright. Walk in the sun with your heads high, knowing that you are loved and honored, that you are a part of his kingdom, and that there is for you a great work to be done which cannot be left to others.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p9" pid="l-i0l0eKnUmqJG5vcB1yYg" hash="Wkciog">What is the work to which President Hinckley refers—a work “which cannot be left to others”? The answer, as you might expect, can be found in Relief Society. The third objective of Relief Society states each sister is encouraged to reach out and serve those in her family, her ward, and her community. As sisters, we have the ability and the responsibility to help each other walk in the light of the Lord. No matter where we live and regardless of our age, nationality, marital status, or Church calling, there are those around us who need our love and service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p10" pid="ekOTZtuZ9U2ByYuLRz4dQA" hash="r_6YDQ">We are all familiar with the life and work of the late Mother Teresa, who spent most of her life laboring among the world’s poor and impoverished and did much to relieve sorrow and suffering. Once when she was in Australia, she offered to clean the hut of a lonely Aborigine man. In his hut was a beautiful but unlit lamp. When asked why he didn’t light it, he replied, “Nobody comes here.” She made him promise that he would light the lamp, and she promised to have the sisters visit him. Later the man sent word to Mother Teresa: “Tell my friend, the light she lit in my life is still burning!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/come-to-relief-society.p11" pid="S5PaG9gJsEmE3POqX8nIOA" hash="XI9ing">As Relief Society sisters we can bring light into the lives of those we serve along with the loaves of bread we bake and the casseroles we share. We can give hope, we can lift, and we can inspire. We can teach of Christ and help others find peace and comfort within His light. As women, we have natural tendencies to love and nourish. Women teach children, bolster friends, encourage husbands, and cheer on the disheartened. Women are givers of life and nurturers of the living. Every one of us has something to give, something to share, and someone to serve. As the second president of the Relief Society, Eliza R. Snow, declared, “There is no sister so isolated … her sphere so narrow but what she can do a great deal towards establishing the Kingdom of God upon the earth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Has there ever been a time in all of history when that strength and protection was more desperately needed? It is my sincere belief that the most powerful protection against the deteriorating condition of the family is a faithful, righteous mother. In 1993 President Hinckley said: “I remind mothers everywhere of the sanctity of your calling. No other can adequately take your place. No responsibility is greater, no obligation more binding than that you rear in love and peace and integrity those whom you have brought into the world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

As we do so, however, we remember that there are many among the most devoted women of the Church who have not as yet had the opportunity to experience motherhood for themselves. For them, the words of Elder Dallin H. Oaks provide insight: “We know that many worthy and wonderful Latter-day Saints currently lack the ideal opportunities and essential requirements for their progress. Singleness, childlessness, death, and divorce frustrate ideals and postpone the fulfillment of promised blessings. In addition, some women who desire to be full-time mothers and homemakers have been literally compelled to enter the full-time workforce. But these frustrations are only temporary. The Lord has promised that in the eternities no blessing will be denied his sons and daughters who keep the commandments, are true to their covenants, and desire what is right.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

A sister recently shared her feelings about being in Relief Society when she told us, “I have felt the wonderful sense of sisterhood and womanhood, but there has also been a healing force [in Relief Society] that I have found nowhere else.”</p>

There is no one kind of acceptable Latter-day Saint woman. It matters not where you come from, what your weaknesses are, what you look like—you belong here! The Lord loves you—each of you, collectively and individually. We are not ordinary women. We are women of the covenant, women who have recognized the truth, accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ, and made covenants with the Lord to follow Him and do His will. And He needs us—each one of us—to do our part in bringing to pass His great latter-day work among the children of men. We need Relief Society, and Relief Society needs us.</p>

In the temple we make eternal covenants with our Father in Heaven. We make promises to Him, and in return He makes extraordinary promises to us. The next time you go to the temple, whether for yourself or your kindred dead, pay careful attention to the promises God makes to you, His daughter. In every part of the temple, the hallowed halls of God’s house are filled with comforting covenants—personal, intimate assurances of His eternal love.</p>

As President Packer has said, “Strong Relief Societies carry a powerful immunizing and healing influence for the mothers and the daughters, for the single parent, for the single sisters, for the aging, for the infirm.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

I looked out the window, and in the street were newsboys carrying stacks of newspapers in their arms announcing the news that President George Albert Smith, the eighth President of the Church, had died. President Smith had been the only prophet I had known in my short time on earth. It was during his administration that I first felt the stirrings of a testimony, and even then I knew how important God’s prophets are. I had been taught in Primary and in my home by loving parents that President Smith was our earthly link to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, that They could talk to me through him. What an empowering concept for a young girl! The Spirit had confirmed in my 11-year-old mind that this was true. When I learned of his death, I felt a tremendous loss.</p>

McKay stood in this tabernacle and spoke to those assembled. He had just been unanimously sustained as the prophet, seer, and revelator by the Saints. As he brushed back the tears, he said, “No one can preside over the church without first being in tune with the head of the Church, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He is our head. This is his church. … With his guidance, with his inspiration, we cannot fail.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

He went to the airport, stayed there two hours, and returned later from [the] dark room with a tremendous sheaf of pictures. He was supposed to take only two.

The ways in which our lives have been enriched by listening to our prophet’s voice are numerous. We have a clearer picture of who we are and what we mean to our Father in Heaven. We have received commandments and counsel to guide us, reminders to keep us on the straight and narrow, and encouraging words to spur us on when we become disheartened or discouraged. If we listen to the voices of the world, we will be misled. But if we listen to the voice of the Lord through His living prophet and follow his counsel, we will never go astray.</p>

We as members of the Church see so much more. Through the whisperings of the Holy Spirit we know that the true head of this Church, the Lord Jesus Christ, does communicate with us through President Hinckley. It was my blessing and privilege to feel that Spirit when I was called into President Hinckley’s office to receive my call to the general Relief Society presidency one and a half years ago. Before I knew the purpose of my being there, I shook his hand and received a powerful personal witness that I was in the presence of a prophet of God. That witness made me feel exceedingly humble and reverent. If I was kind of quiet that day, President Hinckley, that is the reason.</p>

Joseph Smith made this prophecy in the dedication of the Kirtland Temple: “That thy church may come forth out of the wilderness of darkness, and shine forth fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.73" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 109:73</a>).

But here’s the miracle. The Lord has given some marvelous guarantees without any disclaimers. And this is one of them: He will choose the prophet, and He will never let that man lead us astray. Imagine for a moment the impact of that promise. There is at least one place we can turn for pure, unpolluted guidance.</p>

We are created in His image. Our gender was determined before we came to earth and is part of our eternal identity. We lived with Him before we came to earth. God commanded us to bear children but warned that the powers of procreation were to be employed only within the sacred bonds of marriage. God tells us through His prophet that we have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other as husband and wife and to rear our children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs. The family is ordained of God. Parents have specific duties and responsibilities—fathers preside, provide, and protect, and mothers nurture. In addition, the proclamation contains this very important warning—that those who abuse spouse or offspring, who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will stand accountable before God. Further, this warning—that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets. Brothers and sisters, we are in the midst of that reality at this very moment. It is the duty of all of us to protect and strengthen the family.</p>

A small sparrow chose a rose tree on my patio for her nest. Time after time she flew back and forth, carrying blades of grass and small twigs in her beak. Carefully she manipulated her way through the rose thorns, depositing her building materials in the chosen spot. She worked without resting until the tiny nest was finished. I was amazed at how carefully the grasses were woven to make a strong and stable structure. I was almost moved to tears when I saw in the bottom of the nest four small pieces of cotton, placed in just the right spot to make a soft bed for her little ones.</p>

Since she was larger, so was her nest, and in addition to being bigger, the outside of her nest was glued with mud, which kept the grasses and twigs together and held it in the crook of the rain gutter. Inside, single blades of grass were woven into a soft, cuplike shape that perfectly cradled the bird.</p>

Hour after hour, day after day these birds sat on their eggs. After the eggs hatched, the mothers worked full time to feed their hungry babies.</p>

Obviously she was uncomfortable in the glare of the sun. I wondered why she stayed. Then I realized she was not sitting deep in the nest as she had when she was keeping her babies warm. Instead she was carefully stretched over the top of the nest, forming a protective shelter to keep her featherless babies from being sunburned.</p>

Did you know that barn swallows make more than 1,200 mud-carrying trips in order to construct their nests? One single nest of a hooded oriole was found to contain 3,387 separate pieces of material. It seems to me that birds invest everything—their time, their energy, their means, their own comfort—to make a home and rear their young. It is not a priority that is given second place or avoided. It takes first place.</p>

How did they know how to build a nest and to shade their fledglings from the sun? Birds follow instincts to provide, protect, and nurture. These are God-given instincts, and pondering on them caused me, along with the Psalmist, to exclaim, “O Lord, how great are thy works!” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/92.5" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 92:5</a>).</p>

We instinctively want so much for those we love, and yet being human, we encounter many more problems than the birds I observed. In today’s society there are many who challenge the importance of the traditional home and family. Some think there are other uses of a woman’s time and talents that are more important than the family. But prophets have been relentless in declaring that the role of homemaker is one of the most sacred and meaningful pursuits possible to man or woman. Sisters in all life circumstances have opportunities to build and nurture others within their sphere of influence. As you and I learn more about Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation, we are assured that no matter the circumstances of our individual lives, creating a safe and nurturing environment for those we love is of the utmost importance.</p>

The new name will be Home, Family, and Personal Enrichment. The purpose of the new name is to clearly communicate what this important midweek meeting of Relief Society is designed to accomplish. The further purpose of the new name is to help each of us refocus our attention on strengthening ourselves and then, with that increased strength, build our family members, friends, neighbors, and community so that each may be brought closer to our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. During the 15-minute lesson portion of this meeting, teachers will present a spiritual topic. During the 60- to 90-minute activity portion, we will learn practical skills based on the spiritual topic. These practical skills could be something like home maintenance and repairs, gardening, or quilting. We could also choose to participate in service activities that bless and strengthen others. This meeting should enrich and improve each of our lives.</p>

Through the gospel of Jesus Christ, we have the knowledge and the means to establish homes of strength, peace, love, and faith. We need not do it alone. The programs of the Church can help us. We also need the help our Father in Heaven is eager to give us. In Psalm 127:1 [<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/127.1" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 127:1</a>] we are cautioned, “Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.”</p>

He asked if he could help. Through her sobs she explained that she was lost. He told her that this was his house and his wife was inside. He told her he knew she shouldn’t go with strangers, but if she felt comfortable going inside, he and his wife would try to find her home. They went into his house, and his wife, Linda, began to console the little girl. “I’m sure you must be very frightened,” she said.</p>

We who know the truth can help them. We can show them a pattern of strong homes and righteous family members. We can help them if we have the Savior in our homes—not just His picture on the wall but also His teachings, His Spirit, and His love. Despite the instincts we have been blessed with, this kind of home doesn’t happen automatically. We need spiritual strength and practical skills to build a home where the Spirit of the Lord is present. Home, Family, and Personal Enrichment meeting is a place for us to share sisterhood, to gain knowledge, to learn skills, and to increase testimony. This meeting is also the place to rededicate ourselves to our homes and families and to the giving of service wherever it is needed.</p>

Monson, “the Lord, even our building inspector, may say to us, as he said … to Solomon, a builder of another day, ‘… I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually’” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/9.3" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 9:3</a>; <span class="emphasis">Pathways to Perfection</span> [1973], 250).</p>

Standing on the edge of beautiful Jackson Lake, with the majestic mountain peaks reflected in its glassy surface, we would have contests skipping rocks across the smooth water. As the rocks sank, we watched while ripples moved out across the water as far as we could see. Even the smallest pebble tossed by our youngest child rippled on and on and on.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p2" pid="_dOuYvSes0aAMyv1bnuunQ" hash="PpnuVQ">Like the expanding circles our pebbles made on Jackson Lake, the actions of righteous women ripple on and on through time and space and even generations. These righteous actions come from our understanding of the divine mission of Jesus Christ, our knowledge of the gospel plan, our obedience to eternal commandments, and our work in this, the kingdom of God on earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p3" pid="klVRJaGK-U2B6oZrXKT-3Q" hash="vzcjSA">Let me share an example of how this rippling begins and reverberates when one righteous Latter-day Saint woman acts upon her knowledge that Jesus is the Christ and the gospel has been restored.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p4" pid="i4RrjBf94E65IXCzcAk3TA" hash="7wlTWQ">In 1841, Dan Jones, a Welsh immigrant, was the captain of one of the smallest registered boats carrying people and freight on the upper Mississippi River. It seems more than coincidence to me that his boat was named the <span class="emphasis">Ripple.</span> Among his passengers were members of an obscure “new” church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p5" pid="dysRfmhVxEer9JlZUwnhzw" hash="9h8UTA">During his journeys Dan Jones began to hear criticisms of these “Mormons.” Because he had ferried many of them, he had talked with them and observed their behavior. He found them to be good people—kind, honest, and hardworking. The negative comments and writings about these people did not match up with what he had experienced in his dealings with them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p6" pid="VgyHFWJcOkqrrbMbtepHtw" hash="eTRHtA">“Through a careful investigation of the accusations,” he later wrote, “I perceived clearly that it was impossible for them to be true, either because … they overstated the case or … contradicted themselves” (quoted in Ronald D. Dennis, “Dan Jones, Welshman,”<span class="emphasis"> Ensign,</span> Apr. 1987, 50).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p7" pid="vbjVa58zNE2586oZhoceUw" hash="yoeldA">One significant event in particular propelled Dan Jones from a careful observer to an active investigator of the Church. He wrote this: “Purely by accident, there fell into my hands … a letter which [Emma Smith] had written. … I shall never forget the feelings which that … letter caused me to have. I perceived clearly that not only did [she] believe the New Testament, the same as I—professing the apostolic faith, and rejoicing in the midst of her tribulations at being worthy to suffer all … for a testimony of Jesus and the gospel—but also it contained better counsel, more wisdom, and showed a more … godly spirit than anything I had ever read!” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Apr. 1987, 50, 52).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p8" pid="PRBzbmTzFEeiy1dygh5CpA" hash="1ja4pQ">Inspired by Emma’s words and example, Dan Jones sought to learn more about this church. In 1843 he was baptized in the Mississippi River and became one of the most influential missionaries in the history of the Church, bringing hundreds of people to the gospel in his native Wales. In a very literal way, Emma Smith’s influence continues to ripple through generations. Who can say how many hundreds, even thousands of the descendants of those Dan Jones introduced to the gospel may be listening to this meeting at this very hour?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p9" pid="r49ZJDNxIU6-oCfSp1i2pg" hash="xznD3w">Each of us can act in ways that can ripple through a life as powerfully as Emma Smith’s words did in the heart of Dan Jones. Each of us is just one person, but I remember the circles that one tiny pebble made across the vastness of Jackson Lake. Let us take to heart this scriptural encouragement: “Be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:33</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p10" pid="zm9zFTW_k0Kb0GbKcMQQLQ" hash="Aw-xAA">In that most important of places, our homes, we learn best how it is that “out of small things proceedeth that which is great,” for life at home is a series of small things that combine to create an eternal family. Perhaps because creating strong relationships with the Lord and each other is so incremental, or because teaching and encouraging and leading are sometimes thankless, it is easy to become distracted, even discouraged.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p11" pid="p65BNg352Uu6d5KD35k7TA" hash="sJcMJw">The adversary would like to confuse us and divert our attention from what matters most. But we are blessed, for we know that faith and family matter most. The women who have touched my heart and motivated me to lead a better life are those who put the Lord and family first. Their “godly spirit” does for my heart what Emma Smith’s words did for Dan Jones, beckoning me to come unto Christ, who proclaimed, “I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/21.6" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 21:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p12" pid="3itRkkFhR0WSYEG_5FYfcw" hash="omnPSQ">Virtue and power are found in everyday, ordinary work, in all the daily tasks of caring for our families, and in our regular service to others. Prominence does not equal priority, nor can the world’s paycheck equal that of our Heavenly Father’s, who knows the importance of a woman’s devotion to the salvation of souls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p13" pid="JuYrFUIOPkiWqcQFPpLfiw" hash="PA2Jhg">As we think of women whose righteous influence ripples through eternity, let us consider Mary, the “precious and chosen vessel” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:10</a>). Presented by an angel with an unprecedented, holy pronouncement, she graciously submitted to the will of the Lord: “Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/1.38" class="scriptureRef">Luke 1:38</a>). Her faith, obedience, and humility set a standard for all women.</p>

They are women who seek favor with God. … They are humble and live lives of chastity and virtue. … They have believing hearts and magnify the Lord. … They rejoice in the Savior and … recognize His gifts and mercies” (S. Michael Wilcox, <span class="emphasis">Daughters of God: Scriptural Portraits</span> [1998], 179).</p>

Your faithful works and words contribute significantly to the building of this, the kingdom of God on the earth. Elder Bruce R. McConkie reminds us how critical our roles have ever been: “This we know: Christ, under the Father, is the Creator; Michael, His companion and associate, presided over much of the creative work; and with them, as Abraham saw, were many of the noble and great ones. Can we do other than conclude that Mary and Eve and Sarah and myriads of our faithful sisters were numbered among them? Certainly these sisters labored as diligently then, and fought as valiantly in the war in heaven, as did the brethren, even as they in like manner stand firm today, in mortality, in the cause of truth and righteousness” (<span class="emphasis">Woman</span> [1979], 59).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/ripples.p19" pid="K5Fve0pO40KfuPoo94oglg" hash="NIURsQ">Like those “noble and great” women who came before us, we cannot be ordinary women. We cannot be women who seem too much like women of the world. We must speak up for righteousness without apology. We, like Mary, Eve, Sarah, and Emma, are unique. We have ripples to make and water to share. Given our eternal heritage, we must remember how powerfully our simple, righteous actions can ripple through the hearts and homes of those around us. We have such a great opportunity to do so much good, and, most important, we know where and how to “draw water out of the wells of salvation.”</p>

Around the corner from Tammy lived a young man who also decided in his mid-teens that he didn’t want to be part of the Church. They both developed habits that took them further away from Church activity. Eventually, they married and began to raise a family.</p>

She faintly remembered feeling her Heavenly Father’s Spirit and influence with her, and she missed Him. Reluctant to share these thoughts with her husband for fear he would not approve, she kept them hidden. She wanted to come back, but she just didn’t know how to begin. Let’s listen to her own words as she tells the ripple effect of two wonderful visiting teachers who “[drew] water [from] the wells of salvation” and shared it with Tammy.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p1" pid="0hkreiumW0-MDe5gyMbNzA" hash="u3sAvA">When he was just 10 years old, Joshua Dennis spent five days trapped in the pitch-black darkness of an abandoned mine. When rescuers finally heard his faint cry for help and pulled him out of the horrible darkness, he was disoriented, cold, and exhausted. Much to their surprise, he wasn’t afraid. Josh spent his time sleeping, yelling for help, and praying. “Someone was protecting me,” he explained. “I knew people were going to find me.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p2" pid="r7H_dWtri0yrIEWBCIYLEA" hash="i3989w">Joshua’s simple but profound faith had been nurtured by his parents, who taught him that he had a Heavenly Father who knew where he was at all times. They taught him he had been born with the Light of Christ within him. Truly, Josh had been brought up in light and truth (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.40" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:40</a>) so that when he found himself huddled on a ledge 2,000 feet deep in a mine, he had drawn upon that light to sustain and comfort him, to give him courage and hope. Josh experienced what Abinadi taught when, speaking of Christ, he said: “He is the light and life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 16:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p3" pid="S_-8a2xL5ESbq51tu5dtww" hash="-YGuJw">How fitting that the Savior’s birth in Bethlehem was accompanied by miraculous displays of light in the Western Hemisphere. At the time of his birth, “at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because … there was no darkness in all that night” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.15,19" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 1:15, 19</a>). This celebration of light stood in stark contrast to that which occurred at His Crucifixion, when “there was thick darkness upon all the face of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof … could feel the vapor of darkness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.20-23" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 8:20–23</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p4" pid="KACjs2wqSUSr1S7opc8TNQ" hash="mE3iMg">There are all kinds of darkness in this world: darkness that comes from sin; darkness that comes from discouragement, disappointment, and despair; darkness that comes from loneliness and feelings of inadequacy. Just as the light that burned in Josh Dennis’s heart was stronger than the suffocating darkness that engulfed him, the light of Jesus Christ is stronger than any darkness we face in this life, <span class="emphasis">if</span> we have faith in Him, seek after Him, and obey Him. For as the Prophet Joseph revealed, “If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.67" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:67</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p5" pid="MaconNFwY0SxNj0RrjOP7A" hash="lnmv9w">Christ’s light and the gospel message of light and salvation can be darkened in our own lives only by our disobedience and lack of faith. In like manner the Savior’s light <span class="emphasis">increases</span> in our lives as we keep the commandments and strive continually to be like Him. For “that which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:24</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p6" pid="2ADSbpTZe0SwLungJTahGQ" hash="sAWY7Q">As the light of Jesus Christ and His gospel grows brighter within our countenances and our hearts, it becomes easier for us to discern what is truly valuable from the counterfeits the world offers. Knowledge that Christ loved us enough to willingly bear the weight of our sins removes the need for pride and an unwarranted trust in the arm of flesh. Belief that the Atonement restores to us all we lose to sin and missteps along life’s path creates a hope greater than any temporal pleasure or momentary mortal thrill.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p7" pid="CtitAok-y0qCprkgKW5wtg" hash="pAFN6Q">Consider the experience of King Lamoni. Though he had unfettered power, great earthly treasures, and servants to wait on him hand and foot, he lived in spiritual darkness. When he was willing to permit Ammon to teach him the gospel, a most remarkable thing occurred: Lamoni “fell unto the earth, as if he were dead” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/18.42" class="scriptureRef">Alma 18:42</a>). “Ammon knew that king Lamoni was under the power of God; he knew that the dark veil of unbelief was being cast away from his mind, and the light which did light up his mind, … was the light of the glory of God, … yea, this light had infused such joy into his soul” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/19.6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 19:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p8" pid="KU34YU5eekO5odOAtILp3g" hash="HgSgxw">Only the glory of God and the light of life everlasting produce a joy profound enough to overwhelm one completely and to eliminate “the dark veil of unbelief.”</p>

As a young priest traveling in Italy in 1833, Englishman John Henry Newman encountered emotional and physical darkness when illness detained him there for several weeks. He became deeply discouraged, and a nurse who saw his tears asked what troubled him. All he could reply was that he was sure God had work for him to do in England. Aching to return home, he finally found passage on a small boat.</p>

Trapped for a week in the damp, gray darkness, the ship unable to travel forward or back, Newman pled for his Savior’s help as he penned the words we now know as the hymn “Lead, Kindly Light.”</p>

For as the Savior has promised, “he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.12" class="scriptureRef">John 8:12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p12" pid="2M1aeC8bb0iIHXABixnQYA" hash="3dcpXA">We can all find ourselves in places of darkness from time to time. We may wander into dark, spiritual caverns when we make foolish choices, admit harmful influences into our lives, or turn away from the light of the gospel to embrace the world just a little longer. It may seem harmless at first—just a little exploring, that’s all. Before we know it, we become separated from the light and left in darkness alone. Why do we remain in darkness when such rescuing light awaits us? Let us bask in the warm and illuminating light provided by the gospel of Jesus Christ. Let the Savior’s kindly light lead us one step at a time. Let covenants and commandments keep us safe as we follow the gospel pathway to our heavenly home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p13" pid="eRj10ZLg6UqzSBucpMbaiA" hash="qMs5kw">Remember little Josh Dennis? He is now Elder Dennis serving a mission far away from the dark mine which held him captive. Now Elder Dennis finds his way along the narrow, unfamiliar paths of Honduras sharing a message of hope, salvation, and light. What he teaches every day is the paradox he experienced as a young boy lost in a mine: that amidst encircling gloom, amidst the darkest possible circumstances, it is possible to feel hope, peace, and comfort—all because of the light which is stronger than all darkness, the light of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/lead-kindly-light.p14" pid="vnMlPcNzA0GaFiTcGNUbYQ" hash="yyiyuQ">I know from my own experience, just as surely as Josh knows from his, of the reality of that marvelous being of light—our Savior.

His first words were, “I wish every baby could look this perfect!” I could hardly contain myself. As we got to our car, I could not hold back my feelings any longer and I began to cry. So many feelings just came spilling out. I wept, wishing every expectant mother could hear those words. I cried for every woman who wanted to have a baby but couldn’t. Tears flowed for all the women who want children but have not found a husband. Finally, I shed tears of gratitude with an overwhelming desire that our family will provide a home worthy of this baby.</p>

As He sends babies to this earth, the Lord needs us, whatever our circumstance may be, to stand strong and unwavering and to continue to create homes that are a fortress against a rising tide of evil.

What is now known as the Battle of Waterloo ranks as a great turning point in modern history and brought about drastic changes in political boundaries and the power balance in Europe. At a critical moment in this great battle between the forces of the French emperor, Napoleon, and the allied forces under the command of the British general Arthur Wellesley, better known as the Duke of Wellington, an anxious officer dashed into the office of the duke with the message that unless the troops were immediately withdrawn, they must yield before the larger French army.</p>

But in this fight we have much more powerful weaponry and armor than did the Duke of Wellington’s troops.

This idea is fervently expressed in the fifth chapter of Helaman. “And now, … remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down … because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/stand-firm.p24" pid="tremUP58E068S0Sb_4d6DQ" hash="3HsR5Q">Sisters, the Lord’s promises are sure. He has given His life for our salvation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/stand-firm.p25" pid="-bJc5XiP6EW8uOCJs1innw" hash="OSQyaQ">To maintain a firm stance for ourselves and help others stand firm, the message of the restored gospel must be firmly planted in our hearts and taught in our homes. In your own homes, give your children and loved ones the spiritual armor they will need as they leave you each day and venture away from the safe fortress of your home. Teach your loved ones how to draw upon the powers of heaven through fasting and prayer. Teach them that keeping the Sabbath day holy will insulate them from the world. Teach them to be obedient. Teach them to seek God’s approval, not man’s. Teach them that the only route back to our heavenly home is by loving and following the Savior and by making and keeping sacred covenants and commandments. The truths of the gospel and knowledge of the plan of salvation are weapons your family members can use for victory over Satan’s evil forces.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/stand-firm.p26" pid="RMebLnP3eEercFRT15a9mg" hash="L7OfwQ">In our roles as wives, mothers, grandmothers, sisters, and aunts, we must stand firm as role models. Because we love them, we want to give our family members a strong, righteous pattern to follow. In everything we do and say, in how we dress, in how we spend our time, in all the choices we make, we demonstrate what we believe, and that becomes their pattern to follow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/stand-firm.p27" pid="BXSdzNgq8kmFYeJIIyRDMQ" hash="o04KXA">Lucy Mack Smith, mother of the Prophet Joseph Smith, recorded in her history that in the spring of 1803 she and her husband were much concerned about religion. She writes of her own search for truth, “I retired to a grove not far distant, where I prayed to the Lord … that the true gospel might be presented” (<span class="emphasis">History of Joseph Smith,</span> ed. Preston Nibley [1958], 43). Does that sound familiar?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/stand-firm.p28" pid="onhqmWk740WwTHpzjxKsbA" hash="EIkOCw">Seventeen years later, in the spring of 1820, the Prophet Joseph Smith, in search of truth, “came to the determination to ‘ask of God.’” So “I retired to the woods to make the attempt” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.13-14" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:13–14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/stand-firm.p29" pid="ddrvBf_05kq_BjMRrvfzLw" hash="tpZ8iA">Is it a coincidence that both mother and son chose a grove of trees as the place to ask God to reveal truth to them? Joseph’s prayer blessed the entire world through the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The righteous example set by a woman who stands firm in faith blesses countless others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/stand-firm.p30" pid="v8T7KLRNLUeRx9xzGhGxnQ" hash="R-Smug">As much as I love being a wife and mother, I acknowledge it isn’t always easy. I can appreciate the feelings expressed by a grade-school girl when my friend, her teacher, asked the class to write letters to God. Sharon said, “Dear God, I bet it’s very hard for you to love everyone in the world. There are only five people in my family, and I just can’t do it.” In like manner, I’m certain my family members could tell you it’s not always easy for them to love me. However, I agree with Elder Loren C. Dunn, who said, “There can be nothing more precious or enduring than the family” (“Our Precious Families,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1974, 9). In spite of how difficult family life can be at times, the work we do in our families is of the utmost importance. When you are discouraged and things in your family are not going the way you wanted them to, stand firm with faith and say like another young schoolgirl in her letter to God, “Dear God, I’m doing the very best I can.” Don’t allow the difficulties inherent in family life to unduly discourage you or to impact the love which we can share in families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/stand-firm.p31" pid="KO-JCuZF8UWBMKUizfDYPw" hash="Tj4AQA">Let us arm ourselves with faith and stand firm in our convictions. Let us never forget that we are building a foundation for and with our family upon the rock of our Redeemer. Let us put our hand into God’s hand. With the Lord’s help we can build homes that are a righteous fortress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/stand-firm.p32" pid="JUi7m5xAn0afzB7gD6FQPw" hash="lMHp6Q">May the Lord bless you in your efforts to stand firm in defense of home and family is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
