As they gathered, the father felt a negative spirit: some members of the family did not look very excited to participate. They had family prayer, and as they started to read the scriptures, the father noticed that one of the children did not have her personal set of scriptures with her. He invited her to go to her room and bring her scriptures. She reluctantly did so, and after a period of time that seemed like an eternity, she returned, sat down, and said, “Do we really have to do this now?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p2" pid="h9txQdBxHkmajor9uAG8Yg" hash="tji6uQ">The father thought to himself that the enemy of all righteousness wanted to create problems so that they would not study the scriptures. The father, trying to stay calm, said, “Yes, we have to do this now because this is what the Lord wants us to do.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p3" pid="f19gyC743EKpS70RkGl3tA" hash="cWc1tA">She responded, “I don’t really want to do this now!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p4" pid="L0UsrTackE-TbEEZ8mvYbA" hash="YgUvpA">The father then lost his patience, raised his voice, and said, “This is my home, and we will always read the scriptures in my home!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p5" pid="m11m4Ol-2EOEle5RB457KQ" hash="T8GGig">The tone and volume of his words hurt his daughter, and with her scriptures in hand, she left the family circle, ran to her bedroom, and slammed the door. Thus ended the family scripture study—no harmony and little love being felt at home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p6" pid="UrYzcJtF006befhDZjOd_g" hash="NyKWgA">The father knew that he had done wrong, so he went to his own bedroom and knelt down to pray. He pleaded with the Lord for help, knowing that he had offended one of His children, a daughter whom he truly loved. He implored the Lord to restore the spirit of love and harmony at home and enable them to be able to continue studying the scriptures as a family. As he was praying, an idea came to his mind: “Go and say, ‘I’m sorry.’” He continued to pray earnestly, asking for the Spirit of the Lord to come back into his home. Once again the idea came: “Go and say, ‘I’m sorry.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p7" pid="mkGOR7u5bEaAE_h-3YlkSA" hash="biiwQg">He really wanted to be a good father and do the right thing, so he stood up and went to his daughter’s bedroom. He gently knocked on the door several times, and there was no answer. So he slowly opened the door and found his girl sobbing and crying on her bed. He kneeled next to her and said with a soft and tender voice, “I’m sorry. I apologize for what I did.” He repeated, “I’m sorry, I love you, and I don’t want to hurt you.” And then from the mouth of a child came the lesson that the Lord wanted to teach him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p8" pid="cmBxkFOuCkmM1bU1dzcnUA" hash="Xnr_zg">She stopped crying, and after a brief silence, she took her scriptures into her hands and started to look up some verses. The father watched as those pure and delicate hands turned the pages of the scriptures, page after page. She came to the verses she sought and started to read very slowly with a soft voice: “For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p9" pid="iYPNL5cWDEmzadfh4WXigw" hash="-mDSIw">While he was still kneeling next to her bed, humility overcame him as he thought to himself, “That scripture was written for me. She has taught me a great lesson.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/he-teaches-us-to-put-off-the-natural-man.p10" pid="uOxFdioqK0yXeak2SPHgEg" hash="X2gwKw">Then she turned her eyes to him and said, “I am sorry. I am sorry, Daddy.”</p>

He opened his arms and embraced her. Love and harmony had been restored in this sweet moment of reconciliation born of the word of God and the Holy Ghost. That scripture, which his daughter remembered from her own personal scripture study, had touched his heart with the fire of the Holy Ghost.</p>

The natural man is inclined to “cover [his] sins, or to gratify [his] pride, [his] vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, [and when he acts] in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Yes, just as the father embraced his daughter in the arms of his love, so too does the Savior extend His arms to embrace us during our times of true repentance.</p>

I bear witness of the reality and power of the Savior’s Atonement to cleanse, purify, and make us and our homes holy as we strive to put off the natural man and follow Him.</p>

My companion and I received approval to take all the missionaries in the Cusco zone to the magnificent Machu Picchu ruins.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/the-lord-jesus-christ-teaches-us-to-pray.p6" pid="AuxjUX5ECEWV_mtaGsYY-g" hash="osdu-w">Towards the end of our visit to the ruins, some of the missionaries wanted to go to the Inca Bridge, part of a mountain trail. Immediately, I felt in my heart the Spirit constraining me not to go there. The trail was on the side of a mountain with a 2,000-foot (610 m) drop-off. In several areas the trail was only wide enough for one person to pass at a time. My companion and I told them that we should not go to the Inca Bridge.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/the-lord-jesus-christ-teaches-us-to-pray.p7" pid="yG-HxPTrk0y-r4b68GDW1A" hash="BkDalg">However, the missionaries insisted that we go. The pleadings became more intense, and despite what the Spirit had indicated to me, I gave in to the peer pressure and told them that we would visit the bridge but only if we were very careful.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/the-lord-jesus-christ-teaches-us-to-pray.p8" pid="BrhDKeJV6EKmpSBEJJ5c5A" hash="x4T7Rw">We entered the trail that leads to the Inca Bridge with me at the end of the group, and at first everyone walked slowly, as agreed. Then the missionaries started to walk very fast and even run. They ignored my petitions to slow down. I felt obligated to catch up to them, to tell them that we had to turn back. I was far behind them, and I had to run fast to catch up with them.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/the-lord-jesus-christ-teaches-us-to-pray.p9" pid="cD7q2m9GwU-Multt5IGcBQ" hash="YmgYbg">As I came around a turn, in a passage too narrow for two to walk, I found a missionary standing still with his back against the rocks. I asked him why he was standing there. He told me he had received an impression to remain in that spot for a moment and that I should go on.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/the-lord-jesus-christ-teaches-us-to-pray.p10" pid="1Oxwqn8wYEOZ2r0fY6TphQ" hash="WNb_bA">I felt the urgency to catch up to those ahead of us, so he helped me to pass him, and I was able to get a little farther down the trail. I noticed that the ground was full of greenery. I planted my right foot on the ground, realizing, as I fell, that there was no ground underneath the greenery. I desperately grabbed onto some branches that were underneath the trail. For a moment I could see down, some 2,000 feet below me, the Urubamba River, which crosses the Sacred Valley of the Incas. I felt as if my strength had left me, and it was only a matter of time before I could not hold on anymore. In that moment, I prayed intensely. It was a very brief prayer. I opened my mouth and said, “Father, help me!”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/the-lord-jesus-christ-teaches-us-to-pray.p11" pid="M0fN6pp0rEKDjK-rwrDjFg" hash="lfL2mw">The branches were not strong enough to support the weight of my body. I knew the end was near. In the <span class="emphasis">very</span> moment when I was about to fall, I felt a firm hand take me by the arm and pull me up. With that help I was able to continue fighting and get myself back on the trail. The missionary who had stayed behind was the one who saved me.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/the-lord-jesus-christ-teaches-us-to-pray.p12" pid="rsKFbUEqz0-i51NSITReUg" hash="tuIlOQ">But in reality our Father in Heaven saved me. He listened to my voice. I had heard the voice of the Spirit three times before, telling me not to go to the Inca Bridge, but I had not obeyed that voice. I was in shock, I was pale, and I did not know what to say. Then I remembered that the other missionaries were ahead of us, and so we went looking for them until we found them and told them what had happened to me.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/the-lord-jesus-christ-teaches-us-to-pray.p13" pid="-nJZvN67uE2m61GzeLDr4A" hash="5CxWEg">We returned to Machu Picchu very carefully and in silence. On the return trip I remained silent, and the idea came to my mind that He had paid attention to my voice but that I had not paid any attention to His. There was a deep pain in my heart for disobeying His voice and at the same time a deep sense of gratitude for His mercy. He did not exercise His justice upon me, but in His great mercy, He had saved my life (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.20" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:20</a>).</p>

I prayed “with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 10:4</a>).</p>

I pondered my life to that point. I found that on many occasions, our Father in Heaven had been so merciful to me. He taught me many lessons that day in Machu Picchu and in Cusco, Peru. One of the greatest lessons was that I should always, always pray “with a sincere heart, with real intent, [exercising] faith in Christ.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/the-lord-jesus-christ-teaches-us-to-pray.p16" pid="r0Fm11p1zEmnZWq5-xeVCA" hash="154lsg">On one occasion the Lord Jesus Christ “was praying in a certain place,” and “when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/11.1" class="scriptureRef">Luke 11:1</a>). Then He taught His disciples to pray. And today He teaches you and me to pray as we see Him in our minds praying in Gethsemane and saying, “Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.42" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:42</a>). When you pray, do you really, truly want that “not my will, but thine, be done”?</p>

When you pray, are you really praying or just saying prayers? Are you superficial with your prayers?</p>

And so His eyes and His ears are now connected to you. He reads our minds, and He feels our hearts. You cannot hide anything from Him. Now, the wonderful thing is that He will see you with eyes of love and mercy—love and mercy that we cannot fully understand. But love and mercy are with Him the very moment you say, “Father in Heaven.”</p>

He is not one to say, “No, I will not listen to you now because you only come to me when you are in trouble.” Only men do that. He is not one to say, “Oh, you cannot imagine how busy I am now.” Only men say that.</p>
