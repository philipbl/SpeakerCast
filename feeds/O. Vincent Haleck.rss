      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p5" pid="D1Wi6HhaBEum4UI0jbigtA" hash="2in1tQ">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="101"></span>Like all good parents, my own parents desired a bright future for their children. My father was not a member, and because of unusual circumstances that existed at that time, my parents determined that my brothers and sisters and I should leave our island home of American Samoa, in the South Pacific, and travel to the United States in order to go to school.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p6" pid="jdOz1EiAvk6HIfVEEtKWKw" hash="_U5ugg">The decision to be separated from us was a difficult one for my parents, especially my mother. They knew that there would be unknown challenges as we were put into new surroundings. However, with faith and determination, they pressed forward with their plan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p7" pid="MulBqZ_2s0aMGeO75q0puQ" hash="eIgPLw">Because of her Latter-day Saint upbringing, my mother was familiar with the principles of fasting and prayer, and both of my parents felt that they needed the blessings of heaven to help their children. In that spirit they began to set aside a day every week to fast and pray for us. Their vision was to prepare their children for a bright future. They acted on this vision as they exercised their faith by seeking the Lord’s blessings. Through fasting and prayer, they received the assurance, comfort, and peace that all would be well.</p>
    </span>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p8" pid="MEy6HSrNjk6Q08ngIZ-c9w" hash="tWYdjA">How do we, amidst the challenges of our lives, gain the vision necessary to do those things that will bring us closer to the Savior? Speaking of vision, the book of Proverbs teaches this truth: “Where there is no vision, the people perish” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/29.18" class="scriptureRef">Proverbs 29:18</a>). If we are to prosper rather than perish, we must gain a vision of ourselves as the Savior sees us.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p9" pid="QFjCBlCNUESR9Rpu-21pdw" hash="TNjI_w">The Savior saw more in those humble fishermen whom He called to follow Him than they initially saw in themselves; He saw a vision of who they could become. He knew of their goodness and potential, and He acted to call them. They were not experienced at first, but as they followed, they saw His example, felt His teachings, and became His disciples. There was a time when some of His disciples departed from Him because the things that they heard were hard for them. Aware that others might also depart, Jesus inquired of the Twelve, “Will ye also go away?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.67" class="scriptureRef">John 6:67</a>). Peter’s response reflects how he had changed and had caught the vision of who the Savior was. “To whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.68" class="scriptureRef">John 6:68</a>), he responded.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p10" pid="xHagcA16k0ih0lQWmOVVww" hash="MF_gpA">With that vision these faithful and devoted disciples were able to do hard things as they traveled to preach the gospel and establish the Church after the Savior had departed. Eventually, some of them made the ultimate sacrifice for their testimonies.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p11" pid="2tPkZH05CU2gtdzNDK9fFA" hash="OaJSzQ">There are other examples in the scriptures of those who caught the vision of the gospel and then went out to act upon that vision. The prophet Alma gained his vision when he heard Abinadi boldly teaching and testifying before King Noah. Alma acted on Abinadi’s teachings and went about teaching the things he had learned, baptizing many who believed on his words (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17.1-4" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 17:1–4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.1-16" class="scriptureRef">18:1–16</a>). While persecuting the early Saints, the Apostle Paul was converted on the road to Damascus and then acted by teaching and testifying of Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/9.1-6,20-22,29" class="scriptureRef">Acts 9:1–6, 20–22, 29</a>).</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p12" pid="kWGfp7vNQ0SnEDMQ_Nt3wg" hash="miiHrA">In our own day many young men, women, and senior couples have answered the call of a prophet of God to serve missions. With faith and courage they leave their homes and everything that is familiar to them because of their faith in the great good they can do as missionaries. As they act on their vision to serve, they bless the lives of many and, in the process, change their own lives. In the last general conference, President Thomas S. Monson thanked us for the service we give to one another and reminded us of our responsibility to be God’s hands in blessing His children here on earth (see “Until We Meet Again,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2011, 108). The fulfillment of this charge has been heartwarming as members of the Church have acted upon his vision.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p13" pid="JiL7RNyFXEC4CgcNXhXD0Q" hash="h2kc2g">Before the Savior departed, understanding that we would need help, He <span class="pageBreak" page-number="102"></span>said, “I will not leave you comfortless” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.18" class="scriptureRef">John 14:18</a>). He taught His disciples, “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>). This is the same Holy Ghost who can empower and motivate us to do the things that the Savior and our modern-day prophets and apostles teach.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p14" pid="HQ9bmYicDEqS_cBv_SY1_w" hash="ITpXdQ">As we put into action the teachings of our leaders, we gain a deeper understanding of our Savior’s vision for us. Throughout this conference we have received inspired counsel from prophets and apostles. Study their teachings and ponder them in your hearts while seeking the Spirit of the Holy Ghost to help you catch a vision of these teachings in your life. With that vision, exercise your faith in acting upon their counsel.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p15" pid="YtbMLHvvWkeppcv-whyTOw" hash="Dms31Q">Search and study the scriptures with a mind to receiving further light and knowledge of their message to you. Ponder them in your heart and allow them to inspire you. Then act on your inspiration.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p16" pid="ExRCGnXilkOPkxu5lymwoQ" hash="6Lx1cA">As we learned as a family, we act when we fast and pray. Alma spoke of fasting and praying as a way of receiving a surety when he said, “I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.46" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:46</a>). We too come to know how to handle the challenges of our lives through fasting and prayer.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p17" pid="N-QibZdkmkafAYB3szyq2g" hash="d2ARkA">We experience hard things in our lives that can sometimes diminish our vision and faith to do the things we should. We become so busy that we often feel overwhelmed and unable to do any more. While each of us is different, I humbly submit that we must focus our vision on the Savior and His teachings. What did He see in Peter, James, and John and the other Apostles that prompted Him to act to invite them to follow Him? Like His vision of them, the Savior has a great vision of who we can become. It will take the same faith and courage the first Apostles had in order for us to refocus on the things that matter most in bringing lasting happiness and great joy.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p18" pid="CNjaemXT6UGy9jeiFmqN3w" hash="9qdsmQ">When we study the life of our Savior and His teachings, we see Him amongst the people teaching, praying, lifting, and healing. When we emulate Him and do the things we see Him do, we begin to see a vision of who we can become. You will be blessed with insight through the help of the Holy Ghost to do more good. Changes will begin to come, and you will bring a different order to your life that will bless you and your family. During His ministry among the Nephites, the Savior asked, “What manner of men ought ye to be?” He replied, “Even as I am” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 27:27</a>). We need His help to become like Him, and He has shown us the way: “Therefore, ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it <span class="pageBreak" page-number="103"></span>shall be opened unto you; for he that asketh, receiveth; and unto him that knocketh, it shall be opened” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.29" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 27:29</a>).</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p19" pid="pHymX5pG5EaVm6-3DpleBw" hash="eID9yQ">I know that as we gain a vision of ourselves as the Savior sees us and as we act on that vision, our lives will be blessed in unexpected ways. Because of the vision of my parents, not only was my life blessed by educational experiences, but I was placed in circumstances where I found and embraced the gospel. More important, I learned the significance of good and faithful parents. Simply put, my life was changed forever.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p20" pid="5EJVOE5y5UquuHDwEx_ZbQ" hash="56KqHw">Just as vision led my parents to fast and pray for their children’s welfare and as the early Apostles’ vision led them to follow the Savior, that same vision is available to inspire and help us to act. Brothers and sisters, we are a people with a history of vision and the faith and courage to do. Look at where we have come and the blessings we have received! Believe that He can bless you with vision in your life and the courage to act.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p21" pid="5iSKgBIawUCH6DHg8ZZZ7Q" hash="hX_ogw">I bear you my witness of the Savior and His desire for us to return to Him. To do that, we must have the faith to do—to follow Him and become like Him. Throughout various times of our lives, He holds out His hand and invites us:</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p22" pid="Q3j2OCwIB02XbH_D0KCg0Q" hash="NJrEVg">“Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p23" pid="4N6LchTM-Ei7IjzZyEL3iQ" hash="6SozAw">“For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.29-30" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 11:29–30</a>).</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/having-the-vision-to-do.p24" pid="4wyiHHB84kWNO6SvpYf1Cw" hash="IraMiQ">Just as the Savior saw great potential in His early disciples, He also sees the same in us. Let us see ourselves as the Savior sees us. I pray that we will have that vision with the faith and courage to do, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p5" pid="t2Ps9oct90uF_-Zfs5BZwA" hash="oNu7hg">I have had the great blessing of serving among the Saints of the Pacific for most of my adult life. The faith, love, and amazing sacrifices of these devoted Saints fill me with inspiration, gratitude, and joy. Their stories are like your own.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p6" pid="E3GJboIYT0eGYT2j-ZQfLw" hash="Yirokw">It has occurred to me that these Saints have much in common with the widow whom the Savior observed while He “sat … and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p7" pid="yylXNWHp70iJXuCuX8YCYg" hash="kTPWnA">“And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites. …</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p8" pid="qtWGl_tEWESP97h2dS6ppA" hash="4lFl4Q">“And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p9" pid="pUjGjQfVrEegXZ2Dz4ROkA" hash="QZ5wSQ">“For … they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p10" pid="l-yXKqoGbkecwHfNHo158g" hash="2LM-hg">Even though her two mites were a meager contribution, to the Savior her gift was of supreme value, because she gave everything. In that moment, the Savior fully knew the widow, for her gift showed Him her heart. The quality and depth of her love and faith were such that she gave knowing that her “want” would be supplied.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p11" pid="Deu8ejc67kmyxc5j_sIdWw" hash="JSw0eQ">I have seen that same heart in the Saints of the Pacific. In a small village on one of these islands, an older man and his wife accepted the invitation of the missionaries to sincerely ask the Lord if the lessons they were being taught were true. In this process, they also considered the consequences of the commitments that they would need to make if the answer that they received led to their accepting the restored gospel. They fasted and prayed to know the truthfulness of the Church and the veracity of the Book of Mormon. The answer to their prayers came in the form of a sweet but ringing affirmation: “Yes! It is true!”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p12" pid="8O0hCUb2cEuRhcVkEbyOUw" hash="_DSI2Q">Having received this witness, they chose to be baptized. This was not a choice without personal cost. Their decision and baptism carried with them a high price. They lost employment, they sacrificed social standing, important friendships dissolved, and the support, love, and respect of family were withdrawn. They now walked to church each Sunday, exchanging awkward glances with friends and neighbors who were walking in the opposite direction.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p13" pid="JM1z1axNh0Kc_AsqH7Lzmw" hash="7HgrVw">In these difficult circumstances, this good brother was asked how he felt about their decision to join the Church. His simple and unwavering reply was “It is true, isn’t it? Our choice was clear.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p14" pid="eaONmXo8uEGiSTJSvyPOYw" hash="emT6CA">These two newly converted Saints truly had the heart of the widow. They, like the widow, “cast in all” that they could give, knowingly giving of their “want.” As a product of their believing hearts and enduring faith during those hard times, their burdens were lightened. They were aided and surrounded by supportive and ministering Church members, and they were personally strengthened by their service in Church callings.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p15" pid="1HfzBbRUpkCePuaW1JN0Lg" hash="yDuG1Q">After they cast in their “all,” the greatest day came when they were sealed in the temple as an eternal family. Like He did the converts under Alma’s leadership, “the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Such is the heart of the widow exemplified in this wonderful couple.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p16" pid="DbIc_Rj9G0ub6todPqxE0g" hash="R_Sx7g">Let me speak of another experience where the heart of the widow was in full view. In Samoa, we labor with village councils to gain access for missionaries to preach the gospel. A few years ago, I had a conversation with a chief from a village where the missionaries had been prohibited for many, many years. My conversation occurred not too long after the paramount chief had opened the village to the Church, permitting our missionaries to teach those interested in learning about the gospel and its doctrines.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p17" pid="eyRGQnOq90SiLeGDXdSPOw" hash="CUOD9Q">After so many years, to have this miraculous turn of events, I was curious to learn about what had happened to cause the paramount chief to take this action. I asked about this, and the chief with whom I was conversing replied, “A man can live in the dark for a period, but there will come a time when he will long to come into the light.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p18" pid="uBlWTo4A90uNdIY9dAtcMw" hash="Fi2FLA">The paramount chief, in opening the village, demonstrated the heart of the widow—a heart that softens when the warmth and light of the truth is revealed. This leader was willing to relinquish years of tradition, confront much opposition, and stand firm so that others might be blessed. This was a leader whose heart was focused on the welfare and happiness of his people rather than on considerations of tradition, culture, and personal power. He gave away those concerns in favor of what President Thomas S. Monson has taught us: “As we follow the example of the Savior, ours will be the opportunity to be a light in the lives of others.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p19" pid="KAgQEwU2xE6zBq-dV0wKYw" hash="pTWQOQ">Finally, let me share with you one more experience among the Saints of the Pacific that remains deeply and spiritually rooted in my soul. Some years ago I was a young counselor to a bishop in a new ward in American Samoa. We had 99 members, consisting of subsistence farmers, cannery workers, government employees, and their families. When the First Presidency announced in 1977 that a temple was going to be constructed in Samoa, there was joy and thanksgiving expressed by all of us. Going to the temple from American Samoa at that time required traveling either to Hawaii or New Zealand. This was a costly journey that was beyond the reach of many faithful Church members.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p20" pid="qd1yV-vxq0yuzqb-KiJ0Xw" hash="3jc6BQ">During this period of time members were encouraged to donate to a building fund to assist in the construction of temples. In this spirit, our bishopric asked the ward members to prayerfully consider what they could give. A date was set for families to gather to offer their donations. Later, as these donations were opened in private, our bishopric was humbled and touched by the faith and generosity of our wonderful ward members.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p21" pid="-bLVMe0-UkCU0hEOQIz-Dg" hash="yaYaxw">Knowing each family and their circumstances, I felt a deep and abiding sense of awe, respect, and humility. These were, in every way, modern-day widow’s mites given freely from their “want,” with a joy in the promised blessing of the construction of a holy temple of the Lord in Samoa. These families had consecrated all that they could to the Lord, with the faith that they would not be left wanting. Their gift manifested their widow’s hearts. All who gave did so willingly and joyfully because the widow’s heart within them could see with the eye of faith the great crowning blessings in store for their families and for all of the people of Samoa and American Samoa for generations to come. I know that their consecrated offerings, their widow’s mites, were known and accepted by the Lord.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p22" pid="fjELg7dP6kuCiOPem49few" hash="KVV2Nw">The heart of the widow who gave her two mites is a heart that will give all by making sacrifices; by enduring hardship, persecution, and rejection; and by bearing burdens of many kinds. The heart of the widow is a heart that senses, feels, and knows the light of truth and will give anything to embrace that truth. It also helps others to see that same light and come to the same measure of eternal happiness and joy. Finally, the heart of the widow is defined by a willingness to give all for building up the kingdom of God on the earth.</p>

My prayer for each of us is a plea to have the heart to bear our burdens, make necessary sacrifices, and have the will to do and to give. I promise that the Lord will not leave you wanting. The heart of the widow is filled with thanksgiving that the Savior was “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> so that we would not need to taste the “bitter cup.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> In spite of our weaknesses and failings, and because of them, He continues to offer His hands, which were pierced for our sakes. He will lift us up if we are willing to come into the light of His gospel, embrace Him, and allow Him to fill our “want.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/10/the-heart-of-the-widow.p24" pid="znTvTrNn3UCGfnethZzOZg" hash="U4WfMA">I bear my testimony of the great love that we can share as disciples and followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. I love and sustain President Thomas S. Monson as the prophet of God on the earth. The Book of Mormon is another witness of Jesus Christ to the world, and I invite all to read it and discover its message for you. All who accept the Lord’s invitation to come unto Him will find peace, love, and light. Jesus Christ is our great Exemplar and Redeemer. It is only through Jesus Christ, and the miracle of His infinite Atonement, that we can receive eternal life. Of this I bear witness in His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
