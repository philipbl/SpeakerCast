Last night, that long awaited goal became a reality. Brothers and sisters, little did we know that on that day my name would be presented as a member of the Council of the Twelve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/call-to-the-holy-apostleship.p2" pid="2gbQDMh29ESBp1-d6DN91w" hash="g2rxhA">Since we didn’t know, our children didn’t know either. Our married daughters telephoned us between sessions. One who was expecting a baby, said, “Daddy, I was so shocked by that announcement—I think I am going into labor.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/call-to-the-holy-apostleship.p3" pid="aNOkjHmAiUaIwQjAzu6JDQ" hash="QsJWAA">That she did.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/call-to-the-holy-apostleship.p5" pid="LnbKhsoVmk-KnKC5td-PzA" hash="RvNg1A">A wide array of feelings has flashed through my heart since I heard the call that will change my life. The first feeling is that of personal inadequacy. That feeling is intensified as I think of the incomparable power of Elders LeGrand Richards and Mark E. Petersen, whose absence we keenly sense. They were, to me, dear friends as well as esteemed leaders. Then, as I look about and see the strength of those more qualified and able than I, I truly am humbled by this calling.</p>

I have implicit faith in the Lord and in His prophets. I have learned not to put question marks but to use exclamation points when calls are issued through inspired channels of priesthood government.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/call-to-the-holy-apostleship.p7" pid="RjeaOuYgiUCtDuhLsI_ptA" hash="BYWYXg">About twenty years ago, two members of the Quorum of the Twelve were assigned to select a new president of the Bonneville stake in which we lived. They were Elders Spencer W. Kimball and LeGrand Richards. That call they extended to me. Now, I am to be ordained an Apostle under the hand of President Spencer W. Kimball, to fill a chair vacated by the passing of Elder LeGrand Richards.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/call-to-the-holy-apostleship.p8" pid="ItGfcMcb4kepxecOHd-juw" hash="NvsmnQ">Feelings of commitment well up from the depths of my soul. My sweetheart, Dantzel, and I first made those covenants in the temple of the Lord over thirty-eight years ago, to consecrate our lives to the service of the Lord. Today, I reaffirm that promise, to give all I have to the building of the kingdom of God on the earth. In accepting this call, knowing that challenges, charges, and keys will be conferred and that buffetings will likewise come, I commit my effort, my energy, and my all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/call-to-the-holy-apostleship.p9" pid="x3pjlklT9kGAkDbpH2g73w" hash="a4Ueug">Feelings of gratitude emerge as I acknowledge the goodness of my parents, and of all eight of my pioneer great-grandparents who were converted to the Church in the populous nations of Europe. All eight of them ultimately immigrated to the little town of Ephraim, Utah. I know they are watching the events of this day from their celestial windows.</p>

She is the fountain from whom flows the nourishing love in our home. Her sacrifices to bring our ten wonderful children into this world, teaching and training them, while always supporting me without a murmur through my responsibilities in the Church and in my profession, are monumental. We love our eight sons-in-law as our own, and are so grateful for an unbroken string of temple marriages that link them to us forever. For those precious grandchildren already here and for the others on the way, we express our gratitude.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/call-to-the-holy-apostleship.p11" pid="SkTf2Z6z8EKuwJ5VyZLTAA" hash="-uMmqw">While nominally I come to you from the science of surgery and its mother of medicine, in a truer sense, I have been forged from the stern discipline of law—not the laws of men, as mastered by our brethren of the legal profession, but the eternal and unchanging laws of our Divine Creator. The surgeon soon learns the incontrovertibility of divine law. He knows that hopes and wishes are sometimes simply powerless sham. Desired blessings come only by obedience to divine law, and in no other way. My lifetime thus far has been focused on learning those laws. Only as the laws are known, and then obeyed, can the blessings we desire be earned. To this extent, there will be little difference for me in the activities of the past and those of the future. The endless laws of the Lord are the doctrines taught by His Apostles.</p>

Their selfless service satisfies the two great commandments, to love God and neighbor. They have learned that one loves best who serves best.</p>

Kimball. For their confidence in me, I am deeply appreciative. To them and all mankind they serve, I express my love.</p>

I know that salvation is centered in Him! Said the angel to King Benjamin: “Salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.18" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:18</a>.)</p>

Without that atoning sacrifice, there would be neither immortality nor eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/call-to-the-holy-apostleship.p17" pid="IF-hHbHucESMjJ9YV4ub0w" hash="WYN4og">His message <span class="emphasis">is</span> the restored gospel of Jesus Christ; and it is administered by the Church that bears His name. He directs the affairs of His church by the power of the priesthood and by revelation through prophets who proclaim His doctrine to all people of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/call-to-the-holy-apostleship.p18" pid="R_pWZFYgLk-BVXjVPqeGxQ" hash="-UawPA">The testimony that I bear is but an echo of the resounding testimonies of the eighty-four who previously have received this call to the Twelve since the spring of 1820. I know that God the Father and the Son appeared to usher in this last great dispensation of eternal truth. I testify that we are of the house of Israel, specifically of the lineage of Joseph, bearing the birthright and charged with the irrevocable responsibility to prepare the world for the second coming of the Savior. Then, numberless multitudes among every nation, kindred, tongue, and people will eventually join in proclaiming that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. So I solemnly testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I was at work with my electric clippers and long extension cord. I had done this often, each time reminding myself of the need to use these clippers with great care in order to avoid cutting things that I shouldn’t.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p" pid="Rf5FXf7LZ0CB_WNppXgvJw" hash="fZ6-qg">Suddenly the blades became jammed. Caught between them was the power cord itself. Because I had not seen it in the thicket I was trimming, I had cut into the very line that was providing the power to work.</p>

We would then lose that which enables us to generate success in our lives. Proper use of our spiritual power line allows us to learn, to labor, to be obedient to law, and to love. While these capabilities lead to fulfillment, at the same time they also carry risk.</p>

A sharp mind, misdirected, can cut into that line of spiritual power. Some “learned” souls delight in leading others astray, all in the so-called name of learning. Years later their victims may realize that they have climbed their ladder of learning, only to find it leaning against the wrong wall. A prophet of the Lord has counseled us on this point:</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p" pid="66P-BP_bokmWb3RkPaO_Hg" hash="agpqjw">“O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</p>

Labor well spent increases our capacity to do. President Heber J. Grant often said, “‘That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that our power to do is increased.’” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1901, p. 63.)</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p" pid="1Yo0GNWJaUiApq-dPlTBbQ" hash="UBX0MA">The Lord, through his prophet Lehi, said, “It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:11</a>.) So, in reality, competition forces us to improve. It deserves our praise and our gratitude. Without it we could not reach the heights that are otherwise ours to achieve.</p>

One can be anxiously engaged in a meaningless cause. Or one can do something wrong a hundred times and call it experience! Some would avoid labor while pursuing the goals of wealth without working for it, or an honored position without preparing for it. The converted Lamanites taught this lesson: “Rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 24:18</a>.)</p>

One of the great applications of spiritual power is obeying the laws of both God and man. Freedom to act and mastery of our actions both emanate from law. “When we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:21</a>.)</p>

I remember a mother I met once as I made a professional house call. This woman was confined in an iron lung. The ravages of polio had effectively destroyed all the breathing muscles so that her life was completely dependent upon this large metal tank and the electrical motor that powered its noisy bellows.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p" pid="tkAlGb7tfkiItgDUeUAmKg" hash="ETcr_Q">While there, I watched her three children as they related to their mother. The oldest interrupted our work to ask permission to go to a friend’s house for an hour. Later the second child asked her mother for help with arithmetic. Finally the youngest child, so small that she couldn’t see her mother’s face directly, looked up at her image in a mirror that had been placed over the mother’s head and asked, “Mommy, may I have a cookie?” I’ve never forgotten that lesson on the power of love. This woman, virtually disabled and certainly incapable of any degree of physical enforcement of parental authority, sweetly influenced that home solely with the power to love!</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p" pid="2cNVG6ATrUKDvacFd2djjA" hash="sUQVjg">The power of love between a man and a woman is special. The love shared with my beloved companion, Dantzel, has increased the power of love for both of us. That love brought us to the altar in the temple of the Lord. Her love for me motivated her to teach school during the early years of our marriage. When things were tight, she held a second job at night. Once when things were exceptionally tight, she even sold her blood in between her two jobs to keep us solvent. (Her dear parents may have wondered what kind of a son-in-law they had on that occasion!) I thought of that many years later when she needed a transfusion urgently and her blood couldn’t be matched readily with donor blood from the blood bank. What a privilege it was for me to donate mine directly to her.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/protect-the-spiritual-power-line.p" pid="EfQyt3wYzkSYMiILlJ5gcg" hash="aSUFHA">Can the power to love be misused? Sadly, yes. The illegitimate union of the sexes has, in my observation, been one of the greatest causes of grief. In some instances, the improper use of this sacred physical endowment has even destroyed its use in later years.</p>

The abuse of the power to love can result in no love at all. Only its cheap facsimiles of lewdness and lust remain in the wake of pleasure without conscience. Instead of feasting at the banquet table of bounteous love with his own posterity, one is left with scraps from the table—only the refuse from what might have been.</p>

Yet the embers of evil still burn. But as loud voices argue on, let us remember that those who advocate abortion have already been born! Those who freely deny God with their amoral and agnostic practices will one day find that He may just as freely deny them!

Data from all nations are appalling. For the United States of America, one hundred thousand were killed in World War I; over four hundred thousand died in World War II. In the first two hundred years as a nation, the lives of over one million Americans were lost due to war.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p5" pid="Vpsv7qZ1GE2l2dF4-l4grA" hash="CirPYQ">Regrettable as is the loss of loved ones from war, these figures are dwarfed by the toll of a new war that <span class="emphasis">annually</span> claims more casualties than the total number of fatalities from all the wars of this nation.</p>

We weep for those who die, pray and work for those whose lives are in jeopardy. For years I have labored with other doctors here and abroad, struggling to prolong life. It is impossible to describe the grief a physician feels when the life of a patient is lost. Can anyone imagine how we feel when life is destroyed at its roots, as though it were a thing of naught?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p9" pid="6MPjLXt1J0mJ9ptxkBCiGQ" hash="lNytXw">What sense of inconsistency can allow people to grieve for their dead, yet be calloused to this baleful war being waged on life at the time of its silent development? What logic would encourage efforts to preserve the life of a critically ill twelve-week-old infant, but countenance the termination of another life twelve weeks after inception? More attention is seemingly focused on the fate of a life at some penitentiary’s death row than on the millions totally deprived of life’s opportunity through such odious carnage before birth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p10" pid="n5UxyFf4lEeLnSDWhzTOFg" hash="9LeFDQ">The Lord has repeatedly declared this divine imperative: “Thou shalt not kill.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Recently he added, “Nor do anything like unto it.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:6</a>.) Even before the fulness of the gospel was restored, the enlightened understood the sanctity of life. John Calvin, the sixteenth-century reformer, wrote: “If it seems more horrible to kill a man in his own house than in a field, because a man’s house is his place of most secure refuge, it ought surely to be deemed more atrocious to destroy a <span class="emphasis">fetus </span>in the womb before it has come to light.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p12" pid="iUH0Iuv4mk-H6hwM-OK7rw" hash="73fAag">These slogans begin with proper concern for the health of the mother. Infrequently, instances may occur in which the continuation of pregnancy could be life-threatening to the mother. When deemed by competent medical authorities that the life of one must be terminated in order to save the life of the other, many agree that it is better to spare the mother. But these circumstances are rare, particularly where modern medical care is available.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p13" pid="sa8bE0HchEu41MT3m3tgrA" hash="KfhuLw">Another sympathetic concern applies to pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. The tragedy of this despoilment is compounded because, in such relationships, freedom of choice is denied the woman who is innocently involved.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p14" pid="JXv7WcluNkaPMa6QLU8SDA" hash="AWOOWA">But less than 3 percent of all abortions are performed for these two reasons.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> The other 97 percent are performed for what may be termed “reasons of convenience.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p15" pid="1uuJw5V7tk-pd5YWxNzYDw" hash="T0mwPA">Some argue for abortion because a malformed child may result. The harmful effects of certain infectious or toxic agents in the first trimester of pregnancy are real.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p16" pid="Yt0bVuwJ7E2VRnUA_YPgaA" hash="W1CQDA">The experience of a couple whom I shall identify as Brother and Sister Brown (fictitious names) is instructive. Sister Brown was only twenty-one years old at the time, a beautiful woman and a devoted wife. In her first trimester, she contracted the dreaded German measles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p17" pid="S8pzl7rMmkmwoMWSnlhSaQ" hash="ZRBTUQ">Abortion was advised because the developing baby would almost surely be damaged. Some members of her family, out of loving concern, applied additional pressure for an abortion. “Don’t burden yourself financially with a handicapped child,” they argued. “You are too young and too poor.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p18" pid="xaz6C9nwbkOAgm7zifKIVA" hash="rnbI6A">Devotedly Brother and Sister Brown consulted their bishop. He referred them to their stake president, who listened to their serious concern and counseled them not to terminate the life of this baby, even though the child might have a problem. He quoted this scripture:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p19" pid="DS4pPmRwn06EkDNocRZqVg" hash="-tiJag">“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 3:5–6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p20" pid="V4P33LA6QU2tMScekola0A" hash="_7ZzyQ">They chose to follow that counsel and permit their child to be born—a beautiful little girl, normal in every respect, except for a hearing loss, that became evident later. After an evaluation at a school for the deaf, Brother and Sister Brown were advised that this child had the intellect of a genius. Now, some twenty years later, she attends a major university on a scholarship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p21" pid="IuIKvUWHdUGJJezkjB0TrA" hash="XkEsvg">When recently asked how they felt about their once-weighty decision, the mother quickly responded, “She is one of the great joys of my life! She is such a choice spirit! Though she lost the sense of hearing, she has compensated with augmented ability otherwise. Her eyes are alive with constant attention. She excels in dancing, even though she perceives the sounds of music from vibrations. She has served as an officer in school. But most significant is her guileless spirit, her unconditional love. She has taught us to serve and to share. Her spiritual insights have helped us to know God and his purposes. My husband and I are so grateful that she is one of our children.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p22" pid="qASyKumbbkS4E_ctMJCGxQ" hash="laneFQ">Consider another individual weighing the consequences of her pregnancy. She was beyond the normal age for bearing children. She announced to her doctor that her husband was an alcoholic with a syphilitic infection. One of her children had been born dead. Another child was blind. Another had tuberculosis. Her family had a history of deafness. Finally she confessed that she was living in abject poverty. If this true historical situation were posed today, many would recommend abortion. The child born from that pregnancy became the renowned composer Ludwig van Beethoven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p23" pid="TrtRIM4_cUaWHoNHqKFKSw" hash="NAB_Aw">But the principle involved extends beyond those who may become great. If one is to be deprived of life because of potential for developing physical problems, consistency would dictate that those who already have such deficiencies should likewise be terminated. Continuing, then, those who are either infirm, incompetent, or inconvenient should be eliminated by those in power. Such irreverence for life is unthinkable!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p24" pid="UwhAOj7otk-JKBnTR7ckFA" hash="Bdn71Q">Another contention raised is that a woman is free to choose what she does with her own body. To a certain extent this is true for all of us. We are free to think. We are free to plan. And then we are free to do. But once an action has been taken, we are never free from its consequences. Those considering abortion have already exercised certain choices.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p25" pid="UlDAEWlxJkydPn051pRFCQ" hash="cZSzug">To clarify this concept, we can learn from the astronaut. Any time during the selection process, planning, and preparation, he is free to withdraw. But once the powerful rocket fuel is ignited, he is no longer free to choose. Now he is bound by the consequences of his choice. Even if difficulties develop and he might wish otherwise, the choice made was sealed by action.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p26" pid="GgDBQ71NN0aTabCegL6Esw" hash="oOJ_Xg">So it is with those who would tamper with the God-given power of procreation. They are free to think and plan otherwise, but their choice is sealed by action.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p27" pid="H2nfUVGvlEmzi5e9hIiffQ" hash="xihhcg">The woman’s choice for her own body does not validate choice for the body of another. The expression “terminate the pregnancy” applies literally only to the woman. The consequence of terminating the fetus therein involves the body and very life of another. These two individuals have separate brains, separate hearts, and separate circulatory systems. To pretend that there is no child and no life there is to deny reality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/reverence-for-life.p28" pid="KLAnrSTjo0-n_Z9jvTKT0g" hash="JDeFpQ">It is not a question of when “meaningful life” begins or when the spirit “quickens” the body. In the biological sciences, it is known that life begins when two germ cells unite to become one cell, bringing together twenty-three chromosomes from both the father and from the mother. These chromosomes contain thousands of genes. In a marvelous process involving a combination of genetic coding by which all the basic human characteristics of the unborn person are established, a new DNA complex is formed. A continuum of growth results in a new human being. The onset of life is not a debatable issue, but a fact of science.</p>

Many in developing nations unknowingly ascribe their lack of prosperity to overpopulation. While they grovel in ignorance of God and his commandments, they may worship objects of their own creation (or nothing at all), while unsuccessfully attempting to limit their population by the rampant practice of abortion. They live in squalor, oblivious to the divine teaching—stated in the scriptures not once, but thirty-four times—that people will prosper in the land only if they obey the commandments of God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

Remember, “The spirit and the body are the soul of man” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:15</a>.) Both are of great importance. Your physical body is a magnificent creation of God. It is his temple as well as yours, and must be treated with reverence. Scripture declares: “Ye are the temple of God. … If any man defile [it], him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3.16-17" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 3:16–17</a>.)</p>

Abraham taught that “these … spirits … existed before, they shall have no end … for they are … eternal.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.18" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:18</a>.)</p>

Part of each test is to determine <span class="emphasis">if</span> your body can become mastered by the spirit that dwells within it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/self-mastery.p9" pid="Llxpqu3vU0WnvqoEso-uZA" hash="m0cfqQ">Although your spirit had a veil of forgetfulness placed over it at the time of your birth into mortality, it retained its power to remember all that happens—precisely recording each event of life. Indeed, scriptures warn “that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/12.36" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 12:36</a>.) Prophets refer to our “bright recollection” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.43" class="scriptureRef">Alma 11:43</a>) and “perfect remembrance” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:18</a>) at that day of decision.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/self-mastery.p11" pid="j3-EnVlklU63XRqEfnL4yA" hash="kzyXUw">In your quest for self-mastery, full participation in the activities of the Church will help. I’ll mention but a few. A first step comes as we learn together to keep the Sabbath day holy. This is one of the Ten Commandments. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.8" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/5.15" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 5:15</a>.) We honor the Sabbath “to pay [our] devotions unto the Most High” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:10</a>), and because the Lord declared: “It is a sign between me and you … that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/31.13" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 31:13</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/ot/ezek/20.20" class="scriptureRef">Ezek. 20:20</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/self-mastery.p12" pid="VBxKf957zEOl3sDcoc9vqg" hash="dlZk0A">Another step toward self-mastery comes when you are old enough to observe the law of the fast. As funds are contributed from meals missed, the needs of the poor may be met. But meanwhile, through your spirit, you develop personal power over your body’s drives of hunger and thirst. Fasting gives you confidence to know that your spirit can master appetite.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/self-mastery.p13" pid="WV126iowtEO_LJ_9kbYaew" hash="w8m2xA">Some time ago your mother and I visited a third-world country where sanitary conditions were much poorer than ours. We joined with a delegation of other doctors from all over the world. The president of our group, an experienced traveler, warned of risks. In order to avoid water that might be contaminated, we were even counseled to brush our teeth with an alcoholic beverage. We chose not to follow that counsel, but simply did what we had learned to do once a month. We fasted that first day, thinking we could introduce simple food and fluids gradually thereafter. Later, we were the only ones in our group without disabling illness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/self-mastery.p14" pid="c2wrovjYzUauic7H8D_3DA" hash="jcNS7Q">Fasting fortifies discipline over appetite and helps to protect against later uncontrolled cravings and gnawing habits.</p>

Remember, it contains a “promise, adapted to the capacity of … the weakest of all saints.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89:3</a>.) It was given “in consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89:4</a>.) Indeed, as you develop courage to say no to alcohol, tobacco, and other stimulants, you gain additional strength. You can then refuse conspiring men—those seditious solicitors of harmful substances or smut. You can reject their evil enticements to your body.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/self-mastery.p16" pid="0uCN6_4rFUqMabBWD3VS2g" hash="d9qmvw">If you yield to anything that can addict, and thus defy the Word of Wisdom, your spirit surrenders to the body. The <span class="emphasis">flesh</span> then enslaves the <span class="emphasis">spirit.</span> This is contrary to the purpose of your mortal existence. And in the process of such addiction, your life span is likely to be shortened, thereby reducing the time available for repentance by which your spirit might attain self-mastery over your body.</p>

It deserves daily care. Physical conditioning through regular exercise requires self-mastery too. I marvel at Elder Joseph Anderson, now in his ninety-sixth year. For decades, the strength of his spirit over his body has induced him to swim regularly. But his motivation has never been to attain physical longevity. That has come only incidentally. His desire has been to serve God and His anointed. Elder Anderson has followed what I label as the Lord’s prescription for a long and useful life.

Symptoms of the deteriorating body can be painful, even disabling. Deep aches of sadness are caused by the departing of loved ones. For some, these deepening trials come early in life. But when yours are thrust upon you, remember a concept expressed by my father some time after my mother had passed away. Your grandparents had been married for sixty-four years. When someone asked how he was doing, my father simply stated, “I’m lonely, but I’m not lonesome.” Do you know what he meant?

In one country, so many people were sleeping in the streets and on sidewalks that we literally had to step over them as we walked. In another nation, our compassion was stretched almost to the breaking point as we yearned to help countless people in need. Young mothers with babies bundled on their backs begged for money while paddling their little sampan boats, which served both as their shelter and as their mode of transportation. And, oh, how our hearts ached for young men and women of another country who, one by one, were strapped as beasts of burden to wooden-wheeled carts heavily laden with weighty cargo. As far as our eyes could see, the endless caravan of vehicles continued, pulled by dint of human toil.</p>

The poor have been especially favored by the law. Old Testament teachings authorized poor persons at harvest time to glean after the reapers. At fruit-picking time, what was left hanging on branches belonged to the poor. In the sabbatical seventh year, and in the jubilee fiftieth year, land was not planted nor tilled, and what grew of itself was free for the hungry.</p>

May I share an illustration with you? Once, Sister Nelson and I were invited to the humble home of Polynesian Saints who had relatively recently joined the Church. By walking carefully on wooden planks, we approached their house, built on wooden piles emerging from the floor of the sea. We climbed a ladder to enter their little one-room dwelling. As we were invited to be seated on freshly woven grass mats, we could peek through holes in the floor and view sea water below. That home was starkly devoid of furniture, except for a used sewing machine provided by sisters of the Relief Society. But the love and warmth of this special family were apparent as our visit continued.</p>

You need to feel good about the people with whom you live and work—your companions in life.

When shades of slumber first admit the light of dawn, I reach gently for my beloved companion nearby. I gain sweet reassurance that all is well with her even before my eyes are fully opened. That reminds me, incidentally, of advice given by President David O. McKay, who said, “During courtship we should keep our eyes wide open, but after marriage keep them half-shut” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1956, p. 9).</p>

Through our many long years of postgraduate study, professional responsibilities, and a growing family, she did not complain.

Kindness was reflected in her reply: “Through our struggling years I didn’t expect much, so I was rarely disappointed.”</p>

That sin is joy’s deadly poison. The first morning’s glance in the mirror cannot reflect joy if there is any recollection of misdeeds the night before. The surest step toward joy in the morning is virtue in the evening! Virtue includes courtesy to companions all day long.</p>

To me, such ingratitude seems comparable to sullen goldfish oblivious to kind providers who sprinkle food in their bowl.

Harm inflicted by alcohol has been demonstrated, for example, by a study of the relationship between alcohol consumption among expectant mothers and the birth weight of their newborn infants. Findings published from the U. S.

He was interested in the topic of possible continuation of life after what we know as death.

Sensing public interest in that subject, he would entitle the book <span class="emphasis">Life after Life.</span></p>

Jesus ministered unto the dead in the postearthly spirit world (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/23.9-10" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 23:9–10</a>). Peter testified that “the gospel [was] preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/4.6" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 4:6</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.19-21" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 3:19–21</a>).</p>

Our bodies undergo constant rebuilding according to genetic recipes that are uniquely ours. Each time we take a bath, we lose not only dirt, but cells dead and dying, as they are replaced by a newer crop.

            <span class="strong">She labored beside her companion.</span> Adam held the priesthood. Eve served in matriarchal partnership with the patriarchal priesthood. So today, each wife may join with her husband as a partner unified in purpose. Scriptures state clearly, “Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 11:11</a>). “They twain shall be one flesh” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 19:6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.8" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 49:16</a>). Marvelously, it takes a man <span class="emphasis">and</span> a woman to make a man <span class="emphasis">or </span>a woman. Without union of the sexes, neither can we exist, nor can we become perfect. Ordinary and imperfect people can build each other through their wholeness together. The complete contribution of one partner to the other is essential to exaltation. This is so “that the earth might answer the end of its creation” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 49:16</a>).</p>
          <p pid="OBd-D4Au2UqRXxmK9On5Bg" hash="XjeH-Q">So labor and love in partnership. Honor your companion. Any sense of competition for place or position is not appropriate for either partner, especially when enlightened by scriptural understanding.</p>

You will gain joy and rejoicing in your posterity. That enrichment becomes more beautiful and precious with each passing year.</p>

In an interval between her daytime job as a schoolteacher and her evening work as a clerk in a music store, we went to the hospital and each sold a pint of blood. As the needle was withdrawn from her arm, she said to me, “Don’t forget to pay tithing on my blood money.” (When her mother learned I was bleeding her daughter between two jobs, I sensed at that time she may not have been too pleased with her new son-in-law.)

I had earned two doctor’s degrees. I had been certified by two specialty boards. That long preparation had consumed many years, yet it carried no legal permission. Keys were required. They were held by authorities of the state government and the hospitals in which I desired to work. Once those holding proper authority exercised those keys by granting me a license and permission, then I could perform operations. In return, I was obligated to obey the law, to be loyal, and to understand and not abuse the power of a surgeon’s knife. The important steps of preparation, permission, and obligation likewise pertain to other occupations.</p>

I have seen much of death and dying, suffering and sorrow. I also remember the plight of students overwhelmed by their studies and of those striving to learn a foreign language. And I recall the fatigue and frustration felt by young parents with children in need. Amidst circumstances seemingly impossible, I have also experienced the joyous relief that comes when one’s understanding is deepened by scriptural insight.</p>

Scriptures show that some of His lasting lessons have been taught with examples terrible as war, commonplace as childbearing, or obvious as hazards of deep water. His teachings are frequently based on common understanding, but with uncommon results. Indeed, one might say that to teach His people, the Lord employs the unlikely.</p>

Even in that ugly circumstance, the Lord has helped those obedient to His counsel. Going into battle, all would assume the obvious advantage of outnumbering an enemy. But when God’s disciple Gideon was leading an army against the Midianites, “the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many … , lest Israel vaunt themselves … , saying, Mine own hand hath saved me” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/judg/7.2" class="scriptureRef">Judg. 7:2</a>).</p>

So another reduction was made. Finally, only three hundred remained. Then the Lord delivered the victory to the outnumbered few (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/judg/7.5-25" class="scriptureRef">Judg. 7:5–25</a>).</p>

Everyone “knows” that <span class="emphasis">old</span> women do not bear children. So upon whom did the Lord call to bear Abraham’s birthright son? Sarah, at age ninety! When told this was to be, she asked a logical question: “Shall I [which am old] of a surety bear a child?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/18.13" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 18:13</a>). From heaven came this reply: “Is any thing too hard for the Lord?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/18.14" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 18:14</a>).</p>

Later, they were led by Joshua to the river Jordan at flood time (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/3.title" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 3</a>). In each instance, deep water was divinely divided to allow the faithful to reach their destination safely. To teach His people, the Lord employs the unlikely.</p>

Then he spoke of leaders whose faith preceded their miraculous deeds, including Alma, Amulek, Nephi, Lehi, Ammon, the brother of Jared, and the three who were promised that they should not taste of death (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.13-20" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:13–20</a>).</p>

Two separate optical systems are joined together with a gear to focus two independent images into one three-dimensional view. To apply this analogy, let the scene on the left side of your binoculars represent <span class="emphasis">your perception</span> of your task. Let the picture on the right side represent the <span class="emphasis">Lord’s</span> perspective of your task—the portion of His plan He has entrusted to you. Now, connect your system to His. By mental adjustment, fuse your focus. Something wonderful happens. Your vision and His are now the same. You have developed an “eye single to the glory of God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:5</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.15" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:15</a>). With that perspective, look upward—above and beyond mundane things about you. The Lord said, “Look unto me in every thought” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:36</a>). That special vision will also help clarify your wishes when they may be a bit fuzzy and out of focus with God’s hopes for your divine destiny. Indeed, the precise challenge you regard now as “impossible” may be the very refinement you need, in His eye.</p>

Our pioneer forefathers are good examples. They sang, “Gird up your loins; fresh courage take” (“Come, Come, Ye Saints,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 30). They feared no toil and no labor. Among them were Johan Andreas Jensen and his wife, Petra, who left their native Norway in 1863. Their family included six-week-old tiny twin daughters. As handcarts were pulled in their rugged journey, one of those little girls died along the way. The child who survived grew up to become my Grandmother Nelson!</p>

Recently, I interviewed a married couple three days after their release as full-time missionaries in a large metropolis. “We are converts,” they said. “We joined the Church ten years ago. Even though we just completed a mission, we want to go again! But this time, we would like to volunteer for a more difficult assignment. We want to teach and serve children of God who live in remote areas of the world!”</p>

Two of those couples have joined the Church already, and the third is equally supportive. Please send us among humble people who love the Lord and desire to know that His Church has again been restored to the earth.” Needless to say, their petition was gratefully heard, and now they have received their second call to missionary service.</p>

As faithful members of the Church, they had always upheld its doctrines, including the twelfth article of faith. When their country went to war, military conscription called the dutiful husband away from his wife before either had learned she was to bear their child. He was captured by enemy troops and taken as a prisoner of war. Months elapsed. Their baby came. Still no word to know whether the new father was alive. A year after his capture, he was permitted to write to his wife.</p>

Even though clothed in prisoner’s stripes and able to speak the language of his captors’ country only in a limited way, he became Sunday School superintendent of the branch. He baptized four fellow prisoners during their confinement. Three years after the war ended, he returned home to his wife and a son he had never seen. Later, he served for ten years as the first stake president of his country. Now he is a member of the presidency of one of our temples! His wife stands faithfully beside him in the privilege of that sacred assignment.</p>

As a medical doctor, my study of drugs began early in medical school. Each doctor spends months in specialized courses learning potential benefits and risks of medicinal agents. Proper prescription of drugs is the forte of skilled physicians. Generally, when their advice is carefully followed, results are remarkably successful. In addressing this topic, I specifically exclude such application of modern knowledge by educated professionals.</p>

From trial comes a habit. From habit comes dependence. From dependence comes addiction. Its grasp is so gradual. Enslaving shackles of habit are too small to be sensed until they are too strong to be broken. Indeed, drugs are the modern “mess of pottage” for which souls are sold. No families are free from risk.</p>

Some questions relate to surgical intervention to save a life or to save a part of the body. Other questions relate to elective procedures to alter the body’s structure or function. In recent years, many questions relate to the “choice” to abort the life of a newly forming human being. Ironically, such “choice” would deny that developing individual both life and choice.</p>

Well do I remember doing so many years ago while in military service, separated from family and friends, surrounded by the horrible devastation of war. On another unforgettable occasion, I was stranded in a cold, remote area, far from transportation, food, or shelter. No doubt you have had similar anxious moments. But those experiences are the exceptions. I’d like to discuss the greater question.</p>

Another is to be tested—to experience mortality—to determine what you will do with life’s challenging opportunities. Those opportunities require you to make choices, and choices depend on agency. A major reason for your mortal existence, therefore, is to test how you will exercise your agency. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.15,25" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:15, 25</a>.)</p>

In 1972, Elder Kimball, then a member of the Council of the Twelve, knew that his mortal life was slipping away because of heart disease. He obtained competent medical counsel and prayerfully consulted with the Lord and with his file leaders in the Church. Elder and Sister Kimball and the First Presidency carefully weighed available alternatives. Then President Harold B. Lee, speaking for the First Presidency, counseled Elder Kimball. With great conviction, President Lee said: “Spencer, you have been called! You are not to die! You must do everything you need to do to care for yourself and continue to live.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Dec. 1985, p. 40.)</p>

I found my dear wife to be very weary. I don’t know why. She only had nine children underfoot all day. So I offered to get our four-year-old ready for bed. I began to give the orders: “Take off your clothes; hang them up; put on your pajamas; brush your teeth; say your prayers” and so on, commanding in a manner befitting a tough sergeant in the army. Suddenly she cocked her head to one side, looked at me with a wistful eye, and said, “Daddy, do you own me?”</p>

Children are naturally eager to share their experiences, which range from triumphs of delight to trials of distress. Are we as eager to listen? If they try to express their anguish, is it possible for us to listen openly to a shocking experience without going into a state of shock ourselves? Can we listen without interrupting and without making snap judgments that slam shut the door of dialogue? It can remain open with the soothing reassurance that we believe in them and understand their feelings. Adults should not pretend an experience did not happen just because they might wish otherwise.</p>

The doctor instructed me to go into a far room and speak to her. Then I should move nearer and nearer until she does hear. Following the doctor’s instructions, I spoke to her from the bedroom while she was in the kitchen—no answer. I moved nearer and spoke again—no answer.

For example, not long ago a beautiful young mother named Svetlana developed an intense desire to obtain a Bible. But in her city of Leningrad, a Bible was very rare and expensive. Frequently and fervently she prayed for a Bible. Ultimately, she and her husband were impressed to travel with their small child to Helsinki, Finland, with that hope in mind. There one day while walking in a park, she stumbled across an object buried under the cover of autumn leaves. She picked it up and found it to be a Bible written in the Russian language! Excitedly she recounted the story of this great discovery to another mother who was also in the park with her youngster. The second mother rejoiced with Svetlana and added, “Would you like to have <span class="emphasis">another</span> book about Jesus Christ?” Svetlana, of course, answered in the affirmative. The other mother provided Svetlana with a copy of a Russian-language edition of the Book of Mormon and invited the family to church. She eagerly embraced the teachings of the missionaries and shortly thereafter joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Then they returned to their home, where they have helped pioneer the work in the Leningrad Branch of the Church.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

We are grateful to the First Presidency for that assignment. Much has been written regarding the success of the choir and of its favorable influence that will yet continue. Members and friends of the Church worldwide join with me in expressing appreciation to the officers, staff, directors, accompanists, and to all vocalists for their wonderful service. I won’t mention anyone by name; I will simply refer to them all as members of the choir.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/these-were-our-examples.p2" pid="2shgdn5cQUmvp9UX5rZ_4g" hash="l1oRig">I’ll not comment as a music critic would. While musical experts of the world focus on what choir members can do, I would like to focus on what choir members can be. This I do because I witnessed in choir members great examples that can inspire and improve the lives of each of you who honestly strives to emulate the Lord who said, “I am the light; I have set an example for you.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.16" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 18:16</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.15" class="scriptureRef">John 13:15</a>.)

They are ordinary people with ordinary frailties. But therein lies the power of their example. They believe this promise from the Lord: “Because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 135:5</a>.)</p>

Because each of us is to be “an example of the believers” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 4:12</a>), I would like to address those ten topics as members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir “were our examples” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.6" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 10:6</a>) in many memorable ways.</p>

I pay tribute to the First Presidency and to leaders of the choir who had the foresight to plan as they did and when they did. How bold and inspired they were to conceive this tour many months—even years—before Europe’s unwelcoming walls began to crumble! The Brethren had the faith to believe that the choir could sing in cities such as Warsaw, Budapest, Prague, Leningrad, and Moscow long before such dreams seemed plausible. Then in January 1991, hopeful plans were seriously threatened when war erupted in the Persian Gulf. Even then, our leaders decided against canceling the tour. They knew of its potential for good and had faith that countless obstacles could be overcome. Often they prayed that the choir’s tour might be successfully accomplished.</p>

In one thousand years of Russia’s existence, its first popular national election ever to be held occurred in June 1991. Six days later, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir performed in Moscow! That very night, after the strains of “Come, Come, Ye Saints” (see <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 30) had resounded from the Bolshoi Theater, the vice president of the republic announced that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been granted recognition in the Republic of Russia. On the eve of a supreme crisis that was yet ahead, Russian people heard songs of faith, courage, hope, and love.</p>

Real were the risks of separation of husbands and wives, of parents and children. Hundreds of dependents were temporarily deprived of moms or dads for almost a month. Thanks be to all who cared for those families—in faith. If each of us could muster that same faith in the service we are called to render, we would also be blessed.</p>

What inspired him to feel such a force for good? Was it complicated classical music or the excellence of its rendition? I doubt it. I believe it was more likely communication by the Spirit, which allowed both the giver and receiver to be edified. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.21-22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:21–22</a>.) And very possibly, the spirit of the listener was moved most by melodies soft and simple, sung with sweet sincerity. When the choir sang “The Lord’s Prayer,” for example, audiences were hushed and attentive. They seemed to understand, without fully knowing either the language or the history of the song.</p>

That separation evokes pangs of sorrow and shock among those left behind. The hurt is real. Only its intensity varies. Some doors are heavier than others. The sense of tragedy may be related to age. Generally the younger the victim, the greater the grief. Yet even when the elderly or infirm have been afforded merciful relief, their loved ones are rarely ready to let go. The only length of life that seems to satisfy the longings of the human heart is life everlasting.</p>

Prior to our birth, we dwelled as spirit children with our Father in Heaven. There we eagerly anticipated the possibility of coming to earth and obtaining a physical body.

But we regarded the returning home as the best part of that long-awaited trip, just as we do now. Before embarking on any journey, we like to have some assurance of a round-trip ticket. Returning from earth to life in our heavenly home requires passage through—and not around—the doors of death. We were born to die, and we die to live. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/6.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 6:9</a>.) As seedlings of God, we barely blossom on earth; we fully flower in heaven.</p>

We are called, sustained, and ordained—not by ourselves, but “by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.5" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:5</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/5.4" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 5:4</a>.)</p>

Each member of the First Presidency is addressed and spoken of as “President.” (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.22,24,29" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:22, 24, 29</a>.) The title “President” is also used when referring to the presidency of a stake or mission, and in reference to a quorum or branch president. The title “Apostle” is sacred. It has been given of God and belongs only to those who have been called and ordained as “special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:23</a>.) An Apostle speaks in the name of Him whose special witness he is. This hallowed title is not used in ordinary forms of address. The preferred title for one of the Twelve is “Elder” or ”Brother.”</p>

But in discussing this topic, we must recognize at the outset that there is a difference between <span class="emphasis">tolerance</span> and <span class="emphasis">tolerate.</span> Your gracious tolerance for an individual does not grant him or her license to do wrong, nor does your tolerance obligate you to tolerate his or her misdeed. That distinction is fundamental to an understanding of this vital virtue.</p>

Such tendencies make me wonder: Cannot boundary lines exist without becoming battle lines? Could not people unite in waging war against the evils that beset mankind instead of waging war on each other? Sadly, answers to these questions are often no. Through the years, discrimination based on ethnic or religious identity has led to senseless slaughter, vicious pogroms, and countless acts of cruelty.

They viewed “the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of their membership and the supernal setting for their most sacred covenants.” She strived to emulate the “example of the Lord Jesus Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Instead, they chose to endure with loving faith. When well-meaning friends and family expressed concern for Emily, she cheerfully replied, “Don’t worry, I’ll be OK!” Even when she concluded a telephone call, she did not close with the customary “good-bye.” She would say, “I love you!”</p>

Today it is possible to immunize individuals against conditions that once were disabling—even deadly. One medical method by which acquired immunity is conferred is inoculation. The term <span class="emphasis">inoculate</span> is fascinating. It comes from two Latin roots: <span class="emphasis">in,</span> meaning “within”; and <span class="emphasis">oculus,</span> meaning “an eye.” The verb <span class="emphasis">to inoculate,</span> therefore, literally means “to put an eye within”—to monitor against harm.</p>

An affliction like sin can cripple or destroy the spirit. The ravages of polio can now be prevented by immunization, but the ravages of sin require other means of prevention. Doctors cannot immunize against iniquity. Spiritual protection comes only from the Lord<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span>—and in his own way. Jesus chooses not to inoculate, but to indoctrinate. His method employs no vaccine; it utilizes the teaching of divine doctrine—a governing “eye within”—to protect the eternal spirits of his children.</p>

Reminders come repeatedly. We may lock keys inside the car, or even forget where the car is parked. And not infrequently we walk intently from one part of the house to another, only to forget the reason for the errand.</p>

A baseball pitcher can throw a no-hit, no-run ball game. A surgeon can perform an operation without an error. A musician can render a selection without a mistake. One can likewise achieve perfection in being punctual, paying tithing, keeping the Word of Wisdom, and so on. The enormous effort required to attain such self-mastery is rewarded with a deep sense of satisfaction. More importantly, spiritual attainments in mortality accompany us into eternity.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

The process of perfection includes challenges to overcome and steps to repentance that may be very painful.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> There is a proper place for chastisement in the molding of character, for we know that “whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

The moment he uttered the words “even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,” he raised our sights beyond the bounds of mortality. Our Heavenly Father has eternal perfection. This very fact merits a much broader perspective.</p>

When spiritual needs arise, they may look to the left, the right, or round about. But looking to other people on the same level cannot satisfy spiritual shortages. When the immortal spirit is starved, hunger persists for something more filling. Even when material success comes, there is a hollow ache—if living well falls short of living worthily. Inner peace cannot be found in affluence accompanied by spiritual privation.</p>

This sustenance comes because they have made covenants to take upon themselves the name of the Lord and strive to obey his precepts. Strength comes in recognizing and in being grateful for the Lord’s gifts of immortality and the opportunity for eternal life.</p>

While that question was being answered, I thought about our beloved General Authorities born in the countries of Asia; of Europe; of North, Central, and South America; and of the islands of the sea. Though these Brethren come from many nations and speak several tongues, not one of them was called to represent his native country. Presiding quorums of the Church are not representative assemblies. Each leader has been called to face the people as a representative of the Lord, not the other way around.</p>

God’s commandments serve as a standard against which priorities can be measured. Our respect for the first commandment fashions our feelings for all the others. Consider the commandment to keep the Sabbath day holy, for example.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> We live in a time when many people throughout the world have transferred their allegiance on the Sabbath from places of worship to places of amusement.

The morality of self-discipline with appropriate “denial or restraint has been popularly depicted as unhealthy and dehumanizing.” The truth is, “it is dehumanizing to define ourselves by our desires alone.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Each human being is a child of God—created in His image—with natural appetites to control.</p>

If change in direction is needed, we may want to issue a self-command to “about face!” Doing so would please the Lord, who said, “Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

They and their posterity also became subject to injury, disease, and death. And a loving Creator blessed them with healing power by which the life and function of precious physical bodies could be preserved. For example, bones, if broken, could become solid again. Lacerations of the flesh could heal themselves.

They cannot be regarded casually. With divorce rates escalating throughout the world today, it is apparent that many spouses are failing to endure to the end of their commitments to each other. And some temple marriages fail because a husband forgets that his highest and most important priesthood duty is to honor and sustain his wife.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> The best thing that a father can do for his children is to “love their mother.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span></p>

Baptism is an extremely important ordinance. But it is only initiatory. The supreme benefits of membership in the Church can only be realized only through the exalting ordinances of the temple.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p2" pid="VW1cVJfYR0uVr2yuCcOorQ" hash="IlXaNQ">A verse of scripture opens a door of opportunity for each of us: “There is a spirit in man,” said Job, “and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> To take advantage of such an opportunity, we need more than a verbal incentive. We need an example—someone to show us how spiritual capacity can be developed. I have selected as a model for my message President Gordon B. Hinckley.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> I hope he will pardon me. My motive in doing so is not one of adulation, but of emulation. We can draw upon his example in order to improve our own spiritual attributes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p3" pid="eTb68SCfLEiVhYwXy5vN6Q" hash="Q-19lw">This year, Sister Nelson and I have had the privilege of accompanying President and Sister Hinckley to 11 countries<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> for which I have had some responsibilities. That has given us a rare opportunity to observe him closely under a variety of conditions. His teachings are always inspiring and relevant. They should be studied carefully and applied individually. They represent the word of the Lord for His people.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p4" pid="jl3ECcvjWUOh4hi1e34xpA" hash="KNuXjg">But my purpose is not to review the content of President Hinckley’s messages. Instead, I would like to focus upon his spiritual capacities. He has developed many, including “faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, [and] diligence.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p5" pid="QMzh6HUIfUeso62UNLudjw" hash="tH9aNQ">His humility, for example, is so sincere that he would have me point only to the Lord Jesus Christ as our great exemplar.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Of course, He is! The Master said, “I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> We must never lose sight of the Savior’s enduring standard as the ultimate for each of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p6" pid="D83FQwGBl0C2qQNh2N-1Yg" hash="TG79Lw">But we can also learn much from a man who has spent his entire lifetime in striving to be more like the Lord. More than 87 years ago, Gordon B. Hinckley was an infant cradled in the arms of his loving parents. That newborn babe looked much as any other, I presume. An infant’s body is tiny, and its spiritual capacities are undeveloped. While the body may reach the peak of its maturation in a few years, the development of the spirit may never reach the limit of its capacity, because there is no end to progression.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p7" pid="rKgwgdc270SRrlQVJYuBPw" hash="HD_g_A">President Hinckley’s personality, manner, and native intelligence have always been uniquely his. To these inborn attributes, however, he has added spiritual capacities, and they are continuing to increase.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p8" pid="ZOzSu24YoEeKAQ1I6_t9lA" hash="ddFDOg">Both his parents and he understood the importance of education and a mission. After his graduation from the university, he faced a major decision in 1933, when he was called to go on a mission. At that time, most young men in the Church were not able to serve because of a global economic depression that deprived nearly everyone of available cash. Earlier, his wonderful mother, with foresight and faith, had established a small savings account for his mission. Though she died before his call, her fund sent him on his way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p9" pid="oikin66Vt0io8qPJ3UP2TA" hash="gL0x8w">Shortly after Elder Hinckley’s labors began in England, he became discouraged and wrote to his father. After reading that letter, his father’s wise reply closed with these words: “Forget yourself and go to work.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Thanks to noble parents and a crucial decision to remain, Elder Hinckley completed his mission with honor. Now he often states that the good things that have happened to him since have all hinged upon that decision to stay. On his mission, he developed good habits of study, work, communication, budgeting, time management, and more. There he learned that nothing is too hard for the Lord.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p10" pid="E6gflqfutEuKeAQgpAPEsg" hash="fXD_zw">Long ago, President Hinckley harnessed the power of prayer. I have watched him pray over many weighty matters and receive inspired answers. Prayer invites those ennobling attributes of the spirit that are ultimately “bestowed upon all who are true followers of … Jesus Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p11" pid="nEcarzcAbUqfgDRGKB-p8Q" hash="xGumKg">Hobbies can aid in spiritual development. Worthy music, dance, art, and writing are among the creative activities that can enrich the soul. A good hobby can dispel heartache and give zest to life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Through the years, one of President Hinckley’s hobbies has been his home. As a young father, he learned how to build. He acquired the skills necessary to remodel a house and make needed repairs. And more important, he has built and maintained the trust of his wife and their children. Together they have established—and are still adding to—wonderful memories with their children and grandchildren, who know that they are part of “a chosen generation … called … out of darkness into [the] marvellous light”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> of the Lord. From the Hinckleys’ parental example, we can learn a great lesson. Love at home comes when companions cultivate their commitment to keep the commandments of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p12" pid="vQOyG_AqykS-nAHLTCrOhA" hash="HDE26A">President Hinckley’s love of learning is catalyzed by curiosity. He grasps every opportunity to learn from others. On one occasion, I heard him quiz a local security officer for nearly an hour regarding crime control in a major city. I have heard him converse with building contractors, reporters, and those who specialize in the arts, architecture, business, government, law, medicine, and other disciplines. He knows their vocabularies, their challenges, and their strengths.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p13" pid="MkeivHbz90Weq6zCcY1Xgg" hash="CRqbuQ">His remarkable ability as a writer has been gained by his living close to the Spirit. Similar skills can come to others too, for scriptures state that such has been “given unto as many as called upon God to write by the spirit of inspiration.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p14" pid="MiMTh38SAEyOXcXM4ApM8g" hash="QTf6vg">Through the years, President Hinckley has developed a remarkable sense of humor. You have heard his quip that “Sister Hinckley and I are learning that the so-called golden years are laced with lead.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> I might add a pun, President. We are grateful to be led by that kind of lead. It gives ballast to balance one who might lean too far in any direction. And it gives stability to character.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p15" pid="2JSTd2qonEeRW-YrrmaZzA" hash="SZmmBQ">While I focus upon President Hinckley, Sister Hinckley should also be included. They have been married for 60 years and have long been one in spirit, while maintaining their individuality. They do not waste time pondering the past or fretting about the future. And they persevere in spite of adversity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p16" pid="RpeUE5IZYkWQfDtjZ6SXaA" hash="NnQTnQ">While going from a chapel to an airport in Central America, their vehicle was involved in an accident. Sister Nelson and I were traveling behind them and saw it occur. A truck loaded on top with unsecured metal rods approached them at an intersection. To avoid a collision, its driver suddenly stopped the truck, launching those iron rods like javelins to pierce the Hinckleys’ car. Windows were smashed; fenders and doors were dented. The accident could have been very serious. While shattered glass was being removed from their clothing and skin, President Hinckley said: “Thank the Lord for His blessing; now let’s continue on in another car.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p17" pid="uKVxB6QP3UqGsTVXjmMktw" hash="qznCBg">Among President Hinckley’s spiritual attributes is that of compassion. He is sympathetic to people and feels a strong urge to help them. I have watched him weep with those who mourn and rejoice when Saints are blessed. Such compassion can come to anyone whose heart has truly been touched by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p18" pid="0xY92fewJ0qV0Xjbhki1Xw" hash="euIOUA">President and Sister Hinckley have demonstrated that the capacity to understand increases as one learns and then teaches with diligence.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Unless illness interferes, age does not diminish—it augments—the capacity for spiritual development.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p19" pid="MAADqm8jP0-TTeyaA3p9Kw" hash="kcG8Fg">Each President of the Church, armed with the Holy Ghost as a constant companion, inherits an enormous workload at an age when most men would be retired. President Hinckley sets a pace that is unprecedented. In 1996, he visited missionaries, members, and friends of the Church in 23 nations on four continents. During that year, he gave more than 200 major discourses. His stride in 1997 continues to follow that same pattern. His strenuous schedule is driven by his determination to be “anxiously engaged”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> in building the kingdom of God. Often I have heard him say, “I don’t know how to get anything done except getting on my knees and pleading for help and then getting on my feet and going to work.” Unshakable faith, hard work, and contagious optimism epitomize our prophet.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p21" pid="zFH9E-xmIkGkfaTUMsq4Ww" hash="m3vylw">President Hinckley has achieved spiritual supremacy over physical feelings. Even when entitled to normal complaints of “jet lag” or “burnout,” he is attentive. I believe that his personal antidote for fatigue is enthusiasm<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> for the work. He is energized by the Lord, who said, “I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind … [and] fill your soul with joy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>

There President Hinckley recounted to us how that property was selected. On a prior visit, he had been shown several possible locations, but none seemed to satisfy him. While prayerfully searching, he asked about ground on a hill not far from the airport. But it was said to be <span class="emphasis">not</span> for sale. President Hinckley directed that they visit that property anyway. There he received inspiration from the Almighty that this was the right place for the temple. Now we were privileged to stand on that spot reserved by the Lord and then procured for this sacred purpose. Our joy was indescribable.</p>

He is keenly aware of their opportunities and risks. “Yes, this work requires sacrifice,” he said. “It requires effort, it means courage to speak out and faith to try. … It needs men and women of solemn purpose.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> “We know that there are some limits on what you can do, but we know also that there need be no limits on enthusiasm, planning, thoughtful consideration, and effort.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/spiritual-capacity.p25" pid="B6XU9pYy_0OiV6A2D2moeA" hash="-6-1YA">Brothers and sisters, the spirit that dwells within each of us can be enriched with enthusiasm and enlightened by the Almighty.

And I cherish my membership in this Church, to which both of his parents were converted in Denmark about a century and a half ago. In fact, all eight of my great-grandparents were converts to the Church in Europe. Of the others, one joined the Church in Sweden, two in England, and three in Norway. How grateful I am to these pioneer predecessors! My debt to them is reflected in these biblical verses: “One soweth, and another reapeth” that “both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

President Wilford Woodruff was so concerned that he made the issue a matter of fervent prayer. Then, at April 1894 general conference,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> he presented a revelation to the membership of the Church. From it I quote: “We want the Latter-day Saints from this time to trace their genealogies as far as they can, and to be sealed to their fathers and mothers.

And when will he? Not until he has redeemed and saved every son and daughter of our father Adam that have been or ever will be born upon this earth to the end of time. … That is his mission. We will not finish our work until we have saved ourselves, and then not until we shall have saved all depending upon us; for we are to become saviors upon Mount Zion, as well as Christ. We are called to this mission. The dead are not perfect without us, neither are we without them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_30">30</span></p>

Together, these two cells contain all of the new individual’s hereditary information, stored in a space so small it cannot be seen by the naked eye. Twenty-three chromosomes from each parent unite in one new cell. These chromosomes contain thousands of genes which determine all of the physical characteristics of the unborn person. Approximately 22 days after these two cells unite, a little heart begins to beat. At 26 days, blood begins to circulate. Cells multiply and divide. Some become eyes that see; others become ears that hear.</p>

It has four delicate valves that control the direction of blood flow. These valves open and close more than 100,000 times a day—36 million times a year. Yet, unless altered by disease, they are able to withstand this stress almost indefinitely. No man-made material developed to date can be flexed so frequently and so long without breaking.</p>

To protect it from harm, the body perceives pain. In response to infection, it generates antibodies. They not only help to combat the immediate problem, but they persist to strengthen resistance to infection in the future. One day my attention was directed to some three-year-old children who had lapped up water from a street gutter. The number of germs they ingested must have been incalculable, but not one of those youngsters became ill. As soon as that dirty drink reached each little stomach, its hydrochloric acid went to work to treat the water and protect the life of the child.</p>

Mercifully, our Creator provided for aging and other processes which ultimately result in physical death. We often think of death as untimely or tragic. But death, like birth, is part of life.

Fortunately, his mother survived, but I’ll never forget his lingering sorrow. He bore the burden of knowing that his personal immorality had disqualified him from giving needed aid to his mother, and he had added to her grief.

Long years ago, Elder Frank Croft was serving in the state of Alabama. While preaching to the people, he was forcefully abducted by a vicious gang, to be whipped and lashed across his bare back. Elder Croft was ordered to remove his coat and shirt before he was tied to a tree. As he did so, a letter he had recently received from his mother fell to the ground. The vile leader of the gang picked up the letter. Elder Croft closed his eyes and uttered a silent prayer. The attacker read the letter from Elder Croft’s mother. From a copy of that letter, I quote:</p>

Sometime, somewhere, they will understand and then they will regret their action and they will honor you for the glorious work you are doing.

But if rapt attention is paid to a road map for a day’s journey, isn’t it also wise to pay attention to authoritative guidance on our journey through life? To this end I would like to speak—on <span class="emphasis">why</span> we need guidance, <span class="emphasis">where </span>we obtain it, and <span class="emphasis">how</span> we can achieve it.</p>

We studied the map with great care. Then we made the necessary course correction.</p>

You do not know where you are. What can you do? You call for help! You call home! Call the Church! Pray!

Or you may have to go back to the beginning in order to be certain that you can get where you want to go.</p>

We turn to Him who knows us best—our Creator. He allowed us to come to earth with freedom to choose our own course. In His great love, He did not leave us alone. He provided a guide—a spiritual road map—to help us achieve success in our journey. We call that guide the standard works, so named because they—the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price—constitute the <span class="emphasis">standard</span> by which we should live.

In family council we determined that our best time for scripture study was 6:00 <small>A.M.</small> At that hour our little ones were very sleepy but supportive. Occasionally we had to awaken one when a turn came to read. I would be less than honest with you if I conveyed the impression that our family scripture time was a howling success.

When I saw what was ahead, I immediately asked to beach the raft and hold an emergency family council meeting, knowing that if we were to survive this experience, we needed to plan carefully. I reasoned with our family: “No matter what happens, the rubber raft will remain on top of the water. If we cling with all our might to ropes secured to the raft, we can make it. Even if the raft should capsize, we will be all right if we hang tightly to the ropes.”</p>

As we go through life, even through very rough waters, a father’s instinctive impulse to cling tightly to his wife or to his children may not be the best way to accomplish his objective. Instead, if he will lovingly cling to the Savior and the iron rod of the gospel, his family will want to cling to him and to the Savior.</p>

I still remember that mental image—complete with dotted lines where sutures should be placed. The repair was completed as diagrammed in my mind. We tested the valve and found the leak to be reduced remarkably. My assistant said, “It’s a miracle.”</p>

The photo shows nothing about my roots and branches. They are important parts of my identity. Could you tell much about a tree by looking at a photograph of only its trunk? No!

Truths from previous dispensations have now been gathered, amplified, and clarified.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> For us as parents and teachers, we have an excellent teaching resource in the Articles of Faith. Written by the Prophet Joseph Smith,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> this document refers to many doctrines that undergird our religion. It mentions the Godhead, moral agency, the Fall of Adam, and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It spells out the foundational principles and ordinances of faith, repentance, baptism, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. It addresses matters of priesthood authority and organization. It notes as sacred scripture the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, and an open canon of continuing revelation from God. And it proclaims the actuality of the gathering of Israel.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> What a treasure-house of truth is this precious document as we teach of our religious roots.</p>

My heart aches when I learn of those who turn from the faith of their pioneer predecessors. One professionally acclaimed friend and gifted son of faithful ancestors has allowed one doctrinal doubt to dim his view of the fulness of the gospel and drive an ever-widening wedge between him and the temple. Another acquaintance, a sweet sister with illustrious pioneer progenitors, now politely states that she is not a “practicing member” of the Church.</p>

Have they forgotten what the Restoration really means and what it cost? Have they forgotten their pioneer heritage and their lineage as declared in patriarchal blessings? For a few fleeting favors now, would they forget and forfeit eternal life? Oblivious to the roots that have blessed them, they no longer enjoy the spiritual sparkle of Saints engaged in the work of Almighty God.</p>

They wanted to know more about our welfare program and humanitarian help. We complied as we could and then shifted attention from <span class="emphasis">what</span> we do to <span class="emphasis">why</span> we do it. I explained with an analogy to a tree. “You are attracted by various fruits of our faith,” I said. “They are plentiful and powerful.

With our religion, you cannot have the fruits without the roots.” This they understood.</p>

In some of those countries, the Church is relatively new. No matter where I go, I meet our missionaries. They are remarkably resilient and ever effective. They give visible and tangible evidence that the Church of Jesus Christ has been restored in its fulness. It was He who said, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> This commandment throbs in the heart of every missionary who testifies of Jesus Christ and teaches His message.</p>

Parents of 9 grown children and grandparents of 20 grandchildren, they now serve in a remote part of Chile, working in a small branch. They make frequent visits among less-active members and with families recently converted to the Church. These visits provide opportunity for the Poelmans to read with those families and bear testimony of temple blessings. In their mission branches, they have also taught people how to conduct music and play simplified versions of the hymns on small electronic keyboards. Elder and Sister Poelman recently wrote: “Baptism is only the first step in conversion. When the initial excitement subsides and the new converts continue facing the need to work long hours just to put bread on the table, they need others to help them who share the joy of the gospel. That is our specialty. Part of our work is preventive—staying close to new converts. Yet others who rarely attend meetings have not lost conviction and receive our messages gratefully. As we watch the changes brought about in the lives of those we visit, we feel blessed to be receiving constant tutoring and help from the Lord in this work and, at the same time, to know that our family members back home are vicariously sharing our calling and those special blessings.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Elder Kenneth and Sister Barbara Willits, for instance, serve in the Accra Ghana Temple. They developed a special love for the people of Ghana while serving there as missionaries more than two decades earlier. They are energetic and enthusiastic converts of 50 years, with 3 children, 16 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren. They perform the exalting ordinances of the temple. Brother Willits serves as a sealer. On several occasions they have been pleasantly surprised to meet members whom they had previously encountered during their first mission. Recently Elder Willits performed the sealing of a husband and wife that they had taught in 1982, and to that couple, Elder Willits sealed four of their deceased children. Elder and Sister Willits write: “Our willingness to leave our family and home is motivated by the temple covenants we have made, and our deepest desire is to become an eternal family. Our family is fully supportive as we serve, and they share in many blessings we have received. We are humbly grateful for the privilege of assisting others to receive their temple blessings.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

Some, such as the Accra Ghana Temple, are located where most local members had not had previous opportunities to attend a temple. Ordinances for those members are now enhanced by experienced couples who serve as temple missionaries. To them, we also express our heartfelt gratitude.</p>

Callister and I were in Kiev, capital city of Ukraine. We were there to create the first stake in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We were pleased to note that the Kiev Ukraine District was well prepared to become a stake—fully organized and ready to take its place among the stakes of Zion. There we also met with the missionaries, among whom were several stalwart senior couples. We listened attentively to their expressions.</p>

Speaking with a slight and sweet German accent, they recounted the difficult days of World War II and the subsequent Soviet occupation. They spoke of their many deprivations. Finding the Lord’s true Church and later immigrating to America were counted as treasured blessings. The ensuing years brought them five healthy children, along with spiritual and financial increase. They felt that serving a mission would be a good way for them to show gratitude to the Lord. They expressed a deep desire to serve in Eastern Europe. Their call came to serve in the Ukraine Kiev Mission. Elder and Sister Hegewald write: “Now, close to the end of our mission in the land of our former enemy, we are thankful for the opportunity to teach and love the Ukrainian people. As we have served the Lord, our souls have been healed and our family has become more united. We have had a truly remarkable and satisfying experience and have seen many small miracles.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Another couple tells of blessings that come from missionary service. They wrote: “Good people replaced our parenting functions better than we. … If a family problem has not yielded to prayer and fasting, a mission might be considered.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

Neither did Joseph or Brigham or John or Wilford. They had children and grandchildren too. They loved their families not one whit less, but they also loved the Lord and wanted to serve Him. Someday we may meet these stalwarts who helped to establish this dispensation. Then will we rejoice that we did not seek the shadows when a call to missionary service came from the prophet, even in the autumn years of our lives.</p>

At the most recent training broadcast to priesthood leaders throughout the world, President Gordon B. Hinckley issued a similar call: “There is a constant need for more couple missionaries,” he said. “They perform wonderful service throughout the world. You [leaders] need not wait for the couples to volunteer. The sacrifices associated with serving the Lord full time will abundantly bless the couples, their families, and the people they serve.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

Limitations imposed by age or by poor health deserve realistic appraisal, as do the important needs of family members. When desire burns within yet such limitations exist, you can extend your service through others. They can be your arms and legs, and you can provide needed funds. Still others can contribute time and talents as live-at-home missionaries.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> Each will be pleasing to the Lord, and each will receive His praise.</p>

While I was at home on a rare Saturday with no assignment, we had worked together. She had washed our clothing. I had helped to carry it, fold it, and put it in place. Then while we were sitting on the sofa, holding hands, enjoying a program on television, my precious Dantzel slipped peacefully into eternity. Her passing came suddenly and unexpectedly. Just four days earlier, our doctor’s report at a routine checkup indicated that her laboratory tests were good. After my efforts to revive her proved fruitless, feelings of shock and sorrow overwhelmed me. My closest friend, angel mother of our 10 children, grandmother of our 56 grandchildren, had been taken from us.</p>

Countless letters, calls, cards, and other messages have been sent. All tributes expressed loving admiration for her and sympathy for us whom she left behind. Those messages came in such large numbers that we, regretfully, were unable to respond to all of them individually. May I thank each and all for your great kindness toward us. Thank you so very, very much. Your expressions have brought much comfort through this time of heartache for our family. We really love dear Dantzel! We miss her!</p>

Faith, repentance, baptism, a testimony, and enduring conversion lead to the healing power of the Lord. Baptism is a covenant act—a sign of a commitment and a promise. Testimony develops when the Holy Ghost gives conviction to the earnest seeker of the truth. True testimony fosters faith; it promotes repentance and obedience to God’s commandments. Testimony engenders enthusiasm to serve God and fellow human beings.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> Conversion means “to turn with.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> Conversion is a turning <span class="emphasis">from</span> the ways of the world <span class="emphasis">to,</span> and staying <span class="emphasis">with,</span> the ways of the Lord.

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/nurturing-marriage.p19" uuid="1ddf1624-14dc-47f0-88fe-107e93c48194" pid="AufDdEI_JUalf_qj8zCKOA" hash="SzShtA">With these doctrinal underpinnings in mind, let us consider the second step—specific actions that would strengthen a marriage. I will offer sample suggestions and invite each couple privately to ponder them and adapt them as needed to their own particular circumstances.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/nurturing-marriage.p20" uuid="ce614742-0b3e-4436-a9f9-f0e43555c5a5" pid="NFVaoz0cL0WcqAeCcuw0ZQ" hash="Gf0XfQ">My suggestions use three action verbs: to<span class="emphasis"> appreciate, </span>to<span class="emphasis"> communicate,</span> and to<span class="emphasis"> contemplate.</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/nurturing-marriage.p21" uuid="6279d1bb-eb6b-4005-9864-9d93da572f4e" pid="anu7OFzTR02MCTXAnaVrHw" hash="K04rYw">To <span class="emphasis">appreciate</span>—to say “I love you” and “thank you”—is not difficult. But these expressions of love and appreciation do more than acknowledge a kind thought or deed. They are signs of sweet civility. As grateful partners look for the good in each other and sincerely pay compliments to one another, wives and husbands will strive to become the persons described in those compliments.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/nurturing-marriage.p22" uuid="109bc41e-25d5-4505-9eb6-83c3fcfc0d20" pid="P6N2cMuf6E2jvkKxiBf_TQ" hash="0qSTSA">Suggestion number two—to <span class="emphasis">communicate</span> well with your spouse—is also important. Good communication includes taking time to plan together. Couples need private time to observe, to talk, and really listen to each other. They need to cooperate—helping each other as equal partners. They need to nurture their spiritual as well as physical intimacy. They should strive to elevate and motivate each other. Marital unity is sustained when goals are mutually understood. Good communication is also enhanced by prayer. To pray with specific mention of a spouse’s good deed (or need) nurtures a marriage.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/nurturing-marriage.p23" uuid="f713ac92-695e-4a21-a2eb-4719e69c969b" pid="-gWN0RsWwkmW9ptb48mbWg" hash="IHHZ6g">My third suggestion is to <span class="emphasis">contemplate.</span> This word has deep meaning. It comes from Latin roots: <span class="emphasis">con,</span> meaning “with,” and <span class="emphasis">templum,</span> meaning “a space or place to meditate.” It is the root from which the word <span class="emphasis">temple</span> comes. If couples contemplate often—with each other in the temple—sacred covenants will be better remembered and kept. Frequent participation in temple service and regular family scripture study nourish a marriage and strengthen faith within a family. Contemplation allows one to anticipate and to resonate (or be in tune) with each other and with the Lord. Contemplation will nurture both a marriage and God’s kingdom. The Master said, “Seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

Begin with sincere desire. Identify those actions needed to bless your spiritual unity and purpose. Above all, do not be selfish! Generate a spirit of selflessness and generosity. Celebrate and commemorate each day together as a treasured gift from heaven.</p>

We share an enormous responsibility to be who the Lord wants us to be and to do what He wants us to do. We are part of a great movement—the gathering of scattered Israel.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="102"></span>Last year while Elder David S. Baxter and I were driving to a stake conference, we stopped at a restaurant. Later when returning to our car, we were approached by a woman who called out to us. We were startled by her appearance. Her grooming (or lack of it) was what I might politely call “extreme.” She asked if we were elders in the Church. We said yes. Almost unrestrained, she told the story of her tragic life, swamped in sin. Now, only 28 years old, she was miserable. She felt worthless, with nothing to live for. As she spoke, the sweetness of her soul began to emerge. Pleading tearfully, she asked if there was any hope for her, any way up and out of her hopelessness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/repentance-and-conversion.p2" pid="hvc8gAGVgk-aZuajaHbIXw" hash="BCPJCA">“Yes,” we responded, “there is hope. Hope is linked to repentance. You can change. You can ‘come unto Christ, and be perfected in him.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> We urged her not to procrastinate.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> She sobbed humbly and thanked us sincerely.</p>

We recalled the counsel given to a hopeless soul by Aaron, who said, “If thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, … then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

I do so because the Lord has commanded His servants to cry repentance unto all people.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> The Master has restored His gospel to bring joy to His children, and repentance is a crucial component of that gospel.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/repentance-and-conversion.p5" pid="SQqvrUySNkCkEfTWRX37pw" hash="MGcXiw">The doctrine of repentance is as old as the gospel itself. Biblical teachings from the books of Genesis<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> to Revelation<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> teach repentance. Lessons from Jesus Christ during His mortal ministry include these warnings: “The kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> and “Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

We begin with a dictionary’s definition that to repent is “to turn from sin … to feel sorrow [and] regret.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> To repent from sin is not easy. But the prize is worth the price. Repentance needs to be done one step at a time. Humble prayer will facilitate each essential step. As prerequisites to forgiveness, there must first be recognition, remorse, then confession.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> “By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Confession is to be made to the person who has been wronged. Confession should be sincere and not merely an admission of guilt after proof is evident. If many persons have been offended, confession should be made to all offended parties. Acts that may affect one’s standing in the Church or the right to its privileges should be confessed promptly to the bishop, whom the Lord has called as a common judge in Israel.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

Then come steps to resolve to do better and refrain from relapse—to repent “with full purpose of heart.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> Thanks to the ransom paid by the Atonement of Jesus Christ, full forgiveness is given to the sinner who repents and remains free from sin.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> To the repentant soul, Isaiah said, “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; <span class="pageBreak" page-number="103"></span>though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>

Such is the case in His warning to parents: “Inasmuch as parents have children in Zion … that teach them <span class="emphasis">not</span> to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost … , the sin be upon the heads of the parents.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span></p>

When Jesus said “repent,” His disciples recorded that command in the Greek language with the verb <span class="emphasis">metanoeo.</span><span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span> This powerful word has great significance. In this word, the prefix <span class="emphasis">meta</span> means “change.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span> The suffix relates to four important Greek terms: <span class="emphasis">nous, </span>meaning “the mind”;<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span><span class="emphasis">gnosis, </span>meaning “knowledge”;<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_27">27</span><span class="emphasis">pneuma, </span>meaning “spirit”;<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span> and <span class="emphasis">pnoe, </span>meaning “breath.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_29">29</span></p>

A prophet explained that such a change in one’s breath is to breathe with grateful acknowledgment of Him who grants each breath. King Benjamin said, “If ye should serve him who has created you … and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath … from one moment to another—I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_30">30</span></p>

Alma so taught his son: “Learn wisdom in thy youth,” he said. “Learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God. … Let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_32">32</span></p>

Alma taught that concept when he posed these questions: “I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_33">33</span> That change comes when we are “born again,” converted and focused upon our journey to the kingdom of God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_34">34</span></p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="92"></span>My beloved brethren and sisters, I am deeply grateful for each of you. Together we feel a profound sense of gratitude for the gospel of Jesus Christ. In this world abounding with misery, we are truly thankful for God’s “great plan of happiness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> His plan declares that men and women are “that they might have joy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> That joy comes when we choose to live in harmony with God’s eternal plan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p2" pid="xM4adZX5K06tRq7Y-xQIpQ" hash="KQx90w">The importance of choice may be illustrated by a homespun concept that came to mind one day when I was shopping in a large retail store. I call it “patterns of the shopper.” As shopping is part of our daily life, these patterns may be familiar.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p3" pid="pu8w5FkjZk6LUm_ewOPVSQ" hash="iekbXA">Wise shoppers study their options thoroughly before they make a selection. They focus primarily on the quality and durability of a desired product. They want the very best. In contrast, some shoppers look for bargains, and others may splurge, only to learn later—much to their dismay—that their choice did not endure well. And sadly, there are those rare individuals who cast aside their personal integrity and steal what they want. We call them shoplifters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p4" pid="bWmgODfgDEO3w6gPyhpQ9w" hash="u6O_Rg">The patterns of the shopper may be applied to the topic of marriage. A couple in love can choose a marriage of the highest quality or a lesser type that will not endure. Or they can choose neither and brazenly steal what they want as “marital shoplifters.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p5" pid="fcJlbIrHEEyXrWgdNajJWw" hash="t2p9-g">The subject of marriage is debated across the world, where various arrangements exist for conjugal living. My purpose in speaking out on this topic is to declare, as an Apostle of the Lord,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> that marriage between a man and a woman is sacred—it is ordained of God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> I also assert the virtue of a temple marriage. It is the highest and most enduring type of marriage that our Creator can offer to His children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p6" pid="W8MCXHyCH0C42i4YjA8U1Q" hash="YYrFzw">While salvation is an individual matter, exaltation is a family matter.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Only those who are married in the temple and whose marriage is sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise will continue as spouses after death<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> and receive the highest degree of celestial glory, or exaltation. A temple marriage is also called a celestial marriage. Within the celestial glory are three levels. To obtain the highest, a husband and wife must be sealed for time and all eternity and keep their covenants made in a holy temple.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

[Heavenly Father’s great] plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples <span class="pageBreak" page-number="93"></span>make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p14" pid="lC7mKc0AGUCghGkHiUh13g" hash="SI_p8Q">Scriptures declare that “it is lawful that [a man] should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> Another affirms that “the man [is not] without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> Thus, marriage is not only an exalting principle of the gospel; it is a divine commandment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p15" pid="LD4ymvWZZUSLCEtGZb0QoA" hash="TXGWxA">Our Heavenly Father declared, “This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> The Atonement of His Beloved Son enabled both of these objectives to be realized. Because of the Atonement, immortality—or resurrection from the dead—became a reality for all.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> And because of the Atonement, eternal life—which is living forever in God’s presence, the “greatest of all the gifts of God”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span>—became a possibility. To qualify for eternal life, we must make an eternal and everlasting covenant with our Heavenly Father.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span> This means that a temple marriage is not only between husband and wife; it embraces a partnership with God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p17" pid="Rt6NsNQc3EOLyBGf8Ihk8g" hash="7rPGRg">Such a reward requires more than a hopeful wish. On occasion, I read in a newspaper obituary of an expectation that a recent death has reunited that person with a deceased spouse, when, in fact, they did <span class="emphasis">not</span> choose the eternal option. Instead, they opted for a marriage that was valid only as long as they both should live. Heavenly Father had offered them a supernal gift, but they refused it. And in rejecting the gift, they rejected the Giver of the gift.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p18" pid="e9Wjzwjdf02dbbvqFQ3RPQ" hash="ObPZJg">One strong sentence of scripture clearly distinguishes between a hopeful wish and eternal truth: “All covenants, contracts, … obligations, oaths, vows, … or expectations, that are <span class="emphasis">not</span> made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, … are of <span class="emphasis">no</span> efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are <span class="emphasis">not</span> made unto this end have an end when men are dead.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_29">29</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p20" pid="0rp3lyVbBUeHi2TMa2zd-g" hash="tKTF-g">Mercifully, God’s great plan of happiness and its eternal blessings can be extended to those who did not have the opportunity to hear the gospel in mortality.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p21" pid="kKmeHQSox0ePmUpX1LZm7Q" hash="Ytlcsg">But what of the many mature members of the Church who are not married? Through no failing of their own, they deal with the trials of life alone. Be we all reminded that, in the Lord’s own way and time, no blessings will be withheld from His faithful Saints.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_32">32</span> The Lord will judge and reward each individual according to heartfelt desire as well as deed.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_33">33</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p22" pid="G-zJ6l6vRUymSqvauRCxXw" hash="bHfs8Q">Meanwhile, mortal misunderstandings can make mischief in a marriage. In fact, each marriage starts with two built-in handicaps. It involves two imperfect people. Happiness can come to them only through their earnest effort. Just as harmony comes from an orchestra only when its members make a concerted effort, so harmony in marriage also requires a concerted effort. That effort will succeed if each partner will minimize personal demands and maximize actions of loving selflessness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p23" pid="JeRvBhKs1EyfyvOu4hOs5g" hash="DzOEGg">President Thomas S. Monson has said: “To find real happiness, we must seek for it in a focus outside ourselves. No one has learned the meaning of living until he has surrendered his ego to the service of his fellow man. Service to others is akin to duty—the fulfillment of which brings true joy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_34">34</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p24" pid="1eW1wir-Y0WueGPFzH0nDw" hash="hAQ2ZA">Harmony in marriage comes only when one esteems the welfare of his or her spouse among the highest of priorities. When that really happens, a celestial marriage becomes a reality, bringing great joy in this life and in the life to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p25" pid="dwE9H11Oe0ypiVSAuQixtw" hash="KkaU2g">God’s plan of happiness allows us to choose for ourselves. As with the patterns of the shopper, we may choose celestial marriage or lesser alternatives.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_35">35</span> Some marital options are cheap, some are costly, and some are cunningly crafted by the adversary. Beware of his options; they always breed misery!<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_36">36</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p26" pid="TSKCwEe600SKqMeB-95EbQ" hash="XN_imw">The best choice is a celestial marriage. Thankfully, if a lesser choice has previously been made, a choice can now be made to upgrade it to the best choice. That requires a mighty change of heart<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_37">37</span> and a permanent personal upgrade.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_38">38</span> Blessings so derived are worth all efforts made.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_39">39</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage.p27" pid="81bOX4E2VkK1piY8YpGjMQ" hash="23YJ-w">The full realization of the blessings of a temple marriage is almost beyond our mortal comprehension. Such a marriage will continue to grow in the celestial realm. There we can become perfected.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_40">40</span> As Jesus ultimately received the fulness of the glory of the Father,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_41">41</span> so we may “come unto the Father … and in due time receive of his fulness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_42">42</span></p>

I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

It means “truly” or “verily.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Adding <span class="emphasis">amen</span> solemnly affirms a sermon or a prayer.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Those who concur should each add an audible <span class="emphasis">amen</span><span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> to signify “that is my solemn declaration too.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/lessons-from-the-lords-prayers.p29" pid="iLCFRtzuck-qM4ggtW0PmA" hash="r3O9cQ">Prayer can also be enhanced by fasting.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_32">32</span> The Lord said, “I give unto you a commandment that ye shall continue in prayer and fasting from this time forth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_33">33</span> A plea for wisdom in fasting was offered by President Joseph F. Smith, who cautioned that “there is such a thing as overdoing. A man may fast and pray till he kills himself; and there isn’t any necessity for it; nor wisdom in it. … The Lord can hear a simple prayer, offered in faith, in half a dozen words, and he will recognize fasting that may not continue more than twenty-four hours, just as readily and as effectually as He will answer a prayer of a thousand words and fasting for a month. … The Lord will accept that which is enough, with a good deal more pleasure and satisfaction than that which is too much and unnecessary.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_34">34</span></p>

A closing prayer in a Church meeting need not include a summary of each message and should not become an unscheduled sermon. Private prayers can be as long as we want, but public prayers ought to be short supplications for the Spirit of the Lord to be with us or brief declarations of gratitude for what has transpired.</p>

We can use “right words”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_35">35</span>—special pronouns—in reference to Deity. While worldly manners of daily dress and speech are becoming more casual, we have been asked to protect the formal, proper language of prayer.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="81"></span>My beloved brethren and sisters, I am very grateful for each of you. I am thankful too for the miracle of modern communication that allows this conference to reach millions of people throughout the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p2" pid="9WcEh3PFRU-B2s2Nskfy5g" hash="NM-Xuw">Today’s technology also allows us to use wireless telephones to exchange information rapidly. Recently Wendy and I were on assignment on another continent when we learned that a new baby had arrived in our family. We received the good news minutes after that birth had occurred half a world away.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p3" pid="Y2NFN82HX0yxWbD5DrbvBg" hash="xRS3kw">Even more amazing than modern technology is our opportunity to access information directly from heaven, without hardware, software, or monthly service fees. It is one of the most marvelous gifts the Lord has offered to mortals. It is His generous invitation to “<span class="emphasis">ask,</span> and it shall be given you; <span class="emphasis">seek,</span> and ye shall find; <span class="emphasis">knock,</span> and it shall be opened unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p4" pid="dLwk_ooXgUq9ZwZxR7GhQw" hash="djSSIQ">This timeless offer to provide personal revelation is extended to all of His children. It almost sounds too good to be true. But it is true! I have received and responded to that heavenly help. And I have learned that I always need to be ready to receive it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p5" pid="Ee0NpdsUS0SjlAYbVlkWFg" hash="5PeJDA">Years ago, while immersed in the task of preparing a talk for general conference, I was aroused from a sound sleep with an idea impressed strongly upon my mind. Immediately I reached for pencil and paper near my bed and wrote as rapidly as I could. I went back to sleep, knowing I had captured that great impression. The next morning I looked at that piece of paper and found, much to my dismay, that my writing was totally illegible! I still keep pencil and paper at my bedside, but I write more carefully now.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p6" pid="neGpBYPHMUqMjOB-wMOTgQ" hash="iLQz7g">To access information from heaven, one must first have a firm faith and a deep desire. One needs to “ask with a sincere heart [and] real intent, having faith in [Jesus] Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> “Real intent” means that one <span class="emphasis">really intends</span> to follow the divine direction given.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p7" pid="HK0lImxmMEqCGdGhzDfBwA" hash="Iom7iw">The next requirement is to study the matter diligently. This concept was taught to leaders of this restored Church when they were first learning how to gain personal revelation. The Lord instructed them, “I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause <span class="pageBreak" page-number="82"></span>that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p8" pid="bYkGlrRE5EeXbz0GXZjeeA" hash="YgWRVQ">Part of being prepared is to know and obey the relevant teachings of the Lord. Some of His timeless truths are applicable generally, such as the commandments not to steal, not to kill, and not to bear false witness. Other teachings or commandments are also general, such as those regarding the Sabbath, the sacrament, baptism, and confirmation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p9" pid="V3ZB6vKLLkW2-I5SG92hbQ" hash="aodrog">Some revelations have been given for unique circumstances, such as Noah’s building of the ark or the necessity for prophets like Moses, Lehi, and Brigham to lead their followers in arduous travel. God’s long-established pattern of teaching His children through prophets assures us that He will bless each prophet and that He will bless those who heed prophetic counsel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p10" pid="OZEAA_VgPUiqGPcElQV7VA" hash="e5hTJQ">A desire to follow the prophet requires much effort because the natural man knows very little of God and even less of His prophet. Paul wrote that “the natural man [receives] not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> The change from being a natural man to a devoted disciple is a mighty one.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p11" pid="wcCM185PLUSbgSts6f3Fog" hash="xOg4XQ">Another prophet taught that “the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p12" pid="SQkHyESBSU-VoU68BmUJcw" hash="li3dWQ">Recently I observed such a mighty change in a man whom I first met about 10 years ago. He had come to a stake conference at which his son was sustained as a member of the new stake presidency. This father was not a member of the Church. After his son had been set apart, I put my arms around this father and praised him for having such a wonderful son. Then I boldly declared: “The day will come when you will want to have this son sealed to you and your wife in a holy temple. And when that day comes, I would be honored to perform that sealing for you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p13" pid="XsEbb2_S4EuJR6kvMGBmkA" hash="m1m4IQ">During the subsequent decade, I did not see this man. Six weeks ago he and his wife came to my office. He greeted me warmly and recounted how startled he was with my earlier invitation. He didn’t do much about it until later, when his hearing began to fail. Then he awakened to the realization that his body was changing and that his time on earth was indeed limited. In due course he ultimately lost his hearing. At the same time, he became converted and joined the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p14" pid="CnfEg0AK0UOMgOXrzOqq7A" hash="i2q9tg">During our visit he summarized his total transformation: “I had to lose my hearing before I could heed the great importance of your message. Then I realized how much I wanted my loved ones to be sealed to me. I am now worthy and prepared. Will you please perform that sealing?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> This I did with a deep sense of gratitude to God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p15" pid="NFM_b55VO0qWQ-UorReBbQ" hash="5XHUcA">After such a conversion takes place, even further spiritual refinement can come. Personal revelation <span class="pageBreak" page-number="83"></span>can be honed to become spiritual discernment. To <span class="emphasis">discern</span> means to sift, to separate, or to distinguish.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> The gift of spiritual discernment is a supernal gift.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> It allows members of the Church to see things not visible and to feel things not tangible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock.p16" pid="Ar6c0aMVHk2d_8NR8_-Tsw" hash="RjPb9g">Bishops are entitled to that gift as they face the task of seeking out the poor and caring for the needy. With that gift, sisters may view trends in the world and detect those that, however popular, are shallow or even dangerous. Members can discern between schemes that are flashy and fleeting and those refinements that are uplifting and enduring.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="91"></span>Correspondence we receive at Easter or Christmastime provides refreshing memories of dear friends and relatives. Some of those messages are enriched with precious family photographs. Here is one that really caught my attention.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p2" pid="nAGXqBE-3kK4IMciEY-t0w" hash="66WhCw">This is one of our great-granddaughters. I’ll call her “Dear Ruby.” This picture reminded me of her mother when she was about the same age. From my files I retrieved this photo of “Dear Ruby’s” mother—one of our granddaughters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p3" pid="bNooeV_O8UOHsmFjD0_jfA" hash="_GdCSA">I took this picture of “Dear Ruby’s” mother some 29 years ago. Her eyes are still just as blue.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p4" pid="lNP_U3H3mEat_E_nxTwdUA" hash="gIz8yg">Fond memories surfaced from half a century ago, when “Dear Ruby’s” grandmother—one of our daughters—was then the newest member of our family. This is one of her baby pictures. Now she is a loving grandmother, and I am “Dear Ruby’s” great-grandfather. (I won’t show you my picture as a baby. That would not help.) These photographs suggest the love that links our four generations together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p5" pid="mbg6zLqu2kiqRtIUD6qqOw" hash="osEZHw">When I think of the love I feel for each member of our family, I sense, to a slight degree, the love that our Heavenly Father bears for His children. While the family is under attack throughout the world, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaims, promotes, and protects the truth that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children. “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” and our vast family history efforts are but two evidences of how this Church brings hope and help to the sacred institution of the family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p6" pid="jsmUyglUZEiqMAKAgVbQgg" hash="yePgFA">We teach that God’s love for His children is infinite. Regardless of race, nationality, or gender, He loves all of them.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> He has done so from the beginning and will continue to do so. He invites all to gain eternal exaltation for their family. His work and His glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life—the exaltation—of His children.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not <span class="pageBreak" page-number="92"></span>perish, but have everlasting life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p7" pid="FGSSsEbqyki21Q_p2NkBmw" hash="YhksTg">The Atonement of His Beloved Son enabled both of the Father’s objectives to be fulfilled. Without the Atonement, there would be no immortality. Without the Atonement, there would be no return to the presence of the Father and no continuation of the family beyond the grave.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p8" pid="saSxZsMsH0mkDwcb93BVSw" hash="cJ8PYg">Because of the Atonement, these consummate blessings can be realized by each of God’s children who obey His eternal laws. Through the ages, many of His children have had access to the blessings of the gospel, but many more have not. Before the foundation of the world, our Heavenly Father instituted the ordinance of baptism for those who die without a knowledge of the gospel.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> He loves those children too.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p9" pid="ew3rBPLEzkCClng2sTiN4w" hash="rC-EFA">He also provided a way for them to be part of an eternal family. Every human being who comes to this earth is the product of generations of parents. We have a natural yearning to connect with our ancestors. This desire dwells in our hearts, regardless of age.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p10" pid="lEMSUq6Pj0iNh-S8iIPAUg" hash="DeddqA">Consider the spiritual connections that are formed when a young woman helps her grandmother enter family information into a computer or when a young man sees the name of his great-grandfather on a census record. When our hearts turn to our ancestors, something changes inside us. We feel part of something greater than ourselves. Our inborn yearnings for family connections are fulfilled when we are linked to our ancestors through sacred ordinances of the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p11" pid="l-oyn7d5UEqQLZHJs0iY8A" hash="jiUf8g">Because of the importance of this work, the Church has built temples closer to the people,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> and family history research is being facilitated as never before. Methods to find and prepare names for temple ordinances are also improving. At the October 2005 conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley announced an exciting step forward in family history and temple work. He said: “One of the most troublesome aspects of our temple activity is that as we get more and more temples … across the earth there is duplication of effort in proxy work. … We, therefore, have been engaged for some time in a very difficult undertaking. … The solution lies in complex computer technology.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p12" pid="ElZR4i2dUkqxEtxeASO7-Q" hash="e9HEsQ">Since then, not only has duplication been reduced, but procedures have been simplified so that virtually every member of the Church can participate in temple and family history work. Gone are the days when this sacred work was done only by specialists. No matter your situation, you can make family history a part of your life right now. Primary children can draw a family tree. Youth can participate in proxy baptisms. They can also help the older generation work with computers. Parents can relate stories of their lives to their posterity. Worthy adult members can hold a temple recommend and perform temple ordinances for their own kin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p13" pid="QuQfVj9XDkGQCNwlj5brHg" hash="3f4LdA">The Prophet Joseph Smith said, “The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> New technology <span class="pageBreak" page-number="93"></span>makes it easier than ever to fulfill that responsibility. Temple and family history work is now facilitated by a system known as the “new FamilySearch.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> This Internet-based system helps members identify their ancestors, determine what ordinance work needs to be done for them, and prepare their names for the temple. It can be accessed from home, a family history center,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> or wherever the Internet is available. The steps are easy to follow.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p14" pid="YrbbsGRy4E67G9E1J5Cf_w" hash="1cFWSg">You first identify individuals for whom you desire to do temple work.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p16" pid="gt8wKIalbEuawpzyZOLlLg" hash="2Dp3bg">From the Family Ordinance Request, ordinance cards are printed at the temple. After an ordinance is performed, it is recorded and entered into new FamilySearch on that very day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p17" pid="9mS5T3cPg0imvpfOQz4Z5w" hash="DcZYDw">Now what about those of you who have no access to a computer or prefer not to use this technology? Don’t worry! Take one step at a time. Start at home. Begin with an empty cardboard box, as suggested by President Boyd K. Packer.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Put in that box important information about you and your family. Add data gathered from others of your family. Then avail yourself of assistance from your ward or branch family history consultant. The new FamilySearch system enables a consultant to perform all needed computer functions for you, including preparing names for the temple. About 60,000 consultants serve throughout the world. One in your ward or branch can be very helpful to you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p18" pid="qDRDXXBRjk6LX5g5s1z1iQ" hash="tNiwZA">The new FamilySearch system changes the dynamics of family history work by facilitating the creation of one common pedigree. In the past, a person worked separately, keeping his or her own family records. One often worked without knowing what other family members were doing. Now each person can contribute information while coordinating with others in developing their family tree.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p19" pid="031Ben0C60GsjGLgE2QDQQ" hash="lnjPUA">While the new FamilySearch is a giant step forward, it is still just a step. There is more work ahead. Because the system facilitates access to information submitted to the Church over many decades from many sources, new FamilySearch may expose duplicate entries or errors that had not previously been recognized. This feature is especially useful for those with early pioneer ancestry. Duplications and errors need correction, and no one can do it better than each individual for his or her own family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p20" pid="8BUYfIoW2EK5oirlAxPBIg" hash="dvRiQQ">You may be frustrated as you work through these challenges. Please be assured that your concerns are well understood. The Church, under the inspired leadership of President Thomas S. Monson, is working diligently to assist you in solving these problems. Together we are striving to organize the family tree for all of God’s children. This is an enormous endeavor with enormous rewards.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p21" pid="jEe6WuZsSUmU4EiL4a9Smw" hash="3-Nw8Q">This is joyful work. Look at this photograph of new converts doing temple work for their own kin. These dear Saints are from the San Salvador El Salvador Ilopango Stake and are attending the Guatemala City Temple for the first time. They are holding their temple cards, each with the name of a deceased relative for whom they have performed a vicarious baptism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p22" pid="ooHh00O3ZEG59oDQkHQ7ZQ" hash="JtPMKw">In order for the Church’s family history efforts to succeed, priesthood direction and leadership are essential. Leaders teach and testify of the doctrine undergirding this sacred work.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> They issue callings and see that instruction is available.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> They view temple and family history activity as a way to elevate the spirit of their ward, strengthen the spiritual roots of new converts, and bless the lives of all members.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p23" pid="pCY302gTL0WZiSd0EegclQ" hash="kREwIA">While temple and family history work has the power to bless those beyond the veil, it has an equal power to bless the living. It has a refining influence on those who are engaged in it. They are literally helping to exalt their families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/generations-linked-in-love.p24" pid="AByBkJUKb0WBGIeAbqE6ow" hash="qjtm9A">We are exalted when we can dwell together with our extended families in <span class="pageBreak" page-number="94"></span>the presence of Almighty God. The Prophet Joseph Smith foresaw our duty: “The great day of the Lord is at hand … ,” he said. “Let us, therefore, as a church and a people, and as Latter‑day Saints, offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; and let us present in his holy temple … a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

As we work together, we can make it worthy of all acceptation by the Lord. That record enables ordinances to be performed for and accepted by our deceased ancestors, as they may choose. Those ordinances can bring liberty to captives on the other side of the veil.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>

Missionaries serve now just as they did in New Testament times. The book of Acts describes early missionary labors of the Apostles and other disciples following the Lord’s mortal ministry. There we read of the remarkable conversion and baptism of Saul of Tarsus,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> who had previously been “breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> and persecuting members of the fledgling Church. From such beginnings, Saul became the converted Paul, one of the Lord’s greatest missionaries. The final 15 chapters of the book of Acts report the missionary labors of Paul and his companions.</p>

It applies to our full-time missionaries; it applies equally to each member of the Church. Whether full-time missionaries or members, we should all be good examples of the believers in Jesus Christ.</p>

They help people to develop faith in the Lord, repent, be baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, receive the ordinances of the temple, and endure faithfully to the end. God’s work and glory—“to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span>—is also the sacred work and glory of each missionary.</p>

In my family, I have observed the blessings that come to each missionary. Thus far, the number of our children, grandchildren, and their spouses called to serve as full-time missionaries is 49, and that number will continue to increase. In each instance, I have seen the growth in wisdom, maturity in judgment, and flowering of faith that developed in each missionary. They, just as many generations before them, embarked in the service of God to “serve him with all [their] heart, might, mind and strength.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Missionary service has helped to shape their divine destiny.</p>

Most have not been and may never be full-time missionaries. But all can be member missionaries. That statement reminds me of a report of a humorous event. On a large playing field at a missionary training center, a sign was posted. It read, “Missionaries only!” People who also wanted to play on that field posted a new sign of their own. Their sign read, “Every Member a Missionary!”</p>

You can invite friends and neighbors to visit the new mormon.org Web site. If you have blogs and online social networks, you could link your sites to mormon.org.

Because this is a new feature, most of these profiles are available in English. Profiles in other languages will follow.</p>

Two months ago a young man named Zac—a freshman in college—saw an ad for mormon.org on television in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He connected with the Web site and was intrigued by the profiles of Church members. At our Web site he found the link that informed him where he could attend church. The next Sunday, dressed in a white shirt and tie, he attended church, was introduced to members of the ward, and enjoyed all three hours of meetings. He was invited to a member’s home for dinner, followed by his first missionary lesson.

				<span class="pageBreak" page-number="86"></span>One week after a recent assignment to create the first stake in Moscow, Russia,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> I attended a district conference in St. Petersburg. While speaking about my gratitude for early missionaries and local leaders who brought strength to the Church in Russia, I mentioned the name of Vyacheslav Efimov. He was the first Russian convert to become a mission president. He and his wife did wonderfully well in that assignment. Not long after they had completed their mission, and much to our sorrow, President Efimov suddenly passed away.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> He was only 52 years of age.</p>

Far in the rear of the room, a woman stood. I invited her to come to the microphone. Yes, it was Sister Galina Efimov. She spoke with conviction and bore a powerful testimony of the Lord, of His gospel, and of His restored Church. She and her husband had been sealed in the holy temple. She said they were united forever. They were still missionary companions, she on this side of the veil and he on the other side.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> With tears of joy, she thanked God for sacred temple covenants. I wept too, with full realization that the everlasting unity exemplified by this faithful couple was the righteous result of making, keeping, and honoring sacred covenants.</p>

In legal language, a covenant generally denotes an agreement between two or more parties. But in a religious context, a covenant is much more significant. It is a sacred promise with God. He fixes the terms. Each person may choose to accept those terms. If one accepts the terms of the covenant and obeys God’s law, he or she receives the blessings associated with the covenant. We know that “when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span>

We encourage you to keep all that is good and true and then see if we can add more. In this world filled with challenges, we do need help from time to time. Religion, eternal truth, and our missionaries are vital parts of that help.</p>

Jerry’s father was a Baptist minister; his mother, a Methodist minister. One day Jerry’s close friend Pricilla shared with him the pain she felt from the death of her child during childbirth and a bitter divorce that occurred shortly thereafter. Struggling as a single mother, Pricilla has four children—three daughters and a son. As she opened her heart to Jerry, she confessed that she was thinking of taking her own life. With all the strength and love Jerry could muster, he tried to help her understand that her life had value. He invited her to attend his church, but Pricilla explained that she had given up on God.</p>

As he reflected on this impression, he gazed up the street and saw two young men in white shirts and ties riding bicycles toward his home. Stunned by this “coincidence,” he watched them ride by. Then, realizing that the situation required him to act, he shouted out, “Hey, you, please stop! I need to talk to you!”</p>

Can you help me?”</p>

Soon the missionaries were meeting with Pricilla, her children, and Jerry. They discussed the purpose of life and God’s eternal plan for them. Jerry, Pricilla, and her children grew in faith through sincere prayer, their study of the Book of Mormon, and the loving fellowship with members of the Church. Jerry’s already strong faith in Jesus Christ grew even stronger. Pricilla’s doubts and thoughts of suicide turned to hope and happiness. They were baptized and became members of Christ’s restored Church.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Monson and others in praising those who have responded to a prophet’s call for more worthy missionaries. Now an unprecedented wave of enthusiasm for missionary work is sweeping the entire earth. Since President Monson’s historic announcement last October, thousands of elders, sisters, and couples have been called, and many more are preparing.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Now we get questions like “What are you going to do with all these missionaries?” The answer is simple. They will do what missionaries have always done. They will preach the gospel! They will bless the children of Almighty God!</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/catch-the-wave.p6" pid="zo96ISnNUUOZe54W3LCQKg" hash="ZM0jdQ">More of you young men and women will catch this wave as you strive to be worthy of mission calls. You see this as a wave of truth and righteousness. You see your opportunity to be on the crest of that wave.</p>

Where feasible, if you wish to attend a college or university <span class="emphasis">after</span> your mission, we encourage you to apply to your institution of choice <span class="emphasis">before</span> beginning your mission. Many institutions of higher learning will grant an 18- to 30-month deferral to prospective missionaries. This will enable you elders and sisters to serve without worrying about where you will begin your advanced education. We are very grateful to leaders of educational institutions who are making such planning possible!</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/catch-the-wave.p9" pid="v3MkkszuEESBitp8PVK96g" hash="137wwA">You parents, teachers, and others, catch the wave as you prepare our rising generation to be worthy of missionary service. Meanwhile, your exemplary lives will attract the interest of your friends and neighbors. Be ready to give an answer to those who ask why you live as you do. Be ready to give a reason for the hope and joy that they see in you.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> When such questions come, you might respond by saying, “Let’s ask the missionaries! They can help us! And if you desire, I will be at your side as the missionaries respond and teach you.”</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/catch-the-wave.p10" pid="MXWlCunfBkqdc7ctbnxyZg" hash="yXeBoA">You adults, catch the wave with help for the spiritual, physical, and financial preparation of future missionaries. Pinching pennies for piggy banks becomes part of your practice. You senior couples, you plan for the day when you can go on your mission. We will be most grateful for your service. Until then, perhaps some of you could send your dollars on missions by contributing to the General Missionary Fund, as suggested by President Monson again this morning.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

In that service they will shape the destiny of generations born and unborn. Mission presidents hold keys of responsibility for the welfare, safety, and success of their missionaries. After consulting with stake and district presidents in his mission, each mission president assigns missionaries to serve in specific stakes, wards, and branches.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/catch-the-wave.p12" pid="D6Yg6H7dhEuPm7cQVPMFUA" hash="5N0YXg">Stake presidents and bishops catch the wave as they spend more and more hours interviewing prospective missionaries.

You have been called by your bishop to lead missionary work in the ward. And some of you are so successful that an assistant has also been called to help you. Along with others on the ward council, you identify less-active members, part-member families, and interested neighbors. You meet regularly with assigned full-time missionaries. You advise and assist the missionaries. Please help them to fill their daily planners with focused and meaningful teaching opportunities. This is your responsibility. Your role is crucial, truly crucial to the success of this work. If you catch the wave with faith and enthusiasm, others will also. You, as the ward mission leader, are <span class="emphasis">the</span> connecting link between members and missionaries in this sacred work of rescuing God’s children.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

It is <span class="emphasis">not</span> man-made! It comes from the Lord, who said, “I will hasten my work in its time.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> This wave is empowered by a divine announcement made 193 years ago. It consisted of only seven words: “This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Uttered by Almighty God, that announcement introduced a young Joseph Smith to the Lord Jesus Christ. Those seven words launched the Restoration of His gospel. Why? Because our living God is a loving God!

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/catch-the-wave.p16" pid="PHWgKmiQl0eOfJMAUv7lFg" hash="CZml3g">For this glorious purpose, our missionaries teach of the Restoration. They know that some 2,000 years ago, the Lord established His Church. After His Crucifixion and the death of His Apostles, men changed the Church and its doctrine. Then, after generations of spiritual darkness, and as predicted by previous prophets,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ restored the Church, its doctrine, and its priesthood authority. Because of that Restoration, knowledge and essential ordinances for salvation and exaltation are again available to all people.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Ultimately, that exaltation allows each of us to dwell with our families in the presence of God and Jesus Christ forever!</p>

Sure enough, turbulence came. It was really rough. Across the aisle and a couple of rows behind me, a terrified woman panicked. With each frightening drop and jarring bump, she screamed loudly. Her husband tried to comfort her but to no avail. Her hysterical shouts persisted until we passed through that zone of turbulence to a safe landing. During her period of anxiety, I felt sorry for her. Because faith is the antidote for fear, I silently wished that I could have strengthened her faith.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/let-your-faith-show.p7" pid="HURzOzJpFkK8SStKfL3kLw" hash="zOlKBw">Later, as passengers were leaving the aircraft, this woman’s husband spoke to me.

Sometimes those tests come as we face what appear to be life-and-death encounters. For this frightened woman, a violently rocking plane presented one of those moments when we come face-to-face with the strength of our faith.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/let-your-faith-show.p9" pid="tLgvQ6PCLESZDPoXQpVD-Q" hash="hZO2BQ">When we speak of faith—the faith that can move mountains—we are not speaking of faith in general but of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ can be bolstered as we learn about Him and live our religion. The doctrine of Jesus Christ was designed by the Lord to help us increase our faith. In today’s vernacular, however, the word <span class="emphasis">religion</span> can mean different things to different people.</p>

For example, I have overheard conversations on Monday mornings about professional athletic games that took place on the preceding Sunday. For some of these avid fans, I have wondered if their “religion” would “tie them back” only to some kind of a bouncing ball.</p>

Is it in a brand? Is it in a celebrity? Even the best teams can fail. Celebrities can fade. There is only One in whom your faith is always safe, and that is in the Lord Jesus Christ. And you need to let your faith show!</p>

He demanded that I <span class="pageBreak" page-number="30"></span>

Their objectives and desires are heavily influenced by their faith or lack of it. Many put other priorities ahead of God. Some challenge the relevance of religion in modern life. As in every age, so today there are those who mock or decry the free exercise of religion. Some even blame religion for any number of the world’s ills. Admittedly, there have been times when atrocities have been committed in the name of religion. But living the Lord’s pure religion, which means striving to become a true disciple of Jesus Christ, is a way of life and a daily commitment that will provide divine guidance. As you practice your religion, you are exercising your faith. You are letting your faith show.</p>

Even if “everyone is doing it,” wrong is never right. Evil, error, and darkness will never be truth, even if popular.

As a medical doctor and cardiac surgeon, I had the responsibility of performing open-heart surgery on President Spencer W.

But I had no experience doing such a procedure on a 77-year-old patient in heart failure. I did not recommend the operation and so informed President Kimball and the First Presidency. But, in faith, President Kimball chose to have the operation, only because it was advised by the First Presidency. That shows how he sustained his leaders! And his decision made me tremble!</p>

Though I did not see or hear them with my physical senses, I felt their presence. Spiritually, I heard their pleadings. Their message was brief and clear: “Brother Nelson, we are not sealed to anyone! &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;Can you help us?&lt;/span&gt;” Soon thereafter, I learned that their mother had passed away, but their father and younger brother were still alive.&lt;/p&gt;

This time they were willing to meet with me.&lt;/p&gt;

I spoke of his daughters’ pleadings and told him I would be honored to perform sealing ordinances for his family. I also explained that it would take time and much effort on his and Shawn’s part to be ready and worthy to enter the temple, as neither of them had ever been endowed.&lt;/p&gt;

And when Jimmy and Shawn each accepted my offer, I was overjoyed! They worked diligently with their stake president, bishop, home teachers, and ward mission leader, as well as with young missionaries and a senior missionary couple. And then, not long ago, in the Payson Utah Temple, I had the profound privilege of sealing Ruth to Jimmy and their four children to them. Wendy and I wept as we participated in that sublime experience. Many hearts were healed that day!&lt;/p&gt;

They have become heroes to me. If I could have the wish of my heart, it would be that each man and young man in this Church would demonstrate the courage, strength, and humility of this father and son. They were willing to forgive and let go of old hurts and habits. They were willing to submit to guidance from their priesthood leaders so that the Atonement of Jesus Christ could purify and magnify them. Each was willing to become a man who worthily bears the priesthood “after the holiest order of God.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is a sacred trust to bear the priesthood, which is the mighty power and authority of God. Think of this: the priesthood conferred upon us is &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;the very same power &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;and authority&lt;/span&gt; through which God created this and numberless worlds, governs the heavens and the earth, and exalts His obedient children.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His eyes were on the music, and his fingers were on the keys. He began pressing the keys, but there was no sound. I whispered to Wendy, “He has no power.” I reasoned that something had stopped the flow of electrical power to that organ.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of Missouri’s infamous extermination order, issued at the onset of the grueling winter of 1838,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> she and other Saints were forced to flee the state that very winter. One evening, Eliza’s family spent the night in a small log cabin used by refugee Saints. Much of the chinking between the logs had been extracted and burned for firewood by those who preceded them, so there were holes between the logs large enough for a cat to crawl through. It was bitter cold, and their food was frozen solid.</p>

One of the sobering responsibilities a surgeon bears, on occasion, is to inform the family when a loved one passes away. In one hospital where I worked, a special room was built with padded walls where family members could receive such news. There, some people manifested their grief by banging their heads against those padded walls. How I longed to teach those individuals that death, though difficult for surviving loved ones, is a necessary part of our immortal existence. Death allows us to progress to the next world.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
