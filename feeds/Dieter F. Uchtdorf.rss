I am especially grateful for the solemn experience we had this morning, in which I learned again how the Lord is directing and guiding His church in these latter days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p2" pid="6DqHwjRdNk6d6vMRKnCLhA" hash="BnoU_g">A few days ago, my profession as a B-747 captain took me home on a flight from Dallas, Texas, to Frankfurt, Germany. It was a moonless night over the North Atlantic, and myriads of stars covered the sky. As I contemplated this awesome sight from the cockpit, my thoughts went to the many miracles I have seen in my life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p3" pid="gkjhnKFgREG_FyV3SIJO0A" hash="xAcO7w">Forty-five years ago, shortly after the horrors of the Second World War, at age eight I was baptized in Zwickau, Sachsen, in eastern Germany. This came about because a white-haired, courageous, and caring lady shared the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with my grandmother and parents, and they did not hesitate to accept the challenge. How I love them for that! In 1952 my family had to leave that part of my homeland, expecting never to see it again. We went to Frankfurt, where I was ordained a deacon and taught by tough but loving leaders to appreciate the value of work and service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p4" pid="T6MSQ-aAJ0ivkEdFrsk9iw" hash="qTCJzg">At the same time, in the heart of western Germany, another marvelous lady, recently widowed, still in her thirties, was terrified by the difficulties of the future. She had two young daughters and felt left alone in a country without hope. Right then two young missionaries rang the doorbell and brought the message of light, truth, and hope.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p5" pid="6uoIVWKz6Ei_aOHOQook9w" hash="QcnVJg">I give thanks eternally to those diligent American missionaries and most of all to Sister Carmen Reich—who became my mother-in-law—for her faith, strength, and willingness to listen to the still, small voice. My life has been very different because of the miraculous insight of these great individuals.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p6" pid="XMygHTngvEK0uVHsZ2fAyQ" hash="webdZA">In those years, many Saints left Europe to go to Zion. But then the Brethren taught us that Zion could be anywhere around the globe if we were willing to establish it. The Saints had faith and stayed, and Zion increased in beauty and holiness. Stakes were organized and strengthened. Nevertheless, Germany still had two completely different political systems divided by concrete-walled boundaries.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p7" pid="1YWyCfibpkSu0O8J3blocw" hash="0NH5kg">My eternal partner, my wife, Harriet, encouraged me never to lose hope that someday there would be one Germany again. How grateful I am for her, her love and partnership, and for our family.</p>

It was a prophetic promise which required modern-day miracles. And the miracles occurred.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p9" pid="02verPd47EuuRfZc4V8RDA" hash="sVAKcA">In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell; and this week, four years ago, Germany was reunited. The borders were enlarged, and Zion was enabled to put on her beautiful garments—there are now two temples in Germany, five temples in Europe, and more to come. The kingdom of God is expanding rapidly into the eastern parts of Europe and even moving far beyond geographic or political boundaries of yesterday. Missionaries are now serving at places most of us have to look up in dictionaries or cannot find easily on maps.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p10" pid="WhJq8C4kQk6x8wQ_XY36Og" hash="nsHFZQ">I am grateful for the Saints in Europe, for their strong testimonies, which are visible in the conduct of their everyday lives. Their faith has given me comfort and security. Their examples have helped me to find and keep the right direction in days of challenge and questioning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p11" pid="mgMR1SOhQ0GaHjHCTPJEdQ" hash="UhmsnA">That dark night over the North Atlantic, safely directing our big jet to its destination, we had to be extremely careful and precise in creating the navigation basis by entering the geographic coordinates into the navigation reference system. It had to be true and valid because it was the foundation for all future decisions. In 1979, a flight started in New Zealand on wrong coordinates and crashed into Mount Erebus at the South Pole.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p12" pid="PKA35BkLrEKywyc8HzQfPQ" hash="6ZhkrA">The gospel of Jesus Christ is the <span class="emphasis">only true and valid basis</span> for our lives. If we enter it into our system—into “all [our] heart, might, mind and strength” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:2</a>)—we will know how to choose the right and to whom to listen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p13" pid="Y4N4pvd2j02nhUb9m_0AFA" hash="A9gnLg">On long-range flights, the shortwave radio frequencies are often crowded and static distorts the messages. The same is true for our lives. Everybody wants to get <span class="emphasis">their</span> message across. We have to train and condition ourselves to hear the still, small voice, never to be distracted or stop listening because of too much static on that sacred frequency. This can best be done by internalizing and acting according to the moral and ethical standards we receive from the scriptures and the living prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p14" pid="Pi1IX-lSjE2wBJnEsYOu4A" hash="7nWZqw">From the Prophet Joseph Smith to President Howard W. Hunter, we are receiving updated sacred guidance according to our needs and readiness. The general conference messages by our prophets, seers, and revelators are given to us by the Lord in his own time, in his own way, and for a very special purpose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/the-only-true-and-valid-basis.p15" pid="Xoh9zIw-A0-t-jgE37T3_g" hash="30N9rg">Jesus Christ, the Son of God, made the miracle of forgiveness and redemption possible. This is truly the Church of Jesus Christ; it proclaims a gospel of joy, hope, courage, truth, love, and miracles. This I bear humble witness of in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

This conference is being broadcast to 68 countries and translated into 55 languages. This is truly a global Church, with members spread across the nations of the earth. We are all children of a living and loving God, our Heavenly Father. I express my love to you, my dear brothers and sisters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p2" pid="7dWMzcjzQ0-5_awgAag7Aw" hash="Eazy3Q">Just three months ago we joined under the inspired leadership of President Gordon B. Hinckley in the dedication of the rebuilt Nauvoo Temple. It brought us back to the Prophet Joseph and renewed our memories of the early Saints; their sacrifices, sorrows, and tears; but also their courage, faith, and trust in the Lord. I have no ancestors among the 19th-century pioneers. However, since the first days of my Church membership, I have felt a close kinship to those early pioneers who crossed the plains. They are my spiritual ancestry, as they are for each and every member of the Church, regardless of nationality, language, or culture. They have established not only a safe place in the West but also a spiritual foundation for the building of the kingdom of God in all the nations of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p3" pid="TxIL-hsA1kuZqUe3Byrvug" hash="OH5ZBQ">As the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is now being embraced around the world, we are all pioneers in our own sphere and circumstance. It was in the turmoil of post–World War II Germany when my family first learned about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. George Albert Smith was the President then. I was only a young child, and we had lost all material belongings twice within only seven years. We were refugees with an uncertain future. However, during those same seven years, we gained more than any amount of money could ever buy. We found a supernal refuge, a place of defense from despair—the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church, led by a true and living prophet.</p>

McKay was the prophet during my teenage years. I seemed to know him personally: I could feel his love, kindness, and dignity; he gave me confidence and courage in my young life. Even though I grew up thousands of miles away in Europe, I felt he trusted me, and I did not want to disappoint him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p8" pid="hIOTwpLM8k6NGreZjXGKqw" hash="FZUPMw">Another source of strength was a letter written by the Apostle Paul while he was in prison, addressed to Timothy, his most trusted assistant and friend. He wrote:</p>

Yet how many of us permit our fears to take control in this time of international tension, economical and political uncertainties, and personal challenges.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p12" pid="-CATY5AYjk6GzXULI5jD4Q" hash="5cCqqQ">God is speaking to us in a consistent voice. God will deal with all the human family equally. We might be in a large ward or a small branch, our climate or vegetation may differ, the cultural background and language might vary, and the color of our skin could be totally different. But the universal power and blessings of the restored gospel are available to all, irrespective of culture, nationality, political system, tradition, language, economic environment, or education.</p>

God speaks to us through them. They are profoundly aware of the different circumstances we members are living in. They are in this world, but not of this world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p14" pid="QtE1TcB1FE6NhckSQjNgYQ" hash="wGW8bA">We have a living prophet on the face of the earth, even President Gordon B. Hinckley. He knows our challenges and fears. He has inspired answers. A year ago he taught us in his optimistic and clear way. He said:</p>

Our strength comes of obedience to the commandments of God” (“The Times in Which We Live,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2001, 74; <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Jan. 2002, 86).</p>

As the Book of Mormon confirms, “For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:3</a>).</p>

He said, “I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:10</a>).</p>

Be assured, there is balm in Gilead. Let us listen to the prophets of our days as they help us to focus on the things that are central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children. The Lord knows us, He loves us, He wants us to succeed, and He encourages us by saying: “And see that all … things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that [men or women] should run faster than [they have] strength. … [But] it is expedient that [they] should be diligent” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.27" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:27</a>).</p>

Or are we just leisurely strolling along? Are we using our time, talents, and means wisely? Are we focused on the things which matter most? Are we following the inspired counsel of the prophets?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p21" pid="O7R10nbr8EyF4Wwq43LT9w" hash="k4K4uw">One example of great importance for humanity is strengthening our own families. The principle of family home evening was given to us in 1915. President McKay reminded parents again in 1964 that “no other success can compensate for failure in the home” (quoted from J. E. McCulloch, <span class="emphasis">Home: The Savior of Civilization</span> [1924], 42; in Conference Report, Apr. 1964, 5). In 1995 the prophets of our day called upon all the world to strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society. And only three years ago the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles lovingly stated: “We counsel parents and children to give highest priority to family prayer, family home evening, gospel study and instruction, and wholesome family activities. However worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may be, they must not be permitted to displace the divinely appointed duties that only parents and families can adequately perform” (“News of the Church,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> June 1999, 80; “Letter from the First Presidency,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Dec. 1999, 1).</p>

Let us listen and be instructed and edified by those who hold all the keys of the kingdom. And as we attend this conference, may our hearts be changed, that there will be a great desire to do good (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/19.33" class="scriptureRef">Alma 19:33</a>), and that we will be pioneers in building a spiritual foundation that will establish the Church in our part of the world. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Hinckley extended the call to me to become an Apostle and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, I left my busy office to share this totally unexpected news with my beloved Harriet. At this most important time in our lives, we have cherished the quiet sacredness of our home as a place of refuge and of defense. How grateful I am for my wife, for the loving comfort and strong support she has been throughout my life. Next to the gift of life itself and the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, Harriet is the greatest blessing which has come into my life. I wish to express my deep love and appreciation to our children and our grandchildren for their prayers and love, but most of all for their example. Our children and grandchildren live in Germany and are building the kingdom of God in our homeland. The joys of the gospel of Jesus Christ and its eternal blessings bridge over the distance of many thousands of miles and bring happiness and comfort into our lives.</p>

Some days after World War II, my grandmother was standing in line for food when an elderly single sister with no family of her own invited her to sacrament meeting in Zwickau, East Germany. My grandmother and my parents accepted the invitation. They went to church, felt the Spirit, were uplifted by the kindness of the members, and were edified by the hymns of the Restoration. My grandmother, my parents, and my three siblings were all baptized. I had to wait two years because I was only six. How grateful I am for a spiritually sensitive grandmother, teachable parents, and a wise, white-haired, elderly single sister who had the sweet boldness to reach out and follow the Savior’s example by inviting us to “come and see” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.39" class="scriptureRef">John 1:39</a>).

All of these buildings had one important factor in common: the Spirit of God was present; the love of the Savior could be felt as we assembled as a branch or ward family.</p>

It was a wonderful feeling of accomplishment to have a responsibility and to be part of this great work.</p>

By the universal power of the Holy Ghost, I felt in my heart and in my mind that it was true, that Joseph Smith saw God and Jesus Christ and heard Their voices. The Spirit of God comforted my soul at this young age with an assurance of the reality of this sacred moment that resulted in the beginning of a worldwide movement destined to “roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 65:2</a>).

First I exercised simple faith in their testimonies, and then I received the divine witness of the Spirit to my mind and to my heart. I count Joseph Smith among those whose testimony of Christ helped me to develop my own testimony of the Savior. Before I recognized the tutoring of the Spirit testifying to me that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, my youthful heart felt that he was a friend of God and would therefore, quite naturally, also be a friend of mine. I knew I could trust Joseph Smith.</p>

Prophets and apostles throughout the history of mankind have had divine manifestations similar to Joseph’s. Moses saw God face-to-face and learned that he was a son of God “in the similitude of [His] Only Begotten” (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.1-6" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:1–6</a>). The Apostle Paul testified that the resurrected Jesus Christ appeared to him on the road to Damascus and made Paul one of His great missionaries (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/26.9-23" class="scriptureRef">Acts 26:9–23</a>). Hearing Paul’s witness of his heavenly vision during the trial at Caesarea, the powerful King Agrippa admitted, “Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/26.28" class="scriptureRef">Acts 26:28</a>).</p>

Joseph Smith had actually seen a vision. He knew it, and he knew that God knew it, and he could not deny it. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.25" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:25</a>.)</p>

They asked about the many switches, instruments, systems, and procedures and how all this technical equipment would help such a huge and beautiful airplane fly.</p>

At this point of my story, my wife and children would kindly interrupt and say with a twinkling in their eyes, “Pilots are born with a great measure of natural humility!”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p5" pid="Kn0NGBD0CkOq_3R7Hu3W0Q" hash="F5tkpA">In recent years, I have often contemplated that being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints invites us to ask similar questions. What are the basics, the fundamental principles of our membership in the kingdom of God on earth? After all is said and done, what will really carry us at times of greatest need to our desired eternal destination?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p6" pid="Whi1i9hXJESn4qlPyDqCVg" hash="_vDovA">The Church, with all its organizational structure and programs, offers many important activities for its members aimed at helping families and individuals to serve God and each other. Sometimes, however, it can appear that these programs and activities are closer to the center of our heart and soul than the core doctrines and principles of the gospel. Procedures, programs, policies, and patterns of organization are helpful for our spiritual progress here on earth, but let’s not forget that they are subject to change.</p>

Living according to the basic gospel principles will bring power, strength, and spiritual self-reliance into the lives of all Latter-day Saints.</p>

We need this source of power in our lives. God works by power, but this power is usually exercised in response to our faith. “Faith without works is dead” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/2.20" class="scriptureRef">James 2:20</a>). God works according to the faith of His children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p9" pid="JMZd2v4r1E2OFu6YP5n0vQ" hash="CWxihg">The Prophet Joseph Smith explained, “I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves” (quoted by John Taylor, in “The Organization of the Church,” <span class="emphasis">Millennial Star,</span> Nov. 15, 1851, 339). To me, this teaching is beautifully straightforward. As we strive to understand, internalize, and live correct gospel principles, we will become more spiritually self-reliant. The principle of spiritual self-reliance grows out of a fundamental doctrine of the Church that God has granted us—agency. I believe that moral agency is one of the greatest gifts of God unto His children, next to life itself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p10" pid="dvdhebCioUWz88-ZiM3zEw" hash="mTPZmA">When I study and ponder moral agency and its eternal consequences, I realize that we are truly spirit children of God and therefore should act accordingly. This understanding also reminds me that as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we are part of a great worldwide family of Saints.</p>

There is the basic unit program with a very simple organizational structure and fewer meetings. We also have large wards with great organizational resources to serve one another. All are established within the inspired programs of the Church to help members “come unto Christ, and be perfected in him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:32</a>).</p>

I testify as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ that He lives, that the gospel is true, and that it offers the answers to all personal and collective challenges the children of God have on this earth today.</p>

In some parts of Europe, the Church has been present for many years, even since 1837. There is a great heritage of faithful members in Europe. Currently, we have more than 400,000 members in Europe. As we look at all the generations who have emigrated from Europe to America during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, that total number could easily be multiplied a few times.</p>

Many reasons can be named: to escape persecution, to help build the Church in America, to improve their economic circumstances, the desire to be close to a temple, and many more.</p>

But the strength that comes from several faithful generations of Church members is now becoming more apparent. We see more young men and women and more senior couples serve missions for the Lord; we see more temple marriages; we see more confidence and courage by the members to share the restored gospel. Among the peoples of Europe and many other parts of the world, there is a spiritual vacuum of Christ’s true teachings. This vacuum must, can, and will be filled with the message of the restored gospel as our wonderful members live and proclaim this gospel with greater courage and faith.</p>

I spoke with a mission president serving in his homeland of Russia who has been a member for only seven years. He told me, “The same month I was baptized I was called as a branch president.” Did he feel overwhelmed at times? Absolutely! Did he try to implement the full range of Church programs? Fortunately not! How did he grow so strong in such a small congregation, in such a short time? He explained, “I knew with all my soul the Church was true. The doctrine of the gospel filled my mind and my heart. As we joined the Church, we felt part of a family. We felt warmth, trust, and love. We were only few, but we all tried to follow the Savior.”</p>

It was not the organization that had attracted him, but the light of the gospel, and this light strengthened those good members.</p>

However, the members may have a perfect testimony of the truth in their hearts. As the members will stay in their countries and build the Church, despite economic challenges and hardships, future generations will be grateful to those courageous modern-day pioneers. They abide by the loving invitation of the First Presidency given in 1999:</p>

Therefore, we wish to reiterate the long-standing counsel to members of the Church to remain in their homelands rather than immigrate to the United States. …</p>

We have to be careful that the center of our testimony is not located in the social dimension of the Church community or the wonderful activities, programs, and organizations of our wards and stakes. All of these things are important and valuable to have—but they are not enough. Even friendship is not enough.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p22" pid="_ZRMtREHakGoj0-G_zSr_Q" hash="sfRDtg">We recognize that we are living in a time of turmoil, disaster, and war. We and many others feel strongly the great need for a “defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 115:6</a>). How do we find such a place of safety? The prophet of God, even President Hinckley, has taught: “Our safety lies in the virtue of our lives. Our strength lies in our righteousness” (“Till We Meet Again,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Jan. 2002, 105; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2001, 90).</p>

This was also the beginning of the ministry of the Twelve Apostles, and I suspect that they had a feeling of inadequacy, as I deeply have, being one who has also been called to this sacred work. May I suggest that the Savior Himself teaches us here a lesson about core doctrine and priorities in life. Individually, we need to first “follow Him,” and as we do this, the Savior will bless us beyond our own capacity to become what He wants us to be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p24" pid="ue3AZYZK-kuItWDUPUCiqw" hash="Yuec6g">To follow Christ is to become more like Him. It is to learn from His character. As spirit children of our Heavenly Father, we do have the potential to incorporate Christlike attributes into our life and character. The Savior invites us to learn His gospel by living His teachings. To follow Him is to apply correct principles and then witness for ourselves the blessings that follow. This process is very complex and very simple at the same time. Ancient and modern prophets described it with three words: “Keep the commandments”—nothing more, nothing less.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p25" pid="n2qvQ_Vs80GORORcEMQwWw" hash="t_VdLQ">Developing Christlike attributes in our lives is not an easy task, especially when we move away from generalities and abstractions and begin to deal with real life. The test comes in practicing what we proclaim. The reality check comes when Christlike attributes need to become visible in our lives—as husband or wife, as father or mother, as son or daughter, in our friendships, in our employment, in our business, and in our recreation. We can recognize our growth, as can those around us, as we gradually increase our capacity to “act in all holiness before [Him]” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 43:9</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p26" pid="00HkcGlJRUufolXFFTkjew" hash="24nzNw">The scriptures describe a number of Christlike attributes we need to develop during the course of our lives. They include knowledge and humility, charity and love, obedience and diligence, faith and hope. These personal character qualities stand independent of the organizational status of our Church unit, our economic circumstances, our family situation, culture, race, or language. Christlike attributes are gifts from God. They cannot be developed without His help. The one help we all need is given to us freely through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Having faith in Jesus Christ and in His Atonement means relying completely on Him—trusting in His infinite power, intelligence, and love. Christlike attributes come into our lives as we exercise our agency righteously. Faith in Jesus Christ leads to action. When we have faith in Christ, we trust the Lord enough to follow His commandments—even when we do not completely understand the reasons for them. In seeking to become more like the Savior, we need to reevaluate our lives regularly and rely, through the path of true repentance, upon the merits of Jesus Christ and the blessings of His Atonement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p27" pid="BlLXuCz7wEGZC3mubQk-EQ" hash="KBGFMQ">Developing Christlike attributes can be a painful process. We need to be ready to accept direction and correction from the Lord and His servants. This worldwide conference with its music and spoken word offers spiritual power, direction, and blessings “from on high” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 43:16</a>). It is a time when the voice of personal inspiration and revelation will bring peace to our souls and will teach us how to become more Christlike. This voice will be as sweet as the voice of a dear friend, and it will fill our souls when our hearts are sufficiently contrite.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p28" pid="7K6gCHoxR0-UQfONGZRQ_w" hash="3QzzHQ">By becoming more like the Savior, we will grow in our ability to “abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/15.13" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 15:13</a>). We will “lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 25:10</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/christlike-attributes-the-wind-beneath-our-wings.p29" pid="If2JtrZjaUG2zG-ubl_NAQ" hash="Dq8XyQ">This leads me back to my aerodynamic analogy from the beginning. I spoke of focusing on the basics. Christlike attributes are the basics. They are the fundamental principles that will create “the wind beneath our wings.” As we develop Christlike attributes in our own lives, step-by-step, they will “bear [us] up as on eagles’ wings” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:18</a>). Our faith in Jesus Christ will provide power and a strong forward thrust; our unwavering and active hope will provide a powerful upward lift. Both faith and hope will carry us across oceans of temptations, over mountains of afflictions, and bring us safely back to our eternal home and destination.</p>

The priesthood you bear is a wonderful force for good. You live in a time of great challenges and opportunities. As spirit sons of heavenly parents, you are free to make the right choices. This requires hard work, self-discipline, and an optimistic outlook, which will bring joy and freedom into your life now and in the future.</p>

When I was 11 years old, my family had to leave East Germany and begin a new life in West Germany overnight. Until my father could get back into his original profession as a government employee, my parents operated a small laundry business in our little town. I became the laundry delivery boy. To be able to do that effectively, I needed a bicycle to pull the heavy laundry cart. I had always dreamed of owning a nice, sleek, shiny, sporty red bicycle. But there had never been enough money to fulfill this dream. What I got instead was a heavy, ugly, black, sturdy workhorse of a bicycle. I delivered laundry on that bike before and after school for quite a few years. Most of the time, I was not overly excited about the bike, the cart, or my job. Sometimes the cart seemed so heavy and the work so tiring that I thought my lungs would burst, and I often had to stop to catch my breath. Nevertheless, I did my part because I knew we desperately needed the income as a family, and it was my way to contribute.</p>

The doctors were slightly concerned by the results and did some additional medical tests. Then they announced, “You have scars on your lung which are an indication of a lung disease in your early teenage years, but obviously you are fine now.” The doctors wondered what kind of treatment I had gone through to heal the disease. Until the day of that examination I had never known that I had any kind of lung disease. Then it became clear to me that my regular exercise in fresh air as a laundry boy had been a key factor in my healing from this illness. Without the extra effort of pedaling that heavy bicycle day in and day out, pulling the laundry cart up and down the streets of our town, I might never have become a jet fighter pilot and later a 747 airline captain.</p>

We do not know what lies ahead. We live in a time of uncertainty. We are surrounded by challenges on all sides. Occasionally discouragement may sneak into our day; frustration may invite itself into our thinking; doubt might enter about the value of our work. In these dark moments Satan whispers in our ears that we will never be able to succeed, that the price isn’t worth the effort, and that our small part will never make a difference. He, the father of all lies, will try to prevent us from seeing the end from the beginning.</p>

Your Heavenly Father wants your life to be joyful and to lead you back into His presence. The decisions you make now will determine much of what will follow during your life and throughout eternity” (<span class="emphasis">For the Strength of Youth</span> [2001], 2). “You have a responsibility to learn what Heavenly Father wants you to do and then to do your best to follow His will” (<span class="emphasis">Aaronic Priesthood: Fulfilling Our Duty to God</span> [2001], 4).</p>

The pamphlet itself has little material value, perhaps just a few cents. But the doctrine and principles it presents are an invaluable treasure. You young men who are already 18 or older, if you don’t have this booklet anymore, make sure to get one, keep it, and use it. This little booklet is a gem for any age group. It contains standards which are sacred symbols representing our membership in the Church.</p>

The temple is the binding link between generations, in this life and for eternity.

These temples are sacred structures in which eternal questions are answered, truths are taught, and ordinances performed so that we can live with an understanding of our divine inheritance as children of God and with an awareness of our potential as eternal beings. The house of the Lord helps you to see the end from the beginning.</p>

Our testimony motivates us to live righteously, and righteous living will cause our testimony to grow stronger.</p>

Satan wouldn’t mind if we declared the message of our faith and gospel doctrine as negotiable according to circumstances. Our firm conviction of gospel truth is an anchor in our lives; it is steady and reliable as the North Star. A testimony is very personal and may be a little different for each of us, because everyone is a unique person. However, a testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ will always include these clear and simple truths:</p>

Through the Atonement all men, women, and children are unconditionally redeemed from physical death, and all will be redeemed from their own sins on the condition of accepting and obeying the gospel of Jesus Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.17-25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:17–25</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.40-42,50-53" class="scriptureRef">76:40–42, 50–53</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.62" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:62</a>).</p>

This belief distinguishes Latter-day Saints from many other Christian denominations that teach that salvation is given to all who simply believe and confess that Jesus is the Christ. The Lord clearly declared, “If you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>).</p>

Viewed from this perspective, enduring to the end is exalting and glorious, not grim and gloomy. This is a joyful religion, one of hope, strength, and deliverance. “Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.25" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 2:25</a>).</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="117"></span>My dear sisters, I am grateful for this, my first opportunity to speak to the women of the Church gathered together in all parts of the world. We are especially honored today with the presence of President Monson and President Eyring. The choir has touched our hearts. We have been inspired by the messages of Sister Thompson, Sister Allred, and Sister Beck.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/happiness-your-heritage.p2" pid="Od2IGoNOxUSP3ILVmSjV4A" hash="uKDDEg">Since learning that I would be with you today, I have thought about the many women who have shaped my life: my wonderful wife, Harriet; my mother; my mother-in-law; my sister; my daughter; my daughter-in-law; and many friends. All my life I have been surrounded by women who inspired, taught, and encouraged me. I am who I am today in large part because of these singular women. Each time I meet with the sisters of the Church, I sense that I am in the midst of similar remarkable souls. I am grateful to be here, grateful for your talents, compassion, and service. Most of all, I am grateful for who you are: treasured daughters of our Heavenly Father with infinite worth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/happiness-your-heritage.p3" pid="cGHAzygjtkisNlW1Y7tx2g" hash="amW8xg">I’m sure it comes as no surprise, but the differences between men and women can often be quite striking—physically and mentally, as well as emotionally. One of the best ways I can think of to illustrate this is in the way my wife and I cook a meal.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/happiness-your-heritage.p4" pid="Ay7EHg0pFUuRvxHqUnNlYQ" hash="d74IeQ">When Harriet prepares a meal, it’s a masterpiece. Her cuisine is as wide-ranging as the world, and she frequently prepares dishes from countries we have visited. The presentation of the food is awe inspiring. In fact, it often looks so beautiful that it seems a crime to eat it. It’s as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the sense of taste.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/happiness-your-heritage.p5" pid="4UiSsaoLukadrzWpJ_N53g" hash="3QxsAw">But sure enough, no matter how perfect everything is, looks, and tastes, Harriet will apologize for something she thinks is imperfect. “I’m afraid I used a touch too much ginger,” she will say, or, “Next time, I think it would be better if I used a little more curry and one additional bay leaf.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/happiness-your-heritage.p6" pid="4fHccG_gR0ynvZnCOafg1Q" hash="Q2RBbg">Let me contrast that with the way I cook. For the purpose of this talk, I asked Harriet to tell me what I cook best.</p>

I have a specialty dish called <span class="emphasis">Knusperchen.</span> The name may sound like a delicacy you might find at an exclusive restaurant. Let me share with you how to make it. You cut French bread into small slices and toast them twice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/happiness-your-heritage.p10" pid="3bz1qqGo5E2qlLjIjqv-Kg" hash="AW_ftA">That is the recipe!</p>

She bundled us up and somehow managed to get us on one of the last refugee trains heading west. Traveling during that time was dangerous. Everywhere we went, the sound of explosions, the stressed faces, and ever-present hunger reminded us that we were in a war zone.</p>

That she was terrified, I have no doubt. I am certain it crossed her mind that if she did not find this train, she might never see her children again. I know with certainty: her faith overcame her fear, and her hope overcame her despair. She was not a woman who would sit and bemoan tragedy. She moved. She put her faith and hope into action.</p>

No matter how bleak the chapter of our lives may look today, because of the life and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, we may hope and be assured that the ending of the book <span class="pageBreak" page-number="23"></span>of our lives will exceed our grandest expectations. “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span></p>

They uphold us through trials, temptations, and sorrow. Everyone has experienced discouragement and difficulty. Indeed, there are times when the darkness may seem unbearable.

Because God has been faithful and kept His promises in the past, we can hope with confidence that God will keep His promises to us in the present and in the future. In times of distress, we can hold tightly to the hope that things will “work together for [our] good”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_27">27</span> as we follow the counsel of God’s prophets. This type of hope in God, His goodness, and His power refreshes us with courage during difficult challenges and gives strength to those who feel threatened by enclosing walls of fear, doubt, and despair.</p>

None were professional movers, and the task of getting that gravity-friendly instrument through the chapel and into the cultural hall seemed nearly impossible. Everybody knew that this task required not only physical strength but also careful coordination. There were plenty of ideas, but not one could keep the piano balanced correctly. They repositioned the brethren by strength, height, and age over and over again—nothing worked.</p>

          <span class="pageBreak" page-number="54"></span>Although it may seem simple, lifting where we stand is a principle of power. Most of the priesthood bearers I know understand and live by this principle. They are eager to roll up their sleeves and go to work, whatever that work might be.

John was a convert to the Church who left his home in England and traveled to the Salt Lake Valley as part of a handcart company. He built a home for his family in a small town a valley away from Salt Lake City. John was an accomplished stonecutter and, because of this skill, was asked to work on the Salt Lake Temple.</p>

With limited medical resources, the only option was to amputate the broken leg. So John’s family and friends strapped him onto a door and, with a bucksaw, cut off his leg a few inches from the knee.</p>

Once John could sit up in bed, he began carving a wooden leg with an ingenious joint that served as an ankle to an artificial foot. Walking on this device was extremely painful, but John did not give up, building up his endurance until he could make the 22-mile (35-km) journey to the Salt Lake Temple each week, where he continued his work.</p>

President Moyle’s service in these callings was honorable, but his grandfather John’s service, though somewhat less <span class="pageBreak" page-number="56"></span>public, is just as pleasing to the Lord. John’s character, his legacy of sacrifice, serves as a banner of faithfulness and an ensign of duty to his family and to the Church.

During that time, I have searched for a story that would illustrate what I want to say. I looked for a story about farming. I looked for a story about animals. In honor of Elder Scott, I looked for a story about nuclear engineering, and in honor of President Monson, one about raising pigeons.</p>

Nehemiah was an Israelite who lived in exile in Babylon and served as cupbearer to the king. One day the king asked Nehemiah why he seemed so sad. Nehemiah replied, “Why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ [graves], lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

However, not everyone was happy with this plan.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="75"></span>Today is the day the Christian world traditionally calls Palm Sunday. You will remember that it was on that Sunday nearly 2,000 years ago that Jesus Christ entered the city of Jerusalem during the final week of His mortal life.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> In fulfillment of Zechariah’s ancient prophecy,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> He rode in on a donkey, and as He did so, a great multitude came out to greet the Master and carpeted the path before Him with palm leaves, flowering branches, and even their own garments. As He approached, they cried, “Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> and “Hosanna to the Son of David.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

But the Savior understood that many of the shouts of praise and acclamation would be temporary. He knew that soon He would ascend to the Mount of Olives and there, alone in Gethsemane, take upon Himself the sins of the world.</p>

The multitudes in Jerusalem may have seen Him as a great king who would give them freedom from political oppression. But in reality He gave much more than that. He gave us His gospel, a pearl beyond price, the grand key of knowledge that, once understood and applied, unlocks a life of happiness, peace, and fulfillment.</p>

People run from one new idea to the next, hoping to find something that will answer the burning questions of their souls. They attend seminars and buy books, CDs, and other products. They get caught up in the excitement of looking for something new. But inevitably, the flame of each new theory fades, only to be replaced by another “new and improved” solution that promises to do what the others before could not.</p>

The gospel is not a secret. It is not complicated or hidden. It can unlock the door to true happiness. It is not someone’s theory or proposition. It does not come from man at all. It springs from the pure and everlasting waters of the Creator of the universe, who knows truths we cannot even begin to comprehend. And with that knowledge, He has given us the gospel—a divine gift, the ultimate formula for happiness and success.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="21"></span>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is continually growing and becoming better known throughout the world. Although there will always be those who stereotype the Church and its members in a negative way, most people think of us as honest, helpful, and hardworking. Some have images of clean-cut missionaries, loving families, and friendly neighbors who don’t smoke or drink. We might also be known as a people who attend church every Sunday for three hours, in a place where everyone is a brother or a sister, where the children sing songs about streams that talk, trees that produce popcorn, and children who want to become sunbeams.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-love-of-god.p2" pid="MOikXO8KUEWYoeFH_7tzSw" hash="dN9a6Q">Brothers and sisters, of all the things <span class="emphasis">we</span> want to be known for, are there attributes above all others that should define us as members of His Church, even as disciples of Jesus Christ? Since our last general conference six months ago, I have pondered this and similar questions. Today I would like to share with you some thoughts and impressions that have come as a result of that inquiry. The first question is:</p>

        <h3 class="title" pid="fCupjoN9vESlRydzTaThtA" hash="DONHTQ">How Do We Become True Disciples of Jesus Christ?</h3>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-love-of-god.p3" pid="01CZoABzX0G3mb2XogG9aA" hash="49sAFA">The Savior Himself provided the answer with this profound declaration: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> This is the essence of what it means to be a true disciple: those who receive Christ Jesus walk with Him.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-love-of-god.p4" pid="0HMHlj0tF0euogQwFCORZg" hash="C3CfAQ">But this may present a problem for some because there are so many “shoulds” and “should nots” that merely keeping track of them can be a challenge. Sometimes, well-meaning amplifications of divine principles—many coming from uninspired sources—complicate matters further, diluting the purity of divine truth with man-made addenda. One person’s good idea—something that may work for him or her—takes root and becomes an expectation. And gradually, eternal principles can get lost within the labyrinth of “good ideas.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-love-of-god.p5" pid="rVqevVpEFUyJ409oON72Ew" hash="32iqXA">This was one of the Savior’s criticisms of the religious “experts” of His day, whom He chastised for attending to the hundreds of minor details of the law while neglecting the weightier matters.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-love-of-god.p6" pid="OtIatcvA5EiglEGvWMwm8g" hash="-ikx3g">So how do we stay aligned with these weightier matters? Is there a constant compass that can help us prioritize our lives, thoughts, and actions?</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-love-of-god.p7" pid="ta3Tqugx40SHzpUJtFZBBw" hash="iYJgBQ">Once again the Savior revealed the way. When asked to name the greatest commandment, He did not hesitate. “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,” He said. “This is the first and great commandment.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Coupled with the second great commandment—to love our neighbor as ourselves<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span>—we have a compass that provides direction not only for our lives but also for the Lord’s Church on both sides of the veil.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-love-of-god.p8" pid="6r1_dSyVK0uqDwAtsUBmvw" hash="m2DzCQ">Because love is the great commandment, it ought to be at the <span class="emphasis">center</span> of all and everything we do in our own family, in our Church callings, and in our livelihood. Love is the healing balm that repairs rifts in personal and family relationships. It is the bond that unites families, communities, and nations. Love is the power that initiates friendship, tolerance, civility, and respect. It is the source that overcomes divisiveness and hate. Love is the fire that warms our lives with unparalleled joy and divine hope. Love should be our walk and our talk.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/the-love-of-god.p9" pid="ZaxhXu_3EE-g_XCiy1Axvg" hash="xsCxNw">When we truly understand what it means to love as Jesus Christ loves us, the confusion clears and our priorities align. Our walk as disciples of Christ becomes more joyful. Our lives take on new meaning. Our relationship with our Heavenly Father becomes more profound. Obedience becomes a joy rather than a burden.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="55"></span>In our travels visiting Church members throughout the world and by means of established priesthood channels, we receive firsthand feedback on the conditions and challenges of our members. For years many of our members have been affected by worldwide disasters, both natural and man-made. We also understand that families have had to tighten their belts and are concerned about enduring these challenging times.</p>

We love you, and we pray always for you. I have seen enough ups and downs throughout my life to know that winter will surely give way to the warmth and hope of a new spring. I am optimistic about the future. Brethren, for our part, we must remain steadfast in hope, work with all our strength, and trust in God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/10/two-principles-for-any-economy.p3" pid="wfJ017ql4kWoODpeabbhDg" hash="r5RDJg">Lately I have been thinking of a time in my life when the weight of worry and concern over an uncertain future seemed ever present. I was 11 years old and living with my family in the attic of a farmhouse near Frankfurt, Germany. We were refugees for the second time in a period of only a few years, and we were struggling to establish ourselves in a new place far away from our previous home. I could say that we were poor, but that would be an understatement. We all slept in one room that was so tiny there was scarcely space to walk around the beds. In the other small room, we had a few pieces of modest furniture and a stove that Mother used to cook meals on. To get from one room to the other, we had to pass through a storage area where the farmer kept his equipment and tools, along with assorted meats and sausages hanging from the rafters. The aroma always made me very hungry. We had no bathroom, but we did have an outhouse—down the stairs and some 50 feet (15 m) away, though it seemed much farther during wintertime.</p>

Of all the times of my youth, I believe this may have been the most discouraging.</p>

Even though I still remember the hurt and despair, I can see now what I was unable to see then: this was a period of great personal growth. During this time, our family bonded together. I watched and learned from my parents. I admired their determination and optimism. From them I learned that adversity, when confronted with faith, courage, and tenacity, could be overcome.</p>

I remember my father—a civil servant by education and experience—taking on several difficult jobs, among which were coal miner, uranium miner, mechanic, and truck driver. He left early in the morning and often returned late at night in order to support our family. My mother started a laundry and worked countless hours doing menial labor. She enlisted my sister and me in her business. With my bike I became the pickup and delivery service. It felt good to be able to help the family in a small way, and though I did not know it at the time, the physical labor turned out to be a blessing to my health as well.</p>

There is no sabbatical or retirement program from priesthood responsibilities—regardless of age or physical capacity. While the phrase “been there, done that” may work as an excuse to avoid skateboarding, decline the invitation for a motorbike ride, or bypass the spicy curry at the buffet, it is not an acceptable excuse for avoiding covenant responsibilities to consecrate our time, talents, and resources in the work of the kingdom of God.</p>

But in spite of limited options, I always felt an eagerness to learn. I remember one day, while I was out on my bike delivering laundry, I entered the home of a classmate of mine. In one of the rooms, two small desks were nestled against the wall. What a wonderful sight that was! How fortunate those children were to have desks of their own! I could imagine them sitting with open books studying their lessons and doing their homework. It seemed to me that having a desk of my own would be the most wonderful thing in the world.</p>

There I could finally sit at a desk—by myself—and drink in the information and knowledge that books provide. How I loved to read and learn! In those days I understood firsthand the words of an old saying: Education is not so much the filling of <span class="pageBreak" page-number="58"></span>a bucket as the lighting of a fire.</p>

Please encourage your families, your quorum members, everyone to learn and become better educated. If formal education is not available, do not allow that to prevent you from acquiring all the knowledge you can.

Her name was Harriet, and I think I fell in love with her from the first moment I saw her. Unfortunately, this beautiful young woman didn’t seem to feel the same about me. She had many young men who wanted to make her acquaintance, and I began to wonder if she would ever see me as anything but a friend. But I didn’t let that deter me. I figured out ways to be where she was. When I passed the sacrament, I made sure I was in the right position so that I would be the one to pass the sacrament to her.</p>

Harriet’s mother usually answered. In fact, she opened the kitchen window of their apartment on the fourth floor and asked what I wanted. I would ask if Harriet would like a ride to church on my bicycle. Harriet’s mother would say, “No, she will be coming later, but I will be happy to ride with you to church.” This wasn’t exactly what I had in mind, but how could I decline?</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="56"></span>In the 1960s, a professor at Stanford University began a modest experiment testing the willpower of four-year-old children. He placed before them a large marshmallow and then told them they could eat it right away or, if they waited for 15 minutes, they could have two marshmallows.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/continue-in-patience.p2" pid="WXXwEBbZBkKhB9k9-Nsdww" hash="QEXBXg">He then left the children alone and watched what happened behind a two-way mirror. Some of the children ate the marshmallow immediately; some could wait only a few minutes before giving in to temptation. Only 30 percent were able to wait.</p>

          <span class="pageBreak" page-number="57"></span>When I was 10 years old, my family became refugees in a new land. I had always been a good student in school—that is, until we arrived in West Germany. There, my educational experience was a significantly different one. The geography we studied in my school was new to me. The history we studied was also very different. Before, I had been learning Russian as a second language; now, it was English.

Some suggested that they hire a sculptor to make new hands, but others wanted to leave it as it was—a permanent reminder of the tragedy of war. Ultimately, the statue remained without hands. However, the people of the city added on the base of the statue of Jesus Christ a sign with these words: “You are my hands.”</p>

For example, scientists can look at the rings of trees and make educated guesses about climate and growing conditions hundreds and even thousands of years ago. One of the things we learn from studying the growth of trees is that during seasons when conditions are ideal, trees grow at a normal rate. However, during seasons when growing conditions are not ideal, trees slow down their growth and devote their energy to the basic elements necessary for survival.</p>

The most common cause of turbulence is a sudden change in air movement causing the aircraft to pitch, yaw, and roll. While planes are built to withstand far greater turbulence than anything you would encounter on a regular flight, it still may be disconcerting to passengers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/of-things-that-matter-most.p4" pid="g_eba3hr0kO9hxbOJ8C3Kw" hash="wKorLQ">What do you suppose pilots do when they encounter turbulence? A student pilot may think that increasing speed is a good strategy because it will get them through the turbulence faster. But that may be the wrong thing to do. Professional pilots understand that there is an optimum turbulence penetration speed that will minimize the negative effects of turbulence. And most of the time that would mean to reduce your speed. The same principle applies also to speed bumps on a road.</p>

It may seem logical when put in terms of trees or turbulence, but it’s surprising how easy it is to ignore this lesson when it comes to applying these principles in our own daily lives.

We all can think up a list of tasks that will overwhelm our schedules. Some might even think that their self-worth depends on the length of their to-do list. They flood the open spaces in their time with lists of meetings and minutia—even during times of stress and fatigue. Because they unnecessarily complicate their lives, they often feel increased frustration, diminished joy, and too little sense of meaning in their lives.</p>

Quietly focusing on daily personal prayer and scripture study, always aiming to be worthy of a current temple recommend—these will be some wise investments of our time and efforts to draw closer to our Heavenly Father. Let us heed the invitation in Psalms: “Be still, and know that I am God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

Since “no other success can compensate for failure”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> here, we must place high priority on our families. We build deep and loving family relationships by doing simple things together, like family dinner and family home evening and by just having fun together. In family relationships <span class="emphasis">love</span> is really spelled <span class="emphasis">t-i-m-e,</span> time. Taking time for each other is the key for harmony at home. We talk with, rather than about, each other. We learn from each other, and we appreciate our differences as well as our commonalities. We establish a divine bond with each other as we approach God together through family prayer, gospel study, and Sunday worship.</p>

We build this relationship one person at a time—by being sensitive to the needs of others, serving them, and giving of our time and talents. I was deeply impressed by one sister who was burdened with the challenges of age and illness but decided that although she couldn’t do much, she could listen. And so each week she watched for people who looked troubled or discouraged, and she spent time with them, listening. What a blessing she was in the lives of so many people.</p>

It may seem odd to think of having a relationship with ourselves, but we do. Some people can’t get along with themselves. They criticize and belittle themselves all day long until they begin to hate themselves. May I suggest that you reduce the rush and take a little extra time to get to know yourself better. Walk in nature, watch a sunrise, enjoy God’s creations, ponder the truths of the restored gospel, and find out what they mean for you personally. Learn to see yourself as Heavenly Father sees you—as His precious daughter or son with divine potential.</p>

At its core, pride is a sin of comparison, for though it usually begins with “Look how wonderful I am and what great things I have done,” it always seems to end with “Therefore, I am better than you.”</p>

It leads some to revel in their own perceived self-worth, accomplishments, talents, wealth, or position. They count these blessings as evidence of being “chosen,” “superior,” or “more righteous” than others. This is the sin of “Thank God I am more special than you.” At its core is the desire to be admired or envied. It is the sin of self-glorification.</p>

So instead, President Monson asked that those who offered prayers during the stake conference include Christal in their prayers. Surely the Lord and the family would understand.</p>

We tried not to be preachy or overbearing. My wife, Harriet, was always the best at finding something inspirational, uplifting, or humorous to share.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="120"></span>My dear sisters, what a joy it is to be with you today. I always look forward to this annual general Relief Society meeting and the excellent messages given here. Thank you, sisters. It is a precious honor for me to be assigned by President Thomas S. Monson to speak today and to add a few thoughts addressing the sisters of the Church.</p>

I marveled at the glory and beauty of God’s creation. And then I noticed, among all the glorious blooms, the tiniest flower. I knew the name of this flower because since I was a child I have had a tender connection to it. The flower is called forget-me-not.</p>

It does not attract immediate attention; it is easy to overlook among larger and more vibrant flowers; yet it is just as beautiful, with its rich color that mirrors that of the bluest skies—perhaps this is one reason why I like it so much.</p>

There is a German legend that just as God had finished naming all the plants, one was left unnamed. A tiny voice spoke out, “Forget me not, O Lord!” And God replied that this would be its name.</p>

To some, he appeals to their prideful tendencies, puffing them up and encouraging them to believe in the fantasy of their own self-importance and invincibility. He tells them they have transcended the ordinary and that because of ability, birthright, or social status, they are set apart from the common measure of all that surrounds them. He leads them to conclude that they are therefore not subject to anyone else’s rules and not to be bothered by anyone else’s problems.</p>

I was far away from my home, a young West German soldier, born in Czechoslovakia, who had grown up in East Germany and spoke English only with great difficulty. I clearly remember my journey to our training base in Texas. I was on a plane, sitting next to a passenger who spoke with a heavy Southern accent. I could scarcely understand a word he said. I actually wondered if I had been taught the wrong language all along. I was terrified by the thought that I had to compete for the coveted top spots in pilot training against students who were native English speakers.</p>

The members were in the process of building a small meetinghouse that would serve as a permanent place for the Church. Back in those days members provided much of the labor on new buildings.</p>

I knew that it didn’t matter to Heavenly Father where I was, where I ranked with others in my pilot training class, or what my calling in the Church was. What mattered to Him was that I was doing the best I could, that my heart was inclined toward Him, and that I was willing to help those around me.

				<span class="pageBreak" page-number="53"></span>Sixty-five years ago, shortly after World War II, I experienced firsthand the blessings of the welfare program of the Church. Even though I was a young child, I still remember the sweet taste of canned peaches with cooked wheat and the special smell of the donated clothing sent to the postwar German Saints by caring Church members from the United States. I will never forget and I will always cherish these acts of love and kindness to those of us who were in great need.</p>

While there is nothing wrong with experts, let’s face it: there will never be enough of them to solve all the problems. Instead, the Lord has placed His priesthood and its organization at our doorsteps in every nation where the Church is established. And, right by its side, He has placed the Relief Society.

It is your mission to open your eyes, use your priesthood, and go to work in the Lord’s way.</p>

There is no one-size-fits-all answer in Church welfare. It is a self-help program where individuals are responsible for personal self-reliance. Our resources include personal prayer, our own God-given talents and abilities, the assets available to us through our own families and extended family members, various community resources, and of course the caring support of priesthood quorums and the Relief Society.

I attended with my family the branch of the Church in Frankfurt, Germany. We were blessed with many wonderful people in our little branch. One was our branch president, Brother Landschulz. I admired him a great deal, even though he always seemed to be rather serious, very official, and most of the time dressed in a dark suit. I remember as a young man joking with my friends how old-fashioned our branch president appeared.</p>

My first thought was, “What did I do wrong?” My mind raced over the many things I might have done that could have inspired this branch-president-to-deacon talk.</p>

A sacred, divine Spirit filled my heart as he spoke. I could feel that this was the Savior’s Church. And I felt that the calling he had extended was inspired by the Holy Ghost. I remember walking out of that tiny classroom feeling quite a bit taller than before.</p>

The basic gospel principles need to be part of our life’s fabric, even if it means learning them over and over again. That doesn’t mean that this process should be rote or boring.

We had moved back to Frankfurt, Germany, and I had just received a promotion at work that would require a great deal of my time and attention. During this busy season of my life, Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin extended a call to me to serve as stake president.</p>

Although I felt humbled and honored by the call, I briefly wondered if I could accept it. But it was only a fleeting thought because I knew that Elder Wirthlin was called of God and that he was doing the Lord’s work. What could I do but accept?</p>

Nelson and President Thomas S. Monson came to our area. Their teaching was like the dew from heaven and an inspiration for us. I still have the notes I took during these training sessions. These Brethren gave us the <span class="emphasis">vision</span> of what it means to establish the kingdom of God by building personal testimonies and strengthening families. They helped us see how to apply gospel truth and principles to our specific circumstances and for our specific time. To put it another way, inspired leaders helped us to see the <span class="emphasis">why</span> of the gospel, and then we had to roll up our sleeves and go to work.</p>

Competing priorities began to arise, deflecting our focus from the vision shared by the Brethren. There <span class="pageBreak" page-number="60"></span>were many “good” things to do, but not all of them mattered most.</p>

Our activities, initiatives, and plans should be inspired by and grounded upon the <span class="emphasis">why</span> of our priesthood service and not by any flashy trend or interest of the moment. Otherwise, they can distract our efforts, dilute our energy, and get us caught up in our own hobbies, spiritual or temporal, that are not at the center of discipleship.</p>

We all depend on the Savior; none of us can be saved without Him. Christ’s Atonement is infinite and eternal. Forgiveness for <span class="emphasis">our</span> sins comes with conditions.

          <span class="pageBreak" page-number="57"></span>Many years ago a couple of fellow airline captains and I decided to fulfill a boyhood dream of restoring an antique airplane. Together we purchased a worn-down 1938 Piper Cub and started the work of returning it to its original form. The project was a labor of love. It had special meaning for me because I had learned to fly in a similar airplane when I was a young man.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/the-joy-of-the-priesthood.p7" pid="xADg7UubbUCnI-hfgxH4Xg" hash="3_Errw">This airplane was first built only 35 years after the Wright brothers made their famous first flight. Just thinking of that makes me feel very old.</p>

Each engine start was a moment of excitement and bravery.</p>

As a matter of fact, when there was a strong headwind, it seemed as though we were not moving at all. I remember flying together with my teenage son, Guido, above the autobahn in Germany, and sure enough, the cars below passed us comfortably!</p>

It was the perfect way to experience the wonder and beauty of flight. You could hear, feel, smell, taste, and see what flying was all about. The Wright brothers expressed it this way: “There is [nothing] equal to that which aviators enjoy while being carried through the air on great white wings.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

It was like taking a flight above and along memory lane because exactly 50 years before, almost to the day, I had completed my training as an air force fighter pilot.</p>

It showed me a more dynamic beauty of flying. It was like applying the existing laws of aerodynamics in a more perfect way. However, flying with the Blue Angels also quickly reminded me that being a jet fighter pilot is a young man’s game. To quote the Wright brothers again, “More than anything else the sensation [of flying] is one of perfect peace, mingled with an excitement that strains every nerve to the utmost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> In addition, flying with the Blue Angels suggested a totally different way of having “angels” round about you and bearing you up.</p>

In some obvious ways, they were very different, to say the least. And yet in other ways, they were very much the same.</p>

The borders were tightly controlled, but we had a map and knew of a time and a place where it might be safe to cross. I could sense my mother’s anxiety. She observed the area intensely to see if we were being followed. With each step, her legs and knees seemed to become weaker. I helped carry her heavy bag filled with food, vital documents, and family photos as we climbed up one last, long hill. Surely, she thought, we had passed the border by now. When she finally felt safe, we sat down and started to eat our picnic lunch. For the first time that day, I’m sure, she breathed more easily.</p>

I commend you fathers and grandfathers who have brought your sons and grandsons. I congratulate you young men who have chosen to be here today. This is the place for you to be. I hope you can feel the brotherhood that unites us, and I pray that here, among your brothers, you will find belonging, support, and friendship.</p>

Many of us have multiple titles, and each says something important about our identity. For example, some titles describe our roles in families, such as <span class="emphasis">son, brother, husband,</span> and <span class="emphasis">father.</span> Other titles describe our occupations in the world, such as <span class="emphasis">doctor, soldier,</span> or <span class="emphasis">craftsman.</span> And some describe our positions within the Church.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p7" pid="FngNPCg-o0mw3Z3H4wlX6Q" hash="A8Nj5Q">Today I would like to suggest four titles that I believe apply to all priesthood holders around the world—titles that may help us recognize our individual roles in God’s eternal plan and our potential as priesthood holders in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p9" pid="wE8fcEhPKUOvtFeHbmJRiQ" hash="mI54SA">One title that defines all of us in the most fundamental way is <span class="emphasis">son of Heavenly Father.</span> No matter what else we are or do in life, we must never forget that we are God’s literal spirit children. We were His children before we came to this world, and we will be His children forevermore. This basic truth should change the way we look at ourselves, our brothers and sisters, and life itself.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p10" pid="q6EkuCHj9EW87PpaT6F_IA" hash="LJw0bw">Unfortunately, none of us quite lives up to everything that this title implies, “for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p11" pid="DfHEHqUvzUGga-CVfj_Ekw" hash="EVU3OA">It can be discouraging at times to know what it means to be a son of God and yet come up short. The adversary likes to take advantage of these feelings. Satan would rather that you define yourself by your sins instead of your divine potential. Brethren, don’t listen to him.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p12" pid="R-yIn9nCxk-m44ZF01Sm-Q" hash="vKfNkw">We have all seen a toddler learn to walk. He takes a small step and totters. He falls. Do we scold such an attempt? Of course not. What father would punish a toddler for stumbling? We encourage, we applaud, and we praise because with every small step, the child is becoming more like his parents.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p13" pid="770HDBG8_0217vI3pI5B3g" hash="pdpQGA">Now, brethren, compared to the perfection of God, we mortals are scarcely more than awkward, faltering toddlers. But our loving Heavenly Father wants us to become more like Him, and, dear brethren, that should be our eternal goal too. God understands that we get there not in an instant but by taking one step at a time.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p14" pid="LqgjQTzOGUiI2Y6Vym9ykQ" hash="zSmZcA">I do not believe in a God who would set up rules and commandments only to wait for us to fail so He could punish us. I believe in a Heavenly Father who is loving and caring and who rejoices in our every effort to stand tall and walk toward Him. Even when we stumble, He urges us not to be discouraged—never to give up or flee our allotted field of service—but to take courage, find our faith, and keep trying.</p>

					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p17" pid="Otttho2O60ijiNxOXFUijQ" hash="zysCVg">And that leads us to the next title we all have in common: all who strive earnestly to follow the Christ are called His <span class="emphasis">disciples.</span> Although we recognize that none of us are perfect, we do not use that fact as an excuse to lower our expectations, to live beneath our privileges, to delay the day of our repentance, or to refuse to grow into better, more perfect, more refined followers of our Master and King.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p18" pid="tCxgepEnUUa9bcaJAO6FcA" hash="0AkwtA">Remember that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is built not for men and women who are perfect or unaffected by mortal temptations, but rather it is built for people exactly like you and me. And it is built upon the rock of our Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> through whose <span class="pageBreak" page-number="59"></span>Atonement we can be cleansed and become “fellowcitizens … of the household of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p19" pid="qmZ-spNmJUCncqtjnSyJEw" hash="qzWF7w">Without the Atonement of Jesus Christ, life would be a dead-end road without hope or future.

					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p20" pid="QD8LYAn7EUu-h1keYcu_6g" hash="_UQcKA">But while the Atonement is meant to help us all become more like Christ, it is not meant to make us all the same. Sometimes we confuse differences in personality with sin. We can even make the mistake of thinking that because someone is different from us, it must mean they are not pleasing to God. This line of thinking leads some to believe that the Church wants to create every member from a single mold—that each one should look, feel, think, and behave like every other. This would contradict the genius of God, who created every man different from his brother, every son different from his father. Even identical twins are not identical in their personalities and spiritual identities.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p21" pid="Qvg4T9EkvESIyBlRuvq_NA" hash="PKZ_CQ">It also contradicts the intent and purpose of the Church of Jesus Christ, which acknowledges and protects the moral agency—with all its far-reaching consequences—of each and every one of God’s children. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we are united in our testimony of the restored gospel and our commitment to keep God’s commandments. But we are diverse in our cultural, social, and political preferences.</p>

Along our metaphorical path from Bethlehem to Golgotha, we will have many opportunities to abandon our journey. At times it will seem that the path requires more than we had wished for. But as men of the priesthood, we must have the courage to follow our Redeemer, even when our cross seems too heavy to bear.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/four-titles.p24" pid="1ZoX9q_5WkewBWHQ5BHkIw" hash="ARTiEQ">With every step we take following the Son of God, we may be reminded that we are not perfect yet. But let us be steadfast and constant disciples. Let us not give up. Let us be true to our covenants. Let us never lose sight of our Advocate and Redeemer as we walk toward Him, one imperfect step after another.</p>

She had no hope of rescue, so she hardened herself to the horror of her reality. There was no light in her world, so she became resigned to the darkness. With a numbness that can come only from constant and unrelenting contact with evil, she accepted the fact that any moment might be her last.</p>

The joy and hope of the restored gospel penetrated her heart, and she accepted the invitation to be baptized. For the first time, light entered her life, and she saw a bright path before her. She left the darkness of her world and decided to attend school a great distance away from her abuser. At last she felt liberated from an environment of darkness and evil—free to enjoy the Savior’s sweet peace and miraculous healing.</p>

But she didn’t. She resisted the temptation to spread the darkness, refusing to lash out in anger, hurt, or cynicism. Instead, she held fast to the hope that with God’s help she could be healed. She chose to radiate light and devote her life to helping others. This decision enabled her to leave the past behind and to step into a glorious, bright future.</p>

In the coming week the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles will meet with all the General Authorities and general auxiliary leaders, and the remaining sessions of our worldwide general conference will follow on the coming Saturday and Sunday. I am most grateful to President Thomas S. Monson, the prophet of God for our days, for asking me to represent the First Presidency as I speak to the sisters of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p6" pid="0nYINd8VPke7AYfq3Ww89w" hash="3mlGoA"&gt;As I contemplated what I might say, my thoughts went back to the women who have shaped my life and helped me through the challenges of mortality. I am grateful for my grandmother who decades ago decided to take her family to a Mormon sacrament meeting. I am grateful for Sister Ewig, an elderly single German lady, whose name translates into English as “Sister Eternal.” She was the one who extended this courageous and wonderful invitation to my grandmother. I am so very grateful for my mother, who led four children through the turmoil of World War II. I think also of my daughter, granddaughters, and future generations of faithful women who will one day follow.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p7" pid="hxfTDwVPtUmnxYDUhoyPwg" hash="Gt3iQw"&gt;And, of course, I am eternally grateful to my wife, Harriet, who enchanted me as a teen, bore the heaviest burdens of our young family as a mother, stands with me as a wife, and loves and cherishes our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. She has been the strength in our home during both good times and bad. She brings sunshine into the lives of all who know her.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p8" pid="jFK5wOf9lkGxJhOzDBOL5g" hash="Jg7Wbg"&gt;Finally, I am very grateful to all of you, the millions of faithful sisters worldwide of any age who do so much to build the kingdom of God. I am grateful to you for the countless ways you inspire, nurture, and bless those around you.&lt;/p&gt;

When we sing the song “I Am a Child of God,” the lyrics penetrate our hearts. Pondering this truth—that we are children of heavenly parents&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;—fills us with a sense of origin, purpose, and destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p11" pid="VYWrxEGlqUa3CzrRxIBKKQ" hash="Qd_0jg"&gt;It is good to remember that you are always a child of God. This knowledge will carry you through the most difficult times in your life and will inspire you to accomplish remarkable things. However, it is also important to remember that being a daughter of eternal parents is not a distinction you earned or you will ever lose. You will always and forever remain a daughter of God. Your Heavenly Father has high aspirations for you, but your divine origin &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;alone&lt;/span&gt; does not guarantee you a divine inheritance. God sent you here to prepare for a future greater than anything you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

Among them are “thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; And it takes more than a spiritual birth certificate or a “Child of God Membership Card” to qualify for these incomprehensible blessings.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s face it: there may be some that seem harder or less appealing—commandments that we approach with the enthusiasm of a child sitting before a plate of healthy but hated vegetables. We grit our teeth and force ourselves to comply so that we can move on to more desirable activities.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p25" pid="QcRvECNX-0OgzZ1qNRv2og" hash="89k1Mw"&gt;I think God knows something we don’t—things that are beyond our capacity to comprehend! Our Father in Heaven is an eternal being whose experience, wisdom, and intelligence are infinitely greater than ours.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; Not only that, but He is also eternally loving, compassionate, and focused on one blessed goal: to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p26" pid="aHENkqiHqE6-cGcpqdNdqg" hash="1NdTdg"&gt;In other words, He not only &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;knows&lt;/span&gt; what is best for you; He also anxiously &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;wants you to choose&lt;/span&gt; what is best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p27" pid="P3omeaamb0izaKNw6s8J8A" hash="HjsAWA"&gt;If you believe this in your hearts—if you truly believe the great mission of our Heavenly Father is to exalt and glorify His children and that He knows best how to do it—doesn’t it make sense to embrace and follow His commandments, even the ones that appear difficult? Should we not cherish the light posts He has given that guide us through the darkness and the trials of mortality? They mark the way back to our heavenly home! By choosing Heavenly Father’s path, you lay a divine foundation for your personal progress as a daughter of God that will bless you throughout your life.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p28" pid="iUX9PASo7Emd197JgkN2vg" hash="iAaKrQ"&gt;Part of our challenge is, I think, that we imagine that God has all of His blessings locked in a huge cloud up in heaven, refusing to give them to us unless we comply with some strict, paternalistic requirements He has set up. But the commandments aren’t like that at all. In reality, Heavenly Father is constantly raining blessings upon us. It is our fear, doubt, and sin that, like an umbrella, block these blessings from reaching us.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p29" pid="6N__wFM4oEWP9hFRt_2o4A" hash="f4RQmw"&gt;His commandments are the loving instructions and the divine help for us to close the umbrella so we can receive the shower of heavenly blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p30" pid="fvtPz5JtE0e06hIw417ztw" hash="sSXVPA"&gt;We need to accept that the commandments of God aren’t just a long list of good ideas. They aren’t “life hacks” from an Internet blog or motivational quotes from a Pinterest board. They are divine counsel, based on eternal truths, given to bring “peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p31" pid="-USRqnMnck-Pis1FDmraOA" hash="4wL4kA"&gt;So we have a choice. On the one hand, there is the opinion of the world with its ever-changing theories and questionable motives. On the other hand, there is God’s word to His children—His eternal wisdom, His certain promises, and His loving instructions for returning to His presence in glory, love, and majesty.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p32" pid="11wVlHbSZU-9gZuMy_T8Nw" hash="1E7K2Q"&gt;The choice is yours!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p36" pid="JPDDBG6PCEOlNWmHE9R2YA" hash="xuixzg"&gt;Once you understand the true nature of God and His commandments, you will also better understand yourselves and the divine purpose of your existence. With this, your motivation for following the commandments changes, and it becomes your heart’s desire to live the gospel joyfully.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p37" pid="hfpivd4_HECQPhXtv71r9g" hash="USf0hg"&gt;For example, those who see attendance at Church meetings as a personal way to increase their love of God, find peace, uplift others, seek the Spirit, and renew their commitment to follow Jesus Christ will find a far richer experience than those who simply put in their time sitting in a pew. Sisters, it is &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;very important&lt;/span&gt; that we attend our Sunday meetings, but I’m fairly certain our Heavenly Father is even more concerned about our faith and repentance than about attendance statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p38" pid="jVht4PlXlEuEbgB7LKa-7A" hash="I6oOww"&gt;Here is another example:&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;span class="story"&gt;
						&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p39" pid="VXD_G00Z40uAFZcKbg4HDg" hash="pctbRg"&gt;A single mother of two small children recently came down with chicken pox. Of course, it wasn’t long before her children got sick as well. The task of caring for herself and her little ones alone was almost too much for the young mother. And, as a result, the normally spotless house became cluttered and messy. Dirty dishes piled up in the sink, and laundry piled up everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p40" pid="hN7RHa8F1ki5TTNlgUsS7Q" hash="1rzDYQ"&gt;While she was struggling with crying children—and wanting to cry herself—a knock came at the door. It was her visiting teachers. They could see the young mother’s distress. They could see her house, her kitchen. They could hear the cries of the children.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p41" pid="BarE7PIpRU68Gk5X6ai_ew" hash="dfCGQA"&gt;Now, if these sisters had been concerned only with completing their assigned monthly visits, they might have handed the mother a plate of cookies, mentioned that they had missed her at Relief Society last week, and said something like, “Let us know if there is anything we can do!” Then they would have cheerfully been on their way, thankful that they had 100 percent for another month.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p42" pid="utG6fJd5OU2czxTQE89Csw" hash="xZJ5PQ"&gt;Fortunately, these sisters were true disciples of Christ. They noticed their sister’s needs and put their many talents and their experience to work. They cleared up the chaos, brought light and clarity into the home, and called a friend to bring over some much-needed groceries. When they at last finished their work and said their good-byes, they left that young mother in tears—tears of gratitude and love.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p43" pid="iM1rpCAbDkKwdNKX2fZmaA" hash="mIkQYQ"&gt;From that moment on, the young mother’s opinion of visiting teaching changed. “I know,” she said, “that I am not just a check mark on someone else’s to-do list.”&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/span&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p44" pid="oOZ6bcKxaku-gi0-JIQOlg" hash="if_OrA"&gt;Yes, visiting teachers need to be faithful in making their monthly visits, all without missing the most important &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;why&lt;/span&gt; behind this commandment: to love God and fellowmen.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p45" pid="spxO4Uwt20elSRCexEbwrA" hash="IsiAyw"&gt;When we treat God’s commandments and our part in building His kingdom like something to check off on a to-do list, we miss the heart of discipleship. We miss the growth that comes from joyfully living the commandments of our Father in Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p46" pid="wzEaD3ZkQ0qg3xMDS3r2Iw" hash="WF87mw"&gt;Walking in the path of discipleship does not need to be a bitter experience. It “is sweet above all that is sweet.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; It is not a burden that weighs us down. Discipleship lifts our spirits and lightens our hearts. It inspires us with faith, hope, and charity. It fills our spirits with light in times of darkness, and serenity during times of sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/living-the-gospel-joyful.p47" pid="UIkrZidENEO7mLMjNSlNng" hash="-dJA7A"&gt;It gives us divine power and lasting joy.&lt;/p&gt;

So he put lemon juice all over his face, went out, and robbed two banks. Not much later he was arrested when his image was broadcast over the evening news. When police showed the man the videos of himself from the security cameras, he couldn’t believe his eyes. “But I had lemon juice on my face!” he protested.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

To determine whether this was a general problem, two researchers invited college students to participate in a series of tests on various life skills and then asked them to rate how they did. The students who performed poorly were the least accurate at evaluating their own performance—some of them estimating their scores to be five times higher than they actually were.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

And the troubling thing is that this situation is not unique. Such terrible and often unnecessary things happen when members of the Church become disengaged from gospel principles. They may appear on the outside to be disciples of Jesus Christ, but on the inside their hearts have separated from their Savior and His teachings. They have gradually turned away from the things of the Spirit and moved toward the things of the world.</p>

The governor of the area, Grigory Potemkin, desperately wanted to impress these visitors. And so he went to remarkable lengths to showcase the country’s accomplishments.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/on-being-genuine.p6" pid="N1-qBUCFQ0yZ3dcaC-9l3A" hash="s-ySNQ">For part of the journey, Catherine floated down the Dnieper River, proudly pointing out to the ambassadors the thriving hamlets along the shore, filled with industrious and happy townspeople. There was only one problem: it was all for show. It is said that Potemkin had assembled pasteboard facades of shops and homes. He had even positioned busy-looking peasants to create the impression of a prosperous economy. Once the party disappeared around the bend of the river, Potemkin’s men packed up the fake village and rushed it downstream in preparation for Catherine’s next pass.</p>

He thought about the members who were struggling with doubts or loneliness or with severe health conditions and no insurance. He thought about the members who were grappling with broken marriages, addictions, unemployment, and mental illness.

There are two important things you should know about Eva. One is that she was 11 years old in this story.

She was a large woman—everything about her was large: her voice, her smile, her personality. It wasn’t easy for her to get around, but she always sang and laughed while she worked, and the sound of her laughter filled the house. Every night she sat down on her overstuffed sofa, pulled out her scriptures, and read out loud. And as she read, she sometimes made comments like “Oh, he shouldn’t have done that!” or “What wouldn’t I give to have been there!” or “Isn’t that the most beautiful thing you’ve ever heard!” And every evening as the two of them knelt by Eva’s bed to pray, Great-Aunt Rose would say the most beautiful prayers, thanking her Heavenly Father for the blue jays and the spruce trees, the sunsets and the stars, and the “wonder of being alive.” It sounded to Eva as though Rose knew God as a friend.</p>

But people didn’t laugh at her. Instead, they crowded around her, wanting to talk to her. Rose had been a schoolteacher, and it wasn’t uncommon for former students—now grown up with children of their own—to stop and chat. They thanked her for being a good influence in their lives. They often laughed. Sometimes they even cried.</p>

Before Eva knew it, Great-Aunt Rose said it would soon be time for Eva to return home.

And faith led to hope. And faith and hope gave me confidence that one day everything would make sense, that because of the Savior, all the wrongs would be made right. After that, I saw that the path before me wasn’t as dreary and dusty as I had thought. I began to notice the bright blues, the verdant greens, and the fiery reds, and I decided I had a choice—I could hang my head and drag my feet on the dusty road of self-pity, or I could have a little faith, put on a bright dress, slip on my dancing shoes, and skip down the path of life, singing as I went.” Now her voice was skipping along like the girl in the painting.</p>

But I sure had talked myself into being miserable! Yes, I had some dark days, but all my brooding and worrying wasn’t going to change that—it was only making things worse.

One ancient historian described the walls of Babylon that surrounded the city as more than 300 feet (90 m) high and 80 feet (25 m) thick. “In magnificence,” he wrote, “there is no other city that approaches … it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/be-not-afraid-only-believe.p7" pid="44vWeyTzS0adBIOcD6XG3w" hash="MdVzjg">In its day, Babylon was the world’s center of learning, law, and philosophy. Its military might was unparalleled. It shattered the power of Egypt. It invaded, torched, and looted the Assyrian capital, Nineveh. It easily conquered Jerusalem and carried away the best and brightest of the children of Israel back to Babylon to serve King Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/be-not-afraid-only-believe.p8" pid="Zs4D_DZNYkiCeaykWnGISw" hash="AUn5XQ">One of these captives was a young man by the name of Daniel. Many scholars believe that Daniel was between 12 and 17 years old at the time. Think of it, my beloved young Aaronic Priesthood holders: Daniel was very likely your age when he was taken into the king’s court to be educated in the language, laws, religion, and science of the worldly Babylon.</p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/be-not-afraid-only-believe.p10" pid="6wePluKJY0WyZxNCnwk0jA" hash="ayr-pw">Daniel had been raised as a follower of Jehovah. He believed in and worshipped the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He had studied the words of the prophets, and he knew of God’s interaction with man.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/be-not-afraid-only-believe.p11" pid="Ll341dTEzUyIEEBu5x-S6Q" hash="pRB0xg">But now, at a very young age, he was a prisoner-student in Babylon. The pressure on him must have been immense to abandon his old beliefs and adopt those of Babylon. But he stayed true to his faith—in word and in deed.</p>

In the Internet slang of today, we talk about getting “flamed” by those who disagree with us. But Daniel wasn’t just risking public ridicule. In Babylon, those who challenged the religious authorities understood what it means—figuratively and literally—to be “flamed.” Just ask Daniel’s friends Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Some people are blessed with a believing heart—for them, faith seems to come as a gift from heaven. But I imagine that Daniel was like many of us who have to work for our testimonies. I’m confident that Daniel spent many hours on his knees praying, laying his questions and fears on the altar of faith, and waiting upon the Lord for understanding and wisdom.</p>

Skepticism is easy—anyone can do it. It is the faithful life that requires moral strength, dedication, and courage. Those who hold fast to faith are far more impressive than those who give in to doubt when mysterious questions or concerns arise.</p>

The world has a long history of rejecting that which it does not understand. And it has particular trouble understanding things it cannot see. But just because we cannot see something with our physical eyes does not mean it doesn’t exist. Indeed, “there are more things in heaven and earth … than are dreamt of” in our textbooks, scientific journals, and worldly philosophies.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> The universe is filled with wonders profound and astonishing—things that can be comprehended only through spiritual eyes.</p>

The caring tenderness and affection they showed to each other warmed my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/in-praise-of-those-who-save.p6" pid="JT8Ut439KkOQu5SURu4eIA" hash="cCF27w"&gt;I’m not completely sure why this scene affected me so profoundly. Perhaps it was the sweetness of the love these two people shared for one another—a compelling symbol of perseverance and commitment. It was clear that this couple had been together for a long time and their affection for one another was still alive and strong.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/in-praise-of-those-who-save.p8" pid="4NgpsLnlrEWXq8v8s5NrLA" hash="Iln_zg"&gt;I think another reason this tender scene has stayed with me for so long is the contrast to some of today’s attitudes. In so many societies around the world, everything seems to be disposable. As soon as something starts to break down or wear out—or even when we simply grow tired of it—we throw it out and replace it with an upgrade, something newer or shinier.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/in-praise-of-those-who-save.p9" pid="zsGghr7BI0qGtrH325hiwQ" hash="W66Bwg"&gt;We do this with cell phones, clothes, cars—and, tragically, even with relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/in-praise-of-those-who-save.p11" pid="Lvu-x5MenE-FF5oKv0DntA" hash="jH3iqg"&gt;I am grateful that I belong to a church that values marriage and family. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are known throughout the world for having some of the finest marriages and families you can find. I believe this is, in part, due to the precious truth restored by Joseph Smith that marriages and families are meant to be eternal. Families are not just meant to make things run more smoothly here on earth and to be cast off when we get to heaven. Rather, they are the &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; of heaven. They are an echo of a celestial pattern and an emulation of God’s eternal family.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/in-praise-of-those-who-save.p12" pid="TXL8PNi9DECJm7JwVKJbKw" hash="mO_q6Q"&gt;But strong marriage and family relationships do not happen just because we are members of the Church. They require constant, intentional work. The doctrine of eternal families must inspire us to dedicate our best efforts to saving and enriching our marriages and families. I admire and applaud those who have preserved and nourished these critical, eternal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

I have never met anyone who, as they looked at each other across the altar, thought they would end up divorced or heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt;

In such an environment, some are enticed by the tragic conclusion that their spouse isn’t smart enough, fun enough, or young enough. And somehow they get the idea that this gives them justification to start looking elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

I plead with you to stop now, turn around, and come back to the safe path of integrity and loyalty to covenants. And, of course, the same principles apply for our dear sisters.&lt;/p&gt;

That is the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/in-praise-of-those-who-save.p22" pid="Zj9DZscsqka_q3Oriq2MUg" hash="vmbPuA"&gt;Brethren, those who save their marriages understand that this pursuit takes time, patience, and, above all, the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It requires you to be kind, envy not, seek not your own, not be easily provoked, think no evil, and rejoice in the truth. In other words, it requires charity, the pure love of Christ.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/in-praise-of-those-who-save.p23" pid="-u_gSZuREEijqDHoYgVLsw" hash="NfgZ-Q"&gt;All this won’t just happen in an instant. Great marriages are built brick by brick, day after day, over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

So “be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great [marriage]. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, at the risk of stating the obvious, divorce rarely happens when the husband and wife are happy.&lt;/p&gt;

While it’s true that some types of chronic depression require specialized treatment, I am fond of this bit of wisdom by Abraham Lincoln: “Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.” It fits nicely with its scriptural companion: “Seek, and ye shall find.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, if we look for the good, we will surely find it, because everyone has many good qualities too.&lt;/p&gt;

Pride is one of the biggest reasons marriages and families struggle. Pride is short-tempered, unkind, and envious. Pride exaggerates its own strength and ignores the virtues of others. Pride is selfish and easily provoked. Pride assumes evil intent where there is none and hides its own weaknesses behind clever excuses. Pride is cynical, pessimistic, angry, and impatient. Indeed, if charity is the pure love of Christ, then pride is the defining characteristic of Satan.&lt;/p&gt;

Before long, another sound, the rattle and hum of propellers, gradually increases until it shakes the very air. Trained well by our mother, we children each grab our bag and run up the hill to a bomb shelter. As we hurry through the pitch-dark night, green and white flares drop from the sky to mark the targets for the bombers. Strangely enough, everyone calls these flares Christmas trees.&lt;/p&gt;

Those who lived there witnessed perhaps a thousand times what I had seen. Massive firestorms, caused by thousands of tons of explosives, swept through Dresden, destroying more than 90 percent of the city and leaving little but rubble and ash in their wake.&lt;/p&gt;

Originally built in the 1700s, it had been one of Dresden’s shining jewels, but the war reduced it to a pile of rubble. For many years it remained that way, until finally it was determined that the Frauenkirche would be rebuilt.&lt;/p&gt;

We may impress people with our keen intellectual interpretation of religious topics. We may rhapsodize about religion and “dream of [our] mansion above.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt; But if our faith does not change the way we live—if our beliefs do not influence our daily decisions—our religion is vain, and our faith, if not dead, is certainly not well and is in danger of eventually flatlining.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We may see obedience as an end in itself, rather than a means to an end. Or we may pound the metaphorical hammer of obedience against the iron anvil of the commandments in an effort to shape those we love, through constant heating and repeated battering, into holier, heavenly matter.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe obedience is not so much the process of bending, twisting, and pounding our souls into something we are not. Instead, it is the process by which we discover what we truly are made of.&lt;/p&gt;

He is our Heavenly Father. We are literally His spirit children. We are made of supernal material most precious and highly refined, and thus we carry within ourselves the substance of divinity.&lt;/p&gt;

The dust and filth of the world stain our souls, making it difficult to recognize and remember our birthright and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

The fundamental divinity of our nature remains. And the moment we choose to incline our hearts to our beloved Savior and set foot upon the path of discipleship, something miraculous happens. The love of God fills our hearts, the light of truth fills our minds, we start to lose the desire to sin, and we do not want to walk any longer in darkness.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And gradually, the corruption, dust, and limitations of this earth begin to fall away. Eventually, the priceless, eternal spirit of the heavenly being within us is revealed, and a radiance of goodness becomes our nature.&lt;/p&gt;

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p6" pid="6_0BmpoEME2y5cqT136K6w" hash="lZu1Ow">I love attending this wonderful session of general conference devoted to the sisters of the Church.</p>

There is Harriet’s mother, who joined the Church not long after losing her husband to cancer. Then my sister, my daughter, my granddaughter, and my great-granddaughter—all of these individuals have been refining influences for me. They truly bring sunshine into my life. They inspire me to become a better man and a more sensitive Church leader. How different my life would be without them!</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p8" pid="IVwnaf-ym0Ge44XMyBNlKg" hash="SEjpjg">Perhaps what humbles me most is to know that the same influence is replicated millions of times throughout the Church through the abilities, talents, intelligence, and testimony of women of faith like you.</p>

You might think you are too insignificant to have a meaningful influence on others. Perhaps you don’t even consider yourself a “woman of faith” because you sometimes struggle with doubt or fear.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p10" pid="0aOt_3iWGEKu_ynsz2Fmaw" hash="kuJzqw">Today, I wish to speak to anyone who has ever felt this way—and that probably includes all of us at one time or another. I wish to speak of faith—what it is, what it can and cannot do, and what we must do to activate the power of faith in our lives.</p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p12" pid="hY9XHqA_Y0q4ROpe31AIag" hash="ibdalA">Faith is a strong conviction about something we believe—a conviction so strong that it moves us to do things that we otherwise might not do. “Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p13" pid="xAJDcQ8zKUiCGGUHbQ3paw" hash="9Vuxhg">While this makes sense to believing people, it is often confusing to nonbelievers. They shake their heads and ask, “How can anyone be certain of what they cannot see?” To them, this is evidence of the irrationality of religion.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p14" pid="f2MrEjXHjU2sw9zIVwYLiA" hash="PygClg">What they fail to understand is that there are more ways to see than with our eyes, more ways to feel than with our hands, more ways to hear than with our ears.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p15" pid="jhcI45bsZECafM1QIUF64g" hash="n-xeEg">It’s something like the experience of a young girl who was walking with her grandmother. The song of the birds was glorious to the little girl, and she pointed out every sound to her grandmother.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p16" pid="BOqFC5TsqU2VQxbIQ2z8jg" hash="HM5Q2w">“Do you hear that?” the little girl asked again and again. But her grandmother was hard of hearing and could not make out the sounds.</p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p19" pid="mFTlb5pRKUeS2n3VzwABbA" hash="hdTY3Q">There are lessons in this story for both the nonbeliever and the believer. Just because we can’t hear something doesn’t mean there is nothing to hear. Two people can listen to the same message or read the same scripture, and one might feel the witness of the Spirit while the other doesn’t.</p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p21" pid="DHBQuUhJOUyDZoqP7ITKuA" hash="k4nkoQ">Perhaps better advice—for anyone who wants to increase faith—is to listen <span class="emphasis">differently.</span> The Apostle Paul encourages us to seek the voice that speaks to our spirit, not just to our ears. He taught, “The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Or perhaps we should consider the words of Saint-Exupéry’s Little Prince, who said: “One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p23" pid="8WQBarZEj0qLa5socpFB4w" hash="Z3VOPA">Sometimes it’s not easy to develop faith in spiritual things while living in a physical world. But it is worth the effort because the power of faith in our lives can be profound. The scriptures teach us that through faith the worlds were framed, waters were parted, dead were raised, and rivers and mountains were moved from their course.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p24" pid="HyIbWNEcQU28i-1A9wn13A" hash="fvFoQg">Yet some might ask, “If faith is so powerful, why can’t I receive an answer to a heartfelt prayer? I don’t need a sea to part or a mountain to move. I just need my illness to go away or my parents to forgive each other or an eternal companion to appear on my doorstep with a bouquet of flowers in one hand and an engagement ring in the other. Why can’t my faith accomplish <span class="emphasis">that</span>?”</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p25" pid="Neyv5nr1dUagf2zkIoiwqA" hash="9B3S8A">Faith <span class="emphasis">is</span> powerful, and often it does result in miracles. But no matter how much faith we have, there are two things faith cannot do. For one, it cannot violate another person’s agency.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p26" pid="GqoSUwYa706YLq3bx6G_TA" hash="n5QCbw">One woman prayed for years that her wayward daughter would return to the fold of Christ and felt discouraged that her prayers had seemingly gone unanswered. This was especially painful when she heard stories of other prodigal children who had repented of their ways.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p27" pid="1YHLlqa-oEqH5emYfmanLQ" hash="37-Rig">The problem was not a lack of prayers or a shortage of faith. She needed only to understand that, as painful as it might be for our Father in Heaven, He will not force anyone to choose the path of righteousness. God did not force His own children to follow Him in the premortal world. How much less will He force us now as we journey through this mortal life?</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p28" pid="jFnylY8QUkawC4rh9blVYg" hash="RsSF9g">God will invite, persuade. God will reach out tirelessly with love and inspiration and encouragement. But God will never compel—that would undermine His great plan for our eternal growth.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/fourth-floor-last-door.p29" pid="cmamCNn4rkyT9KUpux880g" hash="wPtvGA">The second thing faith cannot do is force our will upon God. We cannot force God to comply with our desires—no matter how right we think we are or how sincerely we pray. Consider the experience of Paul, who pleaded with the Lord multiple times for relief from a personal trial—what he called “a thorn in the flesh.” But that was not God’s will. Eventually, Paul realized that his trial was a blessing, and he thanked God for not answering his prayers the way he had hoped.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Though he was the son of a great prophet, he lost his way for a time and became a “wicked and an idolatrous man.” For reasons we can only guess, he actively opposed his father and sought to destroy the Church. And because of his eloquence and persuasiveness, he experienced great success.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

For three days and three nights, Alma “was racked with eternal torment, … even with the pains of a damned soul.” And then, somehow, a faint memory brought light to the darkness of his mind—an eternal truth, taught by his father: that Jesus Christ would come “to atone for the sins of the world.” Alma had long ago rejected such concepts, but now his “mind caught hold upon this thought,” and he humbly, earnestly placed his trust in Christ’s atoning power.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

The Twitters, Instagrams, and Facebooks of his day would have been filled with images and stories about him.

In short, he was perhaps the most well-known celebrity of his day.</p>

This happens not just when we go to meetings and listen to talks but also when we get outside ourselves and serve. This is how we become “great” in the kingdom of God.</p>

Inherent in our name is the commitment to look forward to the Savior’s return and prepare ourselves and the world to receive Him. Therefore, let us serve God and love our fellowmen. Let us do this with a natural confidence, with humility, never looking down on any other religion or group of people. Brothers and sisters, we are charged with studying the word of God and heeding the voice of the Spirit, that we may “know the signs of the times, and the signs of the coming of the Son of Man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

But this does not mean that we should burden ourselves or others with constant fear.
