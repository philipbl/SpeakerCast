        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="33"></span>In Idaho Falls, Idaho, there is a beautiful airport. One of the largest in the region, this airport allows easy access to the Upper Snake River Valley. I remember as a young man returning from Chile to this very airport and greeting my family after two years of missionary service. Similar scenes have taken place thousands of times in this airport as the faithful Saints answer the call to serve. It is a very useful, integral part of the city and region.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-atonement-can-clean-reclaim-and-sanctify-our-lives.p2" pid="kLlpyNj3T061B8UH1yHvEg" hash="HJ9p0w">Near the airport is another very useful and beautiful part of the city—Freeman Park. The Snake River runs along this park for about two miles. There is a walking path that goes through the park and follows on around the river for miles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-atonement-can-clean-reclaim-and-sanctify-our-lives.p3" pid="j5YaknCEqU2854RozjTSKA" hash="fiP9RA">Freeman Park has acres and acres of green grass filled with baseball and softball diamonds, swing sets for children, picnic shelters for family reunions, beautiful lanes filled with trees and bushes for strolling sweethearts. Looking down the river from the park, one can see the majestic Idaho Falls temple, white and clean, standing on high ground. The sound of the rushing waters of the Snake River as it works its way through natural lava outcroppings makes this park very desirable. It is one of my favorite places to walk with my sweetheart, Lynette; relax; contemplate; and meditate. It is very peaceful and inspiring.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-atonement-can-clean-reclaim-and-sanctify-our-lives.p4" pid="lSz7ZuW-3Eak1IGxhm7YPw" hash="jiAN3A">Why do I talk about the regional airport and Freeman Park in Idaho Falls? Because they are both built on the same kind of ground; both of these beautiful, useful places used to be sanitary landfills.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-atonement-can-clean-reclaim-and-sanctify-our-lives.p5" pid="qk-kA-Zj8024BcIgYMKdYg" hash="d9-QRQ">A sanitary landfill is where garbage is buried between layers of earth. Webster’s dictionary defines a landfill as “a system of trash and garbage disposal in which the waste is buried between layers of earth to build up low-lying land” (<span class="emphasis">Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary,</span> 11th ed. [2003], 699).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-atonement-can-clean-reclaim-and-sanctify-our-lives.p7" pid="OTF8-F1TKkerWT44__WPDg" hash="40s79A">I have lived in Idaho Falls nearly my whole life. I have contributed a lot of garbage to those landfills over the course of more than 50 years.</p>

When they asked me what I was doing, I would respond that I wanted to dig up the old garbage that I had made over the years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-atonement-can-clean-reclaim-and-sanctify-our-lives.p9" pid="lJDKqIWsxkS3dq_rQXQUzw" hash="ZaWUeA">I suspect they would tell me that there was no way to identify my personal garbage, that it had been reclaimed and buried long ago. I’m sure that they would tell me that I had no right to dig up the garbage and that I was destroying something very beautiful and useful that they had made out of my garbage. In short, I don’t think they would be very pleased with me. I suppose that they would wonder why anyone would want to destroy something so beautiful and useful in an attempt to dig up old garbage.</p>

Or what about the one who is making an honest effort but has fallen back into sin so many times that he feels that there is no possible way to break the seemingly endless pattern? Or what about the person who has changed his life but just can’t forgive himself?</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="34"></span>Referring to the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the prophet Alma taught the people in Gideon:</p>

Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 9:7</a>).</p>

His Atonement is infinite. It applies to everyone, even you. It can clean, reclaim, and sanctify even you. That is what infinite means—total, complete, all, forever. President Boyd K. Packer has taught: “There is no habit, no addiction, no rebellion, no transgression, no apostasy, no crime exempted from the promise of complete forgiveness. That is the promise of the atonement of Christ” (“The Brilliant Morning of Forgiveness,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 20).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-atonement-can-clean-reclaim-and-sanctify-our-lives.p18" pid="R32hVRnnvU63Y5TqltdM3Q" hash="CeuidQ">Just as the city fathers in Idaho Falls would feel bad about a person trying to dig up his old garbage, our Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, feel sorrow when we choose to remain in sin, when the gift of repentance made possible through the Atonement can clean, reclaim, and sanctify our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/the-atonement-can-clean-reclaim-and-sanctify-our-lives.p19" pid="PEQWEEu8R0mPF_7bvBCrGg" hash="yNDBLQ">When we gratefully accept and use this precious gift, we can enjoy the beauty and usefulness of our lives that God has reclaimed through His infinite love and the Atonement of His Son and our brother, Jesus Christ.</p>

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="15"></span>While serving as young missionaries in Chile, my companion and I met a family of seven in the branch. The mother attended every week with her children. We assumed that they were longtime members of the Church. After several weeks we learned that they had not been baptized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/because-i-live-ye-shall-live-also.p6" pid="FTDaPcTvDEmQv0RLJQYXMQ" hash="lE2Vtg">We immediately contacted the family and asked if we could come to their home and teach them. The father was not interested in learning about the gospel but had no objection to our teaching his family.</p>

She was anxious to learn all the doctrine that we taught. One evening as we were discussing infant baptism, we taught that little children are innocent and have no need for baptism. We invited her to read in the book of Moroni:</p>

I have felt a great weight taken off of me, and these are tears of joy.”</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="16"></span>I was reminded of the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who taught this comforting doctrine: “The Lord takes many away, even in infancy, that they may escape the envy of man, and the sorrows and evils of this present world; they were too pure, too lovely, to live on earth; therefore, if rightly considered, instead of mourning we have reason to rejoice as they are delivered from evil, and we shall soon have them again.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

It is my prayer that by the power of the Holy Ghost, I may bring some measure of hope, of peace, and of understanding. It is my desire to be an instrument in bringing about a restoration of your faith in our loving Father in Heaven, who knows all things and allows us to experience trials so that we can come to know and love Him and understand that without Him we have nothing.</p>

We named him Tyson. He was a beautiful little boy, and the family greeted him with open hearts and open arms. His brothers and sisters were so proud of him. We all thought he was the most perfect little boy who had ever been born.</p>

The chalk lodged in Tyson’s throat, and he quit breathing. His older brother brought Tyson upstairs, frantically calling, “The baby won’t breathe. The baby won’t breathe.” We began to administer CPR and called 911.</p>

In the waiting room we continued in fervent prayer as we pled to God for a miracle. After what seemed a lifetime, the doctor came into the room and said, “I am so sorry. There is nothing more we can do. Take all the time you need.” She then left.</p>

Most of the time I felt as if I were in a bad dream and that I would soon wake up and this terrible nightmare would be over. For many nights I didn’t sleep. I often wandered in the night from one room to the other, making sure that our other children were all safe.</p>

I felt dirty. I was his father; I should have done more to protect him. If only I would have done this or that. Sometimes even today, 22 years later, those feelings begin to creep into my heart, and I need to get rid of them quickly because they can be destructive.</p>

Larsen. He took the time to listen to me, and I will always be grateful for his counsel and love. He said, “I don’t think the Lord would want you to punish yourself for the death of your little boy.” I felt the love of my Heavenly Father through one of his chosen vessels.</p>

How could God do this to me? Why me? What did I do to deserve this?” I even felt myself get angry with people who were just trying to comfort us. I remember friends saying, “I know how you feel.” I would think to myself, “You have no idea how I feel. Just leave me alone.” I soon found that self-pity can also be very debilitating. I was ashamed of myself for having unkind thoughts about dear friends who were only trying to help.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="17"></span>As I felt the guilt, anger, and self-pity trying to consume me, I prayed that my heart could change. Through very personal sacred experiences, the Lord gave me a new heart, and even though it was still lonely and painful, my whole outlook changed. I was given to know that I had not been robbed but rather that there was a great blessing awaiting me if I would prove faithful.</p>

I testify that this life is not the end. The spirit world is real. The teachings of the prophets regarding life after death are true. This life is but a transitory step forward on our journey back to our Heavenly Father.</p>

Through the years it has been wonderful to see the mercy and kindness of a loving Father in Heaven, who has allowed our family to feel in very tangible ways the influence of Tyson. I testify that the veil is thin. The same feelings of loyalty, love, and family unity don’t end as our loved ones pass to the other side; instead, those feelings are intensified.</p>

I will never have a fulness of joy until we are reunited in the morning of the First Resurrection.</p>

Wouldn’t it be tragic if we didn’t feel great sorrow when we lose a child? How grateful I am to my Father in Heaven that He allows us to love deeply and love eternally. How grateful I am for eternal families. How grateful I am that He has revealed once again through His living prophets the glorious plan of redemption.</p>
