        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="55"></span>Not long ago I was in South Africa visiting a home with Thabiso, the first assistant in the priests quorum in the Kagiso Ward. Thabiso and his bishop, who presides and holds the keys for the quorum, had been praying for quorum members who were less active, seeking inspiration about whom to visit and how to help them. They felt prompted to visit the home of Tebello, and they invited me to go with them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p6" pid="Qe-Vlrf9f0uXF2mOLZoOhg" hash="jQkZIg">Once we made it past the ferocious guard dog, we found ourselves in the living room with Tebello, a calm-spirited young man who had stopped attending church because he had become busy doing other things on Sundays. He was nervous but happy to receive us and even invited his family to join him. The bishop expressed his love for the family and his desire to help them become an eternal family by being sealed in the temple. Their hearts were moved, and we could all feel the strong presence of the Holy Ghost guiding every word and every sentiment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p7" pid="i6y1H-o1okyzpAuYm-lXVw" hash="tLoFcQ">But it was the words of Thabiso that made the difference in the visit. It seemed to me that this young priest was speaking in the language of angels—loving words that we all could fully understand but that especially touched his friend. “I enjoyed so much talking to you all the time at church,” he said. “You always have kind words for me. And you know, our soccer team has basically disappeared now that we don’t have you. You are so good at it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p8" pid="sJjytDP8V0uMFtPYzoFZQg" hash="RPAKFg">“I am sorry,” Tebello answered. “I will come back with you guys.”</p>

But sometimes I also witness, with a sad heart, how many young men do not understand how much good they can do with the power they hold.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p12" pid="H7t2yVMDaUa0ke2ucS4h4g" hash="868BjQ">The priesthood is the power and authority of God Himself to act in the service of His children. Oh, if only every young man, every Aaronic Priesthood holder, could fully comprehend that his priesthood possesses the keys of the ministering of angels. If only they could understand that they have the sacred duty to help their friends find the pathway that leads to the Savior. If only they knew that Heavenly Father will give them the power to explain the truths of the restored gospel with such clarity and sincerity that others will feel the undeniable truthfulness of the words of Christ.</p>

What greater power can you acquire on earth than the priesthood of God? What power could possibly be greater than the capacity to assist our Heavenly Father in changing the lives of your fellowmen, to help them along the pathway of eternal happiness by being cleansed of sin and wrongdoing?</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p14" pid="193tmjnRWU-CIuiRSrB6sA" hash="kfKkUw">Like any other power, the priesthood needs to be exercised to accomplish any good. You are called to “arise and shine forth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 115:5</a>), not to hide your light in darkness. Only those who are brave will be counted among the chosen. As you exercise the power of your sacred priesthood, your courage and confidence will increase. Young men, you know that you are at your best when <span class="pageBreak" page-number="56"></span>you are in the service of God. You know that you are happiest when you are anxiously engaged in a good work. Magnify the power of your priesthood by being clean and being worthy.</p>

Holland made to you six months ago from this pulpit. “I am looking,” he said, “for men young and old who care enough about this battle between good and evil to sign on and speak up. We are at war.” He continued, “… I ask for a stronger and more devoted voice, a voice not only against evil … , but a voice for good, a voice for the gospel, a voice for God” (“We Are All Enlisted,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2011, 44, 47).</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p16" pid="oduX_VnzUEOADq7Ll4AEhQ" hash="duAXXA">Yes, Aaronic Priesthood holders, we are at war. And in this war, the best way to defend against evil is to actively promote righteousness. You cannot listen to foul words and pretend you don’t hear. You cannot watch, alone or with others, images you know are filthy and pretend you don’t see. You cannot touch any unclean thing and pretend it’s no big deal. You cannot be passive when Satan seeks to destroy that which is wholesome and pure. Instead, stand up boldly for what you know is true! When you hear or see anything that violates the Lord’s standards, remember who you are—a soldier in the army of God Himself, empowered with His holy priesthood. There is no better weapon against the enemy, the father of lies, than the truth that will come out of your mouth as you exercise the power of the priesthood. Most of your peers will respect you for your courage and your integrity. Some will not. But that doesn’t matter. You will gain the respect and trust of Heavenly Father because you used His power to accomplish His purposes.</p>

Utilize your priesthood power by inviting those around you to come unto Christ through repentance and baptism. You have the mandate and power of Heavenly Father to do it.</p>

I asked him to write to me, and with his permission I will read to you part of his recent e-mail: “I just turned 16, and Sunday I was ordained to the office of a priest. That same day I baptized a friend; her name is Carolina. I taught her the gospel, and she regularly attended church and even received her Personal Progress award, but her parents would not allow her to be baptized until they got to know and trust me. She wanted me to baptize her, so we had to wait for a month until Sunday, when I turned 16. I feel so good to have helped such a good person to be baptized, and I feel happy that I was the one who baptized her.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p19" pid="s_kZxkMj70mpMhWXAonkaw" hash="5Q-brA">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="57"></span>Daniel is just one of many young men around the world who are living up to the power God has entrusted to them. Another is Luis Fernando, from Honduras, who noticed that his friend was walking a dangerous path and shared his testimony with him, literally saving his life (see “A Change of Heart,” <a href="http://lds.org/youth/video"><span class="language">lds.org/youth/video</span></a>). Olavo, from Brazil, is another example. A true standing minister in his home (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.111" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:111</a>), Olavo inspired his mother to return to full activity in the Church (see “Reunited by Faith,” <a href="http://lds.org/youth/video"><span class="language">lds.org/youth/video</span></a>). You can find some of these stories and many others like them on the Church’s youth website, <a href="http://youth.lds.org"><span class="language">youth.lds.org</span></a>. By the way, the Internet, social media, and other technologies are tools the Lord has placed in your hands to help you exercise your priesthood duties and extend the influence of truth and virtue.</p>

    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p20" pid="q693JaDmzEKibOQmdjT_ug" hash="wsTiPQ">Dear young men, when you exercise the Aaronic Priesthood in the way I have described, you are preparing yourselves for responsibilities in your future. But you are doing much more than that. Like John the Baptist, that exemplary Aaronic Priesthood holder, you are also preparing the way of the Lord and making His paths straight. When you boldly declare the gospel of repentance and baptism, as John did, you are preparing the people for the coming of the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/3.3" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 3:3</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65.1-3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 65:1–3</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.26-28" class="scriptureRef">84:26–28</a>). You are often told about your great potential. Well, now is the time to put that potential into action, to make use of the abilities God has given you to bless others, bring them out from obscurity and into light, and prepare the way of the Lord.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p21" pid="jYbk-HH-f0C8avi7-BXKIw" hash="o4FpFA">The Church has given you the Duty to God booklet as a resource to help you learn and fulfill your duties. Study it often. Get on your knees, away from technology, and seek the Lord’s guidance. And then arise and use the power of God. I promise that you will receive answers from Heavenly Father on how to conduct your own life and how to help others.</p>
    <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/aaronic-priesthood-arise-and-use-the-power-of-god.p22" pid="4vyUZtP6qE2hfMt55gRDyw" hash="wcG9Vg">I quote the words of President Thomas S. Monson: “Never underestimate the far-reaching influence of your testimony. … You have the capacity to notice the unnoticed. When you have eyes to see, ears to hear, and hearts to feel, you can reach out and rescue others” (“Be Thou an Example,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 2005, 115).</p>

I gained my witness exercising the priesthood myself. I have seen miracle after miracle performed by those who have the power of the Aaronic Priesthood. I have witnessed the power of the ministering of angels as faithful Aaronic Priesthood holders speak Spirit-filled words of hope, opening the heart of someone in need of light and love. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, our leader, and our Savior, amen.</p>

Looking back, I am amazed at how much confidence my grandmother and my aunt and uncle had in us. The morning skies were bright and shiny as we departed in our small caravan of three horses.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p6" pid="Co9sMg5SJUOaTf5kOfJ8GA" hash="UJTm4A">In the middle of the prairie, we had a brilliant idea that we should dismount and play marbles. So we did—for a long time. We were so absorbed in our game that we did not see the “signs of the times” above our heads as dark clouds covered the sky. By the time we realized what was happening, we didn’t even have time to mount our horses. The heavy rain was hitting us so hard, and hail was hitting our faces, so we could not think of anything to do but unsaddle the horses and take cover under the saddle blankets.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p7" pid="pG3m28ccYEKNyLaOec2tmA" hash="CJpi0w">Horseless, wet, and cold, we continued our journey, now trying to move as fast as we could. As we approached our destination, we saw that the wide street that entered the town had flooded and was like a river heading toward us. Now our only choice was to drop our covers and climb the barbed-wire fence that surrounded the town. It was late at night when, tired and sore and soaked, we sought shelter in the first home we saw as we entered the town. The good young family there dried us off, fed us delicious bean burritos, and then put us to bed in a room of our own. Soon we discovered that the room had a flat dirt floor, so we had another brilliant idea. We drew a circle on the floor and continued our marbles game until we collapsed to the floor in sleep.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p8" pid="-8zfVg12aEqCdpdPqvQEoA" hash="1hJFKQ">As children we were just thinking about ourselves. We never thought about the loved ones who were desperately searching for us back home—if we had, we would have never delayed our journey in such a useless pursuit. And if we had been wiser, we would have looked at the sky, spotted the clouds forming, and accelerated our pace to stay ahead of the storm. Now that I have a little more experience, I always remind myself, “Don’t forget to look up.”</p>
		</span>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p9" pid="A5IVTU5akEe1hN-OkgMG8Q" hash="Fyk78w">My experience with my cousins taught me to pay attention to the signs of our times. We live in the stormy, perilous days that Paul described: “Men shall be lovers of their own selves, … disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, … false accusers, incontinent, … lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.2-4" class="scriptureRef">2 Timothy 3:2–4</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p10" pid="FhS-20KDaUCm8Rf6tO8U5w" hash="sLskkQ">Speaking of these times, Elder Dallin H. Oaks said: “We need to make both temporal and spiritual preparation. … And the preparation most likely to be neglected is the one less visible and more difficult—the spiritual” (“Preparation for the Second Coming,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign</span> or <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> May 2004, 9). In other words, don’t neglect to look up.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p11" pid="VzRPjoLooEKfk8bRQgLUrA" hash="E-N0UQ">Given the urgent need for spiritual preparation in a time of such peril, I want to extend a word of warning about one very strong sign of the times. My professional life put me on the forefront of technology, so I recognize the value it has, especially in communication. So much information of man is now at our fingertips. But the Internet is also full of much that is filthy and misleading. Technology has augmented our freedom of speech, but it also gives an unqualified blogger false credibility based on the number of viewers. This is why now, more than ever, we must remember this eternal principle: “By their fruits ye shall know them” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.20" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 7:20</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p12" pid="hBy7I3N4QkOg4ZzgaB8Iyw" hash="wElnFg">In particular, I caution you not to view filthy images or give your attention to the false accusers of Christ and the Prophet Joseph Smith. Both actions create the same effect: the loss of the Holy Ghost and His protecting, sustaining power. Vice and unhappiness always follow.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p13" pid="Nn-tRTtngkCXZCrPuwd_Kw" hash="muAwhg">My dear brothers and sisters, if you ever come across anything that causes you to question your testimony of the gospel, I plead with you to look up. Look to the Source of all wisdom and truth. Nourish your faith and testimony with the word of God. There are those in the world who seek to undermine your faith by mixing lies with half-truths. This is why it is absolutely critical that you remain constantly worthy of the Spirit. The <span class="pageBreak" page-number="103"></span>companionship of the Holy Ghost is not just a pleasant convenience—it is essential to your spiritual survival. If you will not treasure up the words of Christ and listen closely to the promptings of the Spirit, you will be deceived (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.37" class="scriptureRef">Joseph Smith—Matthew 1:37</a>). We must do these things.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p14" pid="keX9JfrdRUaEvZfXvWOMMQ" hash="eGEtbA">Jesus Christ, who was perfect, and Joseph Smith, who admitted that he himself was not, were both killed by false accusers who would not accept their testimony. How can we know that their testimony is true—that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and Joseph Smith is a true prophet?</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p15" pid="3v_cqsjCg0uC84XEMXgRMw" hash="MQrIfQ">“By their fruits ye shall know them.” Can good fruit grow from a bad tree? I know for myself that my Redeemer has forgiven my sins and freed me of my personal yoke, bringing me to a state of happiness that I did not know existed. And I know for myself that Joseph Smith was a prophet because I have applied the simple promise in the Book of Mormon: “Ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 10:4</a>). In simple words, look up.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p16" pid="RXINtejCjUCyU9y_ViQYoA" hash="JNMKyg">There are some who might suggest that you must have physical evidence in order to believe in the Resurrection of Christ or the veracity of His restored gospel. To them I quote the words of Alma to Korihor, who was trying to persuade others not to believe: “Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.44" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:44</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p17" pid="yYQaWNN6akeuFKsWi6u8xQ" hash="1mfxvw">You and I are living evidence of the redeeming power of the Savior. We are living evidence of the ministry of the Prophet Joseph and the faithfulness of those early Saints who remained strong in their testimony. The Church of Jesus Christ has now expanded all over the world and is growing like never before—embraced, as in the times of Christ, by humble people who do not need to see and touch to believe.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p18" pid="zxAg8VlRQECoDoYPh0XXtg" hash="Xa05EA">No one knows when the Lord will come again. But the perilous times are now upon us. Today is the time to look to the Source of truth and ensure that our testimonies are strong.</p>

A man knocked on the door looking for the three lost boys. He put us on horses, and we started back home through the same prairie. I will never forget what we saw on our way home—a multitude of people who had been searching for us throughout the night, their tractors and trucks stuck in the mud. They had found a saddle here and a horse there, and when they saw us returning home, I could feel their relief and their love. At the entrance to town, many people were waiting for us, and in front of them all were my loving grandmother and my uncle and aunt. They embraced us and cried, overjoyed that they had found their lost children. What a great reminder this is to me that our loving Heavenly Father is mindful of us. He is anxiously awaiting our return home.</p>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/look-up.p21" pid="zq875aI7HkClunKLjNprSA" hash="eX1LcA">I know we can live together as families for eternity, that our loving Heavenly Father is waiting for us, His children, with His arms extended. I know that Jesus Christ, our Rescuer, lives. As with Peter, no flesh and blood has revealed it to me, but my Father who is in heaven (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.15-19" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 16:15–19</a>). In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
