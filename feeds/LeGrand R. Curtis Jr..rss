      <description>Through Christ, people can and do change their lives and obtain redemption.</description>

    <div class="topic" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.t1">
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p1" guid="285d12df-e620-4c5a-991a-9a7fc1e0f08d" pid="ZoE8jNXnxUmUknK3oOcbeg" hash="lX_AZw">
        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="35"></span>There are various names by which reference is made to the Lord Jesus Christ. These names give us insight into different aspects of the Lord’s atoning mission. Take, for example, the title “Savior.” We all have a sense of what it means to be saved because each of us has been saved at some time from something. As children, my sister and I were playing in a river in a small boat when we unwisely left the safe area of play and found ourselves being propelled by the current to unknown perils downstream. In response to our cries, our father ran to the rescue, saving us from the dangers of the river. When I think of saving, I think of that experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p2" guid="8f5d2126-dc41-4e78-a8ef-75dd38ab8bc5" pid="6Za9iom-B0CMxqz2ngmnSg" hash="kC7dZw">The title “Redeemer” provides similar insights. “To redeem” is to buy or to buy back. As a legal matter, property is redeemed by paying off the mortgages or other liens on it. In Old Testament times, the law of Moses provided different ways that servants and property could be freed, or redeemed, by the payment of money (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/lev/25.29-32,48-55" class="scriptureRef">Leviticus 25:29–32, 48–55</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p3" guid="3785578a-7428-4d8a-ae0a-387641a176f6" pid="kaJR6RYzDUCudZHmm5u8UQ" hash="Cm_Wqw">A prominent scriptural use of the word <span class="emphasis">redeem</span> concerns the delivery of the children of Israel out of their bondage in Egypt. After that deliverance, Moses told them, “Because the Lord loved you, … hath [He] brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/7.8" class="scriptureRef">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p4" guid="b0ed00d3-76ac-4647-b724-d12bcecf8bd9" pid="Dnt6Qnk-JES9znjh7Jle5Q" hash="vZKWkA">The theme of Jehovah redeeming the people of Israel from bondage is repeated many times in the scriptures. Often this is done to remind the people of the Lord’s goodness in delivering the children of Israel from the Egyptians. But it is also done to teach them that there would be another, more important, redemption for Israel. Lehi taught, “And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 2:26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p5" guid="d9d7d380-dcdd-4ac5-9c93-1bbe44522175" pid="7i8dZSJQKUm5WbOQkKq74Q" hash="OIGnMA">The Psalmist wrote, “But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/49.15" class="scriptureRef">Psalm 49:15</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p6" guid="2d74abdd-dd5c-4c0f-b4ad-ca986fa3214d" pid="646_hxgCH02m9OTRPvl9qQ" hash="5w0s0w">The Lord declared through Isaiah, “I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/44.22" class="scriptureRef">Isaiah 44:22</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p7" guid="cdb5c4fd-798f-49bd-a6a9-f4ecd4c26b02" pid="NgJLVu07c0aZG_J8gcSmlQ" hash="J3N_7A">The redemption referred to in these three scriptures, of course, is the Atonement of Jesus Christ. This is the “plenteous redemption” provided by our loving God (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/130.7" class="scriptureRef">Psalm 130:7</a>). Unlike the redemptions under the law of Moses or in modern legal arrangements, this redemption does not come by “corruptible things, as silver and <span class="pageBreak" page-number="36"></span>gold” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.18" class="scriptureRef">1 Peter 1:18</a>). “In [Christ] we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.7" class="scriptureRef">Ephesians 1:7</a>). President John Taylor taught that because of the Redeemer’s sacrifice, “the debt is paid, the redemption made, the covenant fulfilled, justice satisfied, the will of God done, and all power is … given into the hands of the Son of God” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: John Taylor</span> [2001], 44).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p8" guid="a92df86d-dfa8-4eaf-8477-5f1b9bdc6b66" pid="vixlnBhwIkKGmu4Oe7DmLA" hash="1AIAyA">The effects of this redemption include the overcoming of physical death for all of God’s children. That is, temporal death is overcome, and all will be resurrected. Another aspect of this redemption by Christ is the victory over spiritual death. Through His suffering and death, Christ paid for the sins of all mankind on condition of individual repentance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p9" guid="6eed1716-b70c-4a83-99b5-70cd1eb28303" pid="rY8xCRq5tUmPGjXNozD3dg" hash="bFw8fA">Thus, if we repent, we can be forgiven of our sins, the price having been paid by our Redeemer. This is good news for all of us, “for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/3.23" class="scriptureRef">Romans 3:23</a>). Those who have strayed significantly from the paths of righteousness desperately need this redemption, and if they fully repent, it is theirs to claim. But those who have worked hard to live good lives also desperately need this redemption, for none can get to the presence of the Father without Christ’s help. Thus, this loving redemption allows the laws of justice and mercy to be satisfied in the lives of all who repent and follow Christ.</p>

When he was a young adult, he realized what he had been missing by not living the gospel. He repented, changed his life, and devoted himself to righteous living. One day, years after our youthful association, I met him in the temple. The gospel light shone in his eyes, and I sensed that he was a devoted member of the Church trying to fully live the gospel. His is a story of redemption.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p13" guid="25e6650d-a73e-4c81-87d5-39f9b5e39aae" pid="Y-Mo2JSSDkqcmxTQf80jIQ" hash="l3dl2Q">I once interviewed a woman for baptism who had been guilty of a very grievous sin. During the interview <span class="pageBreak" page-number="37"></span>I asked if she understood that she could never repeat that sin. With deep emotion in her eyes and in her voice, she said, “Oh President, I could never do that sin again. That is the reason I want to be baptized—to cleanse me from the effects of that terrible sin.” Hers is a story of redemption.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p14" guid="4f7f4852-4735-448d-a5d8-b64b93a1a54a" pid="yIXP8yeblkGLv3C9ToLzJw" hash="JwDZ5A">As I have visited stake conferences and other meetings in recent years, I have carried President Thomas S. Monson’s call to rescue the less-active members of the Church. At one stake conference I told a story of a less-active member who returned to full activity after his bishop and other leaders visited him in his home, told him he was needed, and called him to serve in the ward. The man in the story not only accepted the call but also changed his life and habits and became fully active in the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p15" guid="f35e2e41-7706-4ae3-873e-1bad07f02516" pid="c06pNE9NQkGApb8JgyEdZg" hash="zVqbmw">A friend of mine was in the congregation to which I told that story. His countenance visibly changed as the story was told. He sent me an e-mail the next day telling me that his emotional reaction to the story was because his father-in-law’s story of returning to activity in the Church was very similar to the one that I had told. He told me that as a result of a similar visit by a bishop and an invitation to serve in the Church, his father-in-law reevaluated his life and his testimony, made major changes in his life, and accepted the call. That reactivated man now has 88 descendants who are active members of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p16" guid="188ce137-76e5-4c55-bad2-351a09897be6" pid="emojli2sQkSbj4hn601lQA" hash="aMPImw">At a meeting a few days later, I told both stories. The next day I received another e-mail which began, “That’s my father’s story too.” That e-mail, from a stake president, told how his father was invited to serve in the Church even though he had not been active and had some habits that needed changing. He accepted the invitation and, in the process, repented, eventually served as a stake president and then a mission president, and laid the foundation for his posterity to be faithful members of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/10/redemption.p17" guid="acd4d9aa-34fe-42bd-8bfd-16fc1dca5112" pid="XUI1VZarwkqNf4Ft3nyijg" hash="y9vWBg">A few weeks later I told all three stories in another stake conference. After the meeting a man came to me and told me that that was <span class="emphasis">not</span> his father’s story. It was <span class="emphasis">his</span> story. He told me of the events that led him to repent and come back to full involvement in the Church. And so it went. As I carried the call to rescue the less active, I saw and heard story after story of people who responded to invitations to come back and change their lives. I heard story after story of redemption.</p>

The government seized all Church property, and all missionary activity stopped. The members of the Church, who refer to this period as “the freeze,” did their best to live the gospel without branch meetings or the support of missionaries. There are many inspiring stories about how the members kept the light of the gospel shining by worshipping in their homes and looking after each other as home and visiting teachers.</p>

His duty was to watch over the building at night. When Nicholas first arrived at the meetinghouse, he saw that things had been scattered around, with papers, books, and furniture in disarray. In the midst of this disorder, he saw a copy of the Book of Mormon. He tried ignoring the book because he had been told that it was evil. But he felt strangely attracted to it. Finally, Nicholas could ignore the book no longer. He picked it up. He felt impelled to start reading it. He read through the night, tears running down his cheeks as he read.</p>

When he got to <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi chapter 25</a>, he read the following: “And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

He realized that in the course of his reading he had received several spiritual promptings that this book was scripture, the most correct he had ever read. He realized that the Latter-day Saints, contrary to what he had heard, strongly believe in Jesus Christ. After the freeze ended and missionaries returned to Ghana, Nicholas, his wife, and his children joined the Church. When I saw him last year, he was a police commander and was serving as the president of the Tamale Ghana District of the Church. He says: “The Church has transformed my life. … I thank the Almighty God for leading me into this gospel.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

While he waited for his friend, Alibert read a book he found nearby. When the meeting ended, Alibert wanted to take the book home. He was given permission to take not only that book but also a copy of the Book of Mormon. When he got home, he started reading the Book of Mormon. He could not put it down. He read by candlelight until 3:00 a.m. He did that for several nights, overwhelmed by what he read and what he felt. Alibert is now a member of the Church.</p>

He eventually became a priest and served his church with devotion. At a certain point his faith started to waver, and he sought and received opportunities for further study. The more he studied, however, the more concerned he became. What he read and felt convinced him that there had been a general apostasy from the true doctrine taught by Jesus and the early Apostles. Angelo searched for God’s true religion in various faiths but was left unsatisfied for many years.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/there-is-power-in-the-book.p13" pid="QVwUH0rZoU2ARO9GPTs_6g" hash="q2ueuw">One day he encountered two members of the Church who were helping the missionaries find more people to teach. He felt drawn to them and joyfully listened to their message. Angelo willingly accepted a copy of the Book of Mormon.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/there-is-power-in-the-book.p14" pid="q-HkO7VAxkyAVvS5FLKBPQ" hash="3iBNsA">That evening he started reading the book. He felt overcome with joy. Through the Spirit, God gave Angelo an inner assurance that in the Book of Mormon he would find the truth for which he had been seeking for many years. Sweet feelings flooded through him. What he read and what he learned from the missionaries confirmed his conclusion that there had been a general apostasy, but he also learned that God’s true Church had been restored to the earth. A short while later, Angelo was baptized into the Church.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> When I first met him, he was the president of the Rimini Branch of our Church in Italy.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/there-is-power-in-the-book.p15" pid="Sjs24JDru0OMZdp3GY4-GQ" hash="ADb94g">What Nicholas, Alibert, and Angelo experienced with the Book of Mormon is reminiscent of Parley P. Pratt’s experience:</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/there-is-power-in-the-book.p16" pid="qUfLRXEKYkeMCLDALFOyiQ" hash="KANnJg">“I opened [the book] with eagerness. … I read all day; eating was a burden, I had no desire for food; sleep was a burden when … night came, for I preferred reading to sleep.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/there-is-power-in-the-book.p17" pid="TtA2DoaaCkCE_9a1mkfzuQ" hash="eZV4Zg">“As I read, the spirit of the Lord was upon me, and I knew and comprehended that the book was true, as plainly and manifestly as a man comprehends and knows that he exists. My joy was now full, as it were, and I rejoiced sufficiently to more than pay me for all the sorrows, sacrifices and toils of my life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/there-is-power-in-the-book.p18" pid="-Ypq1dsvqEaqtzaw9qOG5Q" hash="YJwihQ">Some people have such a powerful experience with the Book of Mormon the first time they open it, but for others the witness of the truthfulness comes more gradually as they read and pray about it. That was my case. I first read the Book of Mormon as a teenage seminary student. This is the copy of the Book of Mormon that I read. I cannot tell you the exact time or place that it happened, but somewhere during that reading, I started sensing something. There was a warmth and a spirit that came every time I opened the book. The feeling grew as I continued my reading. That feeling continues to this day. Every time I open the Book of Mormon, it is like turning on a switch—the Spirit flows into my heart and soul.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/there-is-power-in-the-book.p19" pid="JAH1VYEjP0aQBwQBh9eBnQ" hash="W2m6JQ">For yet others, a testimony of the Book of Mormon comes more slowly, after much study and prayer. I have a friend who read the Book of Mormon searching to know if it was true. He applied the invitation in Moroni to ask God with a sincere heart, with real intent and faith in Christ, if the Book of Mormon is true.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> But he did not immediately get the promised spiritual answer. However, one day as he was deep in thought, driving down the road, the Spirit testified to him of the truth of the Book of Mormon. So happy and overwhelmed was he that he rolled down the car window and yelled, to no one in particular and yet to all the world, “It’s true!”</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/there-is-power-in-the-book.p20" pid="TXU6gD83GUyCg_Gs1tAioA" hash="p_DrRg">Whether our testimony of the Book of Mormon comes the first time we open it or over a period of time, it will influence us all of our days if we continue to read it and apply its teachings. President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “There is a power in the book which will begin to flow into your lives the moment you begin a serious study of the book. You will find greater power to resist temptation. You will find the power to avoid deception. You will find the power to stay on the strait and narrow path.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/10/there-is-power-in-the-book.p21" pid="r9OAKw9pwkGmPbF8MIA9wQ" hash="ohpntw">I encourage everyone receiving this message, including the Aaronic Priesthood bearers convened in this meeting tonight, to discover the power of the Book of Mormon. As President Thomas S. Monson has encouraged: “Read the Book of Mormon. Ponder its teachings. Ask Heavenly Father if it is true.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> During that process you will feel the Spirit of God in your lives. That Spirit will be part of your testimony that the Book of Mormon is true, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is God’s true Church on the earth today. That testimony will help you resist temptation.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> It will prepare you for “the great call of diligence … to labor in the vineyards of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> It will stand as a sure anchor when accusations or slanderous statements are used to challenge your faith, and it will be a rock-solid foundation when you are challenged with questions you cannot answer, at least immediately. You will be able to discern truth from error, and you will feel the assurance of the Holy Ghost reconfirming your testimony over and over again as you continue to read the Book of Mormon throughout your life.</p>

As our children were growing, we read the Book of Mormon as we ate breakfast. This is the bookmark that we used. On the front is a quote from President Benson promising that God would pour out a blessing upon us as we read the Book of Mormon.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> On the back is this promise from President Marion G. Romney, formerly a counselor in the First Presidency: “I feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein. … The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to the counsel of their parents. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity—the pure love of Christ—will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

Our family is far from perfect, but we can testify of the power of the Book of Mormon and the blessings that reading it has brought and continues to bring into the lives of our whole family.</p>

Whether reading it in English, Italian, or French, in print or on an electronic device, I have found the same wonderful spirit flowing from its chapters and verses into my life. I testify of its ability to draw us closer to Christ. I pray that each of us will take full advantage of the power that is in this wonderful book of scripture. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
