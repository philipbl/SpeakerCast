A week ago Thursday, President Kimball called me on the phone and said, “Would you have time to visit with me, along with your wife?” I thought to myself, “Imagine! Do I have time to visit with the prophet?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p2" pid="n3gp_lxCRUy4kPHKVmJVXw" hash="AkRqkg">Actually, I would come from the four corners of the earth to visit with him, and so would you. I was shocked when he told me about my assignment, but of course, readily accepted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p3" pid="MHYKjJeNz0KSo1_iv2nlwg" hash="MaHjoQ">As I left his office, I <span class="emphasis">was</span> in shock. I could hardly believe what had happened to me. Then, just 3 hours and 27 minutes after that, the earthquake came. (There was an earthquake that day, centered in Malad, Idaho, but felt in Salt Lake.) This soon brought me back to reality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p4" pid="xSwDK-H-ek2hRoHt9fCaJA" hash="s-ESOA">Bryant S. Hinckley, one of the great men of the earth, wrote of my father some years ago, “No sounder piece of manhood was put together in this century of time.” (From Thomas Carlyle.) I think this applies to President Kimball as well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p5" pid="lGuOStQL0kuAoCEP0c1XvA" hash="9gLDxw">I was taught at my father’s knee to be humble, diligent, trustworthy, and to honor the servants, the General Authorities of our Church. He loved the Constitution of the United States and its free enterprise system. I trust that I will bring nothing but honor to his name.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p6" pid="vw_J3aMHF0CmZSji1NXS9Q" hash="1MloDA">My life has been encircled by two wonderful women: my mother, who gave me life itself and who reared me in the paths of truth and righteousness. Our home was one of spirituality, love, and refinement. She never permitted a shoddy performance; and in so doing, she taught us not to take too long to accomplish it. My beloved Elisa, my companion and wife, whom I love and revere, is one of the most noble of our Heavenly Father’s handmaidens. She has sustained me with an unfailing devotion; her character is similar to Rebecca of old and to her grandmothers, who were pioneers. She is a positive, stoical person, full of faith, and possesses a great love of the gospel. She has been an inspiration to me. I pay tribute to her mother and father for having reared her.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p7" pid="aR41wJ1xhEiQ4NnO_Mispg" hash="LW_ppQ">I appreciate and love each of our eight children. Their righteous lives have brought nothing but joy and happiness to us. I honor my brothers and sisters for their service in the Church and their communities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p8" pid="jejwyN2EHEmW908tLfLACg" hash="O1R98Q">I think of my coaches who taught me to play—really the game of life—and the many fine teachers in school, and especially in the Church. Sister Marion G. Romney was my Primary teacher, and President Romney was the bishop who recommended me for my mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p9" pid="GeGTJVC6LE-iyWo5ttFw_A" hash="wJWnww">Today I reflect on the many fine brethren, my associates in the Church, with whom I have worked, and I honor them for the uplifting influence they have had upon me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p10" pid="o1WnSstnvkyBw1fNBjyGmw" hash="OoQ6ng">The Sunday School organization of the Church is near and dear to my heart. Under the able leadership of President Russell M. Nelson, his fine counselors, and a talented and inspired board, this organization will do much to carry out and to help and assist the missionary effort in the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p11" pid="FR7KSNzdLU6C1gj6c1og2g" hash="zTvh_Q">I loved my mission in Switzerland and Germany. As I left on the train from Basel, Switzerland, tears flowed down my cheeks because I knew then that my full-time service in the Church had ended. I love the German and the Swiss people for their many fine traits of character. I love their language that is so exacting and yet so expressive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p12" pid="KbPwwbZz-E2spo8cgPWhKQ" hash="bsOcRQ">My life really is anchored to the testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ. I honor the priesthood that I bear, and I have seen its great power in healing the sick. I know that the Lord’s Spirit does whisper to his servants, and it is up to us to listen to these whisperings. I testify to you today that Joseph Smith is a prophet and that through him this great Church was restored and organized through revelation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/anchored-in-testimony.p13" pid="LZL-96wivE6FjVPcfkBODw" hash="10lNww">President Kimball, in the love that I bear for you and all these Brethren who sit on the stand and constitute the General Authorities of the Church, I give you my life and my service. I’ll go where you want me to go, and I’ll do my best to build up the kingdom of God here upon the earth, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p1" pid="BiIo6BGIrkKg0XDOWPQo0A" hash="bdeUAg">My brethren and sisters and friends, it is a privilege to be here in this sacred place and to attend this inspiring conference. The Spirit of the Lord is here. I have felt it, and I am confident many of you have felt it, for your sustaining faith and prayers enhance and magnify that divine presence. In truth, we are come together for the purpose of witnessing to the world that this is God’s church, that President Spencer W. Kimball is truly a prophet of our Heavenly Father. I am sure that my father would have been thrilled today to hear and to have seen Brother Lee sustained as a General Authority. He loved the Indian people as I do and you do. And so we are pleased with this appointment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p2" pid="OtMvwgQaKE-NFSMEheumRg" hash="ni5OmQ">These past six months have been the most enriching and surely the most uplifting and challenging of my entire life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p3" pid="U23960v3RkawEe-Cs5W-yQ" hash="oKALzA">We have observed a restless spirit of searching today among the people of Europe. Why? Because there is a gnawing hunger in the human heart that, if not fed by the truths of the gospel, leaves life empty and devoid of peace. The hodgepodge of economic “isms” advocated by so-called wise men of the world has solved few, if any, problems, and has brought no real joy. Such empty nostrums have led mankind to seek worldly goods and symbols of material power, blinding humanity to the truth that only the righteous life firmly established in the daily living of God’s commandments brings true happiness. Anything less leaves the heart unfed, with a yearning inner hunger—a hunger which it is our mission to identify and define and of which we should make the people aware. I have seen in Europe the fulfillment of the words of Amos, that there would be “a famine in the land, not a famine of bread … but of hearing the words of the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/8.11" class="scriptureRef">Amos 8:11</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p4" pid="WMT-h-NHh0ilaSjZynigsg" hash="lQqGBA">There are a few simple truths that I should now like to restate and reaffirm briefly. My recent experiences have caused them to loom large in my thoughts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p5" pid="5NOMS3Df3UOwjwK60qn27g" hash="Kfom-Q">First, I know as never before that there is a form of communication that transcends the power of words.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p6" pid="NWs56gaDZ0KqWXnMRlv3EA" hash="6IKi-g">Words? Indeed, they are indispensable. But there is a great deal more to understanding than the use of mere words, as all history attests. An alien spirit may reduce the clearest language to naught but a medium of futility and frustration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p7" pid="B0mvi0ds7Ea2CjBAGSBQOA" hash="ts5azg">This I have observed: There are no language barriers in the Church. There is a mighty power that transcends the power of messages conveyed by words alone, and this is the power of messages communicated by the Spirit to our hearts. In every land and clime the sweet Spirit of our Savior communicates to all who seek the truth, regardless of tongue or dialect. It is a universal messenger to every heart in tune. I have felt it everywhere in my recent experiences, regardless of the prevailing language spoken, and I testify to the power and authenticity of such communications. The Spirit is as operative today in communicating the gospel to all who seek the truth as it was on the day of Pentecost anciently.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p8" pid="WGjt75E9PEKPDpZgMeajQg" hash="6-qscQ">There is a striking description of this miracle in the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p9" pid="t9uHOh6GE0GvyotB8jo7TQ" hash="aLqQxA">“For it shall come to pass in that day, that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power, <span class="emphasis">by the administration of the Comforter,</span> shed forth upon them for the revelation of Jesus Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 90:11</a>; italics added.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p10" pid="mTExDhhStU-QWsDP_OivgQ" hash="Gt9EoA">What the power of the Spirit can communicate beyond the meaning of words is clearly seen in an experience of Brother Peter Mourik, real estate director for the Church in Europe. He met with city officials, including the mayor, to negotiate the purchase of the former city hall. If it could be purchased, it was to be converted into a meetinghouse for the Church. The mayor of the neighboring German town was also present, inasmuch as a recent change in the boundaries involved both communities in the transaction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p11" pid="mfelTek82EmrtEIan0y47g" hash="DNhMaA">The gentleman who introduced Brother Mourik to the mayors and officials did so in a spirit of levity. He said, “I want to introduce Mr. Mourik here, who represents this denomination … this sect … this group.” He finally got around to saying “This church.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p12" pid="twvcDeoyxUeLTnLPVVkpIw" hash="QYhGHw">Then Brother Mourik raised his hand and said, “Mr. Mayor, I object.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p13" pid="AMQhjMndrkiWYM0EPvxLZw" hash="b7AwIA">The mayor answered, “The meeting hasn’t even started. What are you objecting to?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p14" pid="HDA2piO4EkemXHHVXzIy_w" hash="csiKFQ">Brother Mourik replied, “Before we start, I’d like everybody to understand who and what it is I represent. I represent The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the only true church upon the face of the earth today!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p15" pid="KwAHu2CdtEGA4MCVhMlLqg" hash="lLZOUg">This statement incited laughter. Then the mayor said to the gentleman introducing Brother Mourik, “You’d better be careful what you say about this church!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p16" pid="BUyO7VaSk0aF6N9FC4KRbQ" hash="mc-X_Q">Brother Mourik thought that this had settled the preliminaries. But the mayor of the smaller town spoke up and said, “I would like to say something about this church. We have leased a schoolhouse to them for over two years. I have found them to be a very beautiful people. I go to the swimming pool on the school grounds quite often. One night I found a special gathering of their church members near the pool. They were holding a baptismal service. I sat quietly at the rear of the group and watched. They sang a hymn. I thought it was beautiful. Then someone prayed, and when he said ‘Amen,’ they all said ‘Amen.’ I was impressed with that. Then a teenage girl got up and spoke about what Christ and the Church meant to her. She was moved to tears. I, too, was deeply moved. I was further moved by the heartwarming sincerity, the oneness and spiritual unity of these people. When I went home, I said to my wife, ‘Let’s get more information about this church. We need to find out more about it.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p17" pid="dT7Fl_BZiEKnQmcz1OzMfg" hash="_fRBKg">When the mayor concluded, Brother Mourik said: “Mr. Mayor, you would make a good bishop in our church,” and they all laughed again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p18" pid="g5qddmuP1UWTuHTis7E5NQ" hash="9WAcSg">But the feeling in the meeting had changed profoundly. The Spirit of the Lord was there and was speaking to the hearts of those present. So Brother Mourik was impressed to say, “Since the mayor has explained to you what our church is about, I’m sure now you understand why we need to purchase the building at the lowest possible price.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p19" pid="Uup2gJGJJ0KyfKnlATHApg" hash="kqNmgA">The Church bought this choice piece of property at a very greatly reduced price. This was accomplished because Brother Mourik had the courage to bear his testimony. This testimony was accompanied by the power of the Spirit, which inspired the mayor to speak and which communicated a favorable conviction about the Church to the city officials. What the Spirit communicates to the hearts of men is beyond the power of words to portray!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p20" pid="BuLIhPyeAk-9gglu3oF8Fw" hash="gJYsWw">The second truth reemphasized in my missionary life is that the Lord communicates in a miraculous way his purposes to achieve. A new elder in Italy by the name of Gary D. Shaw, in following the promptings of the Spirit, discovered this reality. Elder Shaw had been in the mission field only two weeks when his senior companion became ill. The elders, as a consequence, had to remain in their apartment all day. Elder Shaw was moved by the Spirit and had a great desire to talk to someone about the gospel, so he picked up the phone book in which more than three million names were listed. He chose three. There was no response to the first call. To the second, a woman answered and informed Elder Shaw that she wasn’t at all interested, and to make matters worse, declared that she couldn’t understand his poor Italian and atrocious mode of speech. On the third try, a man answered. Elder Shaw introduced himself and received a warm response. The man said his name was Mabiglia and that he would gladly receive the elders. This he did. The appointment, made so miraculously, turned into a spiritually uplifting and inspiring occasion. After the first lesson, Mr. Mabiglia said, “How wonderful! I’ve worked for two years in a bank located on the street where the missionaries have done street-board tracting. Again and again I have practically brushed them as I passed them on the street, but I was too shy to respond to them. Now, in this miraculous way, I have met you.” At this point we should change the “Mister” to “Brother,” for after receiving the lessons, the man contacted by telephone was baptized, and Brother Mabiglia is now serving in the presidency of the Naples Branch.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p21" pid="F3SqtgWJNUuJdRSmO83fhg" hash="7Nl7dg">In the lives of the Wirthlin family, it all began over a hundred years ago with my great-grandfather, Leopold Wirthlin. He was born in Switzerland. As a young man, he embraced the gospel and was promptly disowned by his parents. This motivated him to make the long, hard trek to the Salt Lake Valley. Some years thereafter he received a call from President Brigham Young to serve a mission in Switzerland. He readily accepted. So that he could go, he sold all of his possessions. My great-grandmother sewed salt sacks at a penny apiece to support her family in his absence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p22" pid="ZyjbaXU0kUmGzsAOFA2BpQ" hash="hFOI5w">I should like to conclude with a declaration of my great-grandfather as my deepest conviction and join his words and mine together as an everlasting witness. Leopold Wirthlin said in sincerest humility, “I know that when I discharge my duty properly I feel blessed, and that when I am negligent, I am not happy. Therefore, as members of the Church, we should watch ourselves closely and see to it that we are discharging our duties faithfully.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit.p23" pid="a5hMl3YIXkSlkAiK-NEePQ" hash="__jEYA">May I add to his words these of my own: I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ and that the Father and Son appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Through him the true and everlasting gospel was restored among us, that we might attain the heights of a glorious exaltation as the beloved children of our Heavenly Father. To this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

It is the precious privilege of Latter-day Saints to live, meet, and worship in the name of the Savior of mankind, and to enjoy his sustaining and regenerating spirit in every facet and dimension of their lives.</p>

Here we have learned to know over 1,500 missionaries who radiate and communicate the reality of the truth that Jesus is in their midst. They have asked me to express their great love and appreciation for you at home. If you could hear them bear their testimonies, you would literally tingle with enthusiasm and love for the gospel truth.</p>

To most of them the gospel of Jesus Christ means everything. They have caught the spirit that is present where and when “two or three are gathered together” in the name of the Master. What the gospel does for them is tremendously and unbelievably wonderful! These young men and their families are a tribute to the Church—an inspirational force. They are among the most devoted of all our members. They have donated thousands of dollars and incalculable time and effort toward the building of chapels in Europe—chapels that most of them may never see, since they most likely will be gone home or elsewhere before the chapels are built and dedicated. The crowning glory of the work of the kingdom in Europe, however, is the thousands of faithful members who work tirelessly and joyfully both to live the gospel and to share it with others.</p>

The first step in the process of becoming a Latter-day Saint, Brother Covill was told, as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, is truly to accept the gospel, of which the Lord says, “And this is my gospel—repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/39.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 39:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p5" pid="cHauqGXeL0iM58r2CUPymA" hash="eB6BKg">Following his acceptance of the gospel, Brother Covill was charged to do what is the uncompromising obligation of all of us today. For the Lord says, “And if thou do this, I have prepared thee for a greater work. Thou shalt preach the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth in these last days, the covenant which I have sent forth to recover my people, which are of the house of Israel.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/39.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 39:11</a>.) And here is the promise made to Elder Covill: “And it shall come to pass that power shall rest upon thee; thou shalt have great faith, and I will be with thee and go before thy face.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/39.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 39:12</a>.) What is said here to James Covill in this dispensation, when the Church was only nine months old, applies with equal force to us now—and is a remarkable and powerful reiteration of the promise made by the Savior during his earthly ministry. His pledge that he will be in our midst when two or three are gathered together in his name is a wonderful declaration of his unbounded love for each of us and assures us of his presence in our church services, in our individual lives, and in the intimate circles of our families.</p>

One sister married out of the Church. She had hoped to convert her husband and then be married and sealed in the temple. She had developed one of the most lovely and spiritual personalities. Her husband, however, has never caught the spirit nor acknowledged the truth of the gospel and has been a passive influence in the religious life of his family. Nevertheless, this sister set a beautiful example for her family and drew the children to accompany her in the performance of their church duties and responsibilities. She and the children, despite what could have been a ready excuse for neglect and indifference, exemplified the admonition of Jesus when he said, “Let your light so shine before men, that [others] may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.16" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:16</a>.)</p>

As the years sped by, they carelessly omitted what they had at first intended conscientiously to do—worship together in the name of Jesus that he might be in the midst of their family activities. Although always admiring the Church and its principles, they had forgotten that they were now in fact the salt of the earth that had “lost its savor.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/there-am-i-in-the-midst-of-them.p8" pid="DnigVUJ3uEO9cLjQTm-MIw" hash="ZmTvMg">In a conversation about their children, the second sister said to the first, “Why have your children turned out so well and why are they so active in the Church despite the fact that you married out of the Church?” The first sister replied, “I took my children with me to Sunday School and sacrament meeting.” Surprised, the second sister said, “I <span class="emphasis">sent</span> mine.” And the first sister answered with greater emphasis, “But I <span class="emphasis">took</span> mine!” Hers was a case, as Jesus said, of “where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them,” and this can be true for all of us wherever we may be, at home or elsewhere.</p>

Unless we open the door and permit him to come into our lives, he can’t enter into our midst. Mere knowledge in itself may be, but it is not necessarily, power. Knowledge is not motivation. Neither is logic. That the springs of human action are inherently in the feelings, not the intellect, and that conduct generates feeling are set forth in the Doctrine and Covenants in these words: “And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:88</a>.)</p>

This explains why parents’ hearts may be broken and bowed in shame because of the sins and waywardness of their sons and daughters. They are puzzled and perplexed. They say, “We brought them up to be righteous boys and girls, and our family has always been a good family. We didn’t teach them to behave like this!” The children learned all the precepts, but precepts do not necessarily furnish the will and desire to do right. Indeed, ignorance is not the only cause of sin and deplorable conduct. Fundamental to most wrongdoing is lack of desire, the absence of a strong motive or the right influence, and a deficiency in living the precepts. Individuals who do right and “hunger and thirst after righteousness” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:6</a>) get and keep alive through their actions the feeling to do right. Inherent in the first principles of the gospel is the “desire principle”—the desire to love God and fellowmen “with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.37" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:37</a>.) To attain these heights, each of us must work in harmony with God’s will and create a spiritual climate that will bring Jesus into the midst of our lives; and then we must continue to live “with an eye single to [his] glory.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:5</a>.)</p>

What I am trying to say about the Savior’s being in our midst, whether we be two or three or many, is clearly portrayed in Paul’s eloquent description of the process of attaining spiritual perfection. He said: “For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</p>

Paul rejoiced in the fact that what he had told the Thessalonians was not meaningless words to them, for they had listened with great interest, and what was taught them produced a powerful desire for righteousness in their lives. He was explicit in stressing that the Holy Spirit also gave them full assurance that what was taught was true. He did not hesitate to say that his life, as well, was further proof to them of the truthfulness of the message. Paul was pleased that the gospel message had been received with such joy and happiness, despite many hardships. Finally, he noted what must have been their crowning achievement—that they were inspiring examples to all their neighbors and that from them the word of the Lord had extended to others everywhere, far beyond their boundaries. Paul paid tribute to them when he told them that wherever he traveled, he found people telling him about their remarkable good works and faith in God.</p>

They had often moved from place to place. When they asked the Prophet Joseph Smith about this, he said, “Build as if you are going to stay forever.” The founders of our country—as we believe, divinely inspired—built our nation to endure. And our Church leaders today never for a moment lose sight of their sacred mission. They are building for us, for those to follow, for the future, for eternity.</p>

It is also our pleasure to report that in the German Federal Republic, where we live, and in most of Europe, America’s bicentennial has not gone unnoticed. Many occasions have arisen in which respect and love have been shown to our great country, and the precious principles of freedom and dignity which we accord the individual have been honored.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/dikes-versus-living-water.p3" pid="b3h9CIcFkkKAv_65l6u0PA" hash="FiCsMg">The sentiments of these nations may be portrayed in the words of one distinguished ambassador, General Carlos Romulo, as he left our shores after serving his government here for nearly a score of years. He said, “I admire and love America. … What I have to say in parting is both a tribute and a warning. Never forget, Americans, that yours is a spiritual country. Yes, I know that you are a practical people. Like others, I have marveled at your factories, your skyscrapers, and your arsenals. But underlying everything else is the fact that America began as a God-loving, God-fearing, God-worshiping people, knowing that there is a spark of the divine in each of us. It is this respect for the dignity of the human spirit which makes America invincible.”</p>

Those attending will never forget how magnificently they were uplifted and spiritually fed and how wonderfully their testimonies were fortified.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/dikes-versus-living-water.p6" pid="qsvkqniM5Eawd2J1kq879A" hash="1m8wag">In Amsterdam, during the several days we were together, we visited with some of our members, and our conversation turned to one thing that is unique about the country, the dikes. Much of the Netherlands lies considerably below sea level, as you well know. Through the process of building dikes to wall out the salty sea and through pumping the water into canals, the country of the ingenious, resourceful, and doughty Dutch has literally been born of the sea.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/dikes-versus-living-water.p7" pid="KenCqvvoMEGJr--WBDD9jw" hash="U9q7oA">The process of wresting the good and precious earth from the bitter ocean waters has been going on for over 700 years, and there is no abatement of the struggle in sight. The gigantic dikes, or sea walls, may rise as high as sixty feet and are often broad enough on the top for a road over which a regular flow of traffic may be driven. The other side of the dike usually slopes down to green meadows. Thus, those on the dike can see down the chimneys of the houses nestling below; the fish on the one side are higher than the birds in the trees on the other.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/dikes-versus-living-water.p8" pid="fFPVSkHsNkCarNDCMvzE7w" hash="HEvQ8Q">Then our discussion turned to the question of safety, and it was agreed that there are no dikes tall enough, wide enough, deep enough, or strong enough to give man the security for which his soul cries out, for which he instinctively yearns, and for which he often frantically searches.</p>

Waves chewed like bulldozers at the historic dikes of Holland, breaking through in at least 70 places, to reclaim what centuries of Dutch ingenuity has taken from the sea. … To the north, the flood crest went as high as 30 feet. … In a matter of hours, roughly a sixth of the Netherlands’ 13,000 square miles—an area where 1,000,000 Dutchmen make their homes—was devastated.” The desolation here and in nearby countries had taken a toll of over 1,500 known dead.</p>

The globe is constantly threatened by forces, both man-made and inherent in our dwelling places, so devastating and capricious as to stun and stagger us. And when I speak of forces, I mean the innumerable threats to life of every type and kind that abound on the earth, in the earth, and around the earth, whether it be here, in the Netherlands, or elsewhere in the broad universe.</p>

And since we as a church have the sure answer to mankind’s emotional and psychological problems in the gospel of Jesus Christ, it is most urgent that we continue to “lengthen our stride” to reach forlorn, lonely, hungry, and thirsty hearts, and those whose quest is for the truth.</p>

He had been a teacher at an elementary school in Scottsdale, Arizona. He had developed a burning desire to swim the English Channel and had trained for two long, grueling years, swimming great distances every day under all kinds of weather conditions in order to build up his strength and endurance. He was the first paraplegic ever to attempt the twenty-one-mile swim across the Channel. The strong, treacherous currents, however, require the swimmer to cover a far greater distance than that in order to reach the opposite shore.</p>

Wearing a wet suit, flippers, and snorkel, he was carried to the beach at Dover by his cousins, Tom and Don Philabaum, where he crawled into the sea. Tom and Don, in the boat that accompanied him, fed him every hour. Jack had hoped to reach the French coast in fifteen hours. “For twelve hours the swim went well,” he said. “Then I found myself swimming against the tide.” The coast was near, but conditions had decidedly changed. “I gave it all I had,” he declared. “Tom was urging me from the boat, saying, ‘You’ve got to do it.’ We were so close to France, and yet so far. It was the last few miles that completely drained me. The tides defeated me!” the swimmer exclaimed. His strength ebbed away as he tried to cope with the formidable obstacles in his path. (From <span class="emphasis">Stars and Stripes.</span>)</p>

The tides of life often challenge us. To understand why it has to be this way, we should maintain our understanding, our faith, and our courage by a constant rereading of Second Nephi, chapter two, the substance of which is set forth in this excerpt: “For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:11</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/dikes-versus-living-water.p15" pid="Ke-sO2lf1UmZK5s7yybQJw" hash="xl2y0A">Now let me make a suggestion that will enable us to maintain our spiritual strength and keep our testimonies vitally alive so that the trials, the storms, and the tides of life will not defeat us. This suggestion is that, above all, we should heed the words of Jesus to the woman at Jacob’s well in Samaria when he said, “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him will never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/4.14" class="scriptureRef">John 4:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/dikes-versus-living-water.p16" pid="zpBIEsTgyUKGL6LOKzt65g" hash="7NhXtg">How could one’s strength ebb or falter when it may be so dependably and continuously nourished and restored? Here it is made clear that life, at its best and most vigorous, is spiritual and, as such, is the sincere expression of the soul to God. The spiritual self of each of us is that part of us that will never grow old, or ill, or die, but it must be nurtured and invigorated! Drinking of the living water is the unique recipe, the only way! My testimony is that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, who stands at the head of our church, and that President Spencer W. Kimball is our prophet, seer, and revelator, who is guiding the destiny of the true church of our Savior. To this, I testify with all the strength I possess, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

One such memory was the mission conference we attended last year at Dresden, DDR (or East Germany). A president of the Church had not visited there since 1936—a span of over forty years. Now, at last, the prayers of the people were to be answered. President Kimball, it was announced, would be present at the mission conference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/let-your-light-so-shine.p2" pid="vcIt_fpeH02uqH9oKJQjwA" hash="aWkCZA">Over 1,200 people, Saints and investigators, came from far and near to hear the prophet speak. Some of them traveled several hundred miles. As the hour for the meeting approached it seemed as if there wasn’t room for even one more person. Not to be denied this grand experience, one brother obtained an unwieldy ladder and placed it alongside a window so that he could see and hear President Kimball and be part of the congregation. As I looked at him, he smiled, and I understood the message of that smile. He was thrilled and grateful to be present, even though he was poised precariously on the top rung of that fifteen-foot ladder throughout the two-hour session.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/let-your-light-so-shine.p3" pid="qWkJ60sEQ0mEQK68nKThMw" hash="2CQqAQ">There was scarcely a dry eye in that packed audience as President Kimball spoke. He not only blessed and inspired the large congregation, and the brother on the stepladder, but also a sister in a wheelchair, as well. Sister Margarete Hellmann had suffered an ailment of the hip since youth. As the years came and went, the affliction brought her an ever-increasing burden of pain. Finally, she could walk only with the aid of a pair of crutches. To facilitate her travel from place to place, and to alleviate the terrible pain she keenly felt with every single step, some of the Saints contributed money and bought her a wheelchair. But this relief was short-lived. Soon, even sitting in her wheelchair was accompanied by almost unbearable pain. Then an inflammation of the nerves on the left side of her face further intensified her suffering. One day she heard the heartening news: the prophet of the Lord was to be in Dresden. She had one all-consuming desire—to attend the conference and touch the prophet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/let-your-light-so-shine.p4" pid="Dnew-RylgU6skTyRPviqZg" hash="BYG9Cg">She had faith and the absolute conviction that the prophet would not even have to take the time to lay his hands upon her head and give her a blessing. She felt assured that it would be with her as it was with a certain woman who, according to St. Mark, had suffered for twelve years and still grew worse. And “when she had heard of Jesus, … she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.” This she did, and Jesus “said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/5.25-34" class="scriptureRef">Mark 5:25–34</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/let-your-light-so-shine.p5" pid="9dm26EaLx02Wh1Nep5nDUw" hash="v-2yng">Sister Hellmann had asked her grandson, Frank, to bring her to the service at an early hour and position her wheelchair near the aisle where the prophet was to pass. This statement from her letter tells the rest of the story in her tender words: “When our prophet came close to me,” she wrote, “he warmly shook my hand and looked at me in the spirit of love, as did those who were with him. After that, I did not feel any more pain—not then, nor any to this day. That is the greatest testimony of my life!”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/let-your-light-so-shine.p7" pid="35uR7ySCwk6MorGm5uYb6g" hash="TyYSVA">Brethren, my fervent hope is for every one of us to be as willing as the man on the ladder to inconvenience ourselves for the sake of the gospel. And I would pray that each one of us could develop a faith as strong as that of the sister in the wheelchair.</p>

We honor our priesthood by making an intrinsic part of our every thought and action those great teachings that Jesus proclaimed during his glorious ministry on earth and that are still proclaimed today through latter-day revelation. We honor our priesthood through prayer, pure thoughts, clean language, wholesome appearance, service to others, and through striving for the powerful, personal conversion that will help us to withstand the temptations of the day. In addition to being shining examples in our individual lives, let’s make sure that we strengthen our homes and families and, at the same time, do all we can to reach out with understanding to encourage and bring blessings into the lives of the single adults of our church.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/let-your-light-so-shine.p16" pid="AZddiRz-6Eu2M2Z1rCridg" hash="eme-8g">Jesus wants every one of us to know him because of the transforming power of that knowledge and because of the indescribable joy it brings into our lives. But the influence of the gospel is to extend beyond each individual. It is to be as a light that dispels the darkness from the lives of those around us. No one of us is saved solely and simply for himself alone, just as no lamp is lighted merely for its own benefit.</p>

This schism is dramatically set forth in a recent issue of <span class="emphasis">Time</span> magazine and is entitled “New Debate Over Jesus’ Divinity.” Many modern scholars express the view that “Jesus did not proclaim himself as the eternal Son of God, nor did the early Christians.” Seven university theologians in England published a book contending that Jesus was not really God at all. In America much of the same is going on. An eminent clergyman expressed the conviction of many “that Jesus never claimed to be God, nor to be related to him as son.” In summarizing, <span class="emphasis">Time</span> said that “in view of the new Christology (of the so-called Christian advocates) Christ is not as divine as he used to be.” (<span class="emphasis">Time,</span> 27 Feb. 1978.)</p>

On the divinity of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the position of the restored church and its members is eloquently stated by Elder James E. Talmage in these words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/let-your-light-so-shine.p19" pid="xnVJlJMlGUauCC4zxvWpVQ" hash="i2x_zQ">“The solemn testimonies of millions dead and of millions living unite in proclaiming Him as divine, the Son of the Living God, the Redeemer and Savior of the human race, the Eternal Judge of the souls of men, the Chosen and Anointed of the Father—in short, the Christ.” (<span class="emphasis">Jesus the Christ,</span> 3rd ed., Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916, pp. 1–2.)</p>

It never at any time or place falters, hesitates, or shows any reluctance to bear unwavering testimony to the divinity of Jesus Christ. The state of the world being what it is, each priesthood bearer must take advantage of every opportunity to testify of the Savior and teach and exemplify gospel truth, letting his light so shine before friends and strangers alike to perpetuate the truth concerning our Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>

Duty is too often what one expects from others and not what one does. What people think and believe and plan are all very important, but what they <span class="emphasis">do</span> is the thing that counts most. It is a call to throw out selfishness and to think of the common good of all.</p>

When we accept duties willingly and faithfully, we find happiness. Those who make happiness the chief objective of life are bound to fail, for happiness is a by-product rather than an end in itself. Happiness comes from doing one’s duty and knowing that his life is in harmony with God and his commandments. The members of the Jamaica Branch know that they are living in harmony with our Father’s commandments, and this brings them great happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/let-every-man-learn-his-duty.p16" pid="OcvId7TkuUCanV8ZexntDQ" hash="CxxMMA">A group of missionaries, also in Jamaica, understood their duties to teach the gospel to everyone who would hear their message. As all missionaries are, they were very dependent on their monthly checks from home, but in Jamaica the banking rules dictated that after the checks were presented at the bank for cash, a two-month waiting period had to elapse before the cash could be provided. This was very inconvenient and frustrating to the missionaries, and they agreed that it would be impossible for them to continue to endure such an arrangement. They would have to do something about it—and do something they did! The bank manager was taught the gospel, was baptized, and as a result the check-cashing problem was magically solved. Those elders knew their duty and accomplished it with faith and diligence.</p>

They could obtain some staples essential to good nutrition but only after prolonged and tedious trouble and waiting. Another problem, another solution: teach and baptize the grocer. This they did, and thereafter had no problem in obtaining the food they needed and wanted.</p>

But bicycles often break down and parts wear out. And there are often delays in obtaining parts and having repairs made. Again, the solution was obvious—teach and baptize the bicycle repairman. At last report, he was responding to the missionaries’ friendship and testimonies.</p>

That gentleman wrote a check in full for the structure and then handed the keys back to the builder. “The home you have just built, my boy,” he said with a pleasant smile, “is my present to you. May you live in it in great happiness!”</p>

Larsen beautifully summarized this idea in these words: “When we understand what is right and what is wrong, we are in a position to exercise our freedom in making choices. In so doing, we must stand accountable for our decisions, and we cannot escape the inevitable consequences of these choices. Such freedom to exercise moral agency is essential in an environment where people have the highest prospects for progress and development.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>May 1980, p. 76.)</p>

A sports editor wrote that for such a small country, East Germany, or as the world knows it, the German Democratic Republic, was doing exceedingly well. He said that they were not that much better trained than their competitors, but just a lot better prepared mentally, spending many hours in the preparation of the mind and the will. “Just good old-fashioned positive mental attitude” is all that is favoring the athletes from that country.

All inactive members should be considered candidates for activation regardless of their response to any previous approach. We must use kindness, patience, long-suffering, love, faith, and diligence. They must feel our genuine concern and untiring love.</p>

He attempted to sidestep this phone call and responded, “Tell the bishop that I’m out sawing logs,” and with a humorous touch, “Tell him I’m dead.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p20" pid="87ama4RDQEyeBcEW6d1CSA" hash="6QDWcA">The brother spoke the truth more literally than he realized. It was true. He was sawing logs, and tragically, he was dead to the spiritual things of his life.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p26" pid="5dmtKuu1N0agWI7UzLVPAg" hash="1zoXuw">In another ward, the bishop assigned his two best home teachers to work with one specially selected inactive family. The husband and father had been inactive for many years, even though he held the office of elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood. The couple was approached and asked if the special teachers could come and teach them the gospel in weekly visits to their home. The family agreed, and the teachers proceeded to bring gospel lessons tailored to the needs and desires of the family.</p>

The husband usually went golfing on Sundays and had no desire to change his life-style at first. During one interview, the bishop said to the husband, “You’ve got to get going on spiritual matters so that you won’t lose your fine family.” This caused the inactive brother to think deeply about important issues, and within a couple of weeks he asked for another interview with the bishop and said that he had started paying tithing and that he and his wife wanted to set a goal of being sealed in the temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/restoring-the-lost-sheep.p28" pid="4sLPmzroIkm62mbt6P6mtg" hash="rIxRJw">As this family became active, their whole attitude changed, and they seemed to be very happy to embrace the gospel principles and make the necessary change in life-style.</p>

The teachers first showed genuine friendship and neighborly concern until they felt they could talk with the inactive family in a serious manner. They sat down with the family one day and asked if they could begin teaching them the gospel in weekly sessions in their home. The teachers assured the family that they would not pressure them in any way and that their visits would be designed to teach the doctrines of the Savior and answer questions the family might have. Within a few weeks, the home teachers took the family to church, and soon the family began to attend on their own. The bishop interviewed the couple and helped them to set goals for the husband to be ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood and for them to be sealed in the temple.</p>

I asked the question, “How did you accomplish this?” He said, “We and the home teachers visited them often. These inactive elders knew that we really cared for them.” Their testimonies were strengthened. They and their families are now active members of the Church.</p>

As a matter of fact, she was a Mother Superior at a home for poor children and orphans. Toward the end of a four-year teaching assignment early in her life as a nun, doctors discovered a cancer in her throat. Her mother had died of this same disease. Although she knew that her deteriorating health might lead to certain death, she had a strong feeling that she had not finished her work on earth. She prayed with great faith for the restoration of her health and was healed, with no further problems or need for medical care.</p>

She declined, saying that she already had been baptized. The elders persisted by inviting her to read the Book of Mormon. The elders told her, “If this book is the true word of God, then Joseph Smith is a true prophet and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true.

The obscenity, nudity, and other forms of pornography that would have made us blush and turn away in shame in 1947 are now thrust at us openly in printed and audiovisual material. They are even paraded through our homes unless we are careful to keep them out. As a people, we are slipping further from our old moorings today because we are not following our prophets.</p>

However, I believe that a lack of patience is a major cause of the difficulties and unhappiness in the world today. Too often, we are impatient with ourselves, with our family members and friends, and even with the Lord. We seem to demand what we want right now, regardless of whether we have earned it, whether it would be good for us, or whether it is right. Some seek immediate gratification or numbing of every impulse by turning to alcohol and drugs, while others seek instant material wealth by questionable investments or by dishonesty, with little or no regard for the consequences. Perhaps the practice of patience is more difficult, yet more necessary, now than at any previous time.</p>

Welker of the German-Austrian Mission, one of the outstanding mission presidents of the Church, needed to assign a missionary to labor in Salzburg, Austria, to solve a problem in the branch there. Eight new missionaries were soon to arrive in the mission. He prayed that one of them would have the proper visa and currency to labor in Austria. He continued to pray and waited two weeks for an answer. The night before the eight arrived, the Spirit of the Lord whispered to the president the name of the missionary who should be assigned to Salzburg. The one whose name he received was the one who had the proper credentials to go to Austria. I was that elder.</p>

Shortly after I arrived in Salzburg, that part of the German-Austrian Mission was changed into the Swiss-Austrian Mission. Later, I was transferred to Zurich, Switzerland, where I met Brother Julius Billeter, a warm and friendly member who was a genealogist. He was acquainted with the genealogical records of my progenitors. He researched the names of 6,000 of my ancestors for whom temple work later was completed.</p>

Recognizing our strengths and our weaknesses, we should strive to use good judgment in all of our choices and decisions, make good use of every opportunity, and do our best in every task we undertake. We should not be unduly discouraged nor in despair at any time when we are doing the best we can. Rather, we should be satisfied with our progress even though it may come slowly at times.</p>

Rather than expecting immediate or spectacular manifestations, though they will come when needed, we should pray for a testimony, study the scriptures, follow the counsel of our prophet and other Church leaders, and live the principles of the gospel. Our testimonies then will grow and mature naturally, perhaps imperceptibly at times, until they become driving forces in our lives.</p>

Don’t expect perfection. Find agreeable ways to work out the differences that arise. Remember President David O. McKay’s wise counsel regarding marriage: keep your eyes wide open before marriage and half closed afterward (see Conference Report, Apr. 1956, p. 9). Perhaps, on occasion, our wives could get into the car and honk the horn while we, as husbands, get the children ready.</p>

If they seem to be out of touch on such vital issues as dating, clothing styles, modern music, and use of family cars, listen to them anyway. They have the experience that you lack. Very few, if any, of the challenges and temptations you face are new to them.

As Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, “Patience is tied very closely to faith in our Heavenly Father. Actually, when we are unduly impatient, we are suggesting that we know what is best—better than does God. Or, at least, we are asserting that our timetable is better than his.

What is our course, what is our goal, and what are the obstacles and opposition that would hinder or divert us?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p3" pid="CZP63zK6BE2wW0eWohlfSQ" hash="4Hpf-Q">Our course as members of the Church should be compliance with the principles and ordinances of the gospel. Our goal should be to fill the measure of our creation as sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father—that is, to reach exaltation and eternal life. The obstacles and opposition we meet are the temptations and enticements of Satan that are designed to frustrate the Lord’s work and glory: “To bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p4" pid="6KX-uxGxjk6R7y3pXR_bGA" hash="MK7qog">Perseverance is a positive, active characteristic. It is not idly, passively waiting and hoping for some good thing to happen. It gives us hope by helping us realize that the righteous suffer no failure except in giving up and no longer trying.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p5" pid="NMcy4_l48UmbHZ6dy-qWPg" hash="-g8PZQ">When some people have a difficult job to do, they give up everything else until that job is finished. Others just give up. The need to persevere is expressed in the following lines:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p6" pid="nO_PQ9Txqk-dSgR_IxsJmQ" hash="TcMpfQ">“Genius is only the power of making continuous efforts. The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it; so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it. How many a man has thrown up his hands at a time when a little more effort, a little more patience would have achieved success? A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed a hopeless failure may turn into a glorious success. … There is no defeat except within, no really insurmountable barrier save one’s own inherent weakness of purpose” (author unknown, <span class="emphasis">Second Encyclopedia,</span> ed. Jacob M. Brand, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1957, p. 152).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p7" pid="VnViDKUwK0eHnxi1iAoEgA" hash="Vip-yA">We have numerous examples of perseverance in the scriptures, in secular history, and in our own experiences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p8" pid="clj_obzkNku6q-ymOG0RLA" hash="MQZzDA">Perhaps the best-known Old Testament example of perseverance is the story of Job. As you know, it narrates the afflictions that befell a righteous man and considers reasons for those afflictions. It does not entirely answer the question of why Job, or anyone, might suffer pain and sorrow, but does state clearly that affliction is not necessarily a sign of God’s anger and a punishment for sin, as Job’s friends told him. The book suggests that affliction, if not for punishment, may be for experience, discipline, and instruction (see Bible Dictionary, LDS edition of the King James Version, s.v. “Job”).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p9" pid="jou7oWUtLU2C6MYXfVhpow" hash="iUyPmQ">I do not know of anything that members of the Church need more than they need the conviction and perseverance of Job. He was a just man who feared God and avoided evil. After the Lord allowed Satan to torment Job, his afflictions included the loss of his seven sons and three daughters, the loss of his wealth in flocks and herds and serious physical illnesses. Remaining faithful to the Lord through his indescribable sorrow and suffering, Job was able to say, “Blessed be the name of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/1.21" class="scriptureRef">Job 1:21</a>). “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him. … He also shall be my salvation. … For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth … yet in my flesh shall I see God” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/13.15-16" class="scriptureRef">Job 13:15–16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/job/19.25-26" class="scriptureRef">Job 19:25–26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p10" pid="2VEKMNNpaUmSobStB6MLeQ" hash="N4cz-w">The result of Job’s perseverance is told in the conclusion of the story. The Lord blessed him with a family, good health, and great possessions. He continued in his course, despite unrelenting opposition, until he saw the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/job/42.5" class="scriptureRef">Job 42:5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p11" pid="08Cct_wcx0u2nzZHye683A" hash="X272JA">The Book of Mormon is filled with stories of great people who endured to the very end, from Lehi and his family through Moroni, the son of Mormon. The life of Moroni is especially instructive in teaching perseverance. The obstacles he faced may seem beyond belief to us. He saw the entire Nephite nation destroyed by the sword in a terrible war because of the wickedness of the people. His father and all of his kinsfolk and friends were slain. He was alone for about twenty years, perhaps hiding and fleeing from savage Lamanites who sought to take his life (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.2-7" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:2–7</a>). Yet he continued to keep the record as his father had commanded him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p12" pid="p9RuxfuWqUSKpX0qo0SKYg" hash="hI-VnA">As a result of his perseverance and righteousness, he was ministered to by the Three Nephites, whom the Savior permitted to tarry until His second coming (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.11" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:11</a>). In these latter days, Moroni had the divine commission of instructing Joseph Smith in his calling as the Prophet of the Restoration and delivering the Book of Mormon record to him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p13" pid="-P3S5WH4A0Wi_Y20PdafRQ" hash="sztKEQ">Joseph Smith’s determination and perseverance is another good example. After reading <a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a>, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him,” Joseph knew that he must do as James directed or remain in darkness and confusion. From the moment he knelt in prayer, he encountered enormous obstacles and opposition. First, an evil, unseen power seized him. Then, he wrote, “Just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p14" pid="51PStvG3VUuUYbbahoe_0Q" hash="-SaAFw">“It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me. … One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—‘This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!’” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.16-17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:16–17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p15" pid="i971vUjaz0meri19KXFkuw" hash="g78nqA">This marvelous event, near the start of the Prophet’s mortal ministry, proved to be a pattern in his life. He suffered ridicule, violent attack by his enemies, betrayal by close associates whom he had trusted, forcible separation from his loved ones, trial and imprisonment on false charges, and, finally, martyrdom at the hands of a mob. Yet he remained true to the charge he had received and served faithfully in his calling as the Prophet to usher in the dispensation of the fulness of times. In addition to seeing our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, he received instruction and counsel from angels and other heavenly beings throughout his life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p16" pid="3o7jbmccUUCu1CRbolourA" hash="sL44YQ">Secular history also teaches the principle of perseverance. Winston Churchill is well known for his determination as the leader of Great Britain during World War II. On one occasion in his later years, he returned to a school where he had studied as a boy. Before he arrived, the headmaster told the students, “The greatest Britisher of our time is going to come to this school, and I want every one of you to be here with your notebooks. I want you to write down what he says, because his speech will be something for you to remember all your lives.” The elderly statesman came in and was introduced. His glasses were down on the end of his nose, as usual. He stood and delivered the following words from an immortal speech that he once gave in Parliament. He said, “Never, never, never give up.” Then he sat down. That was the speech. It was unmatched (see “These Are Great Days,” in <span class="emphasis">War Speeches,</span> ed. Charles Eada, Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1942, pp. 286–88). His message was indeed something to be remembered by every boy who heard it and by each of us. We must never give up, regardless of temptations, frustrations, disappointments, or discouragements.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p17" pid="pbnoGMBMbEOyoyK8cvq0bw" hash="GGO36A">I believe that perseverance is vital to success in any endeavor, whether spiritual or temporal, large or small, public or personal. Think seriously of how important perseverance, or the lack of it, has been in your own endeavors, such as Church callings, schooling, or employment. I believe that essentially all significant achievement results largely from perseverance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p18" pid="2ZY6jyvsgUWW4DjQYJinaw" hash="7eG6Hw">By applying this principle, some of our finest legacies have been produced. For example, John Milton was blind when he wrote <span class="emphasis">Paradise Lost.</span> Ludwig von Beethoven was deaf when he finished some of his greatest musical compositions. Abraham Lincoln was laughed at as a gangling, awkward country boy who had many failures; but he became one of the greatest and most eloquent presidents of the United States. Florence Nightingale devoted her life to save the lives of countless wounded soldiers. All of these people left a permanent mark on the world. Their example should give hope to all of us. They succeeded not only because the Lord had endowed them with gifts, as he has each of us in varying degrees, but because they applied themselves steadfastly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p19" pid="VG3yqha2bUmjUTXuKB6oGQ" hash="WtjNyw">Of course, the ultimate example of perseverance is our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, who has and will overcome every obstacle in doing the will of our Heavenly Father. Indeed, Jesus is perfect in perseverance and has taught us to be perfect even as he and his Father are perfect (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:48</a>). Studying his life can help us learn and live this important principle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p20" pid="xjVYoSzEQUqkh0RDJNrJOA" hash="wk4jTw">From the time of the premortal council, in which Jesus became the Christ, the Messiah, the Savior of all mankind, through his millennial reign, he has and will persevere in perfection, doing all that his Father commanded. Because of his love for us, he offered to fulfill the plan of salvation with these words, “Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:2</a>). How different from Satan’s response to the plan: “I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; … give me thine honor” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:1</a>). The conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil persists in the world today—with Jesus persevering in striving to save souls, and Satan striving to destroy them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p21" pid="yqcPAJm8t0WTwP1VKtq_Pg" hash="qi3H9A">During his mortal ministry, as the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh, Jesus again taught the gospel. At the beginning of this ministry, we see his perseverance in one of the most stirring dramas ever recorded. He completely overcame every temptation that the cunning of Satan could devise (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.1-11" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:1–11</a>). After Jesus had fasted forty days and forty nights, gathering miraculous inner strength, came a battle of opposing powers in the wilderness of Judea. First, Satan tempted Jesus by appealing to the basic appetite of hunger, asking him to transform stones into bread. Jesus held to his divine course and refused. Satan next tempted the Savior to cast himself down from a pinnacle of the temple, saying angels would protect him if he were the Son of God. Jesus refused this request to misuse his divine power, saying, “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:7</a>). Satan seldom gives up. He next appealed to a drive that causes the downfall of otherwise invulnerable individuals—the almost irresistible hunger to have great possessions. Satan showed all the kingdoms of the world and offered them to Jesus if he would worship him. Jesus commanded Satan to leave, saying, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.10" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:10</a>). This is the type of perseverance in the face of temptation that each of us can and must exercise if we are to avoid the misery of sin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p22" pid="GvUvB6oanEOylCWK4OWO0g" hash="Sc9-sQ">Jesus persevered through the final days of his mortal life as the mood of the people changed from shouts of “Hosanna to the Son of David” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/21.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 21:9</a>) to cries of “Crucify him” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/15.13" class="scriptureRef">Mark 15:13</a>). He endured the indignities and physical abuse of his trials before Jewish and Roman leaders. Through his atonement and resurrection, he provided for all mankind both immortality and the possibility of eternal life. He paid the penalty for our sins if we will repent of them. How grateful I am for the effect upon me of his love and his perseverance!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p23" pid="J4rFs1X0l0Sm1XTWa4ybfQ" hash="M-qusA">Probably few of us will face opposition and obstacles like those encountered by the great ones I have mentioned. However, we each have our own challenges and trials to overcome as we strive to keep on the right course. Often the most important trials are those we must face and subdue privately within our own hearts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/never-give-up.p24" pid="AmvaqtyQMk2EONXbsnyG9w" hash="O_QD8A">I bear testimony that perseverance is essential to us in learning and living the principles of the gospel and that it will determine our progress as we strive to reach exaltation. Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. He directs this Church. I am grateful to labor in his service and to be a special witness of his divinity. The gospel has been restored in these latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith. President Ezra Taft Benson is our prophet, seer, and revelator. May we follow his stirring address this morning. I bear this testimony humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p2" pid="ZvEC7ABuH0OfkswYWwYdhg" hash="U_sMSg">Early in his mortal ministry, the Savior soon had a multitude of disciples drawn to him by the power of his presence and the spirit of his message. From among these disciples, he chose twelve to be his special witnesses. “And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.13" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p3" pid="j1ZR1mH1Lk-YwCQdDmH1KA" hash="BvZw5Q">Clearly, Jesus had chosen them; he said, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.16" class="scriptureRef">John 15:16</a>). These twelve were common men from various walks of life. The Savior selected them because he could see far beyond their earthly appearance and look into their hearts, recognizing their potential.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p4" pid="Bv_9ZI6GPkytjBci0L9Dkg" hash="eDoOGg">After the Savior called Peter, Andrew, and Philip, Philip introduced Jesus to Nathanael, whom some scholars believe to be Bartholomew, the Apostle. Philip said to Nathanael, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.45" class="scriptureRef">John 1:45</a>). In this statement, Philip testified that Jesus is the Messiah. Nathanael wondered whether any good thing could come out of Nazareth, indicating the relatively bad reputation of Nazareth in those days. Philip asked him to come and see. This is the perfect answer to all who seek to know the truth about Christ. Impartial investigators are converted when they come and see.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p5" pid="tHLfR4pMQUaZfageUfmJcg" hash="BsLfyQ">When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he exclaimed of Nathanael, “Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.47" class="scriptureRef">John 1:47</a>). At that moment, Nathanael recognized that Jesus could see into his heart and asked, in surprise, “Whence knowest thou me?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.48" class="scriptureRef">John 1:48</a>). The Savior’s reply demonstrated an even greater power of perception. He told Nathanael that before Philip had called him to come and see, Jesus saw him under a fig tree.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p6" pid="P2KzUwduZ0OMewHZbRdqTQ" hash="jivjAw">Nathanael apparently had undergone some surpassing spiritual experience while praying, or meditating, or worshipping under a fig tree. The Lord, though absent in body, had been present with Nathanael in spirit. Nathanael then recognized the Savior as the Christ and said, “Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.49" class="scriptureRef">John 1:49</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p7" pid="46dYMWPLr0m3MsGMXDmM4A" hash="WuvPLg">Nathanael spoke without guile. The words came from his heart. They expressed a deep conviction of truth. He followed the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p8" pid="aa3CKp3WfkGXEWEA0sMxtg" hash="QV_knw">To be without guile is to be free of deceit, cunning, hypocrisy, and dishonesty in thought or action. To beguile is to deceive or lead astray, as Lucifer beguiled Eve in the Garden of Eden. A person without guile is a person of innocence, honest intent, and pure motives, whose life reflects the simple practice of conforming his daily actions to principles of integrity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p9" pid="sETfi7F6TkW46b_PbuJyLg" hash="df7T9A">The psalmist wrote, “Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/32.2" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 32:2</a>), and then admonished, “Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/34.13" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 34:13</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p10" pid="FtcDDnZ9RUuvGPrI5mHtXg" hash="A40sDw">In the New Testament, we learn that the Savior was without guile (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 2:22</a>) and that “he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 3:10</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p11" pid="kVNE0q-jGE6hmfdSf9DZjQ" hash="F3Dg7A">In latter-day scriptures, we read that the Lord called Edward Partridge to be bishop for the Church because “his heart is pure before me, for he is like unto Nathanael of old, in whom there is no guile” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/41.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 41:11</a>). In another revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord said, “My servant George Miller is without guile; he may be trusted because of the integrity of his heart; and for the love which he has to my testimony I, the Lord, love him” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 124:20</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p12" pid="AX3LChLEd0-TgCb0zR6Y9g" hash="m4KVFA">These passages of scripture help me understand what the Lord could see in Nathanael, Edward Partridge, and George Miller, and give me some insight into what he expects of the Saints. I believe the Savior was seeking purity of soul in those he called to be his twelve Apostles. When he spoke of being without guile, he referred to something far deeper than outward appearance. He was reaching into the soul, to the very heart of righteousness. He was touching the key to goodness and to the Christlike life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p13" pid="-NWXcD654EmrhkVuVkBefw" hash="rXAZCw">To be without guile is to be pure in heart—an essential virtue of those who would be counted among true followers of Christ. He taught in the Sermon on the Mount, “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.8" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:8</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.8" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:8</a>). He revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith that Zion is the pure in heart (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 97:21</a>) and that a house is to be built in Zion in which the pure in heart shall see God (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97.10-16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 97:10–16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p14" pid="6EM9sU9VvkuMHflWxrPl4Q" hash="FxXCFQ">If we are without guile, we are honest, true, and righteous. All of these are attributes of Deity and are required of the Saints. Those who are honest are fair and truthful in their speech, straightforward in their dealings, free of deceit, and above stealing, misrepresentation, or any other fraudulent action. Honesty is of God and dishonesty of the devil; the devil was a liar from the beginning. Righteousness is living a life that is in harmony with the laws, principles, and ordinances of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p15" pid="CSsWyMZtf0SQ9bhICHcwow" hash="pjUX5Q">As parents know, little children are, by their nature, without guile. They speak the thoughts of their minds without reservation or hesitance as we have learned as parents when they embarrass us at times. They do not deceive. They set an example of being without guile. The Savior taught of this attribute of little children when his disciples asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p16" pid="ej-PGxozHk603zxqzreTqQ" hash="_V0zyA">“And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p28" pid="J60CPi_Tv0Wb4PZi7xjnTw" hash="xWyJSQ">I believe the necessity for the members of the Church to be without guile may be more urgent now than at other times because many in the world apparently do not understand the importance of this virtue or are indifferent to it. We see and hear reports of fraud and deception in all levels of our society. A few citizens of some nations betray their country by exchanging sensitive information for money, information they have stolen or with which they have been entrusted. The entertainment industry seems to have lost, in large measure, the concept of moral values. Employees falsify expense accounts. These few examples of guile illustrate how pervasive it is.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p29" pid="3IbH8IqtOEmpZ0ZO9BsbDA" hash="r2lXhw">Of far greater concern than the outward acts of guile are the inner feelings and the attitudes that motivate them. Fraud and deception appear to be increasingly acceptable; the only wrongdoing seems to be in being caught. The objective often is to get gain or to profit, regardless of the injury, loss, or damage to others. This attitude is totally contrary to the principles of the gospel. It hinders or thwarts the spiritual progress of anyone afflicted by it. The practice of guile prevents the Holy Ghost from prompting, guiding, and instructing us, leaving us ever more susceptible to the buffetings of Satan. When we break the commandments, we close ourselves to God’s influence and open ourselves to Satan’s influence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p30" pid="8UtU69yv0UKSQeouSFNmdQ" hash="TCalwA">If we practice guile in small matters, we soon can find ourselves entangled in an ever-increasing, unending spiral, because each lie or other deception often requires a larger one to cover the first. Moreover, the practice of guile often leads to hypocrisy, which is the false pretense of virtue or righteousness and pretending to be something that we are not. If we know what is right and profess to live by that knowledge but, in fact, do not, we are hypocrites. The Savior denounced hypocrites in unmistakable language. He declared:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/04/without-guile.p31" pid="dlENrokepEOjVl0iS5Z8hA" hash="w6aHug">“Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of … all uncleanness.</p>

If so, it is because of the power Satan has over the hearts of men. With the Lord’s help, the Saints can be without guile. Being honest and fair helps rather than hinders success and prosperity. One man of my acquaintance was in a very competitive business for thirty-six years. He always gave full value in service, quality, and quantity. He paid every debt in full.

How would life be if we always were certain, without question, that what others represent to us is true? Theft would be unknown. We would have little use for jails or prisons, and litigation would be rare. The greatest blessing that would come to a society without guile is the individual, personal inner peace that comes to those who know they are doing right and know their lives are acceptable to the Lord.</p>

The first is the City of Holiness, even Zion, a city in which the inhabitants were pure in heart and dwelt in righteousness. In fact, Zion is the name given by the Lord to his Saints. That city, referred to as the city of Enoch, was taken up into heaven (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18-21" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:18–21</a>). The second example is the society of the Nephites that lasted for about two hundred years after the resurrected Lord visited and taught them. The following words of inspiration from the Book of Mormon describe this society:</p>

I have developed a deeper gratitude for the gospel, a broader affection and admiration for the members, and a greater appreciation for the love our Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, have for each one of us. They have shown us the way to be at peace with ourselves and the way to progress and develop.</p>

These great leaders, whom the Lord has called to direct his work, have a pure love for the people. They are compassionate and sensitive, especially to those who are ill, infirm, or less fortunate. They feel a driving urgency to build the kingdom of God, and they devote their time and energy totally to this work. Their prayers, which truly are expressions of gratitude and sacred pleadings for guidance, are a source of inspiration to me. I testify to you that the Spirit of the Lord is present at our meetings and guides our deliberations.</p>

We must be as Paul the Apostle and never be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/1.16" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 1:16</a>) nor feel threatened when the Church, its leaders, its members, or its doctrines are criticized or maligned. On the contrary, we should be bold and assertive in proclaiming the gospel. We should be grateful to participate in this great latter-day movement.</p>

I want you to understand that we have trust and confidence in you. We realize that from your ranks will come the next generation of Church officers, teachers, and community leaders. Most importantly, you will be fathers and patriarchs in your own families. Your tasks then will be to teach and prepare the generation that follows you. My counsel to you is very simple. In the words of the Lord, “Prepare ye for that which is to come.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:12</a>.)</p>

In the divine wisdom of our Heavenly Father, each of you was born to parents who arrived on this earth a few years ahead of you. They have been over the ground you young men are covering now. They have learned what leads to success and happiness and what leads to misery and sorrow. Seek their counsel, listen to them, and learn from them. You will learn from your own experiences also, but you do not need to make every mistake yourselves. In our society, young people often see parents as the past and friends as the future. Magazines, movies, and music made for teenagers often emphasize going your own way and dismissing parents as naive. Avoid that kind of thinking; it is false. Your parents are wise. They have a maturity that comes only from experience. The Lord has given them the fundamental task of teaching, guiding, and caring for you and helping you prepare for the challenges that are necessary for your growth and progress. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.14-15" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:14–15</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.25-28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:25–28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.40-50" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:40–50</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/22.6" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 22:6</a>.)</p>

They included Charles E. Forsberg, my bishop when I was five years old. His English was somewhat broken, but he knew my name. That was important to me even at that early age. Others of my priesthood leaders were my father, who also was my bishop, and Marion G. Romney, who followed my father as bishop of our ward. These leaders made a big difference in my life; your leaders will do the same for you if you stay close to them.</p>

The God-given principle of agency provides that right of choice in a world filled with beautiful, heavenly creations on the one hand and with the evil designs of Satan, the enemy of God, on the other. Always have the courage to make the right choice. You can do it because “it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.15" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:15</a>.) We learn that in the Book of Mormon. The Lord has given you that judgment. Remember, “God … will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 10:13</a>.)</p>

It is a unique gift to the world. Bearing the priesthood is an honor and an opportunity, connected with a sacred obligation to magnify every priesthood calling. See every assignment as a blessing, regardless of how small or routine it may seem. Complete each one as well as you can, always striving to do more than is required or expected. Recognize that you are acting for the Lord by authority you have received from him each time you gather fast offerings, bless or pass the sacrament, baptize, and visit assigned families as home teachers. Your ability to accept greater tasks will depend on how well you do the lesser ones.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-priesthood-of-god.p11" pid="Kct8gnJe70SlHeH8iCjpLg" hash="yHS05w">Each one of you young men should be preparing for missionary service. Make yourselves worthy to receive a mission call by learning and living the principles of the gospel, especially by living clean, pure lives. Those who bear the priesthood must never defile it or bring shame to the Lord’s church. Prepare also by studying the divine principles of the gospel so you can teach them to those who are awaiting the truth. Lastly, prepare yourselves financially. The world needs the gospel message; you need to help declare it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-priesthood-of-god.p12" pid="rA5YwcJlBk-zv_Mg08Iv5A" hash="hObMoQ">In these latter days when keeping the commandments of God is unimportant to many, you young men have a greater challenge to honor the priesthood than any who have held it at any other time. This is true because Lucifer is on the prowl. He knows that his days are numbered. He has learned how to destroy people, especially the youth. He seeks to find any chink in the armor of each person. He knows our weaknesses and knows how to exploit them if we allow him to do so. We can defend ourselves against his attacks and deceptions only by understanding the commandments and by fortifying ourselves each day through praying, studying the scriptures, and following the counsel of the Lord’s anointed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-priesthood-of-god.p13" pid="HocAs_AMZES5jN04posNCw" hash="og3j8A">I remind you brethren who bear the Melchizedek Priesthood that the seed of the present is the harvest of the future. I urge you, as fathers and as priesthood leaders, to focus more attention on teaching, guiding, and shepherding these young men, especially by example. The Lord has given you that obligation. Remember, the lambs have little chance of following the right path if the shepherd goes astray.</p>

You have received it to magnify your callings in doing the Lord’s work. You are to exercise the priesthood in setting the spiritual tone and building a spiritual foundation in your families. You brethren have a solemn duty to bless your wives, children, and other family members by the power and authority of the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-priesthood-of-god.p15" pid="s14zifknSk2tHQ12ldaFDQ" hash="99UMqA">I hope you single adult brethren will follow our prophet’s admonition to marry at the proper time and will not procrastinate your opportunity to be a husband and father. That is the order of the gospel. President Benson meant what he said when he declared: “Understand that temple marriage is essential to your salvation and exaltation.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1988, p. 51.) I would add: better late than never. Many lovely, faithful women are waiting for this privilege. Do not disappoint them, the Lord, or yourselves. Do not fear the added responsibilities that come with marriage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-priesthood-of-god.p16" pid="ZsRXKj9mY0G--7xhsF_riw" hash="y2uqRQ">I believe that a noble priesthood bearer should have balance in his life. I have observed that some fathers spend too much time watching sports on television. This practice has almost become an addiction in today’s world. It should never cause us to neglect family and Church duties. Television is out of control in some homes; the set is rarely turned off, regardless of the programming. Some programs are filthy and evil and are poisoning the minds of God’s children today. Likewise, many movies and videotapes are blatantly corrupt and evil, making their viewers insensible to the promptings of the Spirit. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.24" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 4:24</a>.) Satan has made the television and film media among his most effective tools to destroy minds and souls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-priesthood-of-god.p17" pid="erIoI8-vvUKu_ZmBb3BNLw" hash="Ic6UOQ">A good example of satanic influence is in television advertising for alcoholic beverages. Its underlying message seems to be that the sole object of life is to have a good time. This so-called fun-loving time comes to those who drink a certain brand of alcoholic beverage, they say. Brethren, that advertising message is false; it is an absolute lie fostered by the father of lies. Especially insidious, in my view, is the advertising for wine coolers, which are represented falsely as little more than delicious, fruit-flavored soft drinks. Beer consumption is represented as the thing to do in order to have a good time. Drinking alcoholic beverages does not bring the good things of life. Evidence mounts each passing day to prove the damaging, even disastrous effects of these substances on the human body and on society. The Word of Wisdom was valid when it was given in 1833. Through the years some have not accepted it, but scientific discoveries in our day have validated this great revelation.</p>

As it has in the past, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands opposed to gambling, including government-sponsored lotteries.</p>

While Peter and John were going into the temple, a man who had been lame from birth and had been placed at a gate to the temple asked them for help. Apparently he expected to receive money. “Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.6-7" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:6–7</a>.)</p>

That is what the priesthood does. To be lifted up in this sense means to “be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.5" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:5</a>.) You brethren can trace your priesthood authority directly to the Savior. The priesthood lifts us and enables us to do things far beyond our own unassisted abilities if we are worthy to exercise it. Also, it gives us the power and authority to lift others. In fact, it places on us the obligation to lift all who come under our influence, much as Peter lifted the afflicted man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/the-priesthood-of-god.p25" pid="XfiLyEyXf0W3sj8BdbJwGA" hash="77Z5dw">The Lord has lifted up his prophets, both ancient and modern. The latter-day prophets, from Joseph Smith to President Ezra Taft Benson, are representatives of the Lord. The world may not recognize them, but God speaks through them. The doctrines of the Church are determined by revelations from God, not by councils out in the world.</p>

The experience was most inspirational as I walked on that holy ground. The Holy Ghost reconfirmed to me that the First Vision did occur, and, in the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith, “I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—<span class="emphasis">This is My Beloved Son.

You should have the same quest for truth and the same desire to know what you should do and how you should act. Remember, he went into the grove and prayed for guidance to know for himself which church was right and how he would know it. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.10-13" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:10–13</a>.)</p>

It should be a part of the personal mission of every member. Each one of us should incorporate into our lives the practice of inviting all to come unto Christ by “proclaiming the gospel, perfecting the Saints, and redeeming the dead.” (Ezra Taft Benson, <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1988, p. 84.) We must not let the demands of the world divert us from this sacred mission.</p>

They are vital counsel to us from the Lord through his prophets. We should ponder and act upon such statements as “No other success can compensate for failure in the home,” by President David O. McKay (in Conference Report, Apr. 1964, p. 5); “The greatest of the Lord’s work you brethren will ever do as fathers will be within the walls of your own home,” by President Harold B. Lee (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> July 1973, p. 98); and “The Church is at a point in its growth and maturity when we are at last ready to move forward in a major way. … We have paused on some plateaus long enough.

In addition, this beautiful singing of our young people has been enjoyed by all of us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p2" pid="bQMJlfupe0e1BL_maocmwA" hash="XMQtAw">In a hot, dry, desert area of northwest Mexico, farmers plant seeds and grow varieties of corn and beans that are unusually hardy and drought resistant. These varieties survive and flourish in a harsh climate where other plants would wither and die. One of these plants is the white tepary bean. Its seed will sprout and the plant will grow even when very little rain falls. It sends its roots as deep as six feet into the rocky, sandy earth to find the moisture it needs. It can flower and fruit in the 115-degree (Fahrenheit) desert temperatures with only one yearly rainfall. Its foliage remains remarkably green, with little irrigation, even in the heat of mid-July. (See Gary Paul Nabhan, “Seeds of Renewal,” <span class="emphasis">World Monitor,</span> Jan. 1989, pp. 17–20.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p3" pid="TG9y7P0CYk2vI8NhDMsbLQ" hash="tK4OPQ">Perhaps members of the Church could emulate the example of these hardy, sturdy plants. We should send our roots deep into the soil of the gospel. We should grow, flourish, flower, and bear good fruit in abundance despite the evil, temptation, or criticism we might encounter. We should learn to thrive in the heat of adversity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p4" pid="qpf6Bn7uK0WC1aLNnZ9NuQ" hash="8L36Ow">Our pioneer ancestors survived and grew stronger in the face of extreme trials and afflictions and made the desert blossom as a rose. My own great-grandfather suffered so much from asthma that he had to walk a mile or two behind the covered wagons crossing the plains to avoid the dust. However, he always arrived at his destination and did his share of the work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p5" pid="0j70cXkDWUyVjcOKye1x9A" hash="FzgAuA">Our challenges today are different from those of our ancestors. Many of them lived lives of poverty and hardship; some among us, however, are affluent and complacent. Wealth, abundance, and easy living do not help us develop the ability to flourish when faced with the rigors and reversals of life. Rather than seeking ease, we must plant, cultivate, and nourish within ourselves the seeds that will enable us to withstand the winds and heat of temptation, sin, and evil and that will help us live successful, happy, and pure lives. Let us consider a few such seeds.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p6" pid="ZAy0fx9IcE6PJa0lJtPggg" hash="cFpbsg">First, we should plant and nurture the seed of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. We each should develop the faith of Nephi to do the things the Lord has commanded (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:7</a>), knowing that all commandments are given for our good. Nephi expressed his faith in these words: “If it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.3" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:3</a>.) When the Lord instructed him to build a ship, his brothers called him a fool to think he could do it. He told them: “If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them. If he should command me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.50" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:50</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p7" pid="AccZomHxbk-HxUcgNJOMHg" hash="ue6_8w">Next, let us nurture the seed of faith which gives us the courage to follow the prophets. Today’s prophet, President Ezra Taft Benson, is the Lord’s spokesman to mankind at this time. We need the wisdom and the courage to accept his inspired counsel with gratitude and conform our lives to it because “whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:38</a>.) The revelation given to President Benson’s first predecessor, Joseph Smith, on the day the Church was organized applies to Church members today: “The church … shalt give heed unto all his [the Prophet’s] words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p8" pid="r_4RFBsAd0mdhiz_35ID8g" hash="QSc79g">“For his word shall ye receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21.4-5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 21:4–5</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p9" pid="WrR4d5ZsAkmX4rFI9OfhkA" hash="9XimYw">I am sure the Lord is pleased with the response of Church members to President Benson’s emphasis on reading and sharing the Book of Mormon. In 1988, more than 3.5 million copies were purchased, by far the most in any year to date. Perhaps more important, tens of thousands of our members are reading that book more than ever before!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p10" pid="-0Gpbpaf3UGKNC07HaVv-A" hash="kTuFFA">Next, we should sow within our hearts the seed of charity, the pure love of Christ. He is the perfect model of charity. His total life, particularly his atoning sacrifice, is a lesson in charity. His every act reflects absolute, unequivocal love for all mankind and for each one of us. His example teaches us that charity means subordinating personal interests willingly and gladly for the good of others. I believe our progress toward exaltation and eternal life depends upon how well we learn and live the principle of charity. Charity must become a fundamental state of mind and heart that guides us in all we do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p11" pid="U61yxIuqt0-JcD06WtzLaQ" hash="uMULjA">We urge you home teachers and visiting teachers to look after your families in a spirit of charity. Home teaching and visiting teaching are vehicles for saving souls when done the right way with the right intent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p12" pid="jjCXRJippU6gbI2-Shja5g" hash="YdrSPw">Next, I believe we must constantly nourish the seeds of love, harmony, and unity in our homes and families. Fathers are to preside over their families in kindness, remembering that “no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:41</a>.) Husbands and wives are to love each other with a pure love that transcends selfishness. In a single-parent family, the parent presides. Parents are to nurture their children and teach them the principles of right living. Regardless of the help other individuals or institutions may give, the Lord has placed this responsibility ultimately with parents. Children are to honor their parents (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.12" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:12</a>) by obeying them, living as they are taught, and fostering peace in the home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p13" pid="g6EnmCwG4UCapwwA17UAsw" hash="KBH3yw">Parents should plant deeply the seed of the work ethic into the hearts and habits of their children. As society has shifted from an agrarian to an urban structure, the joy and necessity of diligent, hard work have been neglected. If our young people do not learn to work while in their homes, they likely will be compelled to learn later in a setting where the lesson may be painful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p14" pid="vFe5YJsezE2AfSU5EPDLDQ" hash="E7JuSQ">The remarks of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., given fifty-six years ago, are instructive today. He said: “It is the eternal, inescapable law that growth comes only from work and preparation, whether the growth be material, mental, or spiritual. Work has no substitute.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1933, p. 103.) More recently, Elder Howard W. Hunter counseled: “The first recorded instruction given to Adam after the Fall dealt with the eternal principle of work. The Lord said: ‘In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.’ (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 3:19</a>.) Our Heavenly Father loves us so completely that he has given us a commandment to work. This is one of the keys to eternal life. He knows that we will learn more, grow more, achieve more, serve more, and benefit more from a life of industry than from a life of ease.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1975, p. 122.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p15" pid="Q7PbZEm8O026Zw-7QdfeHg" hash="AmMOOA">Parents can plant seeds in the hearts and minds of their children only if they know where the children are and what they are doing. Parents should not leave the teaching of their children to chance. They should be in charge of their homes and families, remembering that “reproof give[s] wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/29.15" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 29:15</a>.) I have heard of parents who travel extensively for pleasure, leaving their teenage children without parental protection for extended periods. Unprotected teenagers can indulge in a “little” sin without realizing the possible consequences in sorrow and disappointment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p16" pid="X8SL1yUHpEGOsDdgZzrFTg" hash="OJJYXw">Too many of our young people have the idea that limited sin is not really wrong because it will be forgiven easily with no consequences. We see young people who are guilty of moral sins but are not overly concerned because they expect to repent quickly, thinking all is well. The idea that any sin is unimportant is false; it comes from the devil. “The Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.31" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:31</a>.) We should heed the counsel of Nephi when he wrote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p17" pid="saXRM1FqU0qFz1cuz8bwdw" hash="n8Mspg">“Many … shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God—he will justify in committing a little sin; … there is no harm in this; … and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p18" pid="6wvDaIc3qUy13q8Nh0rSRA" hash="T24rMw">“And thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.8,21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:8, 21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p19" pid="p0FaYUpjnEm9ZnuOfkYzYw" hash="Cpl4UA">We ask our young people who will be approaching marriage within a few years to think of their own unborn children. Think of what these spirits would ask you to do in your life if they could speak to you now.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p20" pid="-C-LL57X7kqiaTkMgbSsKg" hash="lFbE6g">Parents must know what their children are watching on television and must protect them from its evil influence. They should set a proper example by watching only those programs that are uplifting and worthwhile and opposing those that are corrupt and degrading. Many people decry television shows that portray sin and evil as being normal and acceptable, and even preferable to righteous living. However, viewers set the standards for television broadcasting. The networks and stations broadcast the types of programs that most of the people want to see. Mr. Frank Stanton, CBS president emeritus, told a Brigham Young University audience that network television standards will continue to decline because they are based on society’s standards. He said, “Standards come from the audience … ; the audience determines the programming and program content.” Further, he said, “I believe there will be more infractions with respect to [immorality] and violence and it will get a lot worse before it gets better because of the changing standards of our society.” (<span class="emphasis">The Daily Universe,</span> 2 Feb. 1989, p. 1.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p21" pid="ffDF0IqitUaKmGwK7eZE-Q" hash="AjsVFA">What a sad commentary on our society! Again we can learn a great principle from the Book of Mormon. When King Mosiah proposed that judges should rule instead of kings, he said: “It is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p22" pid="ixCfIrF91EGx6lN8pL-x9A" hash="bYQDTg">“And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29.26-27" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 29:26–27</a>.) That time of iniquity came about sixty years later and at several other times. In the book of Helaman we read that “they who chose evil were more numerous than they who chose good.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:2</a>.) If television viewing choices serve as a valid measure of our society, they who choose evil surely are more numerous than they who choose good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p23" pid="P5-ot00EbkWn2d2VifDusg" hash="PbOmFg">Finally, I suggest that we plant in our hearts the seed of testimony, a firm unwavering conviction of the truth and divinity of the gospel that we can share freely with power and persuasion. Humble, fervent testimonies borne as prompted by the Spirit can have far-reaching effects.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p24" pid="ZQo2byyHBkeksJohNjqtuw" hash="_K4iyQ">President Benson bore such a testimony in October 1959 when he visited the Central Baptist Church in Moscow, Russia, and was asked to speak. He described the event later as one of the most moving experiences of his life. The church was filled with about 1,500 people seeking to satisfy their spiritual hunger and thirst even though government policy discouraged religion. He testified, “God lives, I know that He lives. He is our Father. Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the World, watches over this earth. … Be unafraid, keep His commandments, love one another, pray for peace and all will be well.” In closing, he said, “I leave you my witness as a Church servant for many years that the truth will endure. Time is on the side of truth. God bless you and keep you all the days of your life.” Those present were touched deeply. Many wept openly, including a cynical newsman and a young Russian interpreter. The congregation began singing “God Be with You Till We Meet Again.” They waved their handkerchiefs in joyous gratitude and in farewell as he and those with him left the meeting. (See Ezra Taft Benson, <span class="emphasis">Cross Fire: the Eight Years with Eisenhower,</span> Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday and Co., Inc., 1962, pp. 485–88.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p25" pid="Al23LmH9f0qqOdtZiKig8A" hash="7sr-5w">President Benson’s testimony made a deep and lasting impression on a minister of that church, Father Alexander. A few years later, this minister told a Finnish member of our church, Sister Irma Airto, that of all the notable people who visited the Baptist church and signed the guest register, Ezra Taft Benson was the greatest. President Benson was visiting Russia as a high official in the United States government, but Father Alexander recognized him as a great spiritual leader. Father Alexander told Sister Airto, “When you meet Mr. Benson, tell him … that we know he is a man of God and I pray for him.” Sister Airto never expected to meet President Benson in person to convey this message. However, when he visited Finland and created the Helsinki Finland Stake in October 1977, she was able to deliver the message, strengthening her testimony that the Lord guides our affairs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p26" pid="CY19qhGEFUqDf-hDiGbXCw" hash="Wu-IUQ">Another example of the far-reaching effects of an inspired testimony is that of the prophet Abinadi. The testimony he bore as he called an apostate king, Noah, and his priests to repentance is one of the most significant doctrinal discourses in the Book of Mormon. The king and his priests, except one, rejected Abinadi’s teachings and had him put to death. That one was Alma. Abinadi may have felt that he failed as a missionary because he had only one convert, so far as the record shows. However, that one convert, Alma, and his descendants were spiritual leaders among the Nephites and Lamanites for about three hundred years. His son, Alma, became the first chief judge of the Nephite people and the high priest over the Church. Alma’s other descendants who became prominent religious leaders include his grandson, Helaman; great-grandson, Helaman; great-great-grandson, Nephi; and great-great-great-grandson, Nephi, who was the chief disciple of the resurrected Jesus Christ. All of this resulted from Abinadi’s lone convert. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.title" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18</a> and Daniel H. Ludlow, <span class="emphasis">A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1976, p. 187).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p27" pid="454nTxTaZEaWVGcT8hFKMg" hash="syXC9g">My brothers and sisters, I bear my testimony that we can plant in our hearts and minds the seeds I have mentioned, and others. If we will plant them and nurture them, we can be true, faithful, and happy regardless of adversity and the buffetings of Satan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/04/seeds-of-renewal.p28" pid="5UYRTABRxE2vsd87NxSxuw" hash="U6k3Xw">I testify further that I know our Heavenly Father loves each of his children, that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior and Redeemer, that Joseph Smith is the Prophet of the Restoration, and that President Ezra Taft Benson is the prophet today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I should like today to address my remarks to the youth, to those of you who still have before you the greater part of this journey we call life.

        <h3 class="title" pid="D2ioMSkIDUe3VYuvjas2Iw" hash="y8vrPQ">The Marathon</h3>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/running-your-marathon.p2" pid="kpnuilwGRUq0ZsQf5zRPxQ" hash="nV9VqQ">In recent years, running has become a popular form of exercise throughout the world. Many run primarily for the exercise, but others run to condition themselves for well-publicized races of various distances. Perhaps the premier endurance race is the marathon, a modern-day race that has its roots in ancient Greece. Today, the meaning of the word has been broadened to include any contest or activity of great length that requires extraordinary effort and endurance.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/running-your-marathon.p3" pid="iohBX5oSSUCx_HjKSWDXFQ" hash="8-y69Q">A young friend of mine, whom I will call Alan, recently ran his first marathon—a distance of 26.2 miles. He had set his goal several months in advance, learned what preparation was required, and disciplined himself to follow a rigorous training schedule. He sought the advice of experienced runners and read articles on running a marathon. He practiced running the marathon route and planned a strategy for traversing the hilly course.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/running-your-marathon.p4" pid="E0JPsKuTrEaOUY8rVQ5g8Q" hash="9S6Kig">Finally, the day of the marathon arrived; it would be the culmination of months of training, discipline, and sacrifice. He got off to a good start in a large crowd of runners. He felt strong and confident, following his predetermined strategy. About eight miles into the race, on a downhill part of the course, he caught up with an experienced runner, Brent by name, who had given him sound advice during his training. Alan decided to match his stride to Brent’s disciplined and experienced pace.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/running-your-marathon.p5" pid="Rtne5Mj0kkuF2fH6Bh_uGw" hash="RmVs0A">As they passed the eighteen-mile mark, Alan struggled to stay with Brent so someone he knew would be by his side if he began “hitting the wall.” Hitting the wall means feeling a sudden urge to quit, encountering an almost tangible barrier that requires a tremendous effort to overcome. It often comes at about the twenty-mile mark.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/running-your-marathon.p6" pid="Wmc_K7jOEEOwpr-Oj9UAlA" hash="PIWY1Q">For the next two miles, Alan kept pace with Brent. Then it hit him. He felt a sudden loss of energy, an almost overwhelming desire to stop or walk. “Stay with me,” Brent said. “We all feel it at some point. You can get through it. I’ll help pull you through.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/running-your-marathon.p7" pid="xPQXBbVvW0unxwGeWEKnpQ" hash="PolOaw">Somehow, Alan continued. He and Brent began to pass spectators. He knew his wife, children, and other family members would be watching about one mile ahead. Drawing on the strength provided by thoughts of his family, he was able to hang on until the desire to quit left him.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/running-your-marathon.p8" pid="sPdWvyCRNkOygGBFKwTc_A" hash="p_lI4w">As they finally neared the finish, Alan found the last mile to be the hardest of all. Alan and Brent crossed the finish line just five seconds apart. Alan was more exhausted than he ever had been but was elated because he had beaten his goal by more than fifteen minutes and had finished among the top twenty-five runners.</p>

You young people are nearer the beginning of your earthly sojourn. You chose to come to this earth and to be tested and proved. The end may seem too far away to concern you now. But life, like a marathon, requires a good start and a strong, consistent effort all of the way to the finish.</p>

You should look ahead now and decide what you want to do with your lives. Fix clearly in your mind what you want to be one year from now, five years, ten years, and beyond. Receive your patriarchal blessing and strive to live worthy of its promises. A patriarchal blessing is one of the most important guides in life that members of the Church enjoy. Write your goals and review them regularly. Keep them before you constantly, record your progress, and revise them as circumstances dictate. Your ultimate goal should be eternal life—the kind of life God lives, the greatest of all the gifts of God.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/running-your-marathon.p11" pid="La4kA3JG5kSToClq7kceYQ" hash="tzelcg">After you visualize yourself as you would like to be in twenty years from now, identify the preparation you will need. Determine to pay the price in effort, money, study, and prayer. Be sure you understand the course or path you will be taking. The ideal course of life is not always easy. Comparatively few will find it and complete it. It is not a well-marked freeway, but a narrow path with only one entrance. The way to eternal life is straight and narrow. When I think of staying on the right path, I am reminded of Lehi’s dream about the tree of life. In it, the love of God was likened to a tree that bore delicious fruit, fruit that was desirable above all others. As Nephi recorded his father’s words: “And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree. … And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were pressing forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto the tree.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.20-21" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:20–21</a>.) Many of these people later “fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.28" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:28</a>.) But those who ignored the scoffing and ridicule of the world and held tightly to the rod of iron enjoyed the fruit of the tree. The rod of iron represents the word of God, that leads us to the love of God. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.25" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11:25</a>.) You must hold firmly to the rod of iron through the mists and darknesses, the hardships and trials of life. If you relax your grip and slip from the path, the iron rod might become lost in the darkness for a time until you repent and regain your grasp of it.</p>

You will not always know precisely what opportunities will come or when they will come. But you can be sure they will be valuable only to the extent that you are prepared to respond to them.

Joshua Dennis, age ten, is alive today because of his own fervent prayer, faith, and overwhelming optimism, and, in addition, because of the fact that he listened to his mother and obeyed her counsel. In addition, we remember the feeling, and I call it inspiration, given to John Skinner, who led the search party to Joshua. I hope our youth will remember this great lesson of prayer as they pass through life’s journey.</p>

If we boast in our own strength and “walk in our own way,” we can slip easily from the straight and narrow path to the broad roadways of the world. Do not be misled by the occasional easiness of the way, like the downhill part of a marathon. Keep close to the Lord and trust in him during the easier times, just as you do in your uphill struggles.</p>

Without this help, many runners could not carry on. You young people also have “aid stations” to help you keep moving along your course. They should include your parents, other family members, ward leaders, and teachers who have “run more races” and are farther along the path of life. Benefit from the experience they have accumulated. Trust them; seek their advice, counsel, and support; and then listen to them. They will help you stay on your course.</p>

Ignoring the needs of others is a serious sin. Think of the words of Alma to the people of the Church in Zarahemla.

He does not give you challenges that you cannot surmount. He will not ask more than you can do, but may ask right up to your limits so you can prove yourselves.

However, regardless of appearances, “wickedness never was happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>) and never will be. Never find yourselves in the position of the Nephites just a few years before the birth of the Savior.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/personal-integrity.p2" pid="0cQloZ8Y4kqZqSgDDB_f4w" hash="Z6FLbQ">I have felt impressed to speak today about the need for integrity—old-fashioned, personal, practical integrity. To me, integrity means always doing what is right and good, regardless of the immediate consequences. It means being righteous from the very depth of our soul, not only in our actions but, more importantly, in our thoughts and in our hearts. Personal integrity implies such trustworthiness and incorruptibility that we are incapable of being false to a trust or covenant.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/personal-integrity.p3" pid="dJEzaJr1TE2XCQ-uRRECsw" hash="v36J9A">We all have within us the ability to know what is right and good. Speaking to the “peaceable followers of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.3" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:3</a>), the prophet Mormon said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/personal-integrity.p4" pid="gRthaGTsmkaa25JIv3s8aw" hash="agTWRg">“It is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/personal-integrity.p5" pid="hrO4AXLuO0iNDdz8cNzZOA" hash="YLbTYA">“For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/personal-integrity.p7" pid="wpJuyRv9X0KdptNYZDMzFQ" hash="oxc4sQ">Having received the Spirit of Christ to know good from evil, we should always choose the good. We need not be misled, even though fraud, deception, deceit, and duplicity often seem to be acceptable in our world. Lying, stealing, and cheating are commonplace. Integrity, a firm adherence to the highest moral and ethical standards, is essential to the life of a true Latter-day Saint.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/personal-integrity.p8" pid="rEO6QmzUn0SL9Rte0aCGQg" hash="jfc3lA">Like Job of old, we need to say, “Till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/27.5" class="scriptureRef">Job 27:5</a>.) Though he had lost almost everything he valued—his family, his friends, his health, his wealth—he refused to give up his integrity. In sharp contrast, many today trade away their integrity for a very small price tag. A person who shoplifts for a candy bar, or makeup, or jewelry trades priceless integrity for a meager gain. A person who falsifies a tax return by not reporting income or claiming invalid deductions compromises valued integrity for a pittance of unpaid income tax. One who avoids paying bills promptly for goods or services received exchanges cherished integrity for a perceived temporary advantage. Husbands or wives who are unfaithful to their spouses trade their prized integrity for a fleeting moment of mirth. Integrity is so precious that it is beyond price; it is invaluable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/personal-integrity.p9" pid="39RjQ-3NMk2pvO9IFy2cnw" hash="St0stA">Joseph, the son of Jacob, was a model of integrity. No doubt many of you have been reminded of him recently in a Sunday School class. Joseph’s integrity placed him among the greatest of our Heavenly Father’s sons. He did what was right and good; he was trustworthy and incorruptible, self-disciplined never to violate a trust.</p>

His life is evidence that “all things work together for good to [those who] love God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.28" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:28</a>.) His example is especially pertinent to us because most members of the Church have descended from his loins.</p>

The Lord revealed future events to Joseph in dreams. However, his brothers hated him, plotted to take his life, and then sold him as a slave. When he was carried captive to Egypt, the Lord was with him there. Joseph became overseer of the house of Potiphar, captain of Pharaoh’s guard. When approached by Potiphar’s wife, Joseph refused and fled from her improper advances because of his personal righteousness and because he would not violate Potiphar’s trust.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/personal-integrity.p12" pid="DbhQAXSL8EiYa-RK_lLGuA" hash="BRiBpw">This refusal and the accusations it prompted caused Joseph to be imprisoned. Again the Lord was with him. Joseph became overseer of the prison. The Lord enabled him to interpret the dreams of Pharaoh’s butler and baker, and later, Pharaoh’s dreams of seven fat and lean cows and of seven full and thin ears of corn. Subsequently, Joseph became ruler over all Egypt, second in rank only to Pharaoh. He directed the storage of food during the years of plenty and the dispensing of it during the years of famine.</p>

I suppose he could have retaliated for their mistreatment of him by making them slaves, having them imprisoned, or even having them put to death. But he did what was right and good. He said:</p>

He became the birthright son in the house of Israel and received an inheritance in the lands of the Americas. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/13.8" class="scriptureRef">Ether 13:8</a>.) The Lord permitted him to prophesy of Moses, who would deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt (see JST, Gen. 50:27–29), and of Joseph Smith, the prophet of the restoration of the gospel in the latter days (see JST, Gen. 50:30–33; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.6-21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 3:6–21</a>).</p>

His integrity and character, more than the brilliance of his intellect, made him the choice of his countrymen as their leader. He loved the peace and tranquillity of his Mount Vernon estate but responded when duty called him into the turmoil of public life. He refused any compensation, expecting the government to pay only the expenses, of which he kept an exact account. He gave forty-five years of his life in the service of his country. (See David O. McKay, <span class="emphasis">Secrets of a Happy Life,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1967, pp. 142–44.)

We must be fair with suppliers, customers, and employees; repay obligations and keep agreements; and never deceive by failing to disclose all the facts about an investment or business venture. If our selfish “hearts are set so much upon the things of this world” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:35</a>), we can easily lose our integrity.

I watched the white lines on that road more intently than ever before. Staying within the lines kept us from going onto the shoulder and into the deep canyon on one side and helped us avoid a head-on collision on the other. To wander over either line could have been very dangerous. Then I thought, “Would a right-thinking person deviate to the left or the right of a traffic lane if he knew the result would be fatal? If he valued his mortal life, certainly he would stay between these lines.”</p>

He asked the Master what he still lacked. Jesus told him to sell all that he had and give to the poor, and come and follow Him. But the man went away sorrowing, for he loved his possessions.

On a hot, windy summer day this year in Midway, Utah, embers from a small campground fire were fanned into a raging forest fire that soon swept over the entire mountainside. Before the flames were brought under control, the lives of two outstanding members of the Church were lost. The roaring fire had destroyed the beautiful autumn foliage, plus eighteen homes. We risk similar damage to our moral integrity when we let our guard down for even one brief moment. The spark of an evil thought can enter our mind that could ignite and destroy the moral fiber of our soul.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p1" pid="PEs6eXdDFUWfSafUSqI5qw" hash="vOXZag">In recent months, peace has been a very prominent topic on the minds of people throughout the world. When world peace was threatened, many countries found themselves engaged in war. The news media have shown vivid images of the ravages, suffering, and destruction of war and the turmoil it causes in individuals. It causes deep anxiety and disrupts families, employment, and schooling. It consumes resources that could be used to better advantage elsewhere. We are most grateful that the Gulf War ended more quickly and with fewer casualties than expected. Our hearts are filled with compassion for families on all sides who lost loved ones and for the innocent victims of war, especially the children. We pray now for a lasting peace when men “shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: … neither shall they learn war any more.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/2.4" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 2:4</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p2" pid="JHo0VOr1uke89LOIbtivDA" hash="DRMNfg">In the scriptures, <span class="emphasis">peace</span> means either freedom from strife, contention, conflict, or war, or an inner calm and comfort born of the Spirit that is a gift of God to all of his children, an assurance and serenity within a person’s heart. The dictionary definition states that peace is a state of tranquillity or quiet, freedom from disquieting thoughts or emotions, and harmony in personal relations. (See <span class="emphasis">Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary.</span>)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p3" pid="tzvlCTdfGU-oW--LQQPVpg" hash="0EwacA">While we yearn for peace, we live in a world burdened with hunger, pain, anguish, loneliness, sickness, and sorrow. We see divorce with all of its attendant conflict and heartache, especially among the innocent children caught in the middle. Wayward, disobedient children cause their parents grief and anxiety. Financial problems cause distress and loss of self-respect. Some loved ones slip into sin and wickedness, forsake their covenants, and walk in their “own way, and after the image of [their] own god.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p4" pid="muLLfTye70KSa4RPqosh-A" hash="vPQhHQ">The value of peace within our hearts cannot be measured. When we are at peace, we can be free of worry and fear, knowing that with the Lord’s help, we can do all that is expected or required of us. We can approach every day, every task, and every challenge with assurance and confidence in the outcome. We have freedom of thought and action, freedom to be happy. Even those incarcerated for lengthy periods of time as war prisoners can be at peace in their own minds. Many of them have learned from their captors that they cannot deprive them of freedom to think, even when the most harsh limitations are imposed. Few, if any, blessings from God are more valuable to our spiritual health than the reward of peace within. In modern-day revelation the Savior said, “But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:23</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p5" pid="kpyGKF5_i0mKdJ6fkNPNQQ" hash="s6JSgw">Despite dismal conditions in the world and the personal challenges that come into every life, peace within can be a reality. We can be calm and serene regardless of the swirling turmoil all about us. Attaining harmony within ourselves depends upon our relationship with our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, and our willingness to emulate him by living the principles he has given us. He has extended to us an invitation: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:28–30</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p6" pid="6kKe4quqg0CieCPnc2XhDg" hash="XoK76Q">The phrase “Peace, be still” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/4.39" class="scriptureRef">Mark 4:39</a>), that the Savior uttered when he calmed the storm-tossed sea, can have the same calming influence upon us when we are buffeted by life’s storms. During the Passover feast, the Savior taught his disciples: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>.) Referring to the teachings he had given to his disciples, Jesus said: “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.33" class="scriptureRef">John 16:33</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p7" pid="0Y6PCJtCL0Ku-6l8ZTSSzg" hash="MKt7Uw">In his epistle to the Romans, Paul gave us one key to finding the peace promised by the Lord. Paul taught, “To be spiritually minded is life and peace.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.6" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p8" pid="pG_Z_KmGbk2xDauf3FbheA" hash="oZKTtg">One faithful mother of a large family learned to find peace by accepting the Savior’s invitation to come unto him and find rest. She lived in obedience to the commandments of God and had faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ. Then she developed the practice of doing everything within her power to solve problems and meet challenges, and then, when she felt that she could do nothing more, she would cast her burdens upon the Lord and place the outcome in his hands.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p9" pid="4bkF4Rx5Fk-YbUeWyBwgQw" hash="P_c00Q">President David O. McKay said, “The peace of Christ does not come by seeking the superficial things of life, neither does it come except as it springs from the individual’s heart.” He said further that this peace is “conditioned upon obedience to the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. … No man is at peace with himself or his God who is untrue to his better self, who transgresses the law of what is right either in dealing with himself by indulging in passion, in appetite, yielding to temptations against his accusing conscience, or in dealing with his fellowmen, being untrue to their trust. Peace does not come to the transgressor of law; peace comes by obedience to law, and it is that message which Jesus would have us proclaim among men.” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1938, p. 133.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p10" pid="EbJdhh70W0uIebqMuVC3ZQ" hash="EB7wEw">Earth life is a period of probation to provide an opportunity for choices. Two mighty forces are pulling in opposite directions. On the one hand is the power of Christ and his righteousness. On the other hand is Satan and the spirits who follow him. President Marion G. Romney said: “Mankind … must determine to travel in company with the one or the other. The reward for following the one is the fruit of the Spirit—peace. The reward for following the other is the works of the flesh—the antithesis of peace.” Further, he said: “The price of peace is victory over Satan.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Oct. 1983, pp. 4, 5.) We can know which one to follow because God has given everyone the Spirit of Christ to know good from evil and to protect themselves from sin. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.15-18" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:15–18</a>.) We sometimes refer to the Spirit of Christ as our conscience. If we follow its promptings, we can be free of sin and filled with peace. If we do not, but instead let our carnal appetites control us, we never will know true peace. We will be tossed “like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest. … there is no peace, saith … God, to the wicked.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/57.20-21" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 57:20–21</a>.) If we damage or violate our conscience by ignoring it, we can lose that gift because we no longer are sensitive to it. We will be beyond feeling, beyond the influence of that Spirit. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.45" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:45</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p11" pid="R5cTHhPHkEKJgiT_1b6umw" hash="1_ehxQ">Though we abhor war, peace nearly always has been more a dream than a reality. During most of the world’s history, strife, dissension, and conflict have flourished and displaced peace. The times when peace has reigned, it began in the hearts of righteous, obedient individuals and grew until it engulfed a society. We have at least two scriptural accounts of periods of absolute peace and a third that is yet to come. (See Marion G. Romney, <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Oct. 1983, p. 5.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p12" pid="hAIZbiueb0egzOAkvajXKA" hash="n_RGhw">The first of these periods of peace was among the people of Enoch, who lived before the great flood. They continued in righteousness, and “the Lord came and dwelt with” them. He “called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness.” They “built a city that was called the City of Holiness, even Zion” that, in the “process of time, was taken up into heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.16-21" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:16–21</a>.)</p>

They abolished the works of evil and obtained the fruit of the Spirit. Quoting from the Book of Mormon: “The disciples of Jesus had formed a church of Christ. … And as many as did come unto them, and did truly repent of their sins, were baptized in the name of Jesus; and they did also receive the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.1" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:1</a>.) Consequently, “there were no contentions and disputations among them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.2" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:2</a>) “because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people. And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.15-16" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:15–16</a>.) “They were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.17" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:17</a>.) “And every man did deal justly one with another.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.2" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:2</a>.) “And surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.16" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p14" pid="vbDyZgveuUGQ7vfzm2X5DA" hash="84HI2A">Peace prevailed among the Nephites for almost two centuries. Then some of them deserted the teachings of Jesus Christ and turned to selfish pride and wickedness. Within another two centuries, the Nephite nation that had enjoyed this long period of perfect peace had destroyed itself in savage civil war.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/peace-within.p15" pid="v34cnigB4U2WCsFVhm9HEA" hash="dpfT9w">A third period of perfect peace will come during the Millennium. “Satan shall be bound, that he shall have no place in the hearts of the children of men.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.55" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:55</a>.) As they live the gospel of Jesus Christ, the righteousness of the people will banish Satan from their midst. We look forward to that day of universal peace and justice, when Christ will reign upon the earth.</p>

Near the end of his life, he was at the center of a whirlwind of turmoil and tribulation caused by devious associates, false accusations, and cunning plots against his life. Yet a few days before his death, he said, “I am calm as a summer’s morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 135:4</a>.) His inner peace sustained him through monumental adversities, even his own martyrdom.</p>

It is a practical principle that, with conscious effort, can become a normal part of our lives as we deal with matters both large and small. One habit that prevents inner peace is procrastination. It clutters our minds with unfinished business and makes us uneasy until we finish a task and get it out of the way. We are at peace in our Church callings when we do the work at the proper time instead of waiting until the last possible moment. This is true of going to the temple often, performing our home teaching and visiting teaching assignments, preparing lessons and talks, and doing other assignments.</p>

How much mental anguish results from a little lying, cheating, or stealing even if they are never discovered? Do we have peace of mind if we knowingly violate traffic laws? Or do we watch nervously for the ever-present policeman? Do we have peace of mind if we are not honest with our employers and do not give fair value for the pay we receive? Are we at peace if we are less than honest regarding our tax returns?</p>

In a Christmas message, the First Presidency proclaimed that the Church has a divine commission to establish peace. Church members are to “manifest brotherly love, first toward one another, then toward all mankind; to seek unity, harmony and peace … within the Church, and then, by precept and example, extend these virtues throughout the world.” (“Greetings from the First Presidency,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona, the Elders’ Journal,</span> 22 Dec. 1936, p. 315.)</p>

Elder Spencer W. Kimball wrote: “The essence of the miracle of forgiveness is that it brings peace to the previously anxious, restless, frustrated, perhaps tormented soul. In a world of turmoil and contention this is indeed a priceless gift.” (<span class="emphasis">The Miracle of Forgiveness,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969, p. 363.)</p>

The power is in us as spirit children of our Heavenly Father. He and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, have provided the way for us to be at peace. We <span class="emphasis">can</span> enjoy that peace of God which passeth human understanding. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.7" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 4:7</a>.) We can enjoy it personally, within our families, in our communities, in our nations, and in our world if we will do the things that produce it. This peace leads to happiness.

The Godhead consists of three separate, distinct personages who are one in purpose. The Father and the Son have tangible bodies of flesh and bone while the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit.</p>

We are his literal offspring and are formed in his image. We have inherited divine characteristics from him. Knowing our relationship to our Heavenly Father helps us understand the divine nature that is in us and our potential. The doctrine of the fatherhood of God lays a solid foundation for self-esteem. The hymn titled “I Am a Child of God” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 301) states this doctrine in simple terms. Can a person who understands his divine parenthood lack self-esteem? I have known people who have a deep, abiding assurance of this truth and others who understand it only superficially and intellectually. The contrast in their attitudes and the practical effect of these attitudes in their lives is remarkably apparent.</p>

Jesus, the first on this earth to be resurrected, made the resurrection a certainty for all mankind. This reality is a center point of hope in the gospel of Jesus Christ.

President Brigham Young wisely recognized that “the time of youth and early manhood is the proper time” to gain mastery over bodily appetites and passions. He warned that “the man who suffers his passions to lead him becomes a slave to them, and such a man will find the work of emancipation an exceedingly difficult one.” (<span class="emphasis">Letters of Brigham Young to His Sons,</span> ed. Dean C. Jessee, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974, p. 130.)

This revelation has been scrutinized and ignored, attacked and defended, ridiculed and praised. Meanwhile, faithful Saints have observed it as a token of their obedience to God. For many years, they could obey it only on faith, in much the same spirit that Adam offered sacrifice. An angel asked him, “Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.6" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:6</a>.) Early members of the Church obeyed the Lord’s counsel without the benefit of present medical knowledge, which has validated the physical benefits of their obedience.

Parents should teach their children that work is the prerequisite to achievement and success in every worthwhile endeavor. Children of legal age should secure productive employment and begin to move away from dependence on parents. None of us should expect others to provide for us that which we can provide for ourselves.</p>

This is also true today. The Savior commanded, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/16.15" class="scriptureRef">Mark 16:15</a>.) His disciples, especially Paul, proclaimed the gospel message widely in the years following the Savior’s crucifixion. In 1831, the Lord revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, “The voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:2</a>.)</p>

They bless the people they teach by acquainting them with the fulness of the restored gospel. They bless themselves by the dramatic growth and maturity that come during a mission. Every worthy young man should go on a mission. Also, worthy young women and couples of the Church can give invaluable service in the mission field. They all serve as the emissaries of the Lord. We thank them most sincerely.</p>

Remember, the Lord has never revoked the law of chastity.</p>

But I don’t believe I’ve ever attended a finer and more inspirational conference than this one. I might add, it’s been probably the longest I’ve ever attended, since I’m one of the last speakers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/seeking-the-good.p3" pid="SYW-aWJXTkKym5WwHgWTjQ" hash="WiprLQ">A key document of the restoration of the gospel is a letter the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote in reply to a request of John Wentworth, editor of a Chicago newspaper. In the Wentworth letter, the Prophet wrote a “sketch of the rise, progress, persecution, and faith of the Latter-day Saints.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:535.) It apparently was the first published account of principal events that occurred in the 36-year-period after the Prophet’s birth. The last part of the letter, the Articles of Faith, is a concise statement of fundamental beliefs of the Church. The fact that one heaven-inspired person rather than a council of scholars produced this remarkable document is another evidence of Joseph Smith’s divine calling. (See <span class="emphasis">History of the Church, </span>4:535.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/seeking-the-good.p4" pid="520N_wXCp06jIDr9AwEGrA" hash="-0YVFA">The last part of the thirteenth article states, “If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:13</a>.)</p>

It requires an active, assertive approach to life. For example, Abraham “sought for the blessings of the fathers … and to be a greater follower of righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/1.2" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 1:2</a>.) It is the opposite of passively waiting for something good to come to us, with no effort on our part.</p>

We have so much good from which to choose that we need never partake of evil. Elder Richard L. Evans declared: “There is evil in the world. There is also good. It is for us to learn and choose between the two; to increase in self-discipline, in competence, in kindness; to keep going—putting one foot in front of the other—one day, one hour, one moment, one task at a time.” (Richard L. Evans, <span class="emphasis">Thoughts for One Hundred Days, </span>5 vols., Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1970, 4:199.)</p>

Conversely, if we seek for evil, we will find that also. Lucifer understands how to tempt and drag many of our Heavenly Father’s children down to where he and his followers are. He rebelled and was cast out; he wants to make us as miserable as he is. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.18" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:18</a>.)</p>

For members of the Church, seeking the good is more than a lofty ideal. It is an obligation we accepted when we entered the waters of baptism; we renew it each time we partake of the sacrament.

By example parents can teach children to be kind, considerate, respectful, and supportive of one another and to avoid strife and contention. Occasionally, family members treat each other with less courtesy and kindness than they do acquaintances or even strangers. Family members do have differences that can cause friction, but they should reserve their most tender affection for those who are closest to them: their spouse, parents, brothers and sisters. The true greatness of a person, in my view, is evident in the way he or she treats those where courtesy and kindness are not required.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/seeking-the-good.p14" pid="cnnEakNF90Wa8vzYDh0svw" hash="82pVhg">We can seek to be good neighbors. In most cases, those who are good neighbors will have good neighbors. Being a good neighbor means doing more than offering a thoughtful gesture from time to time on a holiday or in a crisis. It means striving continuously to build and maintain genuine friendship. We react quickly in an emergency. For example, last Christmas, our neighbor’s car caught on fire. Everyone who saw the flames immediately rushed out to help. Do we respond as well when the need is less urgent but perhaps very important? Do we visit our neighbors even when no one is ill and no crisis exists?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/seeking-the-good.p15" pid="po8nLS2CtkmrJ4d5wgwEig" hash="W0narw">We can seek to provide selfless service because of the love we have for our fellow men.

When we subordinate personal interests out of love and give of ourselves with no thought of receiving in return, we are moving toward becoming true disciples. “The Lord has … commanded his people to care for the poor and needy. He said, ‘And remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple.’ (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/52.40" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 52:40</a>.)” (<span class="emphasis">Providing in the Lord’s Way,</span> Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1990, p. 3.)

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/seeking-the-good.p22" pid="RBPhhMtUO0urCIkif2dtZw" hash="Nl8MxA">We should seek to become self-reliant, so far as possible, rather than depend on someone else to provide for us. Some people seem to have the notion that we have a right to everything in life without making any effort to produce it ourselves. Many believe the government and others should take care of us: they think they should provide food, health care, and housing. Of course, society must care for some of its people, but the general population should get away from the idea of depending on the government for things they can provide for themselves and their families.</p>

As President Benson said, “Of all people, we as Latter-day Saints should be the most optimistic and the least pessimistic.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Oct. 1986, p. 2.) Where sin is the cause of unhappiness, we need to repent and return to a righteous life because “wickedness never was happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>) and “you cannot do wrong and feel right. It is impossible.” (Ezra Taft Benson, <span class="emphasis">New Era, </span>June 1986, p. 5.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/seeking-the-good.p24" pid="zlkgfFUWuUiNSFrRiECrQg" hash="itCVGA">I believe happiness comes from a clear conscience and from being without guile or deception. It means avoiding jealousy and envy. It means cultivating peace in our homes and enjoying the peace in our hearts that righteousness brings. It comes from a knowledge and assurance, given by the Spirit, that the life we are pursuing accords with God’s will and is acceptable to him. (See Joseph Smith, <span class="emphasis">Lectures on Faith, </span>Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1985, 3:5.) After all, the Prophet Joseph’s oft-quoted statement remains in force; he said: “Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church, </span>5:134–35.) We need not feel depressed or discouraged about conditions in the world, for the Lord will help us find the good that will lead us to happiness.</p>

We should be very selective and choose only those things that meet the test of being virtuous, lovely, of good report, or praiseworthy. If it is questionable, we should avoid it.</p>

We should study the issues and the candidates to be sure our votes are based on knowledge rather than hearsay. We need to pray for our public officials and ask the Lord to help them in making momentous decisions that affect us. Our beliefs regarding earthly governments and laws are summarized in section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants and the twelfth article of faith. We should support public policy that coincides with these moral beliefs.</p>

We should seek without delay to preach by precept and by example to be sure everyone is willing to accept gospel truths and has the opportunity to do so. The best way to teach the gospel is to live it. Parents are to prepare their children by teaching them gospel principles; teaching them to live clean, pure lives so they can be worthy missionaries and ambassadors of the Lord, encouraging them to acquire a strong testimony of the gospel, and helping them to prepare financially for this sacred service. Also, older couples should arrange their affairs so they can serve as missionaries.</p>

Temple work enables us to do for others what they cannot do for themselves. It is a labor of love that permits our forefathers to continue their progress toward eternal life. As valuable and beneficial as temple work is to them, it is equally valuable to us. The House of the Lord is a place where we can escape from the mundane and see our lives in an eternal perspective. We can ponder instructions and covenants that help us understand more clearly the plan of salvation and the infinite love of our Heavenly Father for his children. We can ponder our relationship to God, the Eternal Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ. We learn from the Doctrine and Covenants that a temple is a place of thanksgiving, “a place of instruction for all those who are called to the work of the ministry in all their several callings and offices;</p>

It can be an anchor in daily life, a source of guidance, protection, security, peace, and revelation. No work is more spiritual than temple work.</p>

The mystique of the temple lies in its extension to other worlds; it is the reflection on earth of the heavenly order, and the power that fills it comes from above.” (“Nibley Considers teh Temple in the Cosmos,” <span class="emphasis">Insights, an Ancient Window,</span> Mar. 1992, p. 1.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/seeking-the-good.p35" pid="H7YhiEH2502HEJcqyXKEDA" hash="dr3jNg">We should seek the Holy Ghost, who can be the constant companion of all members of the Church who are obedient and righteous. He can reveal all truth to us in our minds and in our hearts, comfort us in times of distress, prompt us in making correct choices and decisions, and help purify ourselves from sin. I know of no greater blessing that can come to us in mortality than the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>

He cannot tempt us beyond our power to resist. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 10:13</a>.) When we seek “anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy,” we are seeking to emulate the Savior and follow his teachings. Then we are on the path that can lead us to eternal life.</p>

Joseph Smith is the prophet of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. His successors, from Brigham Young to our present prophet, President Ezra Taft Benson, are also modern-day prophets of God. They teach us to seek that which is good. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

These wolf packs were fearless. They were not intimidated by people nor by any of the weapons available at that time. The only thing that seemed to frighten them was fire. Consequently, travelers who found themselves away from cities developed the common practice of building a large bonfire and keeping it burning through the night. As long as the fire burned brightly, the wolves stayed away. But if it were allowed to burn out and die, the wolves would move in for an attack. Travelers understood that building and maintaining a roaring bonfire was not just a matter of convenience or comfort; it was a matter of survival. (See Mary Pratt Parrish, <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1972, p. 25.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p2" pid="N8otcAa5IUOUA7u3zFM8EQ" hash="YosqKw">We do not have to protect ourselves from wolf packs as we travel the road of life today, but, in a spiritual sense, we do face the devious wolves of Satan in the forms of temptation, evil, and sin. We live in dangerous times when these ravenous wolves roam the spiritual countryside in search of those who may be weak in faith or feeble in their conviction. In his first epistle, Peter described our “adversary the devil, as a roaring lion [that] walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/5.8" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 5:8</a>.) The Lord told the Prophet Joseph Smith that “enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:6</a>.) We are all vulnerable to attack. However, we can fortify ourselves with the protection provided by a burning testimony that, like a bonfire, has been built adequately and maintained carefully.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p3" pid="65L3vtv7uESsiyl_hFwLcA" hash="KQ1SLQ">Unfortunately, some in the Church may believe sincerely that their testimony is a raging bonfire when it really is little more than the faint flickering of a candle. Their faithfulness has more to do with habit than holiness, and their pursuit of personal righteousness almost always takes a back seat to their pursuit of personal interests and pleasure. With such a feeble light of testimony for protection, these travelers on life’s highways are easy prey for the wolves of the adversary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p4" pid="iqsLkRdFRkGvnP_vzdRnpg" hash="BWR3Cg">The Savior understood that many of His followers would struggle under the rigors of true discipleship; consequently, He taught them how to build burning testimonies. The night before His crucifixion, Jesus shared the feast of the Passover with His twelve beloved Apostles, most of whom had been with Him throughout His ministry. At one point during this sacred evening, the Lord looked upon Peter, His senior Apostle and loyal friend. Knowing what would be required of Peter after the Ascension, the Lord said: “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p6" pid="6hNTtwVxvEaQzjR_P8p7tA" hash="VyFmzA">Imagine for a moment that you are Peter. Three years ago a holy stranger invited you to set aside your fishing boat and nets, your means of support for yourself and your family, and then asked you to follow Him. You did so without hesitation, and for three years you have continued to follow and to love and support and sustain Him. You have seen Him confound the wise, comfort the weary and the afflicted, heal the sick, and raise the dead to life. You have seen Him conquer evil spirits, calm the troubled seas, and for a few minutes, at least, you even walked on the water toward Him. You were at His side when Moses and Elias appeared to Him; you saw Him transfigured before your very eyes. You have committed your entire life to Him. And now He questions you by instructing you to strengthen your brethren “when thou art converted.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p7" pid="f4qAcVpHLkqMaJwMoYalNA" hash="NXw98g">Peter was surprised. He assured the Lord, “I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.33" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:33</a>.) But Jesus knew and understood. He was not condemning Peter for a lack of conviction; Peter demonstrated his conviction during the Lord’s arrest. Rather, the Savior was telling Peter what he needed to do when his testimony became more secure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p8" pid="P2dH8AYVvEODasX3d47u6w" hash="_A6EDg">As He knew Peter, the Lord understands you and me when our testimonies may not be the brightly burning bonfire you may think they are or want them to be. Perhaps in some cases, that testimony is constructed unwisely, built on a social foundation of programs and personalities instead of the sure rock of personal revelation. Or perhaps you have allowed your testimony to flicker gradually through the years of disuse and spiritual complacency.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p9" pid="pW_snamNYkiE45Wf1jFp6w" hash="3XOtRg">Regardless of the reason your testimony may be growing dim, the Savior lovingly urges you to come unto Him and become strengthened in Him. Said He to Moroni: “If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; … for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:27</a>.)</p>

Many of them likely would be offended at the suggestion. They raise their right hand to sustain Church leaders and then murmur and complain when a decision does not square with their way of thinking. They claim to be obedient to God’s commandments but do not feel at all uncomfortable about purchasing food at the store on Sunday and then asking the Lord to bless it. Some say they would give their lives for the Lord, yet they refuse to serve in the nursery.</p>

His words were: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</p>

That is why you need to do everything in your power to be absolutely certain that your spiritual bonfire of testimony is burning brightly enough to keep the wolves of darkness away. You can always use more dry kindling. As the Apostle Paul taught, each of us has “come short of the glory of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/3.23" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 3:23</a>.) None of us has progressed so far in this life that we do not need to continually fortify our testimonies.</p>

Even though we enjoy the fellowship of the Saints and have strong feelings about the inspired programs of the Church, we must remember that we have only one sure anchor for our souls. It is stated in the words of the prophet Helaman, when he taught his sons:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p17" pid="HOewiiU4GUeoFbjF7tBMhg" hash="s_NxUg">“And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p18" pid="08yYWrSMTE-1AbmULEcg5w" hash="HjI4ZQ">Perhaps you are one of the members of the Church whose first contact with the gospel came through the beautiful music of the Tabernacle Choir. Maybe your life was blessed by the Church welfare program when you followed prophetic counsel to store food and other necessities. These are marvelous, inspired aspects of the Church that God has provided to help bring his children to Christ. However, they are implements and not ends in themselves. The ultimate focus of our devotion must properly be our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p19" pid="oYD2cGe5Vk6jVd_QzRP7ng" hash="n5fGfg">We often hear of members who have separated themselves from the Church because some leader, teacher, or member has said or done something to offend them. Others have had their faith shaken when the Brethren have taken a stand with which they disagree. In such cases, I wonder about the faith of those people and whether it was grounded securely in a testimony of the Lord, Jesus Christ, or merely based on their own ideas and social perceptions of what the Church and its members should be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p20" pid="KVyxOS4k8UKV0vgFnAVP9w" hash="zMRgxg">Scripture teaches us: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 3:5</a>.) In His moving prayer recorded in the seventeenth chapter of John, the Savior taught this profound truth: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.3" class="scriptureRef">John 17:3</a>.) Building a testimony on the foundation of a sincere, personal relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, and on our faith in them, should be our highest priority.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p21" pid="EZtMEot6nEeJClBRE1yP-A" hash="4pvt-g">Anchored with that faith, we are ready for my second suggestion—another layer of kindling on the bonfire of testimony—it is humble, sincere repentance. Few things extinguish the fervor of the Holy Spirit in the heart of any individual more quickly than does sin. It dulls the spiritual senses, diminishes confidence and personal security, and separates the sinner from the Savior. One who carries the burden of unrepented sin is more likely to rationalize additional disobedience. The more sin is rationalized, the greater the possibility of destruction by Satan’s wolves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p22" pid="131ZjHwUYEKiDRn7Q-bXsw" hash="FO9gyQ">Few would argue the potential spiritual risk of major sins like murder or marital infidelity. But what about the person who uses employer’s time to complete personal projects, the person who sneaks into a pornographic movie, the student who cheats at school, the person who criticizes others unfairly, or the parent who thinks family home evening is a good idea—for someone else?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p23" pid="8RnvdNEgQ0WlVOinZCG8bg" hash="K0hx4w">The simple fact is this: anything that does not draw us closer to God takes us away from Him. We have no middle ground, no foggy gray area where we can sin a little without suffering spiritual decline. That is why we must repent and come to Christ daily on submissive knees so that we can prevent our bonfires of testimony from being snuffed out by sin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p24" pid="yeqD1shPHkmIHSs1zCdP8w" hash="Pg3uVg">My third suggestion is that we follow the example of the Savior. He set the pattern.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p25" pid="ya0K8zduLU-SJgOsCeGLnA" hash="PNohWw">In any pursuit and under any condition, we can ask ourselves what would Jesus do and then determine our own course accordingly. For example, what sort of home teacher would the Savior be? Would He occasionally miss visiting families? Would He visit them without a message? Or would He minister to His families like the Good Shepherd that He is, with constant watch care and loving kindness? Deep in our hearts we know what kind of home teacher Jesus would be, just as we know what kind of bishop, teacher, Primary leader, clerk, or youth adviser He would be. Even though we could never in this life measure up completely to His standard of excellence, our attempt to do so will lead us to do far better than otherwise.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p26" pid="8r_5SaUTnUGefeFPnIf4eg" hash="w5_rBg">We can apply the same principle to other pursuits the same way. What sort of parent would Jesus be? What sort of neighbor, employer, employee, student, or friend? If we live our lives to conform as nearly as possible to the pattern the Savior has set, our testimonies will be fortified continually and our spiritual bonfires will never be reduced to embers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p27" pid="t2yhO5eaCEiwcWmEiELvQQ" hash="_Ym8dQ">We live in perilous times. The influence of Satan often appears to be unchecked and overwhelming. Remember the promise that God has given to those who build and maintain brightly burning bonfires of testimony to counter the wolves that threaten us. This is His promise: “Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will … uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 41:10</a>.)</p>

Firm, secure testimonies will be the difference between faithfulness and disaffection.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p29" pid="lBGKHnxrrUKShZNH9rEdug" hash="q-9XpQ">I bear testimony that in order for us to enjoy a happy, rewarding, and spiritual life, we must make sure that our testimonies are built upon the foundation of faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ, humble and sincere repentance, and following the example of the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/spiritual-bonfires-of-testimony.p30" pid="11kmMFTnNEuOOglDK8Cibw" hash="TLe-nA">I know that our Heavenly Father lives and loves each of His children. His Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer. Christ’s atonement provides for all of us immortality and the possibility of eternal life, the kind of life that God lives, if we will repent of our sins and will be true and faithful in keeping the commandments. Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. Through him, the Lord restored the gospel of Jesus Christ in these the latter days. President Ezra Taft Benson is our prophet today. I testify of these divine truths in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Being in the world can be frightening because we live at a time when Satan is becoming more and more bold.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p6" pid="Tr6NXQnvpEqxNrgBITHlaw" hash="myaXEA">I observed a marvelous display of obedience during a recent visit to a large cattle ranch in Argentina. Early one morning, the gauchos brought forty horses into a corral to select their mounts for the day. Gauchos are like cowboys in the United States. Each gaucho went into the corral and whistled softly like this [whistling]. This established their presence. When the horses heard the soft whistling, they lined up quickly near the fence, facing the gauchos. The horses held their heads high, kept their eyes constantly on their masters, and kept their ears forward in an alert, receptive stance. They gave complete attention and appeared to be anxious to serve. They quickly organized themselves into a line as if for a full military dress inspection or review. The gauchos stepped back out of the way and whistled again. The horses circled quickly to the other side of the corral and lined up facing the gauchos. They looked as if a drill sergeant had called them to attention. Each gaucho chose his mount for the day’s work and walked up to the horse he had selected. The others stayed in line waiting for their assignments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p7" pid="gyKsG4wSKkyKWqk-SMZ_-w" hash="L2_z4g">When I asked how the gauchos taught the horses to be so obedient, I was informed that their training started when the horses were colts. Each one learned from its caring mother and from other mature horses. The gauchos began training the colts when they were young, with kindness, never using force of a lasso or a whip.</p>

God has given you the authority to act in His name during this youthful season of your lives. The Aaronic Priesthood will prepare you for the time when you will be ready to receive the greater authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood. Prepare well for that great blessing by being faithful now in magnifying your Aaronic Priesthood.</p>

Prepare, bless, and pass the emblems of the holy sacrament worthily. Diligently gather fast offerings to assist your bishop in his duty to care for those in need. Tend to your home teaching duties consistently. Home teaching is an excellent preparation for missionary service. Attend all of your meetings regularly.

We ask them to carry it with them and read from it often. We have also provided a handbook for our young men and young women. Its title is <span class="emphasis">For the Strength of Youth.</span> We ask you to carry it with you, refer to it frequently, and live according to the counsel it contains. That counsel can protect you from evil and help you to obey even when obedience is difficult.</p>

Remember that “it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> You will grow and learn by overcoming obstacles.

In fact, it can sometimes seem stifling, uncomfortable, or even impossible. “But with God all things are possible.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> You can be obedient. You can defeat Satan and overcome temptation. God “will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> The Lord does not expect anything of you that you cannot do.

Swirling all around us are the whirlwinds of strife and contention, temptation and sin. “The priesthood is a shield against temptation; it motivates and inspires young men to the highest and noblest of deeds; every young man, whether he holds the office of deacon, teacher, or priest, is a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p17" pid="SQTS7-x4HkSljxaRvyt61w" hash="JJN5Zw">How could we serve Him unless we were free from the evils of mortal life? Some mistakenly think it is impossible to avoid the sins of the world. To escape evil, a few even attempt to isolate themselves from society. The Savior prayed “not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> That, too, is our prayer for you young men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p18" pid="x1hXSLYMoUqKyzHDPiPRzQ" hash="RwneDw">Willing obedience provides lasting protection against Satan’s alluring and tantalizing temptations. Jesus is our perfect example of obedience. Learn to do as He did when Satan tempted Him in the wilderness. Even though He was weakened by fasting, His answer was quick and firm: “Get thee behind me, Satan.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> Elder Neal A. Maxwell said this of the Savior’s example in resisting temptation: “Jesus noticed the tremendous temptations that came to Him, but He did not process and reprocess them. Instead, He rejected them promptly. <span class="emphasis">If we entertain temptations, soon they begin entertaining us!”</span><span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> When Satan comes calling, cast him out as quickly as possible. Do not let temptation even begin to entertain you.</p>

Rise above the squalor of pornography, obscenity, and filth. Be virtuous and chaste. Uphold your young sisters in the gospel by respecting their budding womanhood and protecting their virtue. Always conduct yourselves according to the commandments of God when you are with them. You want your girlfriends to remain clean and pure. Just as you surely would protect the chastity of your own sister in your family, likewise protect the virtue of your sisters in God’s family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p20" pid="fNe5j5ZmW0uF7QCfGJrKWg" hash="ZE_s7g">If you make a mistake, obtain forgiveness through sincere, humble repentance. God does forgive; it is a miracle made possible by the atoning sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ. But mistakes that seem to be small to you, if uncorrected, can have enormous consequences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p21" pid="-NN2xPT7qE6bYIezeqsI9g" hash="AdmLaQ">The First Presidency has stated very clearly that serious sins, especially immorality, could disqualify a young man from serving a mission. Yes, repentance is possible, but the privilege and blessing of serving a full-time mission for the Lord could be lost through transgression. Momentary lapses in an otherwise outstanding life could jeopardize this significant privilege and blessing. Brethren, never let your guard down!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p22" pid="kq4z-GjGvESeKs3FZiWupg" hash="HLScFQ">Even though a loving God has provided a pathway to repentance, you simply do not have the time to waste in transgression. Sin wounds the soul; healing slows progress and takes time that could have been used in productive service and progress. The Lord needs you faithful and worthy young men, now and in the future, to combat the forces of Satan that are ravaging the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p23" pid="_dTui3k8rka-zhUYp78y2A" hash="momoFw">Let me share an experience from my own youth, an experience that taught me the importance of obedience in doing even small things well. I loved to play football in high school and at the university. I wanted to be a good athlete. I especially remember one game. Our university team faced the University of Colorado in a contest for the conference championship. We were well coached and really well prepared.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p24" pid="JXhIgEqbA0yPY1Dt7V8FJA" hash="MthWaQ">The star of the Colorado team was Byron “Whizzer” White, an all-American who was a tremendous athlete. He was a fast, versatile, and powerful quarterback. His athletic prowess was legendary. His scholastic abilities were equally impressive. He later became a Rhodes scholar and retired recently as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p25" pid="kYd9fTVMFk6aTUSCRYjSnw" hash="qyrnoA">Our wise coach was Ike Armstrong. His warnings before the game included two simple instructions: one, do not kick off or punt the ball to Whizzer White, and two, never let him get past the line of scrimmage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p26" pid="LP1Z71n54EOMunIkt6RjeA" hash="SNyV9g">We followed his instructions and held Colorado scoreless throughout the first half. Early in the second half, however, Whizzer White kicked a field goal. We answered with a touchdown and kicked the extra point. We were ahead seven to three at the end of the third quarter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p27" pid="n6C3QuP_LEm7H_KK4Pu52g" hash="JoYO1A">On the second play of the fourth quarter, we punted. The ball sailed deep into the corner of the field, near their end zone. Whizzer White plucked the tumbling ball out of the air at his fifteen-yard line and dropped back to his five-yard line to evade the first of our tacklers. Then with the speed, strength, and agility that had built his reputation, he started upfield and sidestepped every player of our team. I managed only to touch him with my little finger. He ran the entire length of the field for a touchdown—thrilling for Colorado, but disappointing for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p28" pid="xIzasaAVbE2akO406sbwEA" hash="V2t-nQ">Later in the fourth quarter, Whizzer dashed around his own right end and beyond the line of scrimmage and ran fifty-seven yards for another touchdown. The game ended with a score seventeen to seven. Colorado won the game and the conference championship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p29" pid="DeFjtIb1t0aM-00Mkwtpyg" hash="tMNEJw">Though we lost, I learned the importance of constant obedience to detailed instructions of our leader. Failure to obey our coach’s two pregame warnings for just two plays—two brief lapses in an otherwise outstanding effort—cost us the game and the conference championship. That is all it took for us to lose something we had worked so hard to achieve.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p30" pid="QCPA9_KYhEa7l2Mq3Uqrsg" hash="qU80NA">I testify to you, my brethren, that your Heavenly Father loves you and wants you to receive and enjoy every blessing He has for His children, including the blessings of happiness and peace. We, the leaders of the Lord’s church, love you. We pray for you earnestly and constantly. Your leaders in your wards and branches and in your stakes and districts likewise love you and pray for you. Your parents’ prayers and love for you are beyond measure. We all want you to succeed in this life and to qualify for the greatest of God’s gifts—eternal life in the celestial kingdom. To achieve your goals in this mortal life and prove yourselves worthy of eternal blessings, learn to obey. There is no other way. Obedience brings great strength and power into your lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/live-in-obedience.p31" pid="OCHTdJH36ECInBq1kXorCw" hash="O5b47w">The commandments of the gospel come from a tender, loving Father whose laws are given to make us happy, to protect us, and to help us avoid the inescapable pain and misery that always result when we yield to Satan and give in to temptation. “Wickedness never was happiness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> God is, indeed, our loving Father. Everything He does is for our good. He knows all things. He knows us much better than we know ourselves, and He knows what is best for us.</p>

Hunter as the fourteenth President of the Church in this dispensation. He is a man without guile. I sustain him with all of my heart and pray that I might serve faithfully under his inspired leadership, and also his marvelous Counselors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/deep-roots.p2" pid="ho-puyNiJUeGPnR-PKtX8A" hash="Sw6k8Q">Recently on the island of Molokai in the Hawaiian Islands, Sister Wirthlin and I passed by two very large trees that the wind had blown down and uprooted. These huge trees had extremely shallow roots. I wondered if they would have survived the winds and storms if their roots had been deeper. Relatively mild gusts of wind blow some trees down. Graceful palm trees, for example, are lovely to look at but will not stand up in a heavy wind because they are not well anchored. Contrast this with giant oak trees that have deep root systems that can extend two and one-half times their height. Such trees rarely are blown down regardless of how violent the storms may be.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/deep-roots.p3" pid="4tEJoV1F1EuBegrqviCZxg" hash="4akAWg">Faithful members of the Church should be like oak trees and should extend deep roots into the fertile soil of the fundamental principles of the gospel. We should understand and live by the simple, basic truths and not complicate them. Our foundations should be solid and deep-rooted so we can withstand the winds of temptation, false doctrine, adversity, and the onslaught of the adversary without being swayed or uprooted. Members whose roots are only at the surface of the gospel need to sink them deeper until they reach the bedrock below the soft topsoil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/deep-roots.p4" pid="HMqnO6jFr0-Kg5QYD0h9yA" hash="iHC66w">Spiritual nourishment is just as important as a balanced diet to keep us strong and healthy. We nourish ourselves spiritually by partaking of the sacrament weekly, reading the scriptures daily, praying daily in personal and family prayer, and performing temple work regularly. Our spiritual strengths are like batteries; they need to be charged and frequently recharged.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/deep-roots.p5" pid="pPpvuWIkkkihaA4RuhkrYw" hash="yahO5w">I wish to review with you a few core principles of the gospel into which our spiritual roots should sink deeply. Most important is the reality of our Heavenly Father; his Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/deep-roots.p6" pid="C0XDUtIp5EWW12onJqwaZA" hash="d-KlHg">Our Heavenly Father is the father of our spirits and of the entire human race; we are his offspring, his sons and daughters. We have inherited divine characteristics from him. Because of his love for his children, he provided a plan for us to progress and reach our highest potential and return to his presence. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/deep-roots.p7" pid="9MLT5bRenkKcwX9c-8zxNQ" hash="SbAMYw">Jesus Christ is infinitely more than a great teacher and philosopher. He is the Firstborn Son of God, the Only Begotten Son in the flesh, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. He accepted the Father’s great plan of happiness, saying, “Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> The Father’s plan gave us our agency to choose right or wrong, good or evil so we can learn, develop, and progress. As part of the plan, Jesus offered to atone for the sins of all mankind and bear the suffering for those sins, satisfying the law of justice if the sinners repent. Otherwise they have to suffer and pay the penalty for their transgressions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/deep-roots.p8" pid="CLXejNOSXUeeIx71Qrq7Xg" hash="tGIqRA">He also offered his mortal life, was crucified, and became the first to be resurrected, making possible the literal resurrection of all of our Father’s children. He created this earth under his Father’s direction as a place for us to live in mortality and prove whether we would be obedient and “do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> He also created innumerable other worlds. He is our Mediator with the Father and our Exemplar in all things. His loving kindness toward us is beyond our comprehension. He stands at the head of his church, which bears his name, and directs it through his prophets.</p>

As the Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> He is a witness and testifier of the truth of the gospel. He is a revelator and teacher who conveys information to our spirits with far more certainty than is possible by our natural senses. He can guide us in every choice and decision and never will deceive or mislead us. He is a comforter who brings peace to our souls in times of need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/deep-roots.p16" pid="_cnSzy98U0i2lGyHJypcWw" hash="13ZQ3A">Just as real is one who would prevent us from becoming rooted to God and his truths. Two of his names are Lucifer and Satan. He is the adversary of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and of everything that is good. He rejected the Father’s plan in premortal life, saying, “Send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> The Father then said:</p>

We learn from the Book of Mormon prophet Moroni that “All things which are good cometh of God; and that which is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.</p>

They are evidences of the relentless campaign of Satan and those who follow him. He uses every tool and device available to him to deceive, confuse, and mislead. He has many followers who do anything for money without regard for the effects of their misdeeds.</p>

One of the most pervasive deceptions in recent years is the notion that immorality is normal and acceptable and has no negative consequences. In truth, immorality is the underlying cause of much suffering and many other problems that are prevalent today, including rampant disease, abortion, broken families, families without fathers, and mothers who themselves are children. President Ezra Taft Benson said, “The plaguing sin of this generation is sexual immorality.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> The Lord said, “Thou shalt not … commit adultery, … nor do anything like unto it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> That means we are to avoid abnormal sexual behavior, including fornication, homosexual behavior, child molestation, or any other perversion of God’s plan of happiness.</p>

For many years after the Prophet Joseph Smith received this revelation in 1833, people deceived themselves into believing they could ignore or violate this law of health with impunity. I believe the Lord inspired President Heber J. Grant to emphasize it frequently and forcefully to counter the media that was becoming increasingly sophisticated and persuasive during his time. Today medical science has proven that tobacco and other such addictive substances are poisons that are harmful to the human body.</p>

In the process their own testimonies become deeply rooted. Missionary service provides the finest foundation possible for young people as they move into adulthood.

Weary, hungry, and thirsty from their journey, they stopped at Jacob’s well in the city of Sychar. While the disciples went in search of food, the Savior remained at the well. He requested a drink from a Samaritan woman who had come to draw water. Because the Jews and Samaritans were divided by rancor and did not often speak to one another, the woman responded to the Savior’s request with a question: “How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Though weary and thirsty, the Master Teacher took this opportunity to testify of his divine role as the Redeemer of the world and to proclaim authoritatively his true identity as the long-promised Messiah. He patiently, yet thoughtfully, answered the woman: “If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

He said: “Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</p>

[Some] have devoted their lives to finding the ‘fountain of youth,’ a miracle water which would bring everlasting life. Today [many] are still seeking … some magic ‘fountain’ that [will] bring forth success, fulfillment, and happiness. But most of this searching is in vain. … It is only this ‘living water,’ the gospel of Jesus Christ, that can and will bring a happy, a successful, and an everlasting life to the children of men.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

By living the gospel of Jesus Christ, we develop within ourselves a living spring that will quench eternally our thirst for happiness, peace, and everlasting life. The Lord explains clearly in the Doctrine and Covenants that only faithful obedience can tap the well of living water that refreshes and enlivens our souls: “But unto him that <span class="emphasis">keepeth my commandments</span> I will give the mysteries of my kingdom, and the same shall be in him a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

Astonished, the Samaritan woman left her water pot and hurried off to tell others of her interview with the Lord, saying, “Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> While she gathered those of her city who would listen, Jesus taught his now-returned disciples that he already had “meat to eat that ye know not of.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> To his puzzled disciples who were carrying the food they had acquired, he explained, “My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

Many in the world are searching, often intensely, for a source of refreshment that will quench their yearning for meaning and direction in their lives.

He came to respect deeply and value highly his pioneer heritage. He served valiantly as a young missionary in England. Throughout his adult life, he has worked tirelessly to build the kingdom. He has served under eight Presidents of the Church, including fourteen years as a counselor to the last three: Presidents Spencer W. Kimball, Ezra Taft Benson, and Howard W. Hunter.</p>

This is an age of digital information. Our computers have become windows through which we can gaze upon a world that is virtually without horizons or boundaries. Literally at the click of a button, we can browse through the digitized libraries of universities, museums, government agencies, and research institutions located throughout the world. A worldwide web of electronic connections now moves data at ever-increasing speed and volume along what we call the information superhighway. Through the windows of personal computer monitors in homes and offices, we can access this network of interconnected data banks to see texts, art, photos, maps, and charts and to hear music and speech that are stored in widely dispersed locations.</p>

Telescopes and microscopes bring to our view the otherwise unseen and unknown. Modern medicine uses imaging “windows” such as magnetic resonance imaging scanners to bring into view otherwise unseen vital information that skilled physicians can use for the benefit of their patients. The air traffic controller’s radarscope is another example of a window that provides lifesaving vision of faraway objects that are invisible without this crucial instrument. A skilled controller can use the information on his radarscope to guide a pilot to safety.</p>

If we should yield to temptations of the adversary and find ourselves weakened spiritually, inspired bishops and other caring leaders can open the windows of revelation to provide spiritual direction. Well-prepared and inspired missionaries can open the windows of heaven to enlighten those “who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Through these divine windows, we can gaze with the Savior “upon the wide expanse of eternity,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span> a universe without horizons, “worlds without end.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_29">29</span> I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

We’ve come together in this historic Tabernacle and across the world “to speak one with another concerning the welfare of [our] souls”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> and to “feast upon the words of Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p2" pid="DYREhSrSak6Z2jGotlaZBg" hash="grVcdA">I speak to you today of the faith of our pioneer forefathers. We can attribute much of the remarkable progress of the Church and of this state of Utah to their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We stand in awe of their resolve and tenacity in holding fast to their convictions despite the obstacles they had to overcome.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p3" pid="MsSEB44hckO6Ag2INBVRwA" hash="1DUAsA">The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the foundation principle of the gospel and the basis of all righteousness. The Prophet Joseph Smith said that “faith is the assurance … of the existence of things … not seen.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> The scriptures define faith as “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p4" pid="SV7thutF10K-Tw9FZMcMHA" hash="VYYCLw">We delight in our faith in our Savior today. We testify to the world that “the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> As members of the Lord’s Church and as faithful advocates of His restored gospel, we declare soberly that God lives, that Jesus is, indeed, the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. Tomorrow is Easter, a day to ponder the mission of Jesus Christ, the Firstborn Son of our Heavenly Father. The Atonement, including the Resurrection of the Savior, provides immortality and the possibility of eternal life for all of our Father’s children. How grateful we should be for these blessings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p5" pid="x9OIJfMY50yJ-goRK18VUQ" hash="wN6rgg">We declare gladly to all who have “ears to hear”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> that the Lord, “knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon [His] servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> to restore the fulness of the gospel that the Saints of earlier days had.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p6" pid="e807--qup0yn5RvtUetcTw" hash="X8AyQw">We testify “from the top of the mountains”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> that President Gordon B. Hinckley is God’s prophet on the earth today. Because of our faith in our prophet, Latter-day Saints echo the words of the Apostle Peter: “We have therefore a more sure knowledge of the word of prophecy, to which word of prophecy ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light which shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> The light of divine revelation shines forth from a living prophet to brighten a darkened world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p7" pid="ql0zcXThzEOVlu4a9IAgeA" hash="97I_tA">From the beginning of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in America, religious freedom has allowed the Church to flourish. Roots sunk deep into the rich soil of obedience and sacrifice have borne good fruit. Generations of faithful members have forged a firm foundation. From this base of strength “shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> President Joseph F. Smith, who came across the plains as a boy and who knew much of adversity in his life, declared his testimony as follows: “The kingdom of God is here to grow, to spread abroad, to take root in the earth, and to abide where the Lord has planted it by His own power and by His own word, in the earth, never more to be destroyed or to cease, but to continue until the purposes of the Almighty shall be accomplished, every whit that has been spoken of by the mouths of the holy prophets since the world began.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p8" pid="FYnNKPb7PUWIZYsPzzFvUg" hash="-UJqDg">President Hinckley noted that “‘the church is growing in a marvelous and wonderful way. … It is spreading over the Earth in a miraculous manner.’” He explained that one of the reasons for this growth is that “‘we have a demanding religion. … We have great expectations concerning our people. We have standards that we expect them to live by, and that is one of the things that attracts people to this church: It stands as an anchor in a world of shifting values.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

At the same time that we look ahead with optimism, we should pause and look back on the faith of our humble pioneer forefathers. Their faith built the foundation on which the Church continues to flourish.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p10" pid="doxKJcPVwkyGPAM83FbaPg" hash="3VW-pQ">During February of this year, citizens in Nauvoo and communities across Iowa commemorated the 150th anniversary of the exodus of the Saints. In 1846, more than 10,000 left the thriving city that had been built on the banks of the Mississippi River. With faith in prophetic leaders, those early Church members left their “City Beautiful” and struck off into the wilderness of the American frontier. They did not know exactly where they were going, precisely how many miles lay ahead, how long the journey would take, or what the future held in store for them. But they <span class="emphasis">did know</span> they were led by the Lord and His servants. Their faith sustained them. They hoped “for things which [were] not seen, which are true.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Like Nephi of old, they were “led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which [they] should do.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p11" pid="XErjeL8JMk2gno3_I-KYDg" hash="iJ9xug">Fearing more of the mob violence that had claimed the lives of the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum on 27 June 1844, Brigham Young, leading the Church as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, announced in September 1845 that the Saints would leave Nauvoo in the spring of 1846. Most of those in Nauvoo believed fully that when Brigham Young announced that they must leave, they were hearing what the Lord wanted them to do. They responded in faith to the direction of the Lord. Throughout the fall and winter months of 1845–46, Church members set about vigorously making preparations for the journey.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p12" pid="LNcFL5WXjEG0qxFCZm9dsA" hash="Ahazeg">When Newel Knight informed his wife, Lydia, that the Saints would have to leave Nauvoo and move yet again, she responded with tenacious faith, saying, “‘Well, there’s nothing to discuss. Our place is with the Kingdom of God. Let us at once set about making preparations to leave.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Brother Knight had moved his family several times already as many of the Saints had moved from New York to Ohio to Missouri and to Illinois. Lydia Knight’s devoted submission to what she knew was God’s will typifies powerfully the faith of those heroic early Saints. With their faith in mind, the words of a familiar hymn take on added meaning:</p>

He directed the first company of pioneer families to leave Nauvoo on 4 February 1846, a cold winter day. They drove their laden wagons and their livestock down Parley Street—a street that became known as the “Street of Tears”—to a landing where they were ferried across the river to Iowa. Chunks of ice floating in the river crunched against the sides of the flatboats and barges that carried the wagons across the Mississippi. A few weeks later, temperatures dropped even further and wagons could cross the river more easily over a bridge of ice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p14" pid="EKA-kVDU3029ty-5Elw3Ng" hash="Bom_GA">Sister Wirthlin and I visited Nauvoo in early March this year. The weather was bitterly cold. As we stood in the chilling wind, looking out across the broad expanse of the Mississippi, we felt a deeper sense of appreciation and gratitude for those Saints as they left their beloved city. We wondered how they ever survived. What a sacrifice to leave behind so much for the uncertain future that lay ahead! No wonder so many tears were shed as the fleeing pioneers drove their wagons rumbling down Parley Street to cross the river with no hope of ever returning to their “City Beautiful.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p15" pid="V2AAt2yUgkyKL6WwBD5EPA" hash="o5vzZQ">Once across the river, they camped temporarily at Sugar Creek before starting their trek west toward the Rocky Mountains. The journey, which historian H. H. Bancroft described as a migration without “parallel in the world’s history,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> had begun.</p>

Hardships caused by cold, snow, rain, mud, sickness, hunger, and death challenged the faith of these hardy pioneers. But they were determined to follow their leaders and to do, no matter the cost, what they believed fervently to be the will of God. Their faith was challenged, and for some it faltered in especially difficult times. But it did not fail them. Many were sustained by the assurances they had received in temple ordinances performed in the Nauvoo Temple.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p17" pid="lNYM1yMxhkqrFbrGRuzQAQ" hash="3GnoEg">One of the more difficult hardships endured by many of the sisters was delivering their babies under harsh, extreme conditions along the trail. Eliza R. Snow wrote that as the pioneers “journeyed onward, mothers gave birth to offspring under almost every variety of circumstances imaginable, except those to which they had been accustomed; some in tents, others in wagons—in rainstorms and in snowstorms.” Sister Snow went on to record in her journal that she “heard of one birth which occurred under the rude shelter of a hut, the sides of which were formed of blankets fastened to poles stuck in the ground, with a bark roof through which the rain was dripping. Kind sisters stood holding dishes to catch the water … , thus protecting the [little one] and its mother from a shower-bath [on its entrance to] the stage of human life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p18" pid="Bb82I3wF2kanwQEbE7wnaQ" hash="BAVayA">What a sacrifice these good sisters made! Some mothers lost their own lives in childbirth. Many babies did not survive. My wife’s grandmother, Elizabeth Riter, was born at Winter Quarters in the back of a covered wagon during a rainstorm. Fortunately, both the mother and the newborn infant survived. With great love for the woman who gave life to her, Elizabeth often lovingly recounted how an umbrella was held over her mother throughout the ordeal to shield her from the water leaking through the wagon’s cover.</p>

Referring to his own pioneer grandparents, he said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p21" pid="0LKraqLsOUOZ2J_rgS1W2A" hash="pxZsdw">“Because of the faith of these forefathers of mine, I am here, living in [these] peaceful valleys, in the shadows of great mountains, and above all, within hearing of the voice of latter-day prophets. “So, I owe to them … a debt of gratitude, … a debt that can best be paid in service to this great cause.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/04/faith-of-our-fathers.p22" pid="CIbKQ188_kyJgqzEgtE7fw" hash="DM-UBg">Now, as we see the kingdom expand throughout the world, an ever smaller percentage of Church members live in the valleys of Utah, in the shadows of our beautiful mountains. But today, modern communication technology allows Saints throughout the world to be “within the hearing of the voice of latter-day prophets.” As it was with my father, so it is for all of us. We who have been blessed to know the fulness of the restored gospel owe a debt of gratitude to those who have gone before us, who have given so much to build the kingdom into the worldwide miracle that it is today. Our debt of gratitude to our forebears is a “debt that can best be paid in service to this great cause.”</p>

He who calls us will qualify us for the work if we will serve with humility, prayer, diligence, and faith. Perhaps we feel inadequate. Maybe we doubt ourselves, thinking that what we have to offer the Lord personally is too slight to even be noticed. The Lord is well aware of our mortality. He knows our weaknesses. He understands the challenges of our everyday lives. He has great empathy for the temptations of earthly appetites and passions. The Apostle Paul wrote in his epistle to the Hebrews that the Savior is “touched with the feeling of our infirmities” because he “was in all points tempted like as we are.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>

When we do, the Lord can work His mighty miracles through us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span></p>

Faust has reassured us that whatever our abilities, faithful service not only is acceptable to the Lord, but also qualifies us for great blessings bestowed by Him, blessings that enrich and expand our lives. President Faust explained “that this church does not necessarily attract great people but more often makes ordinary people great. …</p>

I was taught the importance of such caring attention and loving personal influence many years ago on Temple Square.

I pray for the guidance of the Holy Spirit. I would like to consider with you the importance of mortal life as a time of preparation. As Amulek testified, “This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-time-to-prepare.p2" pid="Bhtbe_CxwUuHDVaZgIR0Gw" hash="CvscuQ">As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have a special understanding of the eternal nature of our souls. We know that we had a premortal existence. We accepted our Heavenly Father’s great plan of happiness and chose to follow our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Principles we adopted and for which we contended were (1) agency, the ability to choose good or evil; (2) progress, the ability to learn and become like our Heavenly Father; and (3) faith, faith in our Father’s plan and in the Atonement of Jesus Christ that enables us to return to the presence of God. Consequently, we were permitted to enter mortal life. Concerning mortal life, the Master said, “We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-time-to-prepare.p3" pid="8X0z19RY10Sql1RizWXbBA" hash="7CBRxg">We understand that we will live a postmortal life of infinite duration and that we determine the kind of life it will be by our thoughts and actions in mortality. Mortality is very brief but immeasurably important.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-time-to-prepare.p4" pid="fbbpmdUGsU6QTQnyq9XagQ" hash="e9xRKg">We learn from the scriptures that the “course of the Lord is one eternal round”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> and that God knows “all things, being from everlasting to everlasting.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> We are also eternal beings. Our presence here on earth is an essential step in our loving Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness for His children. “[We] are, that [we] might have joy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “happiness is the object and design of our existence … if we pursue the path … [of] virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: “We are here [in this life] with a marvelous inheritance, a divine endowment. How different this world would be if every person realized that all of his actions have eternal consequences. How much more satisfying our years may be if … we recognize that we form each day the stuff of which eternity is made.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/the-time-to-prepare.p6" pid="fmijlLXJ0kyNbBEftypxcA" hash="JnNM6A">That understanding helps us to make wise decisions in the many choices of our daily lives. Seeing life from an eternal perspective helps us focus our limited mortal energies on the things that matter most. We can avoid wasting our lives laying “up for [ourselves] treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> We can lay up treasures in heaven and not trade our eternal spiritual birthright.</p>

We might compare our eternal journey to a race of three laps around the track. We have completed the first lap successfully and have made wonderful progress. We have started on the second lap. Can you imagine a world-class runner stopping along the track at this point to pick flowers or chase a rabbit that crossed his path? Yet this is what we are doing when we occupy our time with worldly pursuits that do not move us closer to the third lap toward eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

If we do so, when final judgment comes we will experience the joy of standing before our Father in Heaven as “complete” and “finished” sons and daughters, polished by obedience and worthy of the inheritance that He has promised to the faithful.</p>

We cannot return to the presence of our Father in Heaven without helping our brothers and sisters. Once we understand that we are all literally brothers and sisters in the family of God, we should also feel an obligation for one another’s welfare and show our love through deeds of kindness and concern. Charity, “the pure love of Christ,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> must motivate us in our associations with every one of our Heavenly Father’s children.</p>

Dates that come around every year help us measure progress in our lives. One annual event, New Year’s Day, is a time of reflection and resolution.</p>

We pause to recognize the date of our temple sealing as a special anniversary because that ordinance binds us together forever with our most cherished loved ones. Worthiness interviews, especially annual temple recommend interviews, give us another opportunity to review our progress in fulfilling the glorious stewardship our Father in Heaven has given each of us. Certainly we must watch over and care for our own souls. On these occasions, we renew covenants, affirm commitments, and establish eternal goals.</p>

For example, in less than 15 months—454 days, to be precise—we will experience a New Year’s Day when all four numerals in the calendar year will change at the same time. Public opinion polls indicate that this singular calendar change “is looming increasingly large in the public consciousness.” Surveys show that people are anticipating the moment with “a very positive outlook.” One forecaster said that the millennial calendar change “will be a profound milestone in people’s lives, an opportunity to stop and start anew.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

In much of the world, calendar years are numbered forward and backward from the entire time of His birth. He taught the gospel of repentance and organized His Church, atoned for the sins of all mankind, and was crucified. He was resurrected, opening the way for all to overcome death and have our sins forgiven if we repent. His teachings established standards of human behavior that will endure eternally.</p>

We should resolve to begin a new era of personal obedience to prepare for His return. Mortality is fleeting. We all have much to accomplish in preparation to meet Him. As Latter-day Saints, “we believe all things, we hope all things. … If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> What do we believe that will motivate us to move forward?

We read in Moroni, “Cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all. … Whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Charity can be the outward expression of faith and hope. If sought and obtained, these three foundation elements of celestial character will abide with us in this life and beyond the veil into the next life. Remember that the “same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that [you] go out of this life … will have power to possess your body in [the] eternal world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> We should not wait a single day to intensify our personal efforts to strengthen these virtuous, lovely, and praiseworthy attributes.</p>

Faith begets hope, and together they foster charity. We read in Moroni, “Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope; and if there must be hope there must also be charity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> These three virtues may be sequential initially, but once obtained, they become interdependent. Each one is incomplete without the others. They support and reinforce each other. Moroni explained, “And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of God; neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God if ye have not faith; neither can ye if ye have no hope.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

We all are familiar with Paul’s teaching that “charity never faileth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> Certainly we need unfailing spiritual strength in our lives. Moroni recorded the revelation “that faith, hope and charity bringeth [us] unto [the Lord]—the fountain of all righteousness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>

In fact, He revealed the qualifications required to labor in His service in these words: “No one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love, having faith, hope, and charity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/cultivating-divine-attributes.p13" pid="Q91FPOctqE-CclWCE8doiw" hash="dFHZYg">Mormon taught that “charity is the pure love of Christ” and exhorted us to “pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that [we] may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> Note that charity is given only to those who seek it, only to those who earnestly pray for it, only to those who are disciples of Christ. Before we can be filled with this pure love, we must start at the beginning with the first principle of the gospel. We must have “first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span></p>

There we learn the purpose of life, strengthen our commitment as disciples of Christ by entering into sacred covenants with Him, and seal our families together for eternity across generations. Receiving our own endowment in a temple and returning frequently to perform sacred ordinances for our kindred dead increases our faith, strengthens our hope, and deepens our charity. We receive our own endowment with faith and hope that we will understand the Lord’s plan for His children, will recognize the divine potential within each of us as children of our Heavenly Father, and will be faithful to the end in keeping the covenants we make.

As we reflect on the life of the Savior and His Resurrection, certainly the many images of those who petitioned Him for help come to my mind. I can easily imagine the deformed legs of a man unable to walk since birth or the tears flowing down a widow’s cheek as she follows the body of her only son as it is carried to its tomb. I see the empty eyes of the hungry, the trembling hands of the sick, the pleading voice of the condemned, the disconsolate eye of the outcast. All of them are reaching toward a solitary man, a man without wealth, without home, without position.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/inspired-church-welfare.p2" pid="cpEdMoRBqE219r6WG--UCQ" hash="3p81iQ">I see this man, the Son of the living God, look on each of them with infinite compassion. With a touch of His holy hand, He brings comfort to the downcast, healing to the sick, liberation to the condemned. With a word, the dead man rises from his bier and the widow embraces her enlivened son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/inspired-church-welfare.p3" pid="U8QsWG4M90GxHem9CTL-Cw" hash="BLPxrA">These and other miraculous acts of mercy and kindness, some widely known, others quiet and gentle, define for me one of the salient characteristics of the Savior: His love and compassion for the downtrodden, the weary, the weak, the suffering. Indeed, these acts of compassion are synonymous with His name.</p>

People from all walks of life travel to Church headquarters to see firsthand how the Church cares for the poor and needy without creating dependency on the part of those who receive or bitterness on the part of those who give. A president of a country, after visiting Welfare Square, canceled the remainder of his appointments for the day. “There is something here that is more important than anything else I have on my schedule,” he said. “I must stay and learn more.”</p>

In North America today, 80 Church farms produce nutritious food for the needy. Eighty cannery facilities preserve and package this life-sustaining food. More than 100 bishops’ storehouses stand ready to assist more than 10,000 bishops and branch presidents as they carry out their sacred obligation to seek out and assist the poor and needy in their wards and branches. Fifty Deseret Industries operations offer work and training to thousands. Worldwide, 160 employment centers help more than 78,000 people find jobs each year. Sixty-five LDS Social Services offices help member couples adopt children and provide counseling to those in need.</p>

The poor are exalted because they work for the temporary assistance they receive, they are taught correct principles, and they are able to lift themselves from poverty to self-reliance. The rich are made low because they humble themselves to give generously of their means to those in need.</p>

The man had been happily married for years, but because of a later addiction to alcohol and drugs he was left without a job, home, or family. Hard years of living on the street had degraded and humiliated him. With tears streaming down his face, he pleaded with his bishop for help.</p>

One man knew a dentist who might be willing to replace the man’s broken front teeth. The Relief Society president suggested that nutritious food from the bishops’ storehouse might improve his health. Another suggested that this man needed someone who could spend time with him daily and help him find the strength to overcome his addictions.</p>

Priesthood brethren gave the man a blessing. A charitable dentist replaced his broken teeth. Food from the bishops’ storehouse improved his health. A faithful elderly couple agreed to serve as special home teachers. They were with him daily to help him stick to his resolve.</p>

Slowly his life began to improve. Gradually the look of desperation and misery gave way to one of joy and happiness. Although it was a painful process, he was able to free himself from his addictions. He became an active member in the Church. A life of destitution and misery turned into one of hope and happiness. This is the Lord’s way of caring for those in need.</p>

Inordinate desire for material possessions can become an obsession that consumes our thoughts, drains our resources, and leads to unhappiness. Some members of the Church are increasingly burdened with unnecessary debt because of this sin. President Heber J. Grant said: “If there is any one thing that will bring peace and contentment into the human heart, and into the family, it is to live within our means. And if there is any one thing that is grinding and discouraging and disheartening, it is to have debts and obligations that one cannot meet.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

You cannot grow into the man you must become unless you first rise above the things of the world that clamor for your attention. For example, some of the world’s music is degrading, vulgar, and inappropriate and will drown out the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Bringing into your body substances forbidden by the Lord in the Word of Wisdom will prevent you from feeling and recognizing the promptings of the Holy Ghost.</p>

For me, this magnificent Conference Center with walls of enduring granite is a symbol of a great latter-day work—the stone that Daniel saw, “cut out of the mountain without hands”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> to stand forever as the kingdom of God. Whether you are here in person or participating in other locations, I commend you for your choice to be part of this historic general conference and pray that the Lord will bless you for your faithfulness.</p>

It was a challenging but wonderful time. I grew to love the people of that area of the world and felt reluctant to leave them. But my term of service ended in late August of 1939, and I made preparations to sail home.</p>

I cannot express to you my relief when we finally reached that safe harbor. I imagine I felt something of what the disciples of Jesus Christ felt on that day when they were with the Savior. They set sail upon the Sea of Galilee. The scriptures tell us that Jesus was weary, and He went to the back of the ship and fell asleep on a pillow.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Soon the skies darkened, and “there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> The storm raged. The disciples panicked. It seemed as though the boat would capsize, yet the Savior still slept. At last, they could wait no longer and they awakened Jesus. You can almost hear the anguish and despair in their voices as they pled with their Master, “Carest thou not that we perish?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

It is to you who are looking for a safe harbor that I wish to speak today, you whose hearts are breaking, you who are worried or afraid, you who bear grief or the burdens of sin, you who feel no one is listening to your cries, you whose hearts are pleading, “Master, carest thou not that I perish?” To you I offer a few words of comfort and of counsel.</p>

You can find peace amidst the storms that threaten you. Your Heavenly Father—who knows when even a sparrow falls—knows of your heartache and suffering. He loves you and wants the best for you. Never doubt this. While He allows all of us to make choices that may not always be for our own or even others’ well-being, and while He does not always intervene in the course of events, He has promised the faithful peace even in their trials and tribulations.</p>

I will protect you from the struggle”? I have watched our youngest grandson, Seth, as he was learning to walk. Through this process of gaining experience, he now walks with confidence. Could I have said to him, “Out of my love for you, I will save you from this”? If so, because I could not bear to see him take a tumble at times, he may have never learned to walk.

And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> Even as he lifted up his voice, the serene comfort of the Lord came to him: “Peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p1" pid="jzeUuwFEZUi7UlTOfC4bEA" hash="-TL8NA">Once again we gather in this wondrous Conference Center and in many other places throughout the world. During this conference we will hear and have heard the testimonies of many servants of the Lord. Concerning testimony the Psalmist wrote, “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p2" pid="J2VbVszLVUiT7oDvAM7bLA" hash="IGcw9g">For Latter-day Saints, a testimony is “the assurance of the reality, truth, and goodness of God, of the teachings and atonement of Jesus Christ, and of the divine calling of latter-day prophets. … It is knowledge buttressed by divine personal confirmation by the Holy Ghost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p3" pid="ngNujpjhS0G9fHgZxNOAjA" hash="XZZbOQ">Expressions of solemn testimony have long been important to the children of God upon the earth. Individual testimonies have strengthened this Church from its earliest days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p4" pid="IKMzE7YTK0iQtKftIHhecQ" hash="tOvtsg">One evening in April 1836, for example, Elder Parley P. Pratt had retired early with pressing worries and a heavy heart. He didn’t know how he was going to meet his financial obligations. His wife had been seriously ill, and his aged mother had come to live with him. A year earlier the house he had been building had gone up in flames.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p5" pid="hP4zS6Q7TUCC5oja1qRCfQ" hash="M84XXQ">While he was deep in thought, a knock came at the door. Elder Heber C. Kimball entered and, filled with the spirit of prophecy, told Elder Pratt that he should travel to Toronto, Canada, where he would “find a people prepared for the fulness of the gospel” and that “many [would] be brought to the knowledge of the truth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p6" pid="gzmpvJrTikOrjhiY9dGOVw" hash="CbcIMQ">Despite his worries, Elder Pratt departed. When he arrived in Toronto, at first no one seemed interested in hearing what he had to say.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p7" pid="UkJtsp0ae0GHZSHrNdwaEg" hash="zOMqCQ">Among those he met was John Taylor, who had been a Methodist preacher. John received Elder Pratt courteously but coolly. John Taylor had heard distorted rumors about a new sect, their “golden bible,” and stories of angels appearing to an “unlearned youth, reared in the backwoods of New York.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p8" pid="XLOK7r0ejUCmuHdOjWIcig" hash="tPlLsg">A wise man, John Taylor had been seeking the truth all his life. He listened to what Elder Pratt had to say. Among other things, the stranger from America promised that anyone who investigated the gospel could know for himself, through the influence of the Holy Ghost, that it was true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p9" pid="iYmJWB5xXUe9bKGwIWYV6Q" hash="uaHFiA">At one point John Taylor asked, “What do you mean by this Holy Ghost? … [Will it give] a certain knowledge of the principles that you believe in?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p10" pid="7c-R0e2XxEyfwWXKxy8glQ" hash="9Wb9uw">The Apostle replied, “Yes, … and if it will not, then I am an impostor.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p11" pid="aa9O8sqTxU-JOuKy6yMhEw" hash="nxuarg">Hearing this, John Taylor took up the challenge, saying, “If I find his religion true, I shall accept it, no matter what the consequences may be; and if false, then I shall expose it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p12" pid="aliB2kn9R0WDxKM_r56zRg" hash="TOCgpA">Not only did he accept the challenge, but he “received that Spirit through obedience to the Gospel.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Soon he knew for himself what millions of others have since known, that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p13" pid="aDdfR1fLYkaCz2PYNRYmMA" hash="V0owkQ">Eventually, this man who had devoted his entire life to seeking the truth became the third President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p14" pid="uCPYwMo9JU2xiQJ-inCvKw" hash="yeA-ag">Over time, much in the world has changed. One thing, however, remains the same: the promise Elder Parley P. Pratt made to John Taylor 164 years ago is just as valid today as it was then—the Holy Ghost will confirm the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p15" pid="u0A5zmLju02ezn7IaSTwmg" hash="yKbG-w">Logic itself affirms that a loving Heavenly Father would not abandon His children without providing a way for them to learn of Him. One of the great messages of the Restoration is that the windows of heaven are open. All who seek to know the truth may, through revelations of the Spirit, know for themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p16" pid="uVEPFww2U0KcBd4mce-QNw" hash="dl_Egw">We are blessed to live in an age when apostles and prophets walk the earth bearing solemn and certain testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Many members—millions strong—add their voices to the growing chorus testifying that God once again has spoken to man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p17" pid="ET7bYbxTb0qNI9qdpIhDpg" hash="Yhf4Tw">President Joseph F. Smith declared: “Every person should know that the gospel is true, as this is everyone’s privilege who is baptized and receives the Holy Ghost. … I know that the gospel is true, and that God is with his people; and that if I will do my duty and keep his commandments, the clouds will roll by, and the mists will disappear.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p18" pid="HzB2G22jrE69VN_oatfLVQ" hash="jP3qZQ">How does one acquire a personal testimony?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p19" pid="IewAKLDAFE21kttZpgyXEw" hash="q0ABbw">Study the words of Moroni. He lived more than 1,500 years ago. This prophet had watched as his people were slaughtered and utterly devastated by civil war. His nation in ruins, his friends and loved ones slain, his own father—a great general and a righteous man—killed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p20" pid="ZpzDsL_1iUq7AIKEBARDHg" hash="Ep_2vA">This great prophet, Moroni, having lost all that he loved, stood alone. The last of his people, he was the lone witness to the desolation and heartbreak that results from hatred and rage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p21" pid="sd6d2xXSy06dZQ-APhoxWg" hash="dxcwgA">He had precious little time and space on his plates to write a few final words. His own people destroyed, Moroni wrote for our day. To us, he inscribed his precious words of farewell—his final words of counsel:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p22" pid="2OwqaCuLS0ibkFnxEK5oiA" hash="neMcrg">“Behold, I would exhort you,” he wrote, “that when ye shall read these things … ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men. … Ponder it in your hearts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p23" pid="wPRMPUUPVESM-DolKxcLGQ" hash="Y377gw">“And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p24" pid="IYSro3ADLU-bwM13jlF3SA" hash="IhG1Vg">Would that every ear could hear the last testimony of Moroni, this giant among men, this humble servant of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p25" pid="18SPwccfGkSVihRy3HXmlg" hash="GQl7kw">Do you want to know the truth of the holy scriptures? Do you wish to break the barriers that separate mortals from the knowledge of eternal verities? Do you wish to know—really know—the truth? Then follow Moroni’s counsel and you will surely find what you seek.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p26" pid="EHQ2_QmXDUy6luG-LaJosg" hash="G25Wwg">Be sincere. Study. Ponder. Pray sincerely, having faith.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p28" pid="p16yysSgpUmgwJo1fQWpHA" hash="hKfMMQ">A testimony of the truth of the gospel does not come the same way to all people. Some receive it in a unique, life-changing experience. Others gain a testimony slowly, almost imperceptibly until, one day, they simply know.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p29" pid="rzUzZwX730SrtKAGq67BZA" hash="DyI0QQ">Study the words of President David O. McKay, who tells of how, in his youth, he knelt and “prayed fervently and sincerely and with as much faith as a young boy could muster” that “God would declare to [him] the truth of his revelation to Joseph Smith.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p30" pid="W6673qnFeUyvj9xJzRkdqw" hash="Yb7KOg">President McKay related that when he arose from his knees, he had to admit that “no spiritual manifestation has come to me. If I am true to myself, I must say that I am just the same [boy] that I was before I prayed.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p31" pid="HMYLQsKwGUGtWZ89A3zI_g" hash="nmTBKw">I don’t know how young David felt in his heart at that time, but I’m sure he must have been disappointed—perhaps frustrated that he didn’t receive the spiritual experience that he had hoped for. But that didn’t discourage him from continuing his search for that knowledge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p32" pid="zyn376vAekmoGwVVWKSEEg" hash="5YdYig">The answer to his prayers did come, but not until years later, when he was serving as a missionary. Why was the answer to his prayer so long delayed? President McKay believed that this spiritual manifestation “came as a natural sequence to the performance of duty.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p33" pid="FGAhvhT6RkOZjfl0FfS3sA" hash="xb9l6w">The Savior taught a similar principle: When the truth of His message was challenged, He declared, “If any man will <span class="emphasis">do</span> [God’s] will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p34" pid="M7vF_LBbiE60XcAvDYn0CQ" hash="bOCzeg">Don’t you be discouraged if the answer to your prayer does not come immediately. Study, ponder, pray, sincerely having faith, and live the commandments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p35" pid="4aWeurFWbES1xz6wyjJ_qQ" hash="BYp96Q">“Dispute not because ye see not,” Moroni taught, “for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p36" pid="gT657B5bb0eeteRwFaW0ig" hash="cdO2yw">I remember as a child listening to the testimonies given by adults in my ward. Those testimonies entered my heart and inspired my soul. Wherever I go throughout the world—no matter the language, no matter the culture—I thrill to hear the testimonies of the Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p37" pid="DVAQ3iUqtE-vcYL3rybE8g" hash="kna7vw">Recently, I received a letter from our grandson who is a missionary. He wrote that members “who are reading scriptures and praying are more willing to share the gospel.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p38" pid="3hJqERpXSUyd7LNcu9kj-Q" hash="bR6VTQ">I believe he’s right. The more we study the scriptures and pray, the more likely we can enthusiastically share our testimonies of the gospel with others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p39" pid="vtGugh69GE29_43l1eAwdQ" hash="TmGAWA">Remember, Church members who receive a testimony of the gospel are under covenant “to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> It is clear we have a sacred obligation to obtain referrals for our missionaries. Witnesses have a special knowledge and are to bear testimony of “that which they have seen and heard and most assuredly believe.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> We make simple, clear, direct statements that we know with certainty and surety that the gospel is true because it has been “made known unto [us] by the Holy Spirit of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> In bearing such a testimony, speaking by the power of the Holy Ghost, we are promised that “the Holy Ghost shall be shed forth in bearing record unto all things whatsoever [we] shall say.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> We are blessed personally when we so testify.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p40" pid="B5SfN93sEUGa6XgC_JPj3w" hash="tQ3MDQ">President Boyd K. Packer said: “A testimony is to be <span class="emphasis">found</span> in the <span class="emphasis">bearing</span> of it. Somewhere in your quest for spiritual knowledge, there is that ‘leap of faith,’ as the philosophers call it. It is the moment when you have gone to the edge of the light and step into the darkness to discover that the way is lighted ahead for just a footstep or two.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p41" pid="n0BCM1BPBUCCUiditcolYQ" hash="NOxwZA">Making a determined and confident public statement of your belief is such a step into the unknown. It has a powerful effect in strengthening your own convictions. Bearing testimony drives your faith deeper into your soul, and you believe more fervently than before.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p42" pid="jCOoP76T30i27UJaUMGMIA" hash="ii9UaQ">To those who faithfully bear testimony, the Lord said, “Ye are blessed, for the testimony which ye have borne is recorded in heaven for the angels to look upon; and they rejoice over you, and your sins are forgiven you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> I have tried to follow this counsel to bear testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p43" pid="8f8JXilOVkKwTSWHQbEfIA" hash="9QhwRA">May I tell you how I gained a testimony of the truth and divine nature of this great latter-day work? I’m afraid my experience isn’t very dramatic. It is not a story of heavenly hosannas or thundering shouts. It is not a story of lightning, fire, or flood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p44" pid="e5um8n8ASUCuX5mcjpaXQQ" hash="spGdww">But I have always known the reality and goodness of God.</p>

Sometimes that assurance comes when we feel the love of the Savior when we meet His servants. I remember when I was just five years old and my family moved into a new ward. That first Sunday, Bishop Charles E. Forsberg, who was born in Sweden, came up to me and called me by name. I knew then.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p46" pid="XeMB0eNxKkGlL3pp_lC3DA" hash="QazyRg">During the cold and gray days of the Great Depression I remember a wonderful servant of the Savior by the name of C. Perry Erickson. Brother Erickson, a contractor, had a difficult time finding work. He could have shut himself up. He could have become bitter and angry. He could have given up. Instead, when I was 12 he was my Scoutmaster. He spent countless hours helping me and others my age to learn, to grow, and to approach every difficulty with confidence and optimism. Without exception, every one of C. Perry Erickson’s Scouts received an Eagle award. I knew then.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p47" pid="whQbsnt7SkWxTBlgQtvHeA" hash="YeCxTQ">Yes, the testimonies of priesthood leaders and faithful ward members helped me to know.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p51" pid="iX_0MEABoUWAzYZeAOM-oQ" hash="kmFVCg">I knew last April, when I heard from this pulpit the words of our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, who called Jesus his friend, exemplar, leader, Savior, and King.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/pure-testimony.p52" pid="fTioPC7KlEiBDT6B9S-UWw" hash="NDQzwg">President Hinckley said: “Through giving His life in pain and unspeakable suffering, He has reached down to lift me and each of us and all the sons and daughters of God from the abyss of eternal darkness following death.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/the-law-of-the-fast.p8" pid="s-6dfEUuw0iqvzxqmMl9Ug" hash="Ci5lZw">Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord has established His Church once again among men. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, restored to the earth in these latter days, is centered on those commandments the Savior proclaimed as the greatest: to love our Heavenly Father and to love our fellowmen. Our Savior said, “If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> One way we show our love is through observance of the law of the fast. This law is based upon a primary yet profound principle—a simple practice—that, if observed with the proper spirit, will help us draw closer to our Heavenly Father and strengthen our faith, while at the same time help us ease the burdens of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/the-law-of-the-fast.p9" pid="Co5FqnVN0k-Sy58V6o0Jvg" hash="SQL6pw">In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, members are encouraged to fast whenever their faith needs special fortification and to fast regularly once each month on fast day. On that day, we go without eating or drinking for two consecutive meals, commune with our Heavenly Father, and contribute a fast offering to help the poor. The offering should be at least equal to the value of the food that would have been eaten. Typically, the first Sunday of each month is designated as fast Sunday. On that day, members who are physically able are encouraged to fast, pray, bear witness to the truthfulness of the gospel, and pay a generous fast offering. “The law of the fast,” taught Elder Milton R. Hunter, “is probably as old as the human family. … In ancient times, prophet-leaders repeatedly gave to church members the commandment to observe the law of fasting and praying.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

Without prayer, fasting is not complete fasting; it’s simply going hungry. If we want our fasting to be more than just going without eating, we must lift our hearts, our minds, and our voices in communion with our Heavenly Father. Fasting, coupled with mighty prayer, is powerful. It can fill our minds with the revelations of the Spirit. It can strengthen us against times of temptation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/the-law-of-the-fast.p11" pid="fuWLcmT7MkSqWGQsL-bRnQ" hash="0B2idw">Fasting and prayer can help develop within us courage and confidence. It can strengthen our character and build self-restraint and discipline. Often when we fast, our righteous prayers and petitions have greater power. Testimonies grow. We mature spiritually and emotionally and sanctify our souls. Each time we fast, we gain a little more control over our worldly appetites and passions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/the-law-of-the-fast.p12" pid="bkaAqgNRuUmE4bw8RmsN9w" hash="G-LTCg">Fasting and prayer can help us in our families and in our daily work. They can help us magnify our callings in the Church. President Ezra Taft Benson taught: “If you want to get the spirit of your office and calling as a new president of a quorum, a new high [councilor], a new bishop [or, I might say, a Relief Society president]—try fasting for a period. I don’t mean just missing one meal, then eating twice as much the next meal. I mean really fasting, and praying during that period. It will do more to give you the real spirit of your office and calling and permit the Spirit to operate through you than anything I know.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

They faced overwhelming odds, yet worked miracles in bringing thousands of the Lamanites to a knowledge of the truth. They shared the secret of their success. They “searched the scriptures” and “they had given themselves to much prayer and fasting.” What was the result? “They had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

And for a short time, we literally put ourselves in the position of the hungry and the needy. As we do so, we have greater understanding of the deprivations they might feel. When we give to the bishop an offering to relieve the suffering of others, we not only do something sublime for others, but we do something wonderful for ourselves as well. King Benjamin taught that as we give of our substance to the poor, we retain “a remission of [our] sins from day to day.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Every dollar given to the bishop as a fast offering goes to assist the poor. When donations exceed local needs, they are passed along to fulfill the needs elsewhere.</p>

I come before you today to bear another witness—a witness to the suffering and need of millions of our Heavenly Father’s children. Far too many in the world today—thousands upon thousands of families—experience want each day. They hunger. They ache with cold. They suffer from sickness. They grieve for their children. They mourn for the safety of their families. These people are not strangers and foreigners but children of our Heavenly Father. They are our brothers and our sisters. They are “fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Their fervent prayers ascend to heaven pleading for respite, for relief from suffering. At this very hour on this very day, some members even in our Church are praying for the miracle that would allow them to surmount the suffering that surrounds them. If, while we have the means to do so, we do not have compassion for them and spring to their aid, we are in danger of being among those the prophet Moroni spoke of when he said, “Behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel … more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

And how do you do that? The same as with any gospel principle—let them see you live it by your example. Then help them live the law of the fast themselves, little by little. They can fast and they can also pay a fast offering if they choose. As we teach our children to fast, it can give them the power to resist temptations along their life’s journey.</p>

My brothers and sisters, the measure of our offering to bless the poor is a measure of our gratitude to our Heavenly Father.

President Thomas S. Monson once related to me how he, as a young bishop, began to sense that the young deacons in his ward were complaining about having to get up so early to collect fast offerings. Instead of calling the young men to task, this wise bishop took them to Welfare Square in Salt Lake City.</p>

Observance of the law of the fast can help all people of all nations. President Gordon B.

In fact, nearly 90 percent of those who attempt the climb never reach the summit. Temperatures sink lower than 30 degrees below zero. Besides extreme cold, 100-mile-per-hour winds, deadly crevasses, and avalanches, the climber must overcome the challenges of high altitude, lack of oxygen, and perhaps unsanitary food and water. Since 1953, at least 165 climbers have died in the attempt to scale the 29,000-foot-high summit.</p>

But Erik eventually scaled the south summit and took his place with those who had gone before him, one of the few to stand on top of the highest mountain on the face of the earth.</p>

Don’t let all that doubt and fear and frustration sort of get in the way.” Then, most importantly, he said, “Just take each day step by step.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

We may even make excuses why we can’t do what we want to do.

They “owned their boats and gave employment to other men.” According to Elder Talmage, Simon Peter “was well to do in a material way; and when he once spoke of having left all to follow Jesus, the Lord did not deny that Peter’s sacrifice of temporal possessions was … great.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

When he asked the Savior what else he should do to have eternal life, the Master said, “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.” When the young man heard that, “he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

In a more narrow but more important sense, we might define a net as anything that entices or prevents us from following the call of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>

Our lives are so easily filled with appointments, meetings, and tasks. It is so easy to get caught in a multitude of nets that sometimes even a suggestion of breaking free of them can be threatening and even frightening to us.</p>

I remember a few years that were particularly challenging for me. Our family had grown to seven children. I had served as a counselor in the bishopric and was then given the sacred call as bishop of our ward. I was striving to manage our business that required long hours each day. I pay tribute to my wonderful wife, who always made it possible for me to serve the Lord.</p>

Instead of sacrificing things of significance, I decided I’d get up earlier, take care of my business, then spend the time required to be a good father and husband and a faithful member of the Church. It wasn’t easy. There were mornings when the alarm clock went off that I cracked open an eyelid and glared at it, daring it to keep ringing.</p>

The 70-year-old widow confined to her wheelchair—who, to everyone who visits, cheers their spirits and never fails to tell them of how fortunate she is—follows the Savior.

Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach you what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/three-choices.p42" pid="8xg7vSUXC0ebbAZVNC95aw" hash="2lgYOQ">The bishop smiled and pulled from his desk a set of scriptures. The leather cover was scuffed and wrinkled. The gilded edges on the paper were nearly worn away. “Through the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets,” the bishop replied. “These are the ‘right things.’ Some believe that the commandments of our Heavenly Father are restrictive and hard. To the contrary, they’re a handbook to happiness. Every aspect of the gospel of Jesus Christ—the principles, the doctrines, and the commandments—is a part of our Heavenly Father’s plan to help us obtain peace and happiness.”</p>

I testify to you that Joseph Smith was raised up to organize the Lord’s Church in the dispensation of the fulness of times. As a special witness of Jesus Christ, I know that the Savior laid down His life for us. Through His Atonement, all mankind can repent and be cleansed of sin. We can return to our Heavenly Father and realize the value of our Savior’s infinite sacrifice. This I testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

You can become so easily trapped and overcome as soon as you step into it that you do not realize the severe danger. Most likely you will need assistance to get out of the quicksand of pornography. But how much better it is never to step into it. I plead with you to be careful and cautious.</p>

We all know those who have faced great trials in life and have endured faithfully. One inspiring example is from an early Saint of the 19th century, Warren M. Johnson. He was assigned by Church leaders to operate Lee’s Ferry, an important crossing over the Colorado River in the desert of northern Arizona. Brother Johnson endured great challenges yet remained faithful his entire life. Listen to Brother Johnson explain his family tragedy in a letter to President Wilford Woodruff:</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/press-on.p34" pid="K2Ss-DmoiUeme7gIBa4NRw" hash="4K1veg">“In May 1891 a family … came here [to Lee’s Ferry] from Richfield Utah, where they … spent the winter visiting friends. At Panguitch they buried a child, … without [cleaning] the wagon or themselves. … They came to our house, and remained overnight, mingling with my little children. …</p>

But alas, in four and a half days [the oldest boy died] in my arms. Two more were taken down with the disease and we fasted and prayed as much as we thought it wisdom as we had many duties to perform here. We fasted [for] twenty-four hours and once I fasted [for] forty hours, but to no avail, for both my little girls died also. About a week after their death my fifteen year old daughter Melinda was [also] stricken down and we did all we could for her but she [soon] followed the others. … Three of my dear girls and one boy [have] been taken from us, and the end is not yet. My oldest girl nineteen years old is now prostrate [from] the disease, and we are fasting and praying in her behalf today. … I would ask for your faith and prayers in our behalf however. What have we done that the Lord has left us, and what can we do to gain his favor again[?]”</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/press-on.p43" pid="DUmP4RUp1ky_BfZyXnBtaA" hash="WfCS8Q">Third, repentance. The glorious gift of repentance allows us to return to the path with a new heart, giving us the strength to endure on the path leading to eternal life. The sacrament thus becomes a key component of our endurance in this life.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-virtue-of-kindness.p2" pid="-C5OUYtJ-EizBz2byImxKw" hash="mko8sw">One day we visited a man in his 50s who was a respected mechanic. He told me the last time he had been to church was when he was a young boy. Something had happened that day. He had been acting up in class and was being noisier than he should when his teacher became angry, pulled him out of class, and told him not to come back.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-virtue-of-kindness.p3" pid="RZudv5PBtUmGoIRs227efw" hash="BqWvxw">He never did.</p>

But it had. And, as a consequence, this man had never returned to church. Neither had his wife or children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-virtue-of-kindness.p5" pid="wHnX7-VUBUaswsZz2WWydg" hash="Q5_roA">I apologized to him and expressed my sorrow that he had been treated that way. I told him how unfortunate it was that one word spoken in haste, and so long ago, could have the effect of excluding his family from the blessings that come from Church activity.</p>

I rejoiced when this man and his family eventually returned to church and became strong and faithful members. In particular, this good brother became an effective home teacher because he understood how something as small as an unkind word could have consequences that extend throughout a lifetime and perhaps beyond.</p>

One day, when I was in college, a man seven years my senior congratulated me on my performance in a football game. He not only praised how well I had done in the game, but he had noticed that I had showed good sportsmanship. Even though this conversation happened more than 60 years ago, and even though it’s highly unlikely the person who complimented me has any recollection of this conversation, I still remember the kind words spoken to me that day by Gordon B. Hinckley, who would later become President of the Church.</p>

When my father passed away in 1963, President Hinckley was the first person to come to our home. I’ll never forget his kindness. He gave my mother a blessing and, among other things, promised her that she had much to look forward to and that life would be sweet for her. These words have brought comfort to her and to me, and I’ll never forget his kindness.</p>

He healed the sick. He spent much of His time ministering to the one or many. He spoke compassionately to the Samaritan woman who was looked down upon by many. He instructed His disciples to allow the little children to come unto Him. He was kind to all who had sinned, condemning only the sin, not the sinner. He kindly allowed thousands of Nephites to come forward and feel the nail prints in His hands and feet. Yet His greatest act of kindness was found in His atoning sacrifice, thus freeing all from the effects of death, and all from the effects of sin, on conditions of repentance.</p>

It had been raining the previous day, causing the ground to be very muddy, especially along that street. My brother Wallace and I both got [our feet] in the mud, and could not get out, and of course, child-like, we began to cry, for we thought we would have to stay there. But looking up, I beheld the loving friend of children, the Prophet Joseph, coming to us. He soon had us on higher and drier ground. Then he stooped down and cleaned the mud from our little, heavy-laden shoes, took his handkerchief from his pocket and wiped our tear-stained faces. He spoke kind and cheering words to us, and sent us on our way to school rejoicing.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

I value her opinion. For example, when my wife begins a sentence with the words “I should think you would …” I instantly pay attention and begin searching my mind for something I may have done wrong. Ofttimes before my wife has finished her sentence, I have already planned out in my mind a magnificent apology.</p>

It gets in their blood, I suppose, and it becomes so natural they often don’t even think about it. They seem to criticize everyone—the way Sister Jones leads the music, the way Brother Smith teaches a lesson or plants his garden.</p>

I am reminded of a boy who handed a donation envelope to his bishop and told him it was for him. The bishop, using this as a teaching moment, explained to the boy that he should mark on the donation slip whether it was for tithing, fast offerings, or for something else. The boy insisted the money was for the bishop himself. When the bishop asked why, the boy replied, “Because my father says you’re one of the poorest bishops we’ve ever had.”</p>

Before he was an Apostle, as a young father, he became aware of great suffering at a neighbor’s home whose large family was stricken with the dreaded diphtheria. He did not care that they were not members of the Church; his kindness and charity moved him to act. The Relief Society was desperately trying to find people to help, but no one would because of the contagious nature of the disease.</p>

He wrote in his journal: “She clung to my neck, ofttimes coughing [germs] on my face and clothing, … yet I could not put her from me. During the half hour immediately preceding her death, I walked the floor with the little creature in my arms. She died in agony at 10 <small>A.M.</small>” The three children had all departed within the space of 24 hours.

It was a terrible tragedy. In one day, millions of lives were forever changed.</p>

A society of fishermen, their lives depend on the sea. For hundreds and perhaps thousands of years, their ancestors have studied the ocean, and they have passed their knowledge down from father to son.</p>

According to their traditions, when that happened, the “Laboon”—a wave that eats people—would arrive soon after.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p11" pid="1f2yukt16kSJqYPH_bgONA" hash="b0XGIQ">The prophet Nephi wrote about the great disaster of his day, the destruction of Jerusalem. “As one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews because of iniquity,” he said, “even so have they been destroyed from generation to generation according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p12" pid="1v_WBF_gC0KNxreHTuY_VA" hash="8lawTg">Since the days of Adam, the Lord has spoken to His prophets, and while His message differs according to the specific needs of the time, there is one consistent, never-changing theme: Depart from iniquity and journey to higher ground.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p13" pid="hQogqO40bUaPqe17oaXlfQ" hash="BXAuDg">As people heed the words of the prophets, the Lord blesses them. When they disregard His word, however, distress and suffering often follow. Over and over, the Book of Mormon teaches this great lesson. In its pages we read of the ancient inhabitants of the American continent who, because of their righteousness, were blessed of the Lord and became prosperous. Yet often this prosperity turned into a curse in that it caused them to “harden their hearts, and … forget the Lord their God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p14" pid="r2mlQmCXWEigsYXI_fy-kw" hash="cjnWaw">There is something about prosperity that brings out the worst in some people. In the book of Helaman, we learn of one group of Nephites who experienced great loss and slaughter. Of them we read, “And it was because of the pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek, making a mock of that which was sacred, [and] denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p15" pid="sNLvXaChOUitgZ93mIwCGw" hash="-OTWMg">This sorrow would not have afflicted them “had it not been for their wickedness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> If only they had heeded the words of the prophets of their day and journeyed to higher ground, their lives would have been dramatically different.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p16" pid="OkXzT6lG4kOkmoK8KgPGaw" hash="xznlNA">The natural consequence that comes to those who depart from the way of the Lord is that they are left to their own strength.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> While in the heat of our success we might assume that our own strength is sufficient, those who rely upon the arm of the flesh soon discover how weak and unreliable it truly is.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p17" pid="pmcANJ9e7UOiWH-4a0QhsQ" hash="N2km7g">For example, Solomon, at first, obeyed the Lord and honored His law. Because of this, he prospered and was blessed not only with wisdom but with wealth and honor. If he continued in righteousness, the Lord promised to “establish the throne of [his] kingdom upon Israel for ever.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p18" pid="6vgaQn0yWEWE-LrXUEy2dw" hash="H50Z_Q">But even after heavenly visitations, even after receiving blessings above all men, Solomon turned away from the Lord. Because of this, the Lord decreed that the kingdom would be torn from him and given to his servant.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p19" pid="V8i3uUh-wEWsbo5yYLlG9Q" hash="0yRjkw">The name of that servant was Jeroboam. Jeroboam was an industrious man from the tribe of Ephraim whom Solomon had promoted to manage a portion of his laborers.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p20" pid="Ac6Loo7lWUqKSZCLeTiEPA" hash="0yrU-A">One day, as Jeroboam was traveling, a prophet approached and prophesied that the Lord would rend the kingdom from Solomon and give ten of the twelve tribes of Israel to Jeroboam.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p21" pid="-9AqqgXc8kKrhRZBp9ZZSw" hash="HjIMuA">Through His prophet, the Lord promised Jeroboam if he would do what is right, “I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p22" pid="-EsG9wr1pEyDIEN7ELkaww" hash="vLXSLQ">The Lord chose Jeroboam and promised remarkable blessings to him if only he would obey the commandments and journey to higher ground. After Solomon’s death, the words of the prophet were fulfilled, and ten of the twelve tribes of Israel followed Jeroboam.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p23" pid="syA4tv7c4EWt-4R477oE5g" hash="nxfX3w">After receiving such favor, did the new king obey the Lord?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p24" pid="O37_MfTgfU-0wUn0V-vzRA" hash="ybjUMA">Unfortunately, he did not. He set up golden calves and encouraged his people to worship them. He created his own “priesthood” by selecting whomsoever he would, consecrating them to be “priests of the high places.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> In short, in spite of the great blessings he had received from the Lord, the king was evil above all those before him.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> In later generations, Jeroboam was the standard by which evil kings of Israel were compared.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p25" pid="qtfVgYFjt0y9wYw6MD8BFg" hash="mE-8KA">Because of such wickedness, the Lord turned away from Jeroboam. As a result of the king’s wickedness, the Lord decreed that the king and all of his family would be destroyed until not one was left. This prophecy was later fulfilled to the letter. The seed of Jeroboam perished from the earth.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p26" pid="UNOrXtKJvEmB8C9eXbGPFQ" hash="FA8_Dw">Solomon and Jeroboam are examples of a great, tragic cycle so often illustrated in the Book of Mormon. When the people are righteous, the Lord prospers them. Prosperity often leads to pride, which leads to sin. Sin leads to wickedness and to hearts that become hardened to things of the Spirit. Eventually, the end of this road leads to heartbreak and sorrow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p27" pid="2tlRgGa_GUS-2yoMF_-K8g" hash="jV9AcQ">This pattern is repeated not only in the lives of individual people but by cities, nations, and even the world. The consequences of ignoring the Lord and His prophets are certain and often accompanied by great sorrow and regret. In our day the Lord has warned that wickedness will ultimately lead to “famine, and plague, and earthquake, and the thunder of heaven” until “the inhabitants of the earth be made to feel the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of an Almighty God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p28" pid="P3uaJI3iUE6KVyDcLzjaNw" hash="wIzCjw">It is important to understand, however, that many fine and good people are affected by calamities of man and nature. The early Saints of this dispensation were persecuted and driven from their homes. Some lost their lives. But, perhaps because they had endured so much, they developed an inner strength that was a necessary preparation for the work they were yet to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p29" pid="Kb0pmMDaSUmNGOs8Fxv-5A" hash="b468vA">The same happens in our day as well.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p32" pid="sbFcNdTQhUitXa2Irj_gEg" hash="ZfW9IQ">When the wicked city of Nineveh heard the warning voice of the prophet Jonah, they cried mightily to the Lord, repented, and were saved from destruction.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p33" pid="2lBwpRyKvU6xfjYPN7UIvQ" hash="IxOfDw">Because the people in Enoch’s day were evil, the Lord commanded Enoch to open his mouth and warn the people to turn from their wickedness and serve the Lord their God.</p>

He traveled among the people, crying with a loud voice, testifying against their works. The scriptures tell us that “all men were offended because of him.” They spoke among themselves of “a strange thing in the land” and a “wild man” that had come among them.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p35" pid="xawF0NEx_km24O8kGaa-PQ" hash="HilwAA">Although many hated Enoch, the humble believed his words. They abandoned their sins and journeyed to higher ground, and “they were blessed upon the mountains, and upon the high places, and did flourish.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> In their case, instead of prosperity leading to pride and sin, it led to compassion and righteousness. “And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/journey-to-higher-ground.p36" pid="m5n5VRiNjkO1wvbnsY2GTQ" hash="2jJEyQ">After His Resurrection, the Savior came to the Americas. Because of His wondrous ministry, the people’s hearts were softened. They abandoned their sins and journeyed to higher ground. They cherished His words and sought to follow His example.</p>

The few that remained were old and spent and had been bought by a company that would salvage them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-abundant-life.p2" uuid="b9f1c668-4dc6-4735-a3e3-c4e84e732b8b" pid="NA67GpixFk2mt5p6eady8g" hash="mC7_Kw">Harry, the riding master at a girls’ school in New York, was about to leave when one of these horses—an uncared-for, gray gelding with ugly-looking wounds on its legs—caught his eye. The animal still bore the marks that had been made by a heavy work harness, evidence to the hard life he had led. But something about him captured Harry’s attention, so he offered $80 for him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-abundant-life.p3" uuid="86948503-a67a-427b-9780-0e5764029602" pid="b9wB1Ymp30Obq18cEKyUQA" hash="PFZu5w">It was snowing when Harry’s children saw the horse for the first time, and because of the coat of snow on the horse’s back, the children named him “Snowman.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-abundant-life.p4" uuid="19b55e67-9837-49b3-9d28-ba10de04a9d3" pid="psdDHEbNSkCXCN05WhnMeQ" hash="BsHhnQ">Harry took good care of the horse, which turned out to be a gentle and reliable friend—a horse the girls liked to ride because he was steady and didn’t startle like some of the others. In fact, Snowman made such rapid improvement that a neighbor purchased him for twice what Harry had originally paid.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-abundant-life.p5" uuid="48bb8d5a-f0d0-4d76-b5ab-b143cde92ee1" pid="-F_ON_OSUEGjFoi5dPcZ2Q" hash="QZZH6A">But Snowman kept disappearing from the neighbor’s pasture—sometimes ending up in adjoining potato fields, other times back at Harry’s. It appeared that the horse must have jumped over the fences between the properties, but that seemed impossible—Harry had never seen Snowman jump over anything much higher than a fallen log.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-abundant-life.p6" uuid="db5e9800-c474-4701-9969-87e7e788f042" pid="4utmYppGaU-5HjJe4932Gg" hash="vwAnMw">But eventually, the neighbor’s patience came to an end, and he insisted Harry take back the horse.</p>

He’d had moderate success in the past, but in order to compete at the highest levels, he knew he would have to buy a pedigreed horse that had been specifically bred to jump. And that kind of pedigree would cost far more than he could afford.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/the-abundant-life.p8" uuid="c6d9dde0-801f-4e59-a859-47fdd400bbe5" pid="3W87dXpsmkGwWeoDUHSP0g" hash="aqgvMQ">Snowman was already getting old—he was eight when Harry had purchased him—and he had been badly treated. But, apparently, Snowman wanted to jump, so Harry decided to see what the horse could do.</p>

Snowman stood among the beautifully bred, champion horses, looking very much out of place. Other horse breeders called Snowman a “flea-bitten gray.”</p>

In 1958 and 1959, Snowman was named “Horse of the Year.” Eventually, the gray gelding—who had once been marked for sale to a low bidder—was inducted into the show jumping Hall of Fame.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Although they were free, they were forced to hide from those who might mistake them for runaway slaves. They endured cold and hardship, wearing out shoes and then socks until they walked on bare feet all the way to the City of Joseph. When they arrived in Nauvoo, the Prophet welcomed them into his home and helped each of them find a place to stay.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="45"></span>Lately I have reflected on many of the wonderful experiences I’ve had in my life. As I have expressed gratitude to my Heavenly Father for these marvelous blessings and opportunities, I have realized, perhaps more than ever before, how critical the formative years of my life were.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p2" pid="rtsUq3-zEkmEKs9U2gos8A" hash="pYjiiQ">Many of the most important and life-changing moments of my life occurred when I was a young man. The lessons I learned then formed my character and shaped my destiny. Without them, I would be a very different man and in a very different place than I am today. This evening, I would like to talk for a few minutes about some of these experiences and what I learned from them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p3" pid="_3z9P99oXkGMLdhME1k0qA" hash="Lm0Fsw">I’ll never forget one high school football game against a rival school. I played the wingback position, and my assignment was to either block the linebacker or try to get open so the quarterback could throw me the ball. The reason I remember this particular game so well is because the fellow on the other side of the line—the man I was supposed to block—was a giant.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p4" pid="7ExzZsHetEycRZUBZ8mvLQ" hash="FFmxuw">I wasn’t exactly the tallest athlete in the world. But I think this other guy may have been. I remember looking up at him, thinking he probably weighed as much as two of me. Keep in mind, when I played we didn’t have the protective gear that players have today. My helmet was made of leather, and it didn’t have a face guard.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p5" pid="fxE1ft6Kb0mFENUyJpoqoA" hash="WEl7jA">The more I thought about it, the more I came to a sobering realization: if I ever let him catch me, I could be cheering for my team the rest of the season from a hospital bed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p6" pid="cYsbhoKhEE2fBSFg8v28gQ" hash="h2dk4w">Lucky for me, I was fast. And for the better part of the first half, I managed to avoid him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p7" pid="K4gbAk9rc0-6jAABT23_Sw" hash="9MGHog">Except for one play.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p9" pid="dVevORZjjkSuwCEvB-6eAw" hash="y2_1wg">The only problem was that I could hear a lumbering gallop behind me. In a moment of clarity, I thought that if I caught the ball there was a distinct possibility I could be eating my meals through a tube. But the ball was heading for me, and my team was depending on me. So I reached out, and—at the last instant—I looked up.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p10" pid="da5x7GtxqEOq8xVxH7VvYg" hash="wBJ-Zw">And there he was.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p11" pid="-Yb8SOTDvkGwiWiCWMhPCg" hash="ay2dtQ">I remember the ball hitting my hands. I remember struggling to hang on to it. I remember the sound of the ball falling to the turf. After that, I’m not exactly sure what happened, because the giant hit me so hard I wasn’t sure what planet I was on. One thing I did remember was a deep voice coming from behind a dark haze: “Serves you right for being on the wrong team.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p12" pid="Xsy2ZpRl7Eaxp7JkmS7A8A" hash="Vq0tqw">William McKinley Oswald was my high school football coach. He was a great coach and had a profound influence on my life. But I think he could have learned his method of motivating players from an army drill sergeant.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p13" pid="EthqLFKB50iKrq49zFankw" hash="uclGlw">That day, during his half-time speech, Coach Oswald reminded the whole team about the pass I had dropped. Then he pointed right at me and said, “How could you do that?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p14" pid="xktieHQvREedFbLDM8Fivg" hash="dG1_uA">He wasn’t speaking with his inside voice.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p16" pid="_IT7xVRO902uvT9mNub7bA" hash="thcd2Q">I stammered for a moment and then finally decided to tell the truth. “I took my eye off the ball,” I said.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p17" pid="DWhllUUfxU2ysb7i47T5qg" hash="Q1xawQ">The coach looked at me and said, “That’s right; you took your eye off the ball. Don’t ever do that again. That kind of mistake loses ball games.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p18" pid="brV1msr_MEmBfaxAiJhpCw" hash="odjqrA">I respected Coach Oswald, and in spite of how terrible I felt, I made up my mind to do what Coach said. I vowed to never take my eye off the ball again, even if it meant getting pounded to Mongolia by the giant on the other side of the line.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p19" pid="V9JU2GXoKkaPmKhVs_axJg" hash="kLm65Q">We headed back onto the field and started the second half. It was a close game, and even though my team had <span class="pageBreak" page-number="46"></span>played well, we were behind by four points late in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p20" pid="CmCtcaN2-kWzEeKzaz7I0Q" hash="BRZi2Q">The quarterback called my number on the next play. I went out again, and again I was open. The ball headed towards me. But this time, the giant was in front of me and in perfect position to intercept the pass.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p21" pid="W9NI0X6rb06u2VF_5ffHMQ" hash="sxTdog">He reached up, but the ball sailed through his hands. I jumped high, never taking my eye off the ball; stabbed at it; and pulled it down for the game-winning touchdown.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p22" pid="wCA1W9_ZxUKsG67-ZbNglg" hash="78paOg">I don’t remember much about the celebration after, but I do remember the look on Coach Oswald’s face.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p25" pid="9lexdu4_5kql1O5ydocEOQ" hash="8idvbg">I have known many great men and women. Although they have different backgrounds, talents, and perspectives, they all have this in common: they work diligently and persistently towards achieving their goals. It’s easy to get distracted and lose focus on the things that are most important in life. I’ve tried to remember the lessons I learned from Coach Oswald and prioritize values that are important to me so that I can keep my eye focused on things that really matter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p26" pid="3VyB9rNLJ0OQwSHDwrNYjA" hash="Pc8mrg">I urge you to examine your life. Determine where you are and what you need to do to be the kind of person you want to be. Create inspiring, noble, and righteous goals that fire your imagination and create excitement in your heart. And then keep your eye on them. Work consistently towards achieving them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p27" pid="yLpKmhv0aU6fzLt7_3SKVQ" hash="NXHBiA">“If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams,” wrote Henry David Thoreau, “and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p28" pid="aOU8WatGs0KBnArgfNeKsA" hash="z3v3bw">In other words, never take your eye off the ball.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p29" pid="9ET-SvzJ5kezRPMIWfa1cA" hash="7uGBGQ">Another lesson I learned on the football field was at the bottom of a pile of 10 other players. It was the Rocky Mountain Conference championship game, and the play called for me to run the ball up the middle to score the go-ahead touchdown. I took the handoff and plunged into the line. I knew I was close to the goal line, but I didn’t know how close. Although I was pinned at the bottom of the pile, I reached my fingers forward a couple of inches and I could feel it. The goal line was two inches away.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p30" pid="I4H3H1Mnj0i2CdGNJv3i-g" hash="U5u_gA">At that moment I was tempted to push the ball forward. I could have done it. And when the refs finally pulled the players off the pile, I would have been a hero. No one would have ever known.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p31" pid="HkrTNXqT3UWWuRq9yOZqiw" hash="QEz5wA">I had dreamed of this moment from the time I was a boy. And it was right there within my reach. But then I remembered the words of my mother. “Joseph,” she had often said to me, “do what is right, no matter the consequence. Do what is right and things will turn out OK.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p32" pid="nMKIkIpuSEy17QfFIaBQpw" hash="WWPM0Q">I wanted so desperately to score that touchdown. But more than being a hero in the eyes of my friends, I wanted to be a hero in the eyes of my mother. And so I left the ball where it was—two inches from the goal line.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p33" pid="FIpr1bvjjE6QYAASFSoUMw" hash="oLstmw">I didn’t know it at the time, but this was a defining experience. Had I moved the ball, I could have been a champion for a moment, but the reward of temporary glory would have carried with it too steep and too lasting a price. It would have engraved upon my conscience a scar that would have stayed with me the remainder of my life. I knew I must do what is right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p34" pid="g16FTYJmOU--EFcMVWn7ng" hash="pB2bgg">The Light of Christ helps us to discern right from wrong. When we allow temptations to drown out the still voice of our conscience—that is when decisions become difficult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p35" pid="1bUF1s3550ygg8setUUQKg" hash="T5qZIg">My parents taught me to react quickly when temptation comes and to say “No!” instantly and emphatically. I recommend that same counsel to you. Avoid temptations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p36" pid="cx_1zLzUA0ygbBJI23KRWA" hash="opQWhA">Another lesson I learned was the joy of service to others. I have spoken before of how my father, who was the bishop of our ward, had me load up my wagon and deliver needed food and supplies to the homes of those families who were in need. He wasn’t alone in his desire to reach out to those in distress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p37" pid="D1T6csmHokavGZUTqFUqyA" hash="_eoasw">Seventy-five years ago, Bishop William F. Perschon presided over the Fourth Ward of the Pioneer Stake in Salt Lake City. He was a German immigrant, a convert to the Church, and he spoke with a thick accent. He was a fine businessman, but what most distinguished him was his great compassion for others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p38" pid="ys_Mr8r81kaZzV_3HwN0uA" hash="DhPBGw">Each week during priesthood meeting, Bishop Perschon had the Aaronic Priesthood bearers recite the following phrase: “Priesthood means service; bearing the priesthood, I will serve.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p39" pid="oyHjgO4MXEO2ELpYdJcjhg" hash="fHHJgA">It wasn’t merely a slogan. When widows needed assistance, Bishop Perschon and the Aaronic Priesthood were there to help. When a chapel was being built, Bishop Perschon and the Aaronic Priesthood were there. When the sugar beets and potatoes at the welfare farm needed weeding or <span class="pageBreak" page-number="47"></span>harvesting, Bishop Perschon and the Aaronic Priesthood were there.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p40" pid="pqaIsrGhREGz24LUop87Xg" hash="gbXT1g">Later, William Perschon served in the stake presidency, where he influenced a young bishop by the name of Thomas S. Monson. In the 1950s, Bishop Perschon was called to preside over the Swiss-Austrian Mission and played an instrumental role in building the first “overseas” temple, located in Bern, Switzerland.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p41" pid="qYwrmuz_VE66jEkz3PP_Jg" hash="3XNsrA">You could scarcely think of Bishop Perschon without thinking of his concern and compassion for others and his untiring commitment to teach that same quality to others. Of the young men in the Aaronic Priesthood over whom he presided as bishop, 29 went on to become bishops themselves. Ten served in stake presidencies. Five became mission presidents, three accepted calls as temple presidents, and two served as General Authorities.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/lifes-lessons-learned.p44" pid="a9svWBaDoE6TI3uSa2VM3w" hash="Tffgfw">We all possess spiritual gifts. Some are blessed with the gift of faith, others the gift of healing. In the body of the Church, all of the spiritual gifts are present. In my case, perhaps one of the spiritual gifts for which I am most grateful is that I have been blessed with an obedient spirit.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="28"></span>Brethren and sisters, I would like to ask one very important question. What quality defines us best as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/the-great-commandment.p" pid="KUZs0PMqAkGLq2--jXi_8w" hash="LFu8gA">Today I would like to speak about the answer to this question.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/the-great-commandment.p" pid="--4n3UqIvk6vmrK5E1tBhQ" hash="hlE6uA">In the first century <small>A.D.</small>, members of the growing Church in Corinth were enthusiastic about the gospel. Almost all were recent converts to the Church. Many were attracted to it through the preaching of the Apostle Paul and others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/the-great-commandment.p" pid="aMVfQIbyC0yNL0kQWZZaiA" hash="mjmAog">But the Saints at Corinth were also contentious. They argued amongst themselves. Some felt superior to others. They took each other to court.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/the-great-commandment.p" pid="sDgAshGjiESjaA4WAsdluQ" hash="kaOdbA">When Paul heard this, feeling a sense of frustration, he wrote them a letter, pleading with them to become more unified. He answered many of the questions they had been arguing about. Then, toward the end, he told them that he wanted to show them “a more excellent way.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

You can speak with tongues, have the gift of prophecy, understand all mysteries, and possess all knowledge; even if you have the faith to move mountains, without charity it won’t profit you at all.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

As vast as this congregation is, it’s humbling to realize that it is merely a fraction of the millions who will see, hear, and read the words spoken at this great conference.</p>

He is a mighty man of Israel who was foreordained to preside over this Church. He is well-known for his captivating stories and parables, but we who know him best understand that his life is a practical and exemplary model of the application of those stories. While it is a compliment to him that many of the great and mighty of this world know and honor him, perhaps it is an even greater tribute that many of the lowly call him friend.</p>

From the moment I met him, I recognized in him a man of immense spiritual depth and tremendous capability. I knew the Lord was mindful of him. Twenty-three years ago, I had the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="18"></span>honor of extending to him the Lord’s calling to serve as a stake president in Frankfurt, Germany. As I have watched over the years, I have noticed that everything under his direction has succeeded. The Lord is with him. When I think of President Uchtdorf, two words come to mind: <span class="emphasis">Alles wohl</span>—that’s German for “All is well.”</p>

  <span class="emphasis">True disciples of Jesus Christ have always been concerned for the one. </span>
</span>Jesus Christ is our greatest example. He was surrounded by multitudes and spoke to thousands, yet He always had concern for the one. “For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> He said. “What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

        <span class="strong">
  <span class="emphasis">Some are lost because they are different. </span>
</span>They feel as though they don’t belong. Perhaps because they are different, they find themselves slipping away from the flock. They may look, act, think, and speak differently than those around them and that sometimes causes them to assume they don’t fit in. They conclude that they are not needed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/concern-for-the-one.p12" pid="KwxkpcX_l02hZeE44kAKCw" hash="_BmfFQ">Tied to this misconception is the erroneous belief that all members of the Church should look, talk, and be alike. The Lord did not people the earth with a vibrant orchestra of personalities only to value the piccolos of the world. Every instrument is precious and adds to the complex beauty of the symphony. All of Heavenly Father’s children are different in some degree, yet each has his own beautiful sound that adds depth and richness to the whole.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/come-what-may-and-love-it.p28" pid="JnOqcPaAkUiHbLMbjZAt5g" hash="cmtzrw">
          <span class="pageBreak" page-number="28"></span>The third thing we can do is understand the principle of compensation. The Lord compensates the faithful for every loss. That which is taken away from those who love the Lord will be added unto them in His own way. While it may not come at the time we desire, the faithful will know that every tear today will eventually be returned a hundredfold with tears of rejoicing and gratitude.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/come-what-may-and-love-it.p29" pid="sS8qpEtP3k-4PrG99BNpFA" hash="au2gTw">One of the blessings of the gospel is the knowledge that when the curtain of death signals the end of our mortal lives, life will continue on the other side of the veil. There we will be given new opportunities. Not even death can take from us the eternal blessings promised by a loving Heavenly Father.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/come-what-may-and-love-it.p30" pid="Gye-D1q8ukWqUqZBIfsnZg" hash="y9ofZQ">Because Heavenly Father is merciful, a principle of compensation prevails. I have seen this in my own life. My grandson Joseph has autism. It has been heartbreaking for his mother and father to come to grips with the implications of this affliction.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/come-what-may-and-love-it.p31" pid="mXvqaKPevUiCWC5SoRvGrQ" hash="f1ycuA">They knew that Joseph would probably never be like other children. They understood what that would mean not only for Joseph but for the family as well. But what a joy he has been to us. Autistic children often have a difficult time showing emotion, but every time I’m with him, Joseph gives me a big hug. While there have been challenges, he has filled our lives with joy.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/come-what-may-and-love-it.p32" pid="VwcCJLp8Ck-7k3KegFOwHA" hash="G3xDNg">His parents have encouraged him to participate in sports. When he first started playing baseball, he was in the outfield. But I don’t think he grasped the need to run after loose balls. He thought of a much more efficient way to play the game. When a ball was hit in his direction, Joseph watched it go by and then pulled another baseball out of his pocket and threw that one to the pitcher.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/come-what-may-and-love-it.p33" pid="SQ7xxTBxgEO4or0ii8ZJ7A" hash="SYDDDQ">Any reservations that his family may have had in raising Joseph, any sacrifices they have made have been compensated tenfold. Because of this choice spirit, his mother and father have learned much about children with disabilities. They have witnessed firsthand the generosity and compassion of family, neighbors, and friends. They have rejoiced together as Joseph has progressed. They have marveled at his goodness.</p>

We prayed for her, administered to her, and supported her as best we could. We hoped she would receive a blessing of healing, but days turned into months, and months turned into years. At one point I told her that this affliction might be something she would have to struggle with the rest of her life.</p>
