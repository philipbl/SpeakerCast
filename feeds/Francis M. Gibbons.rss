      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/sixteen-years-as-a-witness.p1" pid="VntevoyPnUi9ZNlEzh0ebg" hash="cSBlOg">My beloved brethren and sisters, the essence of life is change. It was just sixteen years ago this day that I sat in the audience as a bishop and sustained President Joseph Fielding Smith as the President of the Church along with his Counselors, President Harold B. Lee and President N. Eldon Tanner. Sustained at that conference also was Elder Boyd K. Packer, sustained as a member of the Twelve; from the position he now occupies on the stand, you can see the enormous change that has taken place in that short period of sixteen years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/sixteen-years-as-a-witness.p2" pid="06-qHA8xLEqybuqNCEN_wQ" hash="Bd5SuQ">Also sustained at that conference were Elders William Bennett, Joseph Anderson, and David B. Haight as Assistants to the Twelve. Elder Bennett, of course, has passed away. Elder Haight, now a member of the Twelve, and Elder Anderson are still with us. Elder Anderson is in his ninety-seventh year.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/sixteen-years-as-a-witness.p3" pid="NW0RIWYu6UWrAB4gNTwlIA" hash="3Ks0QQ">Elder Anderson, who had been the secretary to the First Presidency for almost fifty years, was a member of the ward of which I was bishop at the time. Through an extraordinary series of circumstances that I will not mention here, three days after his call I found myself in the first meeting of the First Presidency that I was privileged to attend. Since that day sixteen years ago, it has been my blessing to have met on almost a daily basis during the work week with the prophets of God. Each of them has shown special qualities. Each of them has filled a special role. Each of them we have loved and sustained and appreciated. I can today without any qualification raise my hand in full support and love for President Ezra Taft Benson, President Gordon B. Hinckley, and President Thomas S. Monson. These are truly prophets, seers, and revelators of the living God. And what a blessing it is for us to be members of a church that is directed through direct revelation from God on high.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/sixteen-years-as-a-witness.p4" pid="uCqRH9ApWUWxnXMJrcF5Rw" hash="g7fv8A">I suppose at a time like this one naturally reflects about his roots. My great-great-grandfather, Vinson Knight, was a member of the bishopric of the Kirtland Ward, the first ward in the Church. He served under Bishop Newel K. Whitney. He later served as the bishop pro-tem, as it was called at the time, of the ward at Adam-Ondi-Ahman. His daughter, Rizpah, my great-grandmother, tells of having picked berries on the banks of the Grand River, as it flows by Adam-Ondi-Ahman.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/sixteen-years-as-a-witness.p5" pid="SEjpBDt3MUmOF19vq-9YgA" hash="KA_3vA">Vinson Knight later became the bishop of the lower ward in Nauvoo, the ward in which both President Joseph Smith and President Brigham Young resided. His wife, Martha McBride Knight, was one of the charter members of the Relief Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/sixteen-years-as-a-witness.p6" pid="LqMoZyFq8kmCCRYoUazX6w" hash="1wvk2w">I think of these stalwart people, their dedication, and their faith. The daughter of Vinson and Martha married a young man named Andrew Smith Gibbons. They were teenagers in Kirtland. After they married, Rizpah gave birth to her first child, my grandfather Andrew Vinson Gibbons, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, near Winter Quarters. Andrew was assigned as one of the members of Brigham Young’s pioneer company that arrived in the Salt Lake Valley July 24, 1847, and ended up across the river in Arizona, where I was born in the little town of St. Johns. I have told my friends over the years that if you can’t spot it on the map, St. Johns is fifteen miles east of Concho. To many, it’s the end of the earth; but to those of us who were born there, it’s the center of the earth. I pay honor and respect to these ancestors, as well as to my dear wife and children and grandchildren, to all of our friends and relatives, and to the many associates with whom we have been privileged to labor over the years.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/sixteen-years-as-a-witness.p7" pid="9UABSVHkoE6MzjYrUYP-fQ" hash="mKSj_w">As you can appreciate, I accept this assignment with trepidation. I accept it with humility. I accept it without qualification. I desire to serve faithfully and with diligence. I pledge to President Benson and his Counselors that they will never make a call upon me but that I will strive to fill it to the very best of my ability.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/sixteen-years-as-a-witness.p8" pid="4bcplWuIcEOhjaxIozI0Rg" hash="HPdF4Q">As a young man in the mission field over forty years ago, I received a witness of the Spirit. From that experience I learned by spiritual means that God lives, that Jesus Christ is his son, that he is the head of the Church, that the Church is led by prophets, seers, and revelators. I therefore sustain all of those who have preceded this incumbent First Presidency, and I certainly sustain and support them as prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/sixteen-years-as-a-witness.p9" pid="PrB5S0CYjUKweTf4s8lgNQ" hash="cYAeow">As one final word I would say that I came to the position of secretary to the First Presidency sixteen years ago with a full knowledge of the significance of the Church and of the status of its leaders. I have seen nothing in those intervening years that would cause me to question in any respect the doctrines of the Church, the practices of the Church, or most assuredly the integrity of those who head it. I am their witness. I testify that they are honorable, upright, dedicated men of integrity committed to teaching the principles of the gospel, who strive with all of their might to prepare a people ready for the return of the head of the Church, Jesus Christ, at his second coming. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

With him in the cell was a disciple, John Taylor, who shared the terror of this assault and who was gravely wounded but who did not share a martyr’s fate with Joseph and his brother Hyrum.</p>

      <div class="figure" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-savior-and-joseph-smith-alike-yet-unlike.f2">
	<p pid="R2-OfR0EkkylXanHyJC7wg" hash="rJ7XEw">This mortal linkage between Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer, invites comparisons of their lives and their characters.</p>
	<ul class="bullet">
	  <li pid="Wv989EGaxEmtstbBs96VBA" hash="HyICSA">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="ENnsRD_klUCjsvB4VcIgig" hash="95Wz5w">They both came out of a working-class environment. Jesus was the stepson of a carpenter. Joseph Smith’s father was a farmer. Neither had wealthy, powerful, or influential relatives or friends. Both experienced the trauma arising from economic stress.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="KO653lbpn0uv-dalBIBiMg" hash="9ZXMmw">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="fqZUCvg3GEGyUHzx4Py3_A" hash="oULBSg">Both came from solid homes of high spirituality. Mary and Joseph had both conversed with beings from the spiritual world. Joseph Smith’s father received a remarkable series of visions when Joseph Smith, Jr., was a boy; and his mother had had an unusual spiritual experience not long before his birth.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="qgmIy5I8KEu2fkfJHtQ3Mw" hash="LjuMHw">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="9XILr1cM40KUdFtK5npH8w" hash="pO1lZQ">Neither Jesus nor Joseph Smith had significant formal schooling; and neither of them, therefore, was a graduate of a great university nor a fellow in a distinguished academic society.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="Kpea__Y2O0usOnAGjluMVg" hash="vlvFRw">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="mxdC0_KInkqT4hdLfPDe_Q" hash="QM7Lqg">Both of them were highly precocious. At age twelve, Jesus was found teaching the learned rabbis in the temple, who were astonished to find one so young possessed of such vast wisdom and knowledge. In his fifteenth year, Joseph had an experience which enabled him to instruct his family, and others who would listen, about the nature, the power, and the purposes of God, the Eternal Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="oWpHKgG8zky63eofdYDdYg" hash="kOFxmw">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="7g08f_Irk06dP3wv6ABgug" hash="YYF1Eg">Both were provincials. Jesus never ventured beyond the environs of the Holy Land during his earthly ministry, while Joseph Smith spent his entire life within a relatively small area in the United States and Canada.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="LqADT4cUT0akcYhSLwuhzA" hash="TQZz5g">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="TVNe_LMLcEGG99fc9GE0Jg" hash="b487jg">Both were highly controversial figures, boldly attacking the existing order of things. Jesus condemned the scribes, the Pharisees, and the hypocrites, while Joseph condemned a misguided ministry.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="r7uPI--p8E6yfPr_X_hDAQ" hash="bt4J2g">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="IJpMcSnkk0KXHlPW5dR-vQ" hash="KSDIWA">Both attracted strong disciples and powerful enemies. It is through the disciples of Jesus and Joseph that their fame and present influence are largely known. Both of them attracted opposition of such bitterness that both were killed by their enemies.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="Nryqwex4FkKJLCeWCBvZFA" hash="upAKeA">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="dQA5FJf8I0G6AgTRp9YHtg" hash="zCHujA">While both had kind and loving natures, both were fearless in enforcing the right. Jesus, for instance, angered by the merchants in the temple, drove them away with a whip. And on more than one occasion, Joseph engaged in physical combat to assert the right.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="sS_XoHjmX0eHrK4My4i2Og" hash="dlnFkA">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="krSroDYcCESWym6kyN58Lw" hash="kXy_Uw">Both completed their missions at an early age. Jesus was crucified at age 33, while Joseph died as a martyr at age 38 1/2.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="zQTp5-emHkmMJbpnjz7YoQ" hash="9Uneaw">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="o33wftZCa06ngZX-Tbbv_w" hash="C2nyEw">Both were killed as the result of betrayals by erstwhile disciples.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="yRlz36uRVk2UkS9aBMxbFw" hash="WLCedQ">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="xuWRRnXyIkeVLShU2OwvlQ" hash="ODYMyA">Both were prayerful by nature. Before his earthly ministry began, the Savior spent forty days in the wilderness engaged in fervent fasting and prayer. And on the Mount of Transfiguration, in Gethsemane, on the cross, and on other occasions, he engaged in fervent prayers to his Heavenly Father, pleading for guidance or assistance.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="aLk40ivMC0KyayvGsDCZiA" hash="AetK4w">
          <span class="label">•</span>
          <p pid="bjffMxnu_UeohVBu0oBxgA" hash="dBUYOg">Their births were foreseen long in advance. The Savior, according to the scriptures, was “Beloved and Chosen from the beginning” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:2</a>), even him whom God declared “should come in the meridian of time, who was prepared from before the foundation of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.57" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:57</a>). Joseph of old, the son of Jacob, or Israel, prophesied that in the latter days a choice seer would be raised up: “And his name shall be called after me,” he prophesied, “and it shall be after the name of his father” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.15" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 3:15</a>); which is an ancient prophetic reference to Joseph Smith and his father, Joseph Smith, Sr.</p>
        </li>
	</ul>
      </div>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-savior-and-joseph-smith-alike-yet-unlike.p4" pid="kBViuuXVqUS7yipb0PKhRQ" hash="NXxwMg">While the Savior and Joseph Smith shared these and many other qualities, they were very different in basic ways. The main difference lay in the Savior’s unusual nature and identity. He functioned on a plane which was beyond the Prophet Joseph Smith’s comprehension. Jesus is a member of the Godhead, chosen before the creation of the world to become the Savior and the Redeemer of mankind. He was the active force in the Creation, and he is the head of the Church. Through the Atonement, he has, in a sense, purchased us so that we are his children. And by becoming members of the Church, we have taken his name upon us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-savior-and-joseph-smith-alike-yet-unlike.p5" pid="XMKr8HX5tEqSVaiV_JOKyg" hash="UJFJZw">The various roles he played and the various names by which he is known in the holy scriptures give a hint of the preeminent status of the Savior, compared to Joseph Smith or to any other man. He is the Jehovah of the Old Testament, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He is the Son of God, the Messiah, the Creator. He is our Advocate with the Father. He is our Exemplar. He is often called the Good Shepherd or the Great Judge. He is sometimes referred to as our King, or as the King of Kings; as the Lamb of God; as the Light of the World; as the Lawgiver; or as the Mediator. Sometimes he is called the Messenger of the Covenant, or the Rock of our Salvation; the Chief Cornerstone; the Son of Man; the Anointed One, the Deliverer, or the Man of Sorrows; or the Only Begotten of the Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-savior-and-joseph-smith-alike-yet-unlike.p6" pid="qs1ZRXRgRk6foEs1aZlidQ" hash="aEPV0g">Not only does he fill these varied roles but, with the Father, he shares characteristics unknown to mortal men like the Prophet Joseph Smith. He knows all things and, therefore, he is omniscient; he has all power and, therefore, he is omnipotent; and through the Light of Christ, he is omnipresent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-savior-and-joseph-smith-alike-yet-unlike.p7" pid="jl5Dq7iV6UO9rFD3UYDZSw" hash="G9dMYg">No wonder then that John the Baptist, who up until his time was the greatest prophet of all, said of the Savior that he, John, was not worthy to unloose his shoe’s latchet. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.27" class="scriptureRef">John 1:27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-savior-and-joseph-smith-alike-yet-unlike.p8" pid="t-pkJVvkuU6CDXkk9wmf2w" hash="aw1zoQ">While the Savior’s spiritual status is beyond compare, his role as the Only Begotten of the Father does create a common physical ground upon which he meets with the Prophet Joseph Smith and other men. The Savior was born of a mortal mother but was sired by the Eternal Father. Therefore, he shared an element of mortality with the Prophet Joseph Smith because of his mother, Mary. Yet he also had within him the power to lay down his life, or to take it up again, because of his Eternal Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-savior-and-joseph-smith-alike-yet-unlike.p9" pid="Nlaj8zwVk0qYSBXBi0FJVg" hash="r5eoVw">While we honor and revere Joseph Smith as the Prophet of the Restoration and seek to emulate his qualities of character, we adore and worship the Savior. That adoration is shown at each sacrament service when we covenant to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ, to always remember him, and to keep the commandments which he has given to us, that we may always have his Spirit to be with us. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/4.3" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 4:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-savior-and-joseph-smith-alike-yet-unlike.p10" pid="RckZTCfMHU-P-pT2opG-qw" hash="5aKXOA">The supernal status of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and the preeminent place which he occupies in the eternal scheme of things cause us to stand in awe at what has been called the condescension of Christ, meaning his willingness to step down from his exalted place and to go forth, as the scripture says, “suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; … that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities, … that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-13" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-savior-and-joseph-smith-alike-yet-unlike.p11" pid="_s9Nyeu1A0e_osDvMjHjoQ" hash="hD4XOA">I bear testimony, obtained through the power of the Holy Ghost, that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, the only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. I testify that the Savior is a resurrected being, having a tangible body of flesh and bones, and that his Heavenly Father, who is also the Father of the spirits of us all, similarly has a tangible body of flesh and bones. I also testify that Jesus Christ is the head of the church to which we belong, and which bears his holy name, and that Joseph Smith, of whom I have spoken, was the prophet through whom the true church of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth by the ministering of angels many centuries after the Apostasy, and to whom was given the priesthood keys and authority necessary to direct the Savior’s earthly church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/the-savior-and-joseph-smith-alike-yet-unlike.p12" pid="tSsw4OLspUmEI8GV_W-Z1A" hash="NuyZ_Q">Finally, I testify that through an unbroken chain, the prophetic keys and authority received by the Prophet Joseph Smith have been transmitted through intervening generations and today are held, intact, by today’s prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, who stands as the earthly head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, possessing all the keys and authority necessary to help bring about the exaltation of God’s children. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I could ask for nothing better than to pray that the Spirit which actuated them will be with me as I speak briefly this afternoon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p2" pid="NDQ1MlSMQEOR_Yq90hkc6Q" hash="wuSShA">The foundations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are anchored in prayer. It was, for instance, the fervent prayer of Joseph Smith that opened the door to the restoration of the gospel. The foundational scripture in the first chapter of James which prompted Joseph to go to the grove to pray clearly defines the conditions under which God will respond to his children. There it is written that we must “ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.6" class="scriptureRef">James 1:6</a>.) The scripture then adds this postscript: “For let not that man”—that is, the man that wavers—“think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.7" class="scriptureRef">James 1:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p3" pid="s5qITW7iikOhVB01wPaBYQ" hash="VVFOUg">Beyond this seminal scripture, which contains the key to unlock the treasure house to God’s knowledge and wisdom, there are others which further define the principle of prayer and its application in our lives. For example, it is written in <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:27</a>, “Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.” Thus, when we are not actually engaged in the formal act of prayer, we should always have a prayer in our heart, wherever we are or whatever we are doing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p4" pid="zJchzN4pPU2DH01kLTAnxw" hash="dlA89A">Another key scripture on prayer, which goes beyond admonition to the realm of command, is found in Doctrine and Covenants, section 19, which reads: “And again, I command thee that thou shalt pray vocally as well as in thy heart; yea, before the world as well as in secret, in public as well as in private.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p5" pid="u6hBt-y1SESU0DtnEhGUqw" hash="tJylhQ">We may ask, “Why has God seen fit to make it a command that we pray both vocally and in secret?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p6" pid="2em3DFUunECmy9MfXTnRKA" hash="vIBFlg">Obviously, secret prayer is necessary in many cases where it is awkward or infeasible to pray vocally. So, if we are in a social or a business setting and need comfort or direction, a resort to secret prayer is often our only alternative.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p7" pid="iRPWAl4X_UCga-XKY4OEmg" hash="g-4MQw">But a more significant reason for praying secretly is found in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 6, where it is written, “Yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that there is none else save God that knowest thy thoughts and the intents of thy heart.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p8" pid="XLS8NU_dD0eqJP0GDZnNtw" hash="PWrU2w">Other scriptures broaden this concept to include not only God, but those whom God inspires. So Zeezrom, the crafty lawyer who was taught by Alma and Amulek, became convinced “that they knew the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.7" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p9" pid="Ck7jedjsL0WFbvXdRobEqA" hash="03OJYA">It is clear, then, that Satan and his followers, who have been cast out of God’s presence and are dead to His Spirit, are excluded from those who, by the spirit of prophecy and revelation, may know the thoughts and the intents of our hearts. So, in his wisdom and mercy, God has provided a channel of communication between him and his children on earth that Satan, our common enemy, cannot invade. This is the channel of secret prayer. The significance of this to the Latter-day Saint is profound, for by this means we are able to communicate with our Heavenly Father in secrecy, confident that the adversary cannot intrude.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p10" pid="2_mVENP2aUSgdtMf73e06g" hash="hJBflQ">Several years ago, a young man who was in love with a beautiful girl sought my counsel. He was reluctant to marry her because her parents had fallen into apostasy. He said the girl’s mother had told him she knew the Church was false. When he asked how she knew that, she said a voice once whispered to her to go into a nearby bookstore. She did so and there found a bitter, anti-Mormon book from whose reading she concluded that the Church was false. Had this sister understood the gospel, she should have prayed in secret, relating her experience and asking God to reveal whether her conclusion was correct, in the manner prescribed in the ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8-9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 9:8–9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p11" pid="kz6GKzX7ZEaf_CVo__caiQ" hash="0zIQwg">David Whitmer reported that the Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “some revelations are of God: some revelations are of man: and some revelations are of the devil.” (In B. H. Roberts, <span class="emphasis">Comprehensive History of the Church,</span> 1:163.) But while Satan can convey thoughts, he does not know whether these thoughts have taken root unless they are reflected either in words or in actions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p12" pid="5W_d_0fgxEKeJtahPDZfqg" hash="66F-eg">All this suggests that we should be wise in what we say and do. We should also be wise in the way we guard precious things that are revealed to us through the Spirit. For example, when President Heber J. Grant was a young man, presiding in the Tooele Stake, Patriarch John Rowberry gave him a special blessing. Afterward, the patriarch said to President Grant, “I saw something that I dared not mention.” President Grant later recorded it was made known to him at that moment that he would one day be the President of the Church. He never discussed this revelation with anyone, never recorded it, and revealed it only after it was an accomplished fact. (See Francis M. Gibbons, <span class="emphasis">Heber J. Grant: Man of Steel, Prophet of God,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1979, p. viii.) How wise he was, for had he revealed it to others, his enemy, Satan, would have known and, with that knowledge, could have created unimaginable difficulties for him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p13" pid="aTvSsqgSHE-OborMDs3jbQ" hash="z4T7qQ">Often, we talk too much. We say things that need not be said or should not be said; for in saying them, we may open a crevice which enables Lucifer to wedge his way into our lives. We learn from 2 Nephi that Satan “seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>.) Satan and his followers are persistent in their quest to drag us down to their level. They will use any device or artifice to accomplish their end. If they know, for example, of revelations such as the one given to President Grant, or if they see from our words or actions evidence of animosity or hatred or discord among us, they may capitalize on them in ways which will be detrimental to us. Wisdom suggests, therefore, that we suppress words and actions which might enable Satan to harm us or whose tendency might be to create discord or enmity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p14" pid="OdF_mCAmkUGauow2udxkBQ" hash="xiye1Q">For many years, we knew and admired a couple who, on the face of it, seemed happy and well adjusted. It came as a surprise when it was learned that their relationship was filled with discord and bitterness caused by almost constant bickering and faultfinding between them. By this means, the couple had eroded away the bonds of love which originally bound them together and in the process had shattered each other’s self-esteem and had opened the door for Satan to enter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/the-dual-aspects-of-prayer.p15" pid="BK6wdB95MEuKjXlpiaNumg" hash="UxbZLg">How much better it is to follow the admonitions of the Savior, to speak with kindness and love and to create in our homes havens from the turmoil of the world, which is constantly stirred up by the intrigue of our common enemy. And how much better it is to emphasize and to focus on positive rather than negative things so as to build up and to protect each other and to minimize the opportunity for the intrusion of satanic influences in our lives, which, I pray, we may all do, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
