      <description>Sister Cordon counsels us to study the scriptures, pray, and serve others to place our trust in Jesus Christ rather than leaning to our own understanding.</description>

She wrapped her arms around me and asked, “Do you really believe that this gospel is true?” Dear sister, I know it is true. I trust in the Lord.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p6" pid="LSOOwVezQEaupem6pXejPA" hash="BzfTgw">In <a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Proverbs 3:5–6</a>, we read this counsel:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p7" pid="63RZSPJVFUWSShOg3ObHhw" hash="FVxn3Q">“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p9" pid="qD1FwN80Tk2n9N95PCrCug" hash="ykPIHA">This scripture comes with two admonitions, a warning, and a glorious promise. The two admonitions: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart” and “in all thy ways acknowledge him.” The warning: “Lean not unto thine own understanding.” And the glorious promise: “He shall direct thy paths.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p10" pid="8kKWh_9oSUC2bn5887fiCQ" hash="gp4Gvg">Let’s first discuss the warning. The visual image gives us much to ponder. The warning comes in the words “lean not”—“lean not unto thine own understanding.” In English the word <span class="emphasis">lean</span> has a connotation of physically listing or moving to one side. When we <span class="emphasis">physically</span> lean toward one side or another, we move off center, we are out of balance, and we tip. When we <span class="emphasis">spiritually</span> lean to our own understanding, we lean away from our Savior. If we lean, we are not centered; we are not balanced; we are not focused on Christ.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p11" pid="MEiENnHQuEeyYyOwN2eJiA" hash="ukwX2w">Sisters, remember, in our premortal life we stood with the Savior. We trusted Him. We voiced our support, enthusiasm, and joy for the plan of happiness set forth by our Heavenly Father. We leaned not. We fought with our testimonies and “aligned ourselves with the forces of God, and those forces were victorious.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> This battle between good and evil has moved to earth. Once again we have the sacred responsibility to stand as a witness and put our trust in the Lord.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p12" pid="FGKkhSdYp0OiXudcqBjG0Q" hash="KbsSog">We must each ask: How do I keep centered and <span class="emphasis">lean not</span> unto my own understanding? How do I recognize and follow the Savior’s voice when the voices of the world are so compelling? How do I cultivate trust in the Savior?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p13" pid="AuK_pnuGBkWMof50pnyN3Q" hash="5GY1FA">May I suggest three ways to increase our knowledge of and trust in the Savior. You will find that these principles are not new, but they are foundational. They are sung in every Primary, echoed in Young Women lessons, and are responses to many Relief Society questions. They are centering—and not leaning—principles.</p>

My two-year-old grandson was sitting on my lap as we read. I was in full-blown grandma mode, relishing the visit of my son’s family.</p>

My grandson knew that it would soon be bedtime. He looked up with his eager blue eyes and spoke an eternal truth: “More scriptures, Nana.”</p>

For one of my summer breaks from college, I accepted a job in Texas. I had to drive hundreds of miles from Idaho to Texas in my old car, a car I had affectionately named Vern. Vern was packed to the roof, and I was ready for the new adventure.</p>

She pleaded with Heavenly Father for my safety. She prayed for my non-air-conditioned car, asking that the car would function as I needed. She asked for angels to be with me throughout the summer. She prayed and prayed and prayed.</p>

The Lord directed my path in the many decisions I made that summer.</p>

I share the following story with permission from Amy Wright, who came to understand the principle of serving even amid a terrifying and life-threatening illness. Amy wrote:</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p26" pid="wHh_En_YtUeyeS-kKfWr1A" hash="dka_jw">“On October 29, 2015, I found out I had cancer. My cancer has a 17 percent survival rate. The odds weren’t good. I knew that I would be in for the fight of my life. I was determined to give it everything I had not just for myself but, more important, for my family. In December, I began chemo. I was familiar with many of the side effects of cancer-fighting drugs, but I did not know that it was possible for someone to be so sick and still be alive.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p27" pid="KD46Bc_DhkWbyLYAiggFyA" hash="1oQboQ">“At one point, I declared chemotherapy a human rights violation. I told my husband that I was done. I quit! I was not going back to the hospital. In his wisdom, my sweetheart patiently listened and then responded, ‘Well, then we need to find someone to serve.’”</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p29" pid="Qyc2PgBqYEqGVksXHXgseA" hash="v37RZQ">Amy goes on to explain: “My symptoms gradually worsened to where I generally had one or two ‘OK’ days a month [when] I could somewhat function as a living, breathing human being. It was those days when our family would find ways to serve.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p30" pid="_WHDSNPcE0izscW8wZYNnQ" hash="KbwJTw">On one of those days, Amy’s family distributed chemo comfort kits to other patients, kits filled with items to cheer and to help relieve symptoms. When Amy couldn’t sleep, she would think of ways to brighten someone else’s day. Some ways were big, but many were just small notes or text messages of encouragement and love. On those nights when her pain was too great to sleep, she would lie in bed with her iPad and search for ordinances that needed to be completed on behalf of her deceased ancestors. Miraculously the pain would subside, and she was able to endure.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p31" pid="0x1ftrMloEibtqENL6fKkA" hash="ciskdg">“Service,” Amy testifies, “saved my life. Where I ultimately found my strength to keep moving forward was the happiness I discovered in trying to relieve the suffering of those around me. I looked forward to our service projects with great joy and anticipation. Still to this day it seems like such a strange paradox. You would think that someone who was bald, poisoned, and fighting for [her] life was justified in thinking that ‘right now it is all about me.’ However, when I thought about myself, my situation, my suffering and pain, the world became very dark and depressing. When my focus turned to others, there was light, hope, strength, courage, and joy. I know that this is possible because of the sustaining, healing, and enabling power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.”</p>

If she had leaned even a little to her own understanding, she might have rejected the idea that she serve. Service enabled her to withstand her pain and afflictions and to live this scripture: “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not.p33" pid="OyEbJ8QwOkuOlKnbzo5wDQ" hash="LrWJFg">Jesus Christ has overcome the world. And because of Him, because of His infinite Atonement, we all have great cause to trust, knowing that ultimately all will be well.</p>
