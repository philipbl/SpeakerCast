        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="74"></span>While I have been serving in this calling, I have made some new friends. Eliza can sing many Primary songs. Lucas is learning the Articles of Faith in Spanish. Caitlyn is shy but curious. I sat by Martha in Primary, and she wrapped her arm through mine. These children reflect the light of the gospel in their faces.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p2" pid="v2WUCnXn1Ee9I96RmTQ7ug" hash="cFu1kQ">Who are the children in your home or in your neighborhood? Look at them. Think of them. The Savior teaches us that to enter the kingdom of God, we must become as a child, “submissive, meek, humble, patient, [and] full of love” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p3" pid="bsJV06T9jk-1r4gCD-ifMg" hash="krFjpg">But however full of faith children come to us, they face the challenges of a fallen world. What does it take to help these children keep the light of faith in their eyes? We know that nothing can replace a righteous family in the life of a child. But in today’s world, children will need not only a devoted mother and father, but they will need each of us to protect, teach, and love them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p4" pid="Gs1r5nH5WEaESInnyt73vg" hash="o4q6Bg">Brothers and sisters, protecting children means that we provide an environment that invites the Spirit into their lives and validates it in their hearts. That automatically eliminates any form of indifference, neglect, abuse, violence, or exploitation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p5" pid="5_PjuscGtUCN38MgUup3ng" hash="xrky5A">And while conditions of depravity are more serious, we also protect children from other detrimental conditions, such as expectations that are too high or too low, overindulgence, over scheduling, and self-centeredness. Either extreme dulls a child’s ability to identify, trust, and be guided by the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p6" pid="4ziO7SFMykGR76ruJm3jxw" hash="ShIpIQ">Children are open to gospel truths more than at any other time, and protected childhood is literally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to teach and strengthen children to choose the right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p7" pid="kMeiVuDiikqhX1mnKCHbyQ" hash="afB0qQ">It’s easy to know what to teach. The scriptures and our prophets are clear about what to teach our <span class="pageBreak" page-number="75"></span>children. Nephi summarizes it in this verse, “And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ … that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 25:26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p8" pid="m3LBf62KekSGqTvbdWT_Hw" hash="z3tO1A">Knowing that we teach of Christ and His gospel, how do we do it? Begin by following the counsel of our prophets and making time in our homes for family prayer, scripture study, and family home evening. Have we heard that counsel so often that it seems too simple? Or are we so busy that adding one more thing feels too complex? I testify that even when our family worship seems less than effective, obedience alone invites the blessings of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p9" pid="8UrW7PvUoESBL0-N_Avncw" hash="L7NOkA">In fact, personal obedience and example in every part of our lives are the ultimate gospel lessons for children. So study, learn, and apply the gospel. We cannot teach principles that we do not know and that we do not live. Who we are and what is in our heart are discerned by children more quickly than we think.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p10" pid="Gtu36uBbV0K9LwAAAIUWOw" hash="HVZT9w">So love the children. I remember feeling loved as a child, and because of that, it was easy for me to believe that the Savior loved me too. Children thrive in a home where parents understand their “sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Oct. 2004, 49; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p11" pid="Kh_X722KNk688QilzVY-gQ" hash="Cl_vAA">But all of us can help. Notice the children around you, and learn their names. And then invite, listen, affirm, guide, build, serve, and share testimony. Your love can help bring a child to the love of the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p12" pid="oHV_ko4-EUm3goMfZaCgCQ" hash="juy9WA">Vasily is a child who spends much of his time in the streets and is not supported by his parents in his search for truth. He found a small branch of the Church in his town, and he came to every event held at the church. He also brought his three younger brothers to church, and other friends joined him in Primary. In fact, at one time, the largest Primary in that area was made up of these little boys who are not members of the Church. They were drawn to the truth, and the light of the gospel began to be reflected in their faces. They were welcomed, protected, taught, and loved by all the members of that little branch, including youth, young adults, missionaries, teachers, and priesthood leaders. Think of the children in your neighborhood or Primary class. Who are the children in your branch or ward? Is there one, like Vasily, who needs you?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p13" pid="yJ_VayJLi0ifsCQjDXOtig" hash="76NNcQ">When I think of these little boys and children like them, I take great hope from the account of the Savior’s visit to the American continent. Remember that before the Savior’s appearance, there were tempests, earthquakes, fires, and three days of profound darkness (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.title" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 8</a>). I have often thought about the children who experienced these events. And I can only imagine the fear and concern in the hearts of the parents.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p14" pid="KiuY5vQAKES5O3DV_axKVA" hash="W1ZPjg">And then the Savior appeared and <span class="pageBreak" page-number="76"></span>commanded the multitude “that their little children should be brought” to Him (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.11" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 17:11</a>). How eager those parents must have been to bring their children to the Savior. And then they watched as the Savior wept over their children, blessed them one by one, prayed unto the Father for them, and called down angels to minister unto them (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.21,24" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 17:21, 24</a>). This account reminds us that it is the Savior who is the great protector, the ultimate teacher, and the eternal source of love and healing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p15" pid="w8kfHE9Hjk-tFLlX7fAHQQ" hash="3ukEQA">As the darkness of this day surrounds us, we are also commanded to bring our children to the Savior, and as Elder Ballard has reminded us, “we are the ones God has appointed to encircle today’s children with love and the fire of faith and an understanding of who they are” (“Behold Your Little Ones,” <span class="emphasis">Tambuli,</span> Oct. 1994, 40; “Great Shall Be the Peace of Thy Children,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Apr. 1994, 60).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p16" pid="XuZlhL1Gxkas6QooB4Jm5A" hash="VJQufg">Brothers and sisters, as a mother and a Primary leader, I know this work with children is not easy. Protecting, teaching, and loving children can be demanding, often discouraging, sometimes exhausting, and occasionally the fruits of our efforts are long delayed. But it is precisely because it is not easy to bring children to the Savior that we must come to Him ourselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p17" pid="51j4rH-bYU28ueww7GdTJA" hash="qw6BfQ">As we seek Him and His Spirit to help us, we will see a miracle. We will recognize that our own hearts are changing and we too are becoming “submissive, meek, humble, patient, [and] full of love” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>). We too will reflect the light of the gospel in our own countenance. We will come to understand these words of the Savior: “And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.5" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 18:5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/behold-your-little-ones.p18" pid="nOLbAjoghkSnYDo6VOOTbA" hash="ZJAe0Q">I love the Savior and testify of His redeeming power for me and you and for our children, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="11"></span>The last chapter of John tells of an especially tender exchange between Peter and the resurrected Christ. Three times the Savior asks, “Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?” And each time, when Peter assures the Savior of his love, Jesus “saith unto him, Feed my lambs. … Feed my sheep.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p2" pid="m3zgN1CM-EaDp_yIdxjyAQ" hash="RB896g">There is great need in today’s world to nourish the souls of our children and youth with “living water”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> and the “bread of life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Like Peter, we too love the Lord, so today’s parents and leaders work diligently to instill in each heart a testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel. We teach in our homes, in missionary settings, and in the chapels and classrooms of our churches. We prepare and invite the Spirit to be with us. But to truly be able to feed His lambs and nourish His sheep with testimony and the Spirit, we must also cultivate in our homes and classrooms respect for each other and reverence for God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p3" pid="xhvMg21nHEyueqI_Wxk0lA" hash="zEmVyw">My appeal today is to parents, teachers, and leaders to work together to teach, exemplify, and encourage the standards of respect and reverence that will strengthen our children and youth and invite the spirit of worship into our homes and chapels.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p4" pid="jBliA8gXTkW9zf1LV9W6Ug" hash="981YOQ">May I suggest that our ability and our credibility to exemplify reverence for God is strengthened as we show respect for each other. In today’s society, the standards of decorum, dignity, and courtesy are assailed on every side and in every form of media. As parents and leaders, our examples of respect for each other are critical for our youth and children because they are watching not only the media—they are watching us! Are we the examples we need to be?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p5" pid="sc6dqCdUokeOztwWei_gGA" hash="-9ayxg">Ask yourself these questions: Am I an example of respect in my home by the way I treat those I love the most? What is my demeanor during a sports event? If my child has a disagreement with a teacher, coach, or peer, do I listen to both sides of the issue? Do I show respect for the property of others as well as take care of my own? How do I respond to others with whom I disagree in matters of religion, lifestyle, or politics?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p6" pid="st5fx978nUCDKqR9thtaeA" hash="oVdyIA">As parents and leaders exemplify and teach respect for others, we confirm in the hearts of our children that each of us is truly a child of God and all are brothers and sisters through eternity. We will focus on the things we have in common—on the qualities of heart that bind the family of God together, rather than on our differences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p7" pid="hSnDobrjSUiC3o9Nu4Ba1w" hash="GeAlPQ">Respect for others and reverence for God are close cousins. They are rooted in humility and love. President David O. McKay said that “reverence is profound respect mingled with love,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> and Elder L. Tom Perry taught that “reverence flows from our admiration and respect for Deity.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Primary children learn this concept as they sing this verse from a Primary song:</p>
      <div class="poetry" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.f2">
        <div class="stanza">

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p8" pid="-QflCHj8WEOgpDSbEzTWIw" hash="lnmVDA">However, reverent behavior is not a natural tendency for most children. It is a quality that is taught by parents and leaders through example and training. But remember, if reverence is rooted in love, so is the teaching of it. Harshness in our training begets resentment, not reverence. So begin early and have reasonable expectations. A toddler <span class="emphasis">can</span> learn to fold his arms and get ready for prayer. But it takes time, patience, and consistency. Remember that we are not only teaching a child his first lessons in reverence, but the child may be mastering his first attempts at self-discipline.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p9" pid="qg8wOw1mGE-owRDkuzsUhQ" hash="1eySQQ">This process of teaching and self-discipline continues line upon line <span class="pageBreak" page-number="12"></span>and precept upon precept. Thus a child learns to be reverent during prayers and the sacrament. He sits by his parents during the meeting. Then he grows in lessons of self-discipline as later he learns to fast, to obey the Word of Wisdom, to make good Internet choices, and to keep the law of chastity. We each grow in ability as well as understanding. We bless our children and youth as we exemplify, teach, and encourage them through this process because self-mastery is not only the root of self-respect, it is essential in inviting the Spirit to teach, confirm, and testify.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p10" pid="NM82Smvj8kqqFz04SKXJtg" hash="D4Zy2A">I remember a talk that President Boyd K. Packer gave in conference almost 20 years ago entitled “Reverence Invites Revelation.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> That phrase has remained in my heart all these years. It reminds me that we <span class="emphasis">must </span>create in our hearts, our homes, and our meetings places of reverence that will invite the Spirit to comfort, guide, teach, and testify. Because when the Spirit testifies to each of us that God is our Father and Jesus Christ is our Savior, it is <span class="emphasis">that</span> revelation that will invite true reverence born of love and profound respect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p11" pid="DV-n43mTvEeTrNgwceFDdg" hash="jTYJDQ">So, as parents and leaders, what can we do? We can exemplify reverence as we pray humbly, use the proper language of prayer, and speak the names of Deity appropriately. We can handle the scriptures with respect and teach doctrine from them with conviction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p12" pid="OabRjIHfAU6ydMds9u57ZQ" hash="3WVNSw">Reverence will increase as we show proper respect not only for the General Authorities but for local priesthood and auxiliary leaders as well. My stake president has been a dear friend for over 30 years, and as friends, we have always called each other by our first names. But because he serves in a calling of priesthood leadership—in public and certainly in a Church setting—I make a conscious effort to refer to him as President Porter. Teaching our children and youth that it is appropriate to address <span class="pageBreak" page-number="13"></span>our leaders as president, bishop, brother, and sister encourages respect and reverence. It also teaches the truth that leaders are called of God and have been given sacred responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p13" pid="y0jIu-XbAUqrNp9pIqEJ5A" hash="fN5RMg">As parents and leaders, we <span class="emphasis">must</span> set the example of reverent behavior in our Church meetings. Our chapels provide places for many different functions, but on Sunday they are places of worship. We gather to renew covenants that will heal our souls. We come to learn doctrine and strengthen testimony. Missionaries bring their investigators. Only in an attitude of reverence can the Spirit confirm the truths of the gospel through the word of God, music, testimony, and prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p14" pid="_vEWRWcySkmg95K80fKGMA" hash="0H5U2w">We are a friendly people and we love each other, but reverence will increase if our socializing is done in the foyer and if sacrament meeting begins with the prelude music, not the opening prayer. We encourage reverence when we take a crying child out of the chapel and find another room where we continue to listen to the meeting until the baby is calmed or a disruptive toddler is soothed. Reverence includes turning off our cell phones and BlackBerry devices. Texting or reading e-mails in a Church meeting is not only irreverent, it is distracting and signals a lack of respect for those around us. So we exemplify reverence by participating in the meeting, listening to the speakers, and singing the hymns of Zion together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p15" pid="i6d2QUxugE-JEgYysLRPjw" hash="F3m9zQ">Our teachers in Primary, Sunday School, and the youth programs have unique opportunities to teach and exemplify respect and reverence. May I offer a few ideas.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p16" pid="gf9aTwKpqkCQAfFldTrepA" hash="3xUlEw">First of all, love those in your class. Often the child who is the most disruptive needs your love the most.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p17" pid="RjdRW_01XECj0MX7ymZP9Q" hash="GQ21pQ">Take the time to explain what reverence is and why it is important. Display a picture of the Savior. Define behavior that is acceptable, and then be loving and consistent as you not only encourage it but expect it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p18" pid="PkPqG7zClUSu74_PUGEjbA" hash="harzdA">Be prepared. Prepare not only the material, but prepare yourself to teach with the Spirit. Many problems with reverence can be defused with a well-prepared lesson in which the students participate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p19" pid="kub3zwLlFUe1BChHguc8jg" hash="NX9WHQ">Talk with parents of children who have disabilities to determine a reasonable expectation for their child because every child deserves a chance to progress.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p21" pid="-kS6NOcnukGjRuHdGNADew" hash="Mcm7ug">Years ago President Packer promised the Lord’s blessings to those who worship in reverence. Surely those promises apply today: “While we may not see an immediate, miraculous transformation, as surely as the Lord lives, a quiet one will take place. The spiritual power in the lives of each member and in the Church will increase. The Lord will pour out his Spirit upon us more abundantly. We will be less troubled, less confused. We will find revealed answers to personal and family problems.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/respect-and-reverence.p22" pid="csTT-QDJM02-lKWzA_3IMQ" hash="NZHCFw">I believe the promises of a prophet. I know that I have a loving Heavenly Father and that His Son, Jesus Christ, is my Savior. I pray that our increased reverence will reflect our deepest love for Them and improve our quest to feed Their sheep in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
