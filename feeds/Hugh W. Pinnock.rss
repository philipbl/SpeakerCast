      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/three-things-to-share.p1" pid="aUKXVCC5sESwbLlFxNu4LA" hash="X0i2Cw">There are three things that I feel personally obligated to communicate with you, my brothers and sisters, this afternoon. First, I know the gospel of Jesus Christ is true and that only by carefully listening to the words of our Prophet, by reading the scriptures for additional insight, and by living the commandments and suggestions of our Brethren can we find happiness of an eternal nature.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/three-things-to-share.p2" pid="gOJLljBk20Cd6AIH_sPa5w" hash="RtJiQg">Second, I must communicate to you openly about the reality of my own inadequacies. Accepting a call to serve as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, I pray that the Lord, our Church leaders who sit before us, and you with whom I will be called to work will all exert untiring patience with me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/three-things-to-share.p3" pid="QVO3FDqBjES4vVivM7gf2Q" hash="cW81Rw">Lastly, I must communicate to you the awesome level of gratitude that I feel at this time: towards you who have so kindly instructed me through word and deed and action; to a lovely wife and children who have always supported their husband and father both here and in the mission field. To a father and mother who never needed to worry about determining priorities because they understood what was really important as easily as most of us find the act of breathing. I am grateful for a sister and brother and for their families. I am thankful for friends and associates who have been patient in their understanding of my weaknesses, of my lifestyle, and other decisions that have been made, as hopefully I was of theirs. I am so thankful to men like my mission president, A. Lewis Elgren, and to others such as President Harold B. Lee, Elder Richard L. Evans, a great aunt Bertha Irvine, and others who are no longer with us. I am so thankful to many of the Brethren who sit here, whose constant example has served as a motivating force in my life, and for so many others. Most of all I am grateful for a kind and loving Savior, who not only teaches us well but forgives and loves and persists.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/three-things-to-share.p4" pid="zOtXCXOd_km9VjZDbdXF8g" hash="G4uz6w">Speaking for Anne, my wife; Larry, Annette, Marcus, Jonathan, Nathan, and Andrea, our children, we stand waiting to give all we have to the building of the kingdom, and hopefully make a supportive contribution wherever we might find ourselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/10/three-things-to-share.p5" pid="EF21wsWXIUyrLOMN79hZBQ" hash="6fcR2w">Henry Van Dyke said a number of years ago: “There is only one way to get ready for immortality, and that is to love this life and live it as bravely and faithfully and cheerfully, as we can.” (In Emerson Roy West, <span class="emphasis">Vital Quotations,</span> Bookcraft, 1968, p. 201.) This I pray we may all do in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master. Amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p1" pid="vEuDwariBkWBZx9w41y02w" hash="156EWw">While flying from Erie to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, several years ago, I sat next to the minister of a large Protestant church. He was dressed in the garb of the clergy, so was easy to identify. After I had introduced myself as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he asked, “Do you know what we ministers talk about when we meet together? We talk about the Mormons. We see the young and the elderly, teenagers, small children, and the newly married crowding into your chapels. Every age-group seems comfortable and happy being together in your church.” I explained how we are concerned about people of all ages.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p2" pid="cciVs8Qiski03EA69dw7uw" hash="8Ja5og">That experience reminded me of the difficulty Moses had persuading Pharaoh to let the Israelites leave Egypt. One plague followed another until the Egyptian ruler finally gave in. After being threatened with hordes of locusts, Pharaoh agreed to let the men go if Moses would leave the women, the young, and the old behind. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/10.3-11" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 10:3–11</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p3" pid="A7a2yFGS-06Mck_UMAmFBQ" hash="rX5i1A">However, Moses insisted that all should go. He said, “We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/10.9" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 10:9</a>). Moses refused to divide the people of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p4" pid="8-v92YIhokaV6Zqt1Jpyvg" hash="9Fs0Rg">All ages would share the adventure and the dangers together, just as our own pioneers did 132 years ago during their great exodus. The solidarity of the people of all ages is God’s way of doing things. It is our way because it is his way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p5" pid="C7XO8Dhnski4hPu0LE7Ieg" hash="ORc_Qw">Life is not stationary. Seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years all tick away at the same clip for everyone. No age-group can be isolated. None of us can settle into infancy, youth, middle age, or old age. We all <span class="emphasis">grow</span> older, and, incidentally, it is an exciting thought if the accent is on <span class="emphasis">growing.</span> “Though our outward man perish,” said Paul, “yet the inward man is renewed <span class="emphasis">day by day</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/4.16" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 4:16</a>; italics added).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p6" pid="HNoBAOuh-ky0wiHn5THhRw" hash="uH53bQ">I cannot think on my own life without feeling deep gratitude for the older people who have walked and talked with me. A great-aunt taught me many lessons in her own sensitive way. A lovely grandmother has influenced not only her own grandchildren, but also many of their friends. A patriarch, by living righteously and by giving a beautiful blessing, changed the course of a young man’s life. Elder LeGrand Richards’s powerful voice and testimony have brought the truth of the gospel to all who will listen, and a few others besides. Our great prophet-leader, President Kimball, has influenced so many of us through his dedication and incredible energy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p7" pid="Uz55lgJnoUKsYiT8QRuxtQ" hash="biGQ3Q">All are needed; all are to serve. Those of you with experience and maturity, who have seen the Great Depression, the ravages of two world wars, a society that has emerged from the horse and buggy era to silver Concordes splitting the sky at 1,400 miles an hour have so much to offer. It is to you, the elderly, I address my brief comments.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p8" pid="-kP91r0Ho0C5V0IAsPHKLQ" hash="Xlsg-A">Few men whose names occur in the New Testament have so little said about them as did Mnason. His name appears only once: “one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/21.16" class="scriptureRef">Acts 21:16</a>). As the early missionaries traveled, they wanted to be with an elderly disciple, one with whom they felt comfortable. Apparently, they were seeking his wisdom and his knowledge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p9" pid="c3ua-UteGkKUndoRVwSFjQ" hash="Hl56rg">“<span class="emphasis">Then what can we do?” </span>I can almost hear some of our older members of the Church inquiring.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p10" pid="sUs_fNaM30a6-dCm6LFzmg" hash="SpXMTg">First, take time with the Savior. If you feel you do not know him yet, then think of him often. Read about him. Invite him in. It is never too late to make a friend, and he is the best friend you will ever have.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p11" pid="hfxvQ98kHkGzBAx2U-cgKw" hash="hOTvUQ">Second, tell of past decades when life was different. Keep alive the recollection of your struggles and achievements. Take time to share the truths that never change. Show how solutions to problems sixty, seventy, and eighty years ago are just as valid and helpful now as they were then. We need to learn from you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p12" pid="pV2yWDJKJUGxe7YRDJvbbg" hash="i6P2Fw">Third, look to your ancestors. Temple doors stand open bidding you welcome. So many need you to perform their earthly ordinances. The extra time you often have enables you to bless those who need you to do their earthly work for them. They are waiting for you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p13" pid="Uw5juelmdkOHCudRCNs8cg" hash="nctBaA">Fourth, there is so much for you to do in the mission field, either as a couple or, if you do not have a mate, as an elder or sister missionary. It is true, you will not be tracting quite like the younger missionaries, or at least not as long, but you will be influencing the inactive, providing welfare service instruction, serving in our visitors centers, meeting the town fathers, and helping those that need your leadership example, your judgment, and your ability to teach. Investigators in Stuttgart, West Germany; Hermosillo, Mexico; Williamsport, Pennsylvania; and Rocky Ford, Colorado, will listen and, yes, be baptized because of you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p14" pid="YvNg0kegu0aaHhyTPIGadg" hash="ZfQ0ng">Fifth, realize that you <span class="emphasis">are</span> needed and loved and that you <span class="emphasis">can</span> be useful to many in so many positive ways. Only too often an elderly person will retreat into a state of feeling unneeded, left out, or even passed by or rejected. Usually nothing could be further from the truth. Please communicate openly so we will know of your feelings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p15" pid="uDfaEsr6E06HGnDxk2rPdw" hash="Fcyj6g">Sixth, hold family home evening. If you are now alone, invite friends to stop by each Monday night. If you feel lonely, others probably do, too. Loneliness can only be dispelled by helping others feel less lonely. Family home evening is an ideal opportunity to share, to worship, and to heal.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p16" pid="tce4OJOn_0-5ELwpzbat3A" hash="872zGg">Seventh, whenever possible, walk each day. Enjoy this lovely world that the Savior has provided, and invite others to walk with you, sharing the beauties and miracles of nature together. “Add life to your years, not just years to life” (“The Problem of Old Age,” <span class="emphasis">Time,</span> 23 July 1966).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p17" pid="RFDAtf2GK06jOlL0HIKxhQ" hash="c3zKEQ">Eighth, for heaven’s sake, forget your regrets. The many years you have lived have been filled both with success and with experiences you might change if you could. But you can’t, so stop any self-inflicted sadness or despair. When the Savior said, “Judge not,” he was speaking, in part, about your relationship with yourself (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.1" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:1</a>). Live the repentant life happily. The scripture “Men are, that they might have joy” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.25" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:25</a>) applies to you right now.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p18" pid="F8hPvgul8UaRaoHuQy4viA" hash="t4ne2A">Bernard Baruch, on his eighty-fifth birthday, said (in a news report dated 20 August 1955), “To me, old age is always fifteen years older than I am.” Yes, there is much for you to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p19" pid="XgtKvkJe7ESN_Ocb7sAaNA" hash="Oa9oIw">Shifting now to a different perspective, those who are younger may ask, “What can we do?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p20" pid="tIpkbbv6dUyDJtqZkR6tRQ" hash="Mz7OpA">First, it is certainly our responsibility to keep in touch with you our parents, our grandparents, and elderly friends, to say hello and to express our love for your influence. Perhaps we should place a telephone call this afternoon or write a letter or note to say “remember when”—and then—thank you dad, mom, bishop, teacher, or friend.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p21" pid="4-nzjwaNG0-KTBUiQKpe9Q" hash="EOYFAw">Second, we must develop a partner relationship with you that will help all of us serve better in the kingdom by serving together. You stake presidents, bishops, quorum presidents, and auxiliary leaders are to call our older members to positions of meaningful responsibility. Can any of us imagine what the body of the General Authorities would be like without those magnificent men in their eighties and nineties who inspire, teach, and help carry the kingdom forward?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p22" pid="KJux6EyRFkO197-vVTBt4g" hash="-m1Cxg">Third, we must listen carefully to what you older and often wiser people have to say. A listening heart is a loving heart. Please forgive our impatience and may we concentrate upon your counsel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p23" pid="djYKfDmni0mNp_VcEJSbdg" hash="UonvWg">Fourth, we must be certain as we hurry through life that we tend to your needs as you have so kindly tended and cared for our needs through decades of patience and love. May we wipe away your tears as you have so skillfully and lovingly wiped away ours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/we-will-go-with-our-young-and-with-our-old.p24" pid="JaF4ebokUEKu7yuGsVHzNg" hash="XyQNzw">In closing, I say to you—our elder mentors, our examples, some of our dearest friends—thank you, and may we be one, as the Father and the Son are one, I pray in the blessed name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-gospel-restored.p1" pid="17aw1DlTTUqEvpTb8KwlUg" hash="_qCb8w">What a marvelous day this has been, and what an incredible age in which we live! For over a year I have thought of this great day—the dedication of these three buildings, the many people who have made these projects possible, and the remarkable effect of the restoration of the gospel upon the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-gospel-restored.p2" pid="c2c4PJpcKk2I3T5a8ugLew" hash="07BAnA">As we study this reinstitution and the theological basis of the Church, we will find ourselves thinking about the questions that so many others have asked. What is the explanation for the growth and the amazing influence of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? What does make Mormons different? Perplexed scholars, social critics, religionists, and cultural observers have given many answers. Their responses have ranged from describing the Church as a social abnormality that appeals to accomplishment-oriented people to such a simplistic idea as a conservative church always generates interest during troubled times.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-gospel-restored.p3" pid="x2fs3clnf0yvE2UgQgzuoQ" hash="cuZHsg">However, the more deeply one wonders what makes us different from our nonmember friends and neighbors, the more certain is the answer: the Redeemer and other heavenly messengers personally restored the everlasting gospel to the earth. That is why we are here.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-gospel-restored.p4" pid="tO6fbATDx06LTQQP7-x3Kw" hash="ne1vpQ">A poet so aptly said, “An honest tale speeds best being plainly told” (William Shakespeare, <span class="emphasis">Richard III,</span> act 4, sc. 4, line 358). That is my posture this day. The plain fact is that we believe the very same concepts that were revealed to the prophets ever since the world began. We utilize the same principles taught by the Master two thousand years ago.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-gospel-restored.p5" pid="fgo_HA6R50OpsLCPK6pseA" hash="qaxOdw">As we study the Church today, we conclude that it is the same institution that was on the earth so many centuries ago. No other explanation is sensible. This is why scholars who attempt to relate the gospel of Jesus Christ to popular movements of the day, to a chance happening, or to other responses simply do not make sense, nor do they satisfy the longings of even the most naive seeker after truth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/the-gospel-restored.p6" pid="_faeFYngxUeuOgvraDXHiA" hash="3z-ZZg">An example: the Master, while speaking to his disciples in the Old World, said, “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.16" class="scriptureRef">John 10:16</a>). We have known for 150 years that the other sheep were those sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father living here in the Americas. These are they whom the Savior visited after his resurrection. Their lives and trials are recorded in the Book of Mormon. No other logical explanation can be given for that verse in John. The restored gospel also offers explanations for so many other verses that have left biblical scholars mystified and struggling.</p>

Where can one find spiritual, emotional, and economic safety in order to survive today’s terrible cultural storms? The world is messy and bent on self-centeredness. Economic chaos and political instability are also part of today’s environment, leaving uneasiness, insecurity, and turmoil in all of our lives. Fortunately, the Restoration gives us the panacea that mends, directs, corrects, and heals; but if we don’t conform to this great God-given system, we will be like those unwise maidens who did not trim their wicks and fill their lamps with oil. We as a people are action-oriented and work-inclined. Conformance to this eternal system of energy expenditures does provide the only complete set of answers, which the world so desperately needs.

One of our unique characteristics, as a people, is the fact that we have a divinely appointed leader, a heavenly designee, whose authoritative responsibility has persisted for 150 years, beginning at this very spot with the first elder of the Church, Joseph Smith.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/beginning-again.p31" pid="fSkIPYDs0kisCsjRiiwTiw" hash="HVueXg">We recall with clarity these words of the Master: “Seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” (JST, Matt. 6:38.) Just a few verses later, the Savior tells us, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:7</a>.)</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Sixth,</span> don’t begin again partially. Be complete! Otherwise, you may be patching up an old article of clothing with a little piece of new material. The old fabric will not hold. As Jesus said, “No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for … the rent is made worse.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/9.16" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 9:16</a>.) Don’t patch. Begin a whole new life. The wealthy young man was unwilling to give all, to follow the Master totally, and so “he went away sorrowful” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.22" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 19:22</a>), and was never heard from again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/beginning-again.p33" pid="W9qwpwo7UEyN6nAobhn-Fg" hash="LFBmZA">
        <span class="emphasis">Seventh,</span> be open and candid in your relationships with others. So many of life’s difficulties are brought about by being double-minded. Let us learn to say it as it is. Think of Peter’s extreme discomfort when the Master addressed him after Peter had been teaching a false concept: “Thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.23" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:23</a>.) From that moment, Peter was a greater disciple. The person who is open and honest will be vindicated. Time is his friend. Trust is his reward.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Last,</span> and perhaps the hardest of all, forgive. Paul said, “To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/2.10" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 2:10</a>.) Certainly part of beginning again is to “love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/6.27-28" class="scriptureRef">Luke 6:27–28</a>.) Paul reinforced this admonition when he said, “See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.15" class="scriptureRef">1 Thes. 5:15</a>.) Revenge has no place in the life of a person who has found the “Land of Beginning Again.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/beginning-again.p35" pid="rC4lOk6uhkGIBDeWVkq1VQ" hash="1uwxcg">Think how young Joseph had been wronged by jealous brothers anciently. They sold him into slavery. He had every reason to seek revenge. But when circumstances joined them together again in Egypt, Joseph said, “But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, … to save much people.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/50.20" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 50:20</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/beginning-again.p36" pid="ITk4mcbo3EiDmJ7qi45YHA" hash="gtfK9w">Yes, so much of heartache and grief eventually become blessings, our earthly instructions, and condition us spiritually. Even if we cannot understand the “whys” of our tribulations, we can still turn to God and rededicate our lives to his safekeeping. Yes, “he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:23</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/beginning-again.p37" pid="3FIP2G6yzkOeDihoDF1YKg" hash="8vbkuw">May each of us, where necessary, Begin Again. I testify that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored and that we are to live its principles and precepts, and by so doing will be exalted. And this I say humbly in the worthy name of Jesus Christ, our Master, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/learning-our-fathers-will.p" pid="jrDUD4rKe0WvC49R3DpkOw" hash="CT5_LQ">While serving in Pennsylvania several years ago, I was pleasantly surprised to be visited by a minister of a huge Protestant congregation. We exchanged pleasantries and discussed the doctrinal subjects on which we could find benign agreement. Suddenly he interrupted our conversation by stating, “You teach one belief with which I could never agree. It is your idea that ‘as God is, man may become.’” (See <span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 6:302–17.) He held a well-worn white Bible in his hand. I asked him to turn to Matthew 5:48 [<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:48</a>]. His nimble fingers quickly turned to that reference, and he read, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/learning-our-fathers-will.p" pid="rb409kGwFkiUjjfCMuDc3g" hash="3lr9ug">He gasped and then hesitatingly agreed to man’s great potential. We read other scriptures, such as: “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/1.26" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 1:26</a>.) He understood, and found a new respect for our teachings. He left a wiser man, and I felt a renewed gratitude for the inspiring truths that we understand and teach.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/learning-our-fathers-will.p" pid="vPfO7TDks0asewmVVnFA3w" hash="6MzNiQ">A young woman had almost left the Church. While I visited the distant city where she lived, she asked if we could talk for a few minutes, and I agreed. She had heard many of the misconceptions that our detractors have used to discredit the Church for decades. We read from the scriptures for about an hour together. With relief reflected in her eyes, she finally said, “I have been misled, haven’t I?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/learning-our-fathers-will.p" pid="iCfGpktNSkGX6aS3PaGLnA" hash="66ohlQ">I said, “Yes, you have.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/learning-our-fathers-will.p" pid="Wqi3LPPnlk-fgWFBeaJMMQ" hash="qL4-LA">She was disappointed with what those erring enemies of the Church were teaching, but was excited to find herself back thinking clearly again. All we had done was read from the scriptures together. Confusion and mistakes come when we forget the importance of God’s word as our unwavering guide.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/learning-our-fathers-will.p" pid="OohDXmJlOk-cyR10sA7nfg" hash="mY2zPw">A friend asked me several months ago why so many problems have been plaguing a number of the members of the Church recently. I hesitatingly answered, “Well, the last days are surely approaching when even the elect shall be deceived.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.24" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:24</a>.) He looked at me momentarily and said, “Well, perhaps that might be a little of it, but I believe the real reason that so many are wandering on strange paths is because they do not follow prophetic counsel to study the scriptures and attend the classes in Church.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/learning-our-fathers-will.p" pid="9-XIHNJj2kiXsV_imjrbPg" hash="infnaQ">I have thought of that conversation many times.</p>

Also, the episode when the Master asked those without sin to cast the first stone at the woman caught in adultery and then, when they left, asked her, “Woman, where are … thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? … Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.10-11" class="scriptureRef">John 8:10–11</a>.)</p>

He bought our bodies and our spirits, and they belong to God. We surely are to take care of His possessions. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/6.15-20" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 6:15–20</a>.)</p>

        <span class="emphasis">First,</span> attend our Church meetings. Several years ago we were given a meeting schedule that consolidated formal worship into a three-hour time frame. To each is given the identical commodity of 168 hours each week. The knave is given the same amount of time as the knight. The scriptural scholar is given the same amount of time as the doctrinal dumbo. Yes, for three hours each week we are asked to attend our formal Church meetings to become familiar with the word of God. This is less than two percent of our time. Yet too often presidencies hold meetings, members visit in the hallways, and leaders interview during this precious period. Yes, our leaders would lead better, our counselors would counsel better, and our members, by worshiping more studiously, would be able to cope more enduringly and satisfactorily.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/learning-our-fathers-will.p" pid="t2vYMrIjskGPwaIpFprK2w" hash="4g54og">What better lesson can a bishop, a Relief Society or Young Women president, a Melchizedek Priesthood quorum leader, or stake president teach than by being in a Gospel Doctrine class with his or her mate studying the word of God? Children certainly become more committed to doctrinal learning when they see their parents with scriptures in hand going to Church meetings and studying God’s word together.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Second,</span> study the scriptures with our family, with other members, and with friends, but also search the words of God in private contemplation. Search the scriptures as they relate to our priesthood, Relief Society, Sunday School, Young Women, and Primary lessons. Study the scriptures for additional enlightenment on how to be more happy and less frustrated in what only too often is at least temporarily a sad and dreary world. Every four years we are guided carefully through all of the scriptures in the adult curriculum of the Church. In a lifetime, each member can become a spiritual scriptorian instead of remaining a scriptural simpleton. How blessed we are to have our four books of scripture in editions that include efficient indexes, chapter headings, and other study helps such as the Topical Guide.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/learning-our-fathers-will.p" pid="F6DMHQ2vhEaAhNZOr2vdVg" hash="xHVgVA">Last April I was deeply impressed with the words of Elder J. Thomas Fyans when he reported to the First Quorum of the Seventy the method he and his wife, Helen, use to study the scriptures. Because his stake conference assignments kept them from sitting together in the Gospel Doctrine class, learning from the Book of Mormon this year, they studied the Sunday School manual together at home, carefully marking the scriptures as they went along. They completed their study of the Book of Mormon in just four months and were looking forward to repeating the experience.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Third,</span> brothers and sisters, we are to practice what we learn and teach. To overcome scriptural stupor, we must put what we learn into action. The scriptures lived for those who wrote them; we can make them just as real for us today if we will live by their teachings.</p>

He said, “Most people don’t realize that we are going to have a flood this year. They are relaxed down there in the valley.

Men and boys worked with shovels; people worked together. A miracle was being performed as a canal was dug twenty-three miles long in a matter of several days. The communities were saved. Yes, some of the farms were injured, but a whole area was now safe. How? Why? Because of the unity of courageous people doing what needed to be done together. No one person could have done it. No small group of men or women could have accomplished the task. But with the unity which that stake president helped to create, we saw the National Guard, construction companies (not knowing if or when they would be paid), and men from near and far loaning their valuable equipment so that a valley could be rescued.

We sustain our leaders and generally follow their counsel and direction. There are many reasons to be unified, but perhaps the greatest reason is that we have been asked to be one. In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord asks us to assemble ourselves together to agree upon his word (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/41.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 41:2</a>).

Brother Anderson died fourteen months ago. He had an extremely rare disease, <span class="emphasis">epidermalosis belosa.</span> When he was young, whenever his skin was touched, it would hemorrhage. After a time the injury would scab over. Cotton would partially protect his hands, feet, and other areas of his body, but not well enough to avoid the pain and scabbing. His skin became a form of inflexible tissue. He could not touch his scalp, so combing his hair was very difficult. He lived to be twenty-six years old, but never during those 312 months did he have a day free of pain, scabs, and bandages, or a day that he could run and play as others.</p>

He had a wonderful sense of humor. His example of courage and being as self-sustaining as possible blessed everyone who knew him. Of course, his wonderful parents, friends, Church leaders, and teachers did all they could, but Chucky Anderson determined he would be as self-reliant as possible.</p>

So what did he do? He served a mission by helping all who knew him to know that he was a Mormon boy and loved the Lord.

He was talking about the Book of Mormon. The noise continued. Suddenly, a young woman stood up, stepped to the front of the class, and, frightened, said as she pushed the pause button, “He is our prophet. He talks with Heavenly Father.

Concentrate upon the words of the Master as reflected through the writings of Nephi, Moses, Paul, Luke, Joseph Smith, and other prophets. Often, when the days are dark and times are difficult, turning to the scriptures will provide a strength and confirmation that, generally, can come in no other way. To have a testimony and personality become stronger, one must go it alone.</p>

These resources will remain helpful, but all of them together will never be as complete or as powerful as the scriptures. And incidentally, let us not rely too heavily upon what others tell us the Lord is saying in the standard works. Let us find out by going directly to those sacred pages ourselves.</p>

They are well designed, and almost always beautifully maintained, but they do not substitute for our homes and never will.

Pilots have a procedure they follow for leaving the ground confidently, traveling about the earth or exploring it from outer space securely, and then landing safely. Whether flying a single-engine airplane or commanding a spacecraft circling the world every ninety-two minutes, each seasoned pilot carefully goes over a <span class="emphasis">checklist</span> to ensure that every system of the aircraft is working properly. Whether we speak of a jet fighter (F-14 or F-18 Hornet) screaming into the sky from an aircraft carrier deck, a crop duster skimming over farms in Washington or Kansas, or the space shuttle <span class="emphasis">Discovery</span> rocketing into space, launching satellites and doing scientific and medical experiments, it is the same. Each pilot and crew member goes through a detailed checklist before taking off to make sure that everything is in proper order.</p>

        <span class="strong">First checklist item: The priesthood.</span> Really understand and use the priesthood you bear. Honor it; realize its power. Remember the Aaronic Priesthood that you bear is the preparatory priesthood leading to the Melchizedek Priesthood. By the power of the Melchizedek Priesthood, the Only Begotten Son created worlds without number (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/1.2" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 1:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:24</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.33" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:33</a>) as the premortal Jehovah and then performed many miracles on earth as our Savior, Jesus Christ. A wise priesthood leader taught that now is the time in your life for <span class="emphasis">doing,</span> so later you <span class="emphasis">become</span> the man you are to be. Heavenly Father trusts you. You have the very priesthood that Aaron bore honorably and that John the Baptist used when he baptized Jesus “to fulfil all righteousness” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/3.15" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 3:15</a>). Eighteen hundred years later, on the banks of the Susquehanna River, he ordained Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery to that same Aaronic Priesthood (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.68-73" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:68–73</a>).</p>

You gather fast offerings to help the poor and the needy. Many of you serve as ushers, arrange chairs and tables for meetings, and perform other important duties. You priests have the authority to baptize (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:46</a>) just as the young men serving as missionaries and as your fathers and other older men do.

        <span class="strong">Second checklist item: Family and friends.</span> Always remember the importance of your home, your parents, other family members, and your friends. Do not expect your parents to do things for you that you now can do for yourselves. It is your turn to begin taking more responsibility. “Hey, but my dad should do this,” or “I want my mother to continue to do this for me,” you might still wish. A successful home is based on the love and helpfulness of children just as it is based on loving parents handling their responsibilities.</p>

My father came out of the house to observe what I was doing. He criticized me to the extent that I felt as if I was doing nothing right. Finally I said something like, “Dad, get off my case. Don’t you understand this is the first time I have ever been a teenager?” He looked at me and said, “Pal, don’t you know this is the first time I have ever been a father?” I grew wiser that day because I realized we all are learning together within a family. We cannot expect our parents to be perfect any more than we can expect ourselves to be all that we hoped to be.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/your-personal-checklist-for-a-successful-eternal-flight.p10" pid="SmL_bB7qvU6P0J7hE_Q5JA" hash="cMd-uQ">Choose your friends carefully. Associate with young men and young women who are straight and who will assist you to be responsible. Help your friends decide to go on missions, to attend Church meetings, and to enjoy righteous activities. You who are sixteen and older and are dating, make sure the girls you date are just as good when you return them to their homes as when you picked them up.</p>

        <span class="strong">Third checklist item: Live the commandments.</span> Never feed the foxes! What does that mean? <span class="emphasis">Breaking commandments is like feeding foxes.</span> In England where we live, my wife and I had heard that foxes were right in town. We wanted to see a fox. A neighbor told us that if we left food for the foxes we probably would see one. Our butcher gave us some bones. Each night we would place some bones out in the backyard. Soon a fox came to eat. Then a few more. Now we have at least five foxes racing through our flower garden, digging up the lawn, and leaving a shamble every night, sort of like a furry Jurassic Park.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/your-personal-checklist-for-a-successful-eternal-flight.p12" pid="WjBtDNRq8kiiSvTX_yLjng" hash="NuifTw">What started out as a curiosity is now a problem, and sin is much the same. An indiscretion can begin a process that can make a mess of a whole life. Remember, if you don’t start feeding the foxes, they will never tear up your yard. If you avoid making the seemingly small and harmless mistakes, your life will be free of many larger problems later on. Be a courageous young man by living straight. Create happy memories for yourselves and those around you.</p>

        <span class="strong">Fourth checklist item: Education.</span> Make good use of your schooling. The scriptures tell us that there is a time for every purpose under heaven (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/eccl/3.1-8" class="scriptureRef">Eccl. 3:1–8</a>). Now is the time of your preparation. The direction you are flying as a young man will determine where you will land as an adult. Are you headed in the direction that you want to be flying?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/your-personal-checklist-for-a-successful-eternal-flight.p14" pid="QUATe1Z2p0aV7Epdn1-gwQ" hash="vAmUSg">Those of us who are older remember that not all that goes on in school and work is pleasant, nor does it all seem useful and necessary. Yet most of what you learn is helpful. Be excited about your schooling and develop the habit of going the extra mile (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.41" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:41</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.41" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:41</a>). This habit will assist you in crossing continents successfully when you are older. Through study and hard work, you prepare for a life of spiritual, emotional, and economic self-reliance. Build a foundation now that will support your future (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.24-25" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:24–25</a>). Feel the excitement of accomplishing difficult tasks.</p>

Many of them worked several jobs when they were young and saved part of their income for a mission and for their education. They have been blessing others ever since. Your parents are not obligated to provide everything you want. The Lord instructed us not to be idle! (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:42</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 60:13</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/75.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 75:3</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.124" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:124</a>).</p>

        <span class="strong">Fifth checklist item: A mission.</span> While serving as an aide-de-camp to a major general in an army reserve unit, I found myself in many conversations with that remarkable military leader. He was not of our faith. “Pinnock,” he once said, “do you know how fortunate you Mormons are?” I replied by saying something like, “Yes, sir, but what are you thinking about?” He said, “A mission, Pinnock, that’s what it’s all about. Your young men are encouraged to go to serve others. They become stronger, more wise, and more dependable because of a mission.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/your-personal-checklist-for-a-successful-eternal-flight.p17" pid="BqxojOiR7kG-EYQCUZ_ToA" hash="3MzGXQ">The prophet has asked you young men to serve, the world desperately needs you to serve, and you need to feel the power and growth from serving and teaching others. And if for some unusual reason you are not called to serve a mission, there will be other opportunities to serve the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/your-personal-checklist-for-a-successful-eternal-flight.p18" pid="y_5-1UFhNk2o0XxEJLeORg" hash="zeR7nQ">So there you have it: a checklist that can keep you flying in the right direction. A pilot must have the support of a skilled ground crew to succeed, and your parents, bishops, quorum leaders, and solid friends all will help support your flight through these key years of your life. A wonderful future is yours if you stick to your personal checklist. We pray for you, care about you, and stand by to help you. To these truths I testify in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
