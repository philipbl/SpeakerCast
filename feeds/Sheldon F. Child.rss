      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p1" pid="obGysOEI0E-z7DiRs-yJsA" hash="cKsgsQ">I was raised on a small farm in northern Utah. We were blessed to have enough land, not enough to make a living, but enough to make work for a young boy. My parents were good, hardworking, industrious people. In order to make ends meet, my father took outside employment. Each morning before he left for work, he would make a list of chores he wanted me to accomplish before he came home that evening.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p2" pid="iurZ60xl_UOpZggRQ6Lzpw" hash="yekYqw">I remember on one occasion one of the items on the list was to take a small broken part from our hay rake to the blacksmith shop to have it repaired. I was uncomfortable about going. My father hadn’t left any money, and I wondered what I should do. I put off going as long as I could. When all my other chores were finished, I knew I couldn’t avoid it any longer. Father expected the broken part to be repaired when he came home, and it was my responsibility to see that it was done.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p3" pid="lBKziEIqtUKxNvT1b-f8sA" hash="TLPD1g">I can still remember walking the mile or so to the blacksmith shop. I even remember how uncomfortable I was as I watched him weld the part. As he finished, I nervously told him that I had no money, but that my father would pay him later. I’m sure he sensed my anxiety. He patted me on the shoulder and said, “Son, don’t worry, <span class="emphasis">your father’s word is as good as his bond.”</span> I remember running all the way home, relieved that the part had been repaired and grateful that my father was known as a man whose word was as good as his bond.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p4" pid="GDNR20yowEumN3abst4mhA" hash="KCM5Sw">As a boy I didn’t fully understand what that meant, but I knew it was good and something to be desired. It was years later that I recognized that a person whose word is as good as his bond is a person of honesty and integrity, a person to be trusted. In today’s world, there are some who think nothing of breaking their word, their promises, their covenants with man and with God. What a blessing it is to deal with those whom we can trust.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p5" pid="ordleabcBEaJK0-lk1uJHA" hash="5QKLbA">A powerful example of this can be found in the Book of Mormon. You will remember the assignment given to Nephi and his brothers by their father, Lehi, to go to Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass from Laban. After an unsuccessful attempt, the brothers desired to return to their father in the wilderness. Nephi recognized that they had a task to perform, an assignment to fulfill. He stated, “We will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> They tried again, and again they failed. Nephi then “crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> It was there that he found Laban drunken with wine and obeyed the voice of the Spirit, which said to him: “Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands. … It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Then, putting on the clothes of Laban, he went to the treasury and obtained the plates. Nephi had accomplished that which he had been sent to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p6" pid="nWFkEAYqU0KQfvNA9YUvMg" hash="qGML7w">But we must not overlook the powerful example of Laban’s servant, Zoram. Nephi commanded Zoram to follow him as he left the treasury, and it was only when he called to his brothers that Zoram realized that it was Nephi and not Laban whom he had followed. The scriptures tell us that Zoram “began to tremble, and was about to flee,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> when Nephi seized him and told him he need not fear, that he should be a free man if he would go down into the wilderness with them.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Zoram promised that he would; he gave his word. And Nephi said that “when Zoram had made an oath unto us, our fears did cease concerning him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> He was a man to be trusted; his oath was binding; his word was as good as his bond.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p7" pid="kHBZJIJAEES7NFdyCf4BLA" hash="G-Jumg">Honesty and integrity are not old-fashioned principles. They are just as viable in today’s world. We have been taught in the Church that:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p15" pid="VaPAf5Wa1UWySM2kQuPtyQ" hash="mY9X4g">“A young man came to me not long ago and said, ‘I made an agreement with a man that requires me to make certain payments each year. I am in arrears, and I can’t make those payments, for if I do, it is going to cause me to lose my home. What shall I do?’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p16" pid="C5AT77EE4k6tBwdRRXsDSg" hash="0zx8hA">“I looked at him and said, ‘Keep your agreement.’</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p18" pid="4Mf0wSyVfUyAIxNecA2FpQ" hash="wl0VCQ">“I said, ‘I am not talking about your home. I am talking about your agreement; and I think your wife would rather have a husband who would keep his word, meet his obligations, keep his pledges or his covenants, and have to rent a home than to have a home with a husband who will not keep his covenants and his pledges.’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p19" pid="Wl0HxPCr0k2evVS4wpOiIg" hash="A0ZGbg">We are all familiar with the statement “Honesty is the best policy.” For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, honesty is the <span class="emphasis">only</span> policy. We must be honest with our fellowmen. We must be honest with our God. We are honest with God when we honor the covenants we make with Him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p20" pid="5fCk_wFpBUqu5Ie-b0Pl0g" hash="KO-8Qg">We are a covenant-making people. We make covenants at the waters of baptism.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> We renew those covenants each week as we worthily partake of the sacrament. We take upon ourselves the name of Christ; we promise to always remember Him and to keep His commandments. And in return He promises us that His Spirit will always be with us. We make covenants as we enter into the temple, and in return we receive the promised blessings of eternal life—if we keep those sacred covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p21" pid="UkGYTwVevEiZUQJdxTVsYw" hash="PvhsFQ">Covenants with God are not to be taken lightly. In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord tells us, “I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/as-good-as-our-bond.p22" pid="mcK18AhACkWFKPh8injtAw" hash="yoT_9w">The account of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies in the Book of Mormon is a touching example of this. Ammon and his brethren spent 14 years preaching to the Lamanite people. Thousands were brought to the knowledge of the truth, and those who were converted unto the Lord “never did fall away.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> “For they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> They were so grateful for the mercy of God that they covenanted with Him “that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> You will remember that they buried their weapons of war in the ground. They were so true to that covenant that even when the armies of the Lamanites came upon them, “they went out to meet them, and prostrated themselves before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> They offered no resistance. Many were slain. These people were willing to die rather than break the covenant that they had made with the Lord.</p>

Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin tells us: “The rewards of integrity are immeasurable. One is the indescribable inner peace that comes from knowing we are doing what is right; another is an absence of the guilt and anxiety that accompany sin. Another reward of integrity is the confidence it can give us in approaching God. … The consummate reward of integrity is the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. … Let us live true to the trust the Lord has placed in us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/a-sure-foundation.p1" pid="FPlefRwD0k6400RJh9tCiA" hash="_qCKyg">Several years ago a severe storm hit the area in which we were living. It began with a torrential downpour, followed by a devastating easterly wind. When the storm was over, damages were assessed—power lines were down, property had been damaged, and many of the beautiful trees that grew in the area had been uprooted. A few days later I was talking to a friend who had lost several of the trees in his yard. The trees on one side of his home were standing straight and tall. They had weathered the storm well, while the trees that were in what I considered the prime spot on his property had not been able to withstand the heavy winds. He pointed out to me that the trees that survived the storm were planted on firm ground; their roots had to sink deep into the soil to receive nourishment. The trees he had lost were planted near a small stream, where nourishment was readily available. The roots were shallow. They were not anchored deeply enough to protect them from the storm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/a-sure-foundation.p2" pid="sC1RoQMhekO9J1akiFVxMQ" hash="sK6XDA">Our testimonies, like those trees, must be built on a sure foundation, deeply rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ, so that when the winds and rains come into our lives, as they surely will, we will be strong enough to weather the storms that rage about us. Helaman counseled his sons:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/a-sure-foundation.p3" pid="1GIPTsM3dUenZW4b89tkdA" hash="qWUwYQ">“And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/a-sure-foundation.p4" pid="I9q1yiHF1UWB_08atlgG2g" hash="MZKSjQ">In the Book of Mormon the prophet Jacob, in his encounter with Sherem the anti-Christ, asked this question: “Deniest thou the Christ who shall come?

So important were the scriptures that, in order to obtain the records, the voice of the Spirit directed Nephi to slay Laban, saying, “It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

Many generations later, King Mosiah discovered their descendants. They were known as the people of Zarahemla. Their spiritual condition was poor. In Omni we read, “Their language had become corrupted; and they had brought no records with them; and they denied the being of their Creator.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Without scriptures, not only nations perish, but families and individuals dwindle in unbelief. Daily scripture study helps us to anchor our faith in Christ. They truly testify of Him.</p>

At the Sunday session of the conference, the wife of the newly called stake president related this story. She stated that she had been raised in a good Christian home. Her parents gathered their family together every day to read and study the Bible. As they read about the prophets of old, she asked her parents why there were no prophets on the earth today. They didn’t have an answer that satisfied her, nor did her teachers or her religious leaders.</p>

Hinckley, his counselors, and the Quorum of the Twelve as prophets, seers, and revelators. They are special witnesses of the name of Jesus Christ. In the document “The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles,” they state: “We bear testimony, as His duly ordained Apostles—that Jesus is the Living Christ, the immortal Son of God. … He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world. His way is the path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> Brothers and sisters, if God loves us enough to send us prophets, then we need to love Him enough to follow them. Following the prophets will help protect us against the storms of life and lead us to Christ.</p>

If we live righteously and remain worthy, we are promised His constant companionship; He will guide our lives, teach us truths, and testify to us that Jesus is the Christ. As covenant members of the Lord’s Church, we promise to serve Him and keep His commandments “that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon [us].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/a-sure-foundation.p20" pid="ruAgEXCKbUyaAXAi7AcRvA" hash="Q1p4pQ">In West Africa, where we are currently serving, we feel His Spirit being poured out in rich abundance upon the faithful Saints. In 1989 a storm hit Ghana—not a storm of wind or rain, but a storm of persecution, slander, and misunderstandings. It was a trying time; the Church was new there. All of our non-African missionaries were required to leave the country. Our meetinghouses were locked and guarded so that they could not be used by the members. The Saints could not gather together, so they worshiped as families in their own homes. Some members were arrested and even imprisoned. This period of time is referred to as “the freeze.” Members had little contact or support from the outside Church, but they were not left on their own to weather the storm. They had the scriptures and the words of the prophets; they put their trust and faith in the Lord, and He poured out His Spirit upon them. One member of the Church said: “We had the Spirit of the Lord with us; we could feel Him guiding and directing us. We drew closer to one another, and we drew nearer to the Savior.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/a-sure-foundation.p21" pid="F6qwrQ9wQEKHgrPNLqmvdA" hash="VeuGCg">For 18 months the Saints fasted and prayed for the day when the freeze would end. In November of 1990, the ban was lifted. The worst of the storm had passed, but it had taken its toll. There were those who had fallen away. Their roots had been shallow and their foundation weak. The foundation of the Church in Ghana today is built on the faith of those who weathered the storm. They were deeply rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

They will help us build on “a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Of this I humbly testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="79"></span>When I was a young boy, one of our neighbors had a herd of dairy cows. One of his cows died, leaving a newborn calf, which he gave to me. I took care of the calf, fed it, and raised it. The day my dad took it to the stockyards to be sold was a day of mixed emotions for me: I had grown attached to my calf, and yet I was looking forward to receiving the rewards of my labor. My only request was that the money I received from selling the calf be in silver dollars. I remember Dad coming home that night and dropping 20 silver dollars into my hands. Money was hard to come by, and I thought I had all the money in the world. I counted, admired, and polished each coin carefully. When Sunday came, I reluctantly put two shiny coins into my pocket to pay my tithing. As hard as it was to surrender my precious silver dollars to the bishop, I still remember now how good I felt being obedient to the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p2" pid="2G04ZLKqd0SmQE3FMV3ZeA" hash="MbONPQ">On the way home from church, my mother told me how proud she was of me. Then she said, “Your grandfather always told us children that if we would faithfully pay an honest tithing, the Lord would bless us and it would be the best investment that we could ever make.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p3" pid="4TWtAHwxFkqf6jPOuGodAA" hash="Py4XtA">My grandfather understood that “there is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated—and when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Tithing is a commandment from God, and when we obey His law, He is bound to bless us. Even as a seven-year-old boy, that was something I could understand. President Thomas S. Monson, in speaking about God’s laws, stated: “Violate them and we suffer lasting consequences. Obey them and we reap everlasting joy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p4" pid="gDHmNVE9h0ilRTwNxNPsBQ" hash="Vbrpgg">You’ll remember that when Israel was chastened for robbing God, the people asked, “Wherein have we robbed thee?” The answer came, “In <span class="pageBreak" page-number="80"></span>tithes and offerings.” And then the Israelites were promised that if they would obey His law of tithing, they would be entitled to receive His blessings. The Lord said, “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse … and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p5" pid="hvoBqCSLEUK6bJus_U33gg" hash="C4CoFA">The Lord asked Israel to prove Him, to test Him, to have faith in Him so that He would be able to keep His promise to them. That same commandment and that same promise are in effect today. When we keep the law of the tithe, the Lord’s promise is sure: blessings will come to us both temporally and spiritually, according to the wisdom and timing of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p6" pid="JqbLWDN8LUCK11_Cp2y6yw" hash="EeXmSw">My wife, Joan, and I have had the privilege of living in various parts of the world among wonderful people who rely daily on the Lord for their most basic temporal needs. Those who take the leap of faith to pay their tithing testify that the windows of heaven are opened to them. I remember a faithful father in the Philippines telling of paying his meager tithing to the bishop one Sunday and then leading his children home from church, knowing full well that there was no food for them. As they were walking along, a huge breadfruit dropped from a tree right in front of them. He immediately looked up and thanked God for opening the windows of heaven and sending him a breadfruit to feed his children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p7" pid="VzmwABdQbEief_APP6siwg" hash="TNNVJQ">We are living in challenging economic times. However, if we look back over the past years, we find there have been, and will continue to be, times of relative prosperity and times of financial uncertainty. But regardless of the circumstances in which we find ourselves, if we first pay our obligation to the Lord and then use wisdom and good judgment, the Lord will help us manage the resources He has given us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p8" pid="qfqGlJkuPEqE9OtazvTtZw" hash="_LA41Q">President Heber J. Grant stated, “I want to say to you, if you will be honest with the Lord, paying your tithing and keeping His commandments, He will not only bless you with the light and inspiration of His Holy Spirit, but you will be blessed in dollars and cents; you will be enabled to pay your debts, and the Lord will pour out temporal blessings upon you in great abundance.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p9" pid="52Wr5oUBIkeSGbih4VEJaA" hash="UtivWg">In 1936, at the height of the Great Depression in the United States, when <span class="pageBreak" page-number="81"></span>people were struggling to make ends meet, Elder John A. Widtsoe admonished the Saints to pay their tithing because of the spiritual blessings they would receive. He said: “Obedience to the law of tithing … brings a deep, inward joy … that can be won in no other way. … The principles of truth become clearer. … Prayer becomes easier. … The spiritual sense is sharpened [and] … man becomes more like his Father in Heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p10" pid="FJNGFiZ8Rk-DTup4m7PX8Q" hash="YMbzZA">A mother in West Africa shared her testimony about tithing. She was a trader in a marketplace. Every day she would come home, count out her tithing, and put it in a special place. Then on Sunday she would faithfully take it to her bishop. She shared with us how her business had grown and how her family had been blessed with health and strength and enough food to eat. Then with tears in her eyes she said, “But the greatest blessings of all are that my children love the Lord and we are a forever family.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p11" pid="xl_EL9QOY025rZJAJoEIqw" hash="yJ4jyw">This humble mother understood that one of the great blessings of being a full-tithe payer is the privilege of entering the house of the Lord and participating in the sacred ordinances that enable families to be together forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/the-best-investment.p12" pid="t2bFjl-klE69e5ntVk-oeg" hash="9XLZUA">As we faithfully pay our tithes, the Lord will indeed open the windows of heaven and pour us out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. I want each of you to know, and especially my children and grandchildren, that I know, as my grandfather did, that if you always pay an honest tithing, the Lord will bless you. It will be the best investment you will ever make. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
