      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p1" pid="kVlrez7na0eo__HAsgBRYQ" hash="gg4SHg">I approach this enormous responsibility with great respect and love for you—particularly you young women. I know that each of you listens with a very individual heart. Each of your needs at this particular moment are yours alone. Regardless of the formality of this setting, I have confidence that many of us will find—either through music, the spoken word, or simply the comradery of friends around us—answers and encouragement that will help us move forward. My only desire is to be a part of that process.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p2" pid="sBIOiRY82kGmOiWXu_fksg" hash="q667vw">In this desire to somehow connect with your very individual lives, I began to think about something that every human being experiences—something that we usually see as negative—that we would avoid if we could. Sometimes we tell ourselves that no one else suffers from this as we do, or sometimes in an effort to control it, we tell ourselves that we simply do not experience it. That something is called <span class="emphasis">fear</span>.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p3" pid="o03HsLMDOkSJSx0dW4HpDA" hash="BbO0uw">I have asked many young women what they are afraid of. These are some of the things that they told me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p4" pid="Iu8zV1PkKkyyEdgtawqwcQ" hash="yKY1Ew">“When I moved into a new school, I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to make friends.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p5" pid="qxLzLLGQXU23L8Sw4ZmD8A" hash="GjVYFQ">“Last year my brother was sick. I was afraid he would die.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p6" pid="StSk6Ya27kO4l1Hb7DJEmw" hash="k_ZuZg">“When I hear my parents arguing and fighting, I am afraid they will get divorced.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p7" pid="5XLj-We2yk--dquI6Htmlw" hash="7-00og">“I made some terrible mistakes, and I lived in fear that they would be discovered, bringing shame and embarrassment to my family. I was so afraid of the humiliation that I thought about having an abortion.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p8" pid="vGZbv5U_YkeKi7fTlrF2KQ" hash="JHanHw">“I have lots of worries—what will I say, how should I act, what should I wear? It seems like I can’t have fun or make friends because I am always afraid of what people will think of me.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p9" pid="6hm6H2IrREuoYGsuZK17nw" hash="MY6p9g">“Because of some things that happened to me when I was young, I have a hard time not being afraid of men. Even being alone with the bishop in his office can sometimes be frightening to me. I’m also afraid that if anyone else knew what has happened to me, they wouldn’t love me anymore.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p10" pid="ePGp7uvyvEKlgHf4cz3HIQ" hash="FhXHAQ">“I’m afraid I won’t pass the big test that will allow me to keep going to school.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p11" pid="v75rGy7WfEmgUshjg9jEiA" hash="BQ2eEQ">“I’m afraid that I won’t ever get married.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p12" pid="hnezY46T1kGes72GE325vw" hash="ofRb1w">“I’m afraid that my parents won’t be able to buy a uniform for me to go to school.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p13" pid="TU8aUsldy0CsGl1331cUgw" hash="l6h7eg">Scary stuff, isn’t it?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p14" pid="X3csq8bzbUy6O1SdvnoUfw" hash="bB3hBQ">As we read the scriptures, we find that fear has been a part of the history of individuals ever since the world began. I can even imagine that in the preexistent world, when the two plans were presented, some may have chosen Lucifer’s plan because of fear—the fear of leaving the presence of the Father with no guarantee that we would return. Lucifer perhaps played on those fears by assuring that with his plan, all would return.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p15" pid="CLc8IrcAj0u38VtnJ2U_5Q" hash="MAdSEQ">I can imagine how frightening it must have been for Adam and Eve, who had lived with complete security—friendly animals, plenty to eat, no opposition from nature—to suddenly be cast into a world where survival itself must have been a constant fear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p16" pid="76q5SM8M2Eaa6Hp9d9etLA" hash="Ogvz6Q">Why is fear part of earth life?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p17" pid="peHPLZrmQEyisdzik871nA" hash="zPKQTQ">Perhaps our Heavenly Father’s greatest hope is that through our fears we may choose to turn to him. The uncertainties of earth life can help to remind each of us that we are dependent on him. But that reminder is not automatic. It involves our agency. We must <span class="emphasis">choose</span> to take our fears to him, <span class="emphasis">choose </span>to trust him, and <span class="emphasis">choose</span> to allow him to direct us. We must make these choices when what we feel most inclined to do is to rely more and more on our own frantic and often distorted thinking.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p18" pid="QhYD9P8XZUGdCzMSeVVOAw" hash="EIb0zw">As we try to live his commandments and pray to him, there are things he will direct us to do that will help calm our fears. These actions often require great courage and direction from the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost may help us to understand when and with whom we should share our fears. He will support us as we face our fears and try to do things that we have never done before.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p19" pid="baKf5DqB70asaJepkXBYkw" hash="e-Tfdw">May I offer two ideas that have been helpful to me when I have felt fearful? The first one came in the form of advice from Sister Michaelene Grassli, Primary general president. I served under her on the Primary General Board. We were on a training assignment together when a local leader began to describe in glowing details the auxiliary leaders who had come to that area the year before. As she told about the wonderful things they had done and expressed her hopes that we would do the same, a sick feeling began to settle in my stomach. That night after our hostess had left, I expressed to Sister Grassli my fears: I was afraid my performance would be far less than those who had come before, and I would certainly be a disappointment to everyone and probably an embarrassment to her and the Church. She said, “I have had those same feelings, but it is comforting to me to know that I need only be concerned that what I do and say is acceptable and pleasing to the Lord.” Her words brought such immediate peace to my mind that I have repeated them over and over to myself in countless situations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p20" pid="a8nFtx5mQk-Jwxpp52ugjQ" hash="8X4etA">As women, we like very much to please others—sometimes seeking approval so frantically that we become torn and confused by the conflicting needs of those around us. Concentrating on pleasing Heavenly Father brings peace, a respite from fear and anxiety. Think of that, young women, the next time you are asked to perform in church, or visit an inactive member of your class, or plan an activity: “I only need to worry about pleasing the Lord.” I think some of your fears will evaporate. The prophet David said: “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/27.1" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 27:1</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p21" pid="AbWtphZQ40OBuDnTZpSxRg" hash="FRqJfg">The second idea that has been helpful to me was reportedly expressed by Vincent van Gogh, a famous painter. He said, “I am always doing what I can’t do yet in order to learn how to do it.” A large part of conquering daily fear is simply doing things that we don’t know how to do—yet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p22" pid="BX31i9qjvkyUpdlvzYq75A" hash="yXl_Aw">Are there things you don’t know how to do yet, that you are doing anyway? What about trying to make conversation with a young man at Mutual even though you feel very awkward? What about working hard in school even though it feels discouraging? I have often heard Sister Janette Hales, our Young Women general president, tell young people to work hard. She has said, “Working increases our abilities, and as you feel your abilities increase, you will feel more secure.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p23" pid="n_NGxEGT-EWV9mwtGW4PiQ" hash="XGtLwA">I’ve just finished reading Eleanor Roosevelt’s biography. She was the wife of a president of the United States, but her influence went far beyond politics and position. Her life stands as a beacon to all women as someone who magnificently developed her own gifts through her service to others. This was a woman whose early life was ruled by fear and self-doubt. She described herself as an awkward adolescent, unattractively tall, with protruding teeth, dressed inappropriately, and so ill at ease with others her own age that parties and dances were dreaded occasions. How did she move from that to the kind of confidence that allowed her to contribute so widely?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p24" pid="8X-aIeEBEEGhdAbwn-l0KQ" hash="fXF0mA">She said, “You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing which you think you cannot do.” (Karen McAuley, <span class="emphasis">Eleanor Roosevelt,</span> New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1987, p. 105.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p25" pid="PWNFZd1dUkmkRZ9BRVO6sQ" hash="jQ8SEQ">As we concentrate on pleasing the Lord rather than others and continue to work hard, doing the things we don’t know how to do yet, we will experience personal growth. We will increase our confidence in Heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. This faith assures us that in the end, we will not only survive but we will know great joy and happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p26" pid="TG9MryJfp0Sawav8RVYblw" hash="k0P6bw">After the death of Christ, Paul was converted and became a great missionary. He had a junior companion, whom he loved as a father loves his own son. When we pick up their story in 2 Timothy, they are separated in their service. Timothy is lonely and afraid—being a missionary can be a fearful business. Paul is in prison in Rome. He writes Timothy a letter: “To Timothy, my dearly beloved son. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p27" pid="CSgoL5oC_UOCHrr9Owvjeg" hash="kB9MlA">“I thank God … that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p28" pid="4DUBT1RPW06Hdh7YJI-nLA" hash="i4nMsQ">“Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.2-4" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 1:2–4</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p29" pid="lKiViRaFG0ORCKQwr_lvfg" hash="r7hZ7Q">Isn’t that a tender letter? Pretend it is coming to you from one who is mindful of <span class="emphasis">your</span> tears.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p30" pid="2HdE-U6f50eM5xAAbmoy6Q" hash="Xw6S7g">Paul then goes on to remind Timothy of his strengths: “I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.5" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 1:5</a>.) He reminds Timothy that both his grandmother and his mother were women of faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p31" pid="cq_yVpVj3kKXfiQv0pLVeA" hash="LFXUsw">Think of some of the strengths that your grandmothers and mother have passed on to you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p32" pid="BS_o_gza00SZ8xqQcRIueQ" hash="bclksg">Then Paul asks Timothy to remember to use the gift of the Holy Ghost: “I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.6" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 1:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p33" pid="3QziTy-tBEq-gBTzSxtyhA" hash="eULe4Q">Are you remembering that you have had hands laid on your head—that you have been given a gift? Use that gift to conquer your fears!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p34" pid="hMSNxO0pyUqKRn2lbuy1Pg" hash="ieKvvg">And then my favorite part of the letter: “For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 1:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p35" pid="EN1aEpB0JE-mi3AO4s8VKw" hash="PPtAcw">Are those just the things you want when you are fearful—power, love, the ability to think clearly?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p36" pid="UgNM_Umin0icWTFd7P3npA" hash="9O2ZVQ">Paul ends one of his letters: “All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/titus/3.15" class="scriptureRef">Titus 3:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/fear.p37" pid="jIMRcAnq3kqDUGFjq_aMfw" hash="xhlPwg">All that are with me salute you. We love you and are aware of your fears and your faith. I bear you my witness that Jesus Christ is our Savior, that he loves me, that he loves each of you, and that he will help us to replace our fears with faith. I say these things in his name, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/ward-and-branch-families-part-of-heavenly-fathers-plan-for-us.p1" pid="9Soipm891EaePm7Tb1N9Ag" hash="SMQzkg">It is good to gather in this inspiring setting in the presence of thousands and thousands who are brought together through the satellite network. I believe that Heavenly Father recognized that even though our relationship with him and our accountability to him are intensely personal, we gather strength when we meet in groups. We need to be reminded often that we are a part of something big and grand as we continue to do our own part. Each Sunday in gatherings around the world, young women stand and say aloud together: not “<span class="emphasis">I</span>” but “<span class="emphasis">We</span> are daughters of <span class="emphasis">our</span> Heavenly Father who loves <span class="emphasis">us,</span> and <span class="emphasis">we</span> love him. <span class="emphasis">We</span> will ‘stand as witnesses’ … ” and so on (Young Women Theme; emphasis added).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/ward-and-branch-families-part-of-heavenly-fathers-plan-for-us.p2" pid="N6Lq-8A620GOKcHtQurZjQ" hash="EqQxMw">Learning in groups is so important that Heavenly Father planned for us to be born into a group—the most basic, most hallowed, and most powerful group on earth: the family. We have heard good counsel about the family in these past two days. I would like to build on that by talking about the <span class="emphasis">ward</span> or <span class="emphasis">branch</span> family—the basic ecclesiastical unit to which we all belong as members of the Church of Jesus Christ. For simplicity this afternoon, I will use the word <span class="emphasis">ward</span> to include both wards and branches, since they both serve the same purposes. Wards are not designed to replace the family unit, but to support the family and its righteous teachings. A ward is another place where there is enough commitment and energy to form a sort of “safety net” family for each of us when our families cannot or do not provide all of the teaching and growing experiences we need to return to Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/ward-and-branch-families-part-of-heavenly-fathers-plan-for-us.p3" pid="1j4raNZiAEer0ITyQWGYCQ" hash="YK_a_Q">It is my desire and prayer that during the next few minutes we will expand our appreciation of the power of the ward family and renew our commitment to participate positively in that community of Saints.</p>

In a ward, as in a family, every person is different and valuable. Paul said:</p>

As he moved rather energetically down the hall, at least five people called him by name—teenagers, children, adults. “Hi, Benjamin,” “Hey, Benjamin,” “Morning, Benjamin.” My heart overflowed with gratitude that Benjamin is learning that he, as an individual, belongs to a ward family. Over a lifetime, ward families will do for him what his family alone cannot do.</p>

Hales asked adult members to “learn the names of the young people in [their] ward or branch and call them by name” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1992, p. 80). Now, I would enlarge her invitation, inviting you young men and young women to learn the names of the adults and the children. Overcome your natural timidity and greet as many people as you can by name each week. Our wards will be better places if, like Benjamin, everyone hears his own name four or five times between the chapel and the classroom. We can each help that to happen.</p>

        <span class="strong">Next, ward families provide the reassurance of listening ears.</span> Someone has said that people would rather be understood than be loved. In truth, the surest way to increase our love for someone is to listen with patience and respect. I believe that our baptismal covenant demands this. How can we “mourn with those that mourn” and “bear one another’s burdens” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:8–9</a>) if we don’t listen to know what those burdens are?</p>

Talking itself is a sorting and learning process. We feel such comfort when others listen with the understanding that our words are not our final statement, but a wondering and wandering process used to reach a clearer understanding.</p>

They encouraged mutual murmuring. When fellow ward members complain, blame others, and repeat negative tales, it takes self-discipline to stop ourselves from adding more fuel to their fire of disgruntlement. Mutual murmuring is a smoldering fire that can burst into flame and destroy a ward.</p>

        <span class="strong">Third, ward families provide encouragement.</span> Becky and Danny’s second child was born prematurely. Recounting the days, then weeks and years, of caring for a critically ill child, Becky says, “It was difficult for my mother to watch us dealing with this situation. She wished that she could take it away from me. We were living in a distant state, and Mother would call me on the phone and feel so helpless as she listened to our daily struggles. One day she said to me, ‘Becky, I don’t know how you will get through this, but I am confident that you can.’ That encouragement was a turning point for me.”</p>

As they came into the playroom, she said, “I don’t know the rules or how to play.” “Oh, it’s not hard at all,” he beamed confidently. “I just stand right here and throw the darts, and you stand over there and say, ‘Wonderful! Wonderful!’” Pretty easy rules to remember, aren’t they?</p>

We can make life less difficult for each other as we make our wards emotionally safer places: by being kind, accepting, tolerant, supportive, and positive. Those of us who teach children and youth have a special responsibility to insist—in respectful and kind ways—that class members use language and behavior which shows respect for others. No one should be belittled or made to feel less than he is within the walls of a Church classroom.</p>

        <span class="strong">Ward families are a refuge.</span> I know a young family that lived in south Los Angeles during the violent summer of 1992. They could feel the heat from the fires as they sat terrified in their little apartment. They telephoned their parents in Salt Lake. Their families offered encouragement and their prayers. They could do no more at such a distance. It was a ward member who made arrangements for the Parkins to get themselves and their baby out safely. They stayed with members until they could go back to their apartment. They were safe.</p>

The people were friendly, but I was shy by nature and struggled to feel comfortable. One Sunday morning as I stood up from the bench at the back of the chapel and turned to go to Sunday School, a member of the bishopric greeted me with a smile and a handshake. Brother Goates was one of many who had extended themselves in becoming acquainted with us. As he shook my hand, he said, “Virginia, get off the back row and quit thinking about yourself!”</p>

Paradoxically, as we concentrate on the needs of others, our own needs become less controlling.</p>

        <span class="strong">Ward families provide a laboratory to learn and practice the gospel.</span> A CTR B teacher taught a lesson on fasting. After talking with their parents, she arranged for the children to visit Brother Dibble, a ward member who was very ill. As they visited, Sister McRae explained that their class had learned in Primary about fasting. Most of the children had never fasted before, and it was their desire, as a class, to fast and pray for Brother Dibble on the following fast Sunday. With tears rolling down his cheeks, he expressed in tender words his gratitude—for them, the gospel, and the principle of fasting. On Sunday, having fasted, Sister McRae and her class members knelt together in their classroom to pray for Brother Dibble and conclude their fast.</p>

She was twelve years old and living in Brighton, England, when the missionaries taught her family the gospel. The year was 1855, and all Mary’s mother could think of was to join the other Saints in Utah.

Mary wrote: “We had to keep close to [the handcart companies] to help them if we could. We began to get short of food and our cattle gave out” (<span class="emphasis">A Believing People ,</span> ed. Richard H. Cracroft and Neal E. Lambert, Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1974, p. 144). Many died—among them Mary’s two-year-old sister, her five-year-old brother, and Edith, a baby sister born on the trail and buried in Wyoming.</p>

I want to be myself, and what I am afraid of is that I might lose them, and I don’t want to lose them. When the prophet read this scripture, it was like he knew what I was feeling.

As I sat in the service, my mind and heart raced over her years of preparation for that single event—the principles carefully taught, constantly observed, and quietly accepted, the acknowledgment of God’s hand in life events, the sweet confirmation of the Spirit as difficult, but right, choices were made. My mind recalled the past and rejoiced in the present, and I couldn’t help but anticipate the future. I hoped with all my heart that this good woman would remain actively connected to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for the rest of her life—that she would continue to learn and live the gospel and experience the fulness of its blessings.</p>

And then I think of the rest of us, the roughly nine million who have stepped into the waters of baptism sometime in the past. Though our stories are individual, each of us came to that ordinance having been taught the true doctrines of the kingdom, having felt the Spirit, having understood how the doctrines fit into the context of our lives, and having demonstrated a willingness to try always to live those truths.</p>

Some of us will leave for a time and find our way back with a heightened sense of gratitude for participation in the kingdom of God on earth. The reality of life is that each of us is daily at risk for drifting or even marching into inactivity.</p>

This morning I would like to talk about just one of them. I would like to suggest that the ordinary Church classroom is a powerful setting for steady and continued growth in the gospel.</p>

But each class is part of a plan for lifelong gospel learning. We can have great expectations for the power of those learning hours! Church classes provide a place where we can repeatedly experience the very things that brought us into the waters of baptism, where we learn doctrine and receive the ratifying witness of its truth, where we come to understand how doctrine is applied in the reality of our daily lives and accept the challenge to change our behavior accordingly.</p>

These truths are what brought us into the Church. If we fail to continue learning them, we may not stay. “You shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom … that ye may be prepared in all things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Teachers can prayerfully make adaptations, always taking care that the learning activities chosen truly reflect the doctrine.</p>

It is to invite the Spirit and use techniques which will enhance the possibility that the learner will discover the truth for herself and then be motivated to apply it. Although some seem to be born teachers, teaching skills can successfully be learned. Where can you go as a teacher to enhance your skills? Could you watch and learn from others? Perhaps approach an admired teacher, asking him to observe and offer suggestions? What about your Primary presidency, if you are a Primary teacher, or your Sunday School presidency, if you teach Sunday School? Asking your ward teacher development coordinator for regular and specific help would put you in touch with a multitude of resources.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> We don’t have to struggle alone in this Church. There is help everywhere. We can prayerfully and courageously seek to learn and practice new techniques.</p>

His story of activity, complete inactivity, and a return to activity included the description of two classrooms. He said: “When I was about 15, I started to have a lot of questions about the Church. I thought maybe there would be a chance to talk about my questions at church, but it didn’t happen. In priesthood it seemed like most of the time everybody talked about the game the night before. Sunday School was about the same—maybe a little lesson thrown in during the last five minutes where the teacher asked questions, and it was kind of ‘guess-the-right-answer-from-the-manual-time.’”</p>

Several years passed by until he found himself in church again. This time his face lit up as he described his Sunday School class:</p>

He didn’t waste a minute. He asked important questions. Everyone had their scriptures. They looked up verses. Shared ideas. They listened to each other. They talked about problems at school and how they fit in with the lesson. You could tell that the people in the class were all different, but they had one amazing thing in common—they were all interested in learning the gospel. After five minutes, I knew that this was a good place for me.”</p>

Can you imagine hundreds of thousands of classrooms every Sunday, each with a teacher who understands that “the learning has to be done by the pupil. Therefore it is the pupil who has to be put into action. When a teacher takes the spotlight, becomes the star of the show, does all the talking, and otherwise takes over all of the activity, it is almost certain that he is interfering with the learning of the class members.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

This means that each person’s questions and contributions are respected. When we feel safe and included, we can ask questions that will help us to understand the gospel. We can share insights and faith that might help someone else.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> We can stumble without embarrassment as we try to apply the lessons taught. Conversely, when we feel that we must protect and defend ourselves or seem more righteous than we are, our energy is used counterproductively and our learning and the learning of others is severely limited. Maintaining a climate of trust and safety is a responsibility the teacher and the learners share.</p>

Mostly they walked and walked and walked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/keep-walking-and-give-time-a-chance.p3" pid="SBAWeZovJE6RD1rsBypqEw" hash="IVFP7w">When the pioneers broke camp each morning, the cattle had to be fed and watered, fires built, breakfasts cooked, a cold meal for noon prepared and packed, repairs made, teams hitched, and wagons reloaded. Every single morning. Then they walked about six miles before halting to feed and water cattle, eat lunch, regroup, and walk again until about 6:00 <small>P.M.</small> Then the routine of unhitching and watering teams, making repairs, gathering tinder, building fires, cooking supper, a line or two in a journal before dark, sometimes a little music, prayers, and bed at 9:00 <small>P.M.</small></p>

Because the pace was set by slow-moving oxen, no one had to run to keep up with the wagons. On a good day, on a no-problem day (is there ever such a thing?), the pioneers covered about 15 miles. Usually it was less than 10. Imagine how puny that seemed compared to their ultimate goal of 1,300 miles!</p>

She did this because her small child wouldn’t stay in the wagon unless he could see his mother’s hand. Even as they walked forward, those pioneers knew how to help one another.</p>

I believe it has everything to do with us. Most of our lives are not a string of dramatic moments that call for immediate heroism and courage. Most of our lives, rather, consist of daily routines, even monotonous tasks, that wear us down and leave us vulnerable to discouragement. Sure, we know where we’re going, and if it were possible we would choose to jump out of bed, work like crazy, and be there by nightfall. But our goal, our journey’s end, our Zion is life in the presence of our Heavenly Father. And to get there we are expected to walk and walk and walk.</p>

The pioneer steadiness, the plain, old, hard work of it all, their willingness to move inch by inch, step by step toward the promised land inspire me as much as their more obvious acts of courage. It is so difficult to keep believing that we are making progress when we are moving at such a pace—to keep believing in the future when the mileage of the day is so minuscule.</p>

Do you see the significance of doing your homework every day and recognize the courage displayed in asking for help when you don’t understand an assignment? Do you see the heroism in going to church every single Sunday, participating in class, and being friendly to others? Do you see the greatness in doing the dishes over and over and over? Or practicing the piano? Or tending children? Do you recognize the fortitude and belief in the journey’s end that are required in order to keep saying your prayers every day and keep reading the scriptures? Do you see the magnificence in giving time a chance to whittle your problems down to a manageable size?</p>

Well, maybe not <span class="emphasis">every</span> minute of <span class="emphasis">every</span> day. Certainly we are sad and even angry at times. But we can make a decision to refrain from wallowing in our sadness or anger. One young woman wrote to our office: “I just love being 14. I wish I could stay 14 for a long time. Fourteen is soooooooooo fun!” Those short sentences brightened my day. “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/17.22" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 17:22</a>).</p>

Laboratory scientists have carefully chronicled its life cycle. An egg is laid at just the right spot on the food plant. Within five days it hatches and grows into a black caterpillar with yellow-orange dots. When mature, the caterpillar creates its own chrysalis. Most emerge after two years. But some—and this is the interesting observation—have been known to remain in the chrysalis for up to seven years. Then, unexpectedly, within a few short hours the once-spotted caterpillar emerges as a gorgeous black butterfly and takes flight.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Did this caterpillar become a butterfly in a few short hours or in seven years?</p>
