      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p1" pid="1_GZczQqmku8cIBGOOGHSQ" hash="-QbuyA">Since I was called just six months ago, I have felt a deep, God-given love for you, my dear sisters. My great desire for young women everywhere is that you know that you are loved—not only by me, but also by your parents and leaders, and especially by your Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p2" pid="JP4_KxnmLEWRQfstG9-ylw" hash="FS_zdA">Sometimes it is hard to feel this love. A young woman I know looked like she had everything going for her. She had just won a student-body election, she had auditioned for the madrigal choir and made it, and she had been chosen as the junior prom queen. She went home from school one day and threw herself on her bed in tears. Her mother asked what was wrong, and the daughter blurted out, “I feel like a failure; nobody likes me; I don’t have any talents; I can’t keep up in my classes; and besides that, I’m ugly.” No one would suspect that she was feeling insecure, lonely, and inadequate; but most teens feel this way at one time or another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p3" pid="DsYQCe-_MkOPfPRPvMo7Gg" hash="vlBndg">And some young people suffer even more obvious hardships. For example, among the young women I know, one girl has a mother who is dying of cancer. One has divorced parents. One girl stays home alone on weekends while all her friends go out drinking. One young woman was in a debilitating accident. One girl’s father has been deployed for military service. One good sister worries about her wayward brother.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p4" pid="cs7IgsENDU2Prc0IJT6PEQ" hash="NmdNxA">What can help the youth with these diverse and monumental problems? The Mutual theme this year, which is our focus tonight, provides an answer. It says, “Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>). I love this scripture. It describes <span class="emphasis">how</span> we should face life’s challenges. When I press forward with hope and love, I also <span class="emphasis">feel</span> hope and love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p5" pid="MNU1LzkFFkCmUvallKRmPQ" hash="b3b_DA">To be steadfast in Christ implies keeping covenants. Each week we renew our baptismal covenants to take His name upon us, to “always remember him,” and to “keep his commandments” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>). We are steadfast in Christ when we do these things, and our spirits are lifted and our hearts are filled with love. Simply stated, when I keep my covenants, I feel hope and I feel love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p6" pid="arkhV5nCjkaOfJkyHhVhcg" hash="ejfrlA">My young friend whom I’ll call Lindsey needed hope. She lived in a home which was devoid of the Spirit and of love. Her friends were wild, and even most of her Young Women leaders looked on her only as a “project.” But deep inside she felt that the Lord loved her, despite her deplorable situation. She focused on always remembering Him. She chose not to participate with her friends when they did bad things. She tried to worship Heavenly Father in the privacy of her own bedroom because she wanted to feel His Spirit in her life. Something in her wanted to be good, to keep His commandments. Even with her limited knowledge and lack of outside help, she was trying to keep her baptismal covenants. She felt hope to carry on, and she felt love from Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p7" pid="u03k5FhyUU-5eTckZVmn8g" hash="TGHLLg">The Lord has promised us that He will not forget us because He has “graven [us] upon the palms of [His] hands” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/49.16" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 49:16</a>). And our promise to Him is that we will not forget Him, for we have engraven Him in our hearts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p8" pid="hUi_DTk8Gk6KBunyQDQ58Q" hash="V5E_cg">The early Saints were taught this in their sufferings in Missouri. The Lord counseled them to wait “patiently on the Lord, for your prayers have entered into the ears of the Lord. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p9" pid="I3-Z2C2LQ0ygnC2Se7c7Ug" hash="xpQPag">“Therefore, he giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable covenant that they shall be fulfilled; and all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.2-3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 98:2–3</a>). This promise didn’t remove their trials, but it did comfort them, giving them hope for the future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p10" pid="3so7XBONVU-XKsVKtOrZaA" hash="OSUZLQ">Likewise, Abraham pressed forward steadfastly, clinging to promises God had made him. Each time I read about Abraham’s walk to Mount Moriah to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice, I feel anxious for him. He did not know the outcome of that test as we know it from a historical perspective. He was walking into the unknown. Still he was steadfast. He was living on promises that the Lord would bless him. Whatever nervousness he may have felt didn’t deter him from pressing forward with a steadfastness in Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p11" pid="Q4fcs6u7BUGZJNPj4Aa6fQ" hash="F0O7Xg">Like the Saints in Missouri, Lindsey knew that in spite of her deplorable conditions, Heavenly Father hadn’t given up on her. His love was firm. She took comfort in the “immutable covenant” of His love—that “all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 98:3</a>). As with Abraham, hers was not an easy path to walk, yet she pressed forward. As she did so, she found help. One special Church leader loved and guided her. She grew closer to Heavenly Father and eventually found a young man who loved her, taught her much about the gospel, and married her.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p12" pid="86_uvkC3T0a44lfMWbyflg" hash="JdlDhQ">At last many of the blessings she had longed for earlier in life were poured out upon her. She found she could have the Spirit in her own family and raise righteous children. Where once she was isolated and neglected, she now feels enveloped by love. This has come from pressing forward while waiting patiently on the Lord. Being steadfast in Christ brought hope to Lindsey as it will to each of us as we struggle with life’s challenges. The words the choir sings tonight will encourage us to come unto Him:</p>

The Lord teaches in Jeremiah, “This shall be the covenant that I will make; … I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/31.33" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 31:33</a>). Covenants enlarge our hearts and allow us to feel the “love of God and of all men” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>). Remember, when we keep our covenants, we feel hope, and we feel love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p14" pid="41DAcTq43UC4uzEtXombKg" hash="8Y8D1g">Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount the virtues of the heart such as love, forgiveness, and compassion. He taught us as His disciples to take His name and character upon us. This changes our hearts and blesses our relationships with others. Elder Marvin J. Ashton said, “When we truly become converted to Jesus Christ, committed to Him, an interesting thing happens: our attention turns to the welfare of our fellowman, and the way we treat others becomes increasingly filled with patience, kindness, [and] a gentle acceptance” (“The Tongue Can Be a Sharp Sword,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1992, 20).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p15" pid="DGCQ8rzFg0qFeqho7cYieQ" hash="nS3TZw">Could you be more steadfast in Christ in your own homes, with your own family members? When you promise to take His name and characteristics upon you, it means you should speak a little softer, act a little kinder, serve your siblings more selflessly, and appreciate and help your parents more openly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p16" pid="BAgHCnjWeUiYKinG2pm2mQ" hash="Zysw3w">Our son did this long ago on a family trip. We had traveled many miles to see a beautiful castle. By the time we finally arrived, one of our younger daughters was tired and cross. She refused to get out of the car to take the short hike to the site we had come so far to see. Most of us felt impatient with her. But with gentleness our 14-year-old son lifted her on his back and carried her to the castle. That tense moment was softened by his quiet expression of love. That now lives in each of our memories more than the view of the castle.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p17" pid="vM_LPEnfIUqAcvK-gXChqg" hash="i8aySQ">Sometimes it is hardest in our own homes to be our best selves. It requires that diligent effort of “pressing forward.” But when you keep your covenants, you will learn to more fully love those to whom you are eternally bound. Then you will also be able to extend your love beyond that circle to others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p18" pid="Retgq1d5YkupNwaUW8FBbg" hash="kZTx2Q">A number of years ago our family lived in Brazil for a short while. Two weeks before we were supposed to return home, we were in an auto accident. As we drove home in pouring rain from sacrament meeting, we entered a neighborhood intersection. A car pulled out from behind a parked vehicle and hit us broadside. Fortunately no one in either of the cars was injured, but the automobiles were both quite badly dented. As my husband, John, got out to discuss our plight with the other driver, I kept reminding him that it was not our fault. Soon he returned to the car and slowly drove back to the little farmhouse where we were living, with metal grinding against the tires on every rotation. The other car followed. All John said was, “I’ll explain later.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p19" pid="WwBwngk7JEi9i4kTmFdJMQ" hash="eqjXHw">When we got home, John found our little envelope of emergency cash, and he paid the family to get their car repaired. They happily left. I was astonished. Then John gathered our family together. He was somewhat apologetic as he explained his actions. “I know this accident was not our fault, but as I was negotiating with this family, the only thought in my head was that only a little over an hour ago I had covenanted with Heavenly Father to always act as He would. I knew that if He were standing in my position, He would have had compassion on this family and would have done all He could to help them.” What an exemplary husband and father! He had remembered his covenants. Acting with Christlike love, he had softened hearts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p20" pid="uoxbuw9YykKowQ_-nEF06w" hash="-K3psQ">I testify to you that when I remember my covenants each day, I do feel hope and I feel love. I know that being steadfast in Christ brings a perfect brightness of hope to me and a love of God and all men to my heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/steadfast-in-our-covenants.p21" pid="o_bNpnIASkWAdSANzUHvCw" hash="jZKjLQ">“What does the Father ask of us? What do the scriptures say? Have faith, have hope, live like his Son, help others on their way” (“He Sent His Son,” <span class="emphasis">Children’s Songbook,</span> 35; <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Apr. 1992, F11). I pray that each of us will come unto Him for hope and follow His example of love, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p1" pid="vpm9DH3KRkqdvcrqAHlojA" hash="QlNwLA">Almost three years ago, one of our daughters got married and immediately left with her husband for medical school in a distant city. She was leaving the security of the nest to begin a family of her own. I wondered: “Did I teach her everything she needs to know? Does she know what is most important in this life? Is she prepared to build a happy home?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p2" pid="1O4cd1ArX0mTq_hgjcGeIw" hash="FcHfWQ">As I watched her drive away, I remembered a little journal I gave her on her 17th birthday. It was entitled “Did I Tell You … ?” In it, I recorded counsel I had often given her in our late-night conversations. As she and her new husband headed for their life together, I thought of three additional entries I wanted to add to that little journal to help her make a transition more important and challenging than that of crossing the country: the transition to starting her own home and family. Let me share these entries to her and to all young people in the Church, to teach and testify of the importance of family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p3" pid="QsBoM2_hzUaZ5Dg8kySy5g" hash="W-S93Q">First, did I tell you … how to make your home a haven of peace and a fortress of strength? You should follow the pattern you witnessed as you entered the Lord’s house, to “establish a house … of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, … a house of order” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 109:8</a>). As we follow this pattern, great peace will dwell within our homes in a world of increasing turmoil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p4" pid="HltdsT2pDU-d_eSkeFNhPw" hash="XNM_pw">Look to the example of your grandparents’ homes. Both sets of grandparents brought up their “children in light and truth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.40" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:40</a>). Dad’s home was a house of learning. He said at his father’s funeral that he had never learned a gospel principle at a Church meeting that he hadn’t already learned in his own home. The Church was a supplement to his home. My home was a house of order. It was of utmost importance (in spite of many hectic schedules) for us to be together for breakfast and dinner. Mealtime meant more than just refueling. It was a crucial time for nourishing spirits as well as bodies.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p5" pid="K9Wixic32EqWRJ4LQ-rcyw" hash="2AXEOQ">Small things make a happy home—things like praying, saying “I’m sorry,” expressing gratitude, reading a good book together. Remember how we laughed and cried as we built the backyard fence? Remember how every time we drove in the car we sang so we wouldn’t quarrel? Remember how we fasted for one member’s important decision and for another’s crucial test? The family proclamation reiterates this: “Successful … families are established … on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome … activities” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102; <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Oct. 1998, 24).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p6" pid="PPsM2P50uk6Y5WjSwzQ7jA" hash="nB7OiA">In your youth, you formed habits of praying and reading scriptures. Capitalize on those habits as well as the skills you learned of cooking and budgeting. With your righteous desires and your homemaking abilities, you will build a home that is a haven of peace and a fortress of strength.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p7" pid="5xnE6AW2YU2B_v7Gw5dtqg" hash="p9Vslw">Next, did I tell you … that “children are an heritage of the Lord”? (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/127.3" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 127:3</a>). The family proclamation declares, “God’s commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102; <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Oct. 1998, 24). We hope Heavenly Father will bless you with children. Many in the world miss the joy and see children only as an inconvenience. It is true that parenting is physically exhausting, emotionally draining, and mentally demanding. No one will give you good grades or blue ribbons for what you do as a mother. Sometimes you might wonder, “Did I do this right? Is it all worth it?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p8" pid="yOHTWc1fcUadC28wKvXONA" hash="kBhrsA">It is worth it! All latter-day prophets have borne witness to the sacred role of motherhood. President Spencer W. Kimball said, “It is important for you Latter-day Saint women to understand that the Lord holds motherhood and mothers sacred and in the highest esteem” (“Privileges and Responsibilities of Sisters,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1978, 105). The Spirit testifies to my soul that this is true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p9" pid="Bu1jDRxXWUyPtEJxwaGFVQ" hash="8vIboA">You will come to know, as I do, that parenting is not only challenging, but it provides life’s greatest joys. Joy comes when at family home evening a five-year-old tells a scripture story with complete and correct details or when a child reads the Book of Mormon faithfully every night. I feel joy when my cheerleader has the courage to tell her squad that the new cheer they are learning has inappropriate actions in it, and when a missionary daughter writes of her testimony of the gospel. Joy comes as I watch a daughter read to a blind woman and a son serve in the temple. In these moments, I feel as John the Beloved: “I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/3-jn/1.4" class="scriptureRef">3 Jn. 1:4</a>). Did I tell you … that to the very depths of my being, I love being a mother?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p10" pid="d2FiDnCFHkGZHlytmva4-Q" hash="qwmAxQ">Finally, did I tell you … that love is the foundational virtue in building a strong home? Our Father in Heaven exemplifies the pattern we should follow. He loves us, teaches us, is patient with us, and entrusts us with our agency. President Hinckley said: “Love can make the difference—love generously given in childhood and reaching through the awkward years of youth … and encouragement that is quick to compliment and slow to criticize” (“Bring Up a Child in the Way He Should Go,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1993, 60). Sometimes discipline, which means “to teach,” is confused with criticism. Children—as well as people of all ages—improve behavior from love and encouragement more than from fault-finding.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p11" pid="YnLMCuM_50CfHmr1hM9MUQ" hash="FebRGQ">When a young man I know had a long hippie hairstyle during his teens, his parents chose to concentrate instead on his good work ethic and his kindness to needy people. Eventually he himself chose to cut his hair. He went on to get a good education, serve in the Church, and follow in his own family this pattern of loving children into doing what is right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p12" pid="E7kzS_mZTke5i4-EVa9zFQ" hash="EYmFtg">We demonstrate our love for family members not only in teaching them affirmatively but also in giving them of our time. Some time ago I read an article called “Putting Children Last,” which told about parents who talk about their children in “appointment book” terms: 15 minutes at night when possible, regularly scheduled play time once a week, and so on (see Mary Eberstadt, <span class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal,</span> 2 May 1995). Contrast that with the mother who vowed to give her children not just quality time but quantity time. She recognized that a loving relationship requires constant and ongoing talking, playing, laughing, and working moments. I, too, believe that parents and children need to participate in each other’s everyday, ordinary experiences. So I know about your upcoming test; you know about my lesson preparation. I attend your games; you join me in the kitchen for dinner preparation. We are major players in each other’s lives, absorbing love through daily experiences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p13" pid="Sw33wsftY0aD4c58Dg2pUw" hash="dKzgDQ">And love endures through the hardships of life. The Apostle Paul taught, “Charity suffereth long. … [It] beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.4,7,8" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13:4, 7, 8</a>). I watched a mother’s enduring love for her alcoholic son. She never gave up praying for him and being available for him. In his later years, he finally “came to himself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.17" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:17</a>), kept a respectable job, and used his mechanical skills to fix up his mother’s house.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p14" pid="FQyIJGd7ikaj-2IzWbnJiQ" hash="RAE01Q">Many families struggle with wayward children. We can take comfort in “the eternal sealings of faithful parents” which will draw children “back to the fold” (Orson F. Whitney, in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, 110). We must never give up loving them, praying for them, and trusting in our Heavenly Father’s care.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/did-i-tell-you.p15" pid="QbwIBeNJGUSTjkMCUWf0Eg" hash="WXQ64g">So to my daughter, and to all young people in the Church, as you make the transition to this new phase in your life, I tell you these things. I testify that in the eternal scheme of things, the most crucial and fulfilling thing you will do is to build a holy home and rear a strong family in love. This family unit will bless society and endure through eternity. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

But I can hardly stand it if a novel gets too intense—if the hero’s life is too dangerous or sad or complicated. So I have to read ahead to the end just to make sure that everything will turn out all right for the main character.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p2" pid="YAqhUNzgiEKuG_iV6xg0yQ" hash="BIXlPw">In a sense all of us are in the middle of our own novels, our own life stories. Sometimes our stories feel very intense, and we would like to read ahead to know our own end, to make sure that everything is going to turn out all right. While we don’t know the particular details of our life’s experiences, fortunately we do know something about our futures, if we live worthily.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/04/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p3" pid="qk_QMTPtgEe7pjJKr0MgMg" hash="q2Rtlg">We are given this insight in Doctrine and Covenants 90:24 [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 90:24</a>]: “Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly.” This stunning promise from the Lord that all things shall work together for our good is repeated many times in the scriptures, particularly to people or prophets who are suffering through the trials of their own life stories.</p>

Knowing that eventually all things will work together for our good will help us endure affliction like the faithful people from the scriptures who knew of His promises and trusted in them, “having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.13" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:13</a>). We too can embrace this promise.</p>

Other times we plead for years before we see the desired promises fulfilled. Sometimes, as with faithful Abraham, we may embrace the promises but die “in faith, not having received the promises” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.13" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:13</a>) while on earth. While it may be true in some instances that our promised blessings will be fulfilled only in the eternities, it is also true that as we search, pray, and believe, we will often recognize things working together for our good in this life.</p>

But they lived with courage and faith. They knew that ultimately all things would work together for their good. They also knew that through interim blessings and miracles, things were working out. They were sustained, tutored, and protected. They embraced the promises not only afar off but here and now as well.</p>

His fellow Apostle James had just been killed, and now Peter was thrown into jail, carefully guarded by 16 men. I wonder if he felt like the Prophet Joseph Smith felt as he suffered in Liberty Jail. It was while Joseph was there that the Lord promised him that “all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:7</a>). It might be hard to believe in this promise in the midst of such trials, but Peter, like Joseph, was blessed by the Lord.</p>

Then something wonderful happened. During the night when Peter was sleeping between two soldiers and was bound with two chains, an angel of the Lord “came upon him” and “raised him up,” and “his chains fell off from his hands.” Peter wondered if he were in a dream. He followed the angel past the guards through an iron gate and out to a city street, “and forthwith the angel departed from him.” Peter then realized it was not a dream. He had been miraculously delivered. The Lord was blessing him right then.</p>

When Peter knocked, a young woman (just like you young women) named Rhoda came to the gate. She heard and recognized Peter’s voice. The scriptures say she was glad. But in her excitement she forgot to let him in. Instead, she ran back to share with the others the great news that Peter stood at the gate. They didn’t believe her and argued with her, saying she didn’t know what she was talking about. Meanwhile Peter still knocked and waited. When they finally came to him, “they were astonished” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/12.4-17" class="scriptureRef">Acts 12:4–17</a>).</p>

They were surprised at the Lord’s goodness in His miraculous response. Do we recognize the fulfilling of promises in our lives? As the Savior asked, “Having eyes, see ye not?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/8.18" class="scriptureRef">Mark 8:18</a>). Do we have eyes to see?</p>

As with Peter there will be “angels round about you, to bear you up” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:88</a>). They will sustain us as we carry our earthly burdens. Often in our lives, those angels are the people around us, the people who love us, those who allow themselves to be instruments in the Lord’s hands. President Spencer W. Kimball said: “God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom” (“There Is Purpose in Life,” <span class="emphasis">New Era,</span> Sept. 1974, 5).</p>

They worked hard to be His instruments and His hands (quite literally) in helping this young woman. A miracle swept over their entire ward as they became the angels that would bear up Alexis, the new Beehive.</p>

Mom always comes with me to sign for me because I am deaf. After the opening prayer and song, Sister Hoskin, my Young Women president, said, ‘Alexis, we have a gift for you.’ Then all the girls stood up and started signing something. I knew it was special. Later I learned it was the Young Women theme. All the girls in our ward had learned it to surprise me.</p>

Alexis is hearing impaired, and I worried about how I could help her fit in and show her that she was one of us. After being troubled for many days and after many prayers, I woke in the middle of the night from a dream where I saw my group of young women standing together, doing the Young Women theme in sign language. I knew the answer to my prayers.</p>

It took hours—one entire night of Mutual, then weekly practices before we were ready. When Alexis’s birthday came, everyone was excited and nervous about our surprise. I pulled Alexis and her mom in front of the girls and said (signing to Alexis), ‘We have a gift for you. Now you are one of us.’ Then we stood and repeated the theme and did it in sign language. The Spirit was so strong, and there weren’t many voices because we were all crying, but the girls did a beautiful job. Alexis was beaming. She knew she was one of us.</p>

Because she is deaf, I am often at her side interpreting for her. You can imagine the feelings that flooded through me as the young women all began to sign the Young Women theme for her. As I stood there watching with tears in my eyes, the verse that ran through my mind was from Matthew 25:40 [<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>]: ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.’</p>

The Laurel class president related that learning the theme in sign language was hard work, but they felt the Spirit helping them in this effort. She said, “We did not rush through the theme just to say it like usual. We thought about the words and signed it for someone else so that [she] could know the words too, and that made me happy to know that she could understand our theme and know that she was a daughter of God too.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/glad-tidings-from-cumorah.p1" pid="JxE3HhhG5kGbgyOu-GeWHg" hash="pDKdzw">As I visited Joseph Smith’s restored small and humble log home, I sensed that I was in a holy place. I was at the site where the angel Moroni first appeared to Joseph Smith to usher in this great and marvelous work of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. While contemplating the intertwined lives of these two great prophets—Moroni, the last prophet of his age, and Joseph, the first prophet of our dispensation—I have had numerous “likening” moments. Let me share some “likening” lessons as I bear testimony of this great and marvelous work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/glad-tidings-from-cumorah.p2" pid="HzCT9OFUs0G5aTvFE3-Jpw" hash="6UWloA">When Joseph first met Moroni, he was just 17, the age of many of you young women. We know the very time and place. It was on the night of September 21, 1823, in an upstairs bedroom while five of his brothers slept. Joseph prayed that he “might know of [his] state and standing before [God]” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.29" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:29</a>). Joseph felt inadequate and unworthy before God. He said he had not been “guilty of any great or malignant sins,” but had fallen into “foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of youth” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.28" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:28</a>), so he prayed for reassurance. I can identify with young Joseph’s feelings, as I know many of you can. How often have each of us fallen to our knees with such feelings of inadequacy and need for divine reassurance?</p>

Joseph records that “he called me by name, and said … that God had a work for me to do” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.33" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:33</a>).

That first day, Moroni repeated the same message over and over again. Can you liken this to anything you experience? My children sometimes tease me that I tell them the same things over and over again. Don’t be too hard on your parents and leaders when we repeat ourselves. The Lord had Moroni teach a young prophet through repetition. Repetition ingrains gospel principles in our minds and hearts.</p>

I believe that we should nurture love for the prophets, both ancient and modern, in our hearts as well. How fitting that a statue depicting the angel Moroni sits atop most of our modern temples. These serve as reminders that Moroni is that glorious “angel from on high [who] / The long, long silence broke” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 13), about whom our choir will sing tonight.</p>

Then in the safety and sanctity of that log home where Moroni appeared, Joseph shared much of what he had learned with his receptive family. His mother said:</p>

What a model young Joseph is for us of strengthening home and family! He did not keep his testimony and spiritual experiences to himself but shared them often with his parents and siblings. We can do the same in our homes.</p>

Perhaps Moroni’s teachings and example helped the Prophet Joseph learn how to stand as a witness in a wicked world. Moroni lived in the kind of world he predicted would exist in modern times—“a day when there shall be … murders, and robbing, and lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all manner of abominations” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.31" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:31</a>).</p>

After a great and tremendous battle between the Nephites and the Lamanites where all of his people were destroyed, he lamented: “I am alone. My father hath been slain in battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and how long the Lord will suffer that I may live I know not” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.5" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:5</a>).

Some of us feel we have not “whither to go” as we face our trials. But you and I can not only survive but prevail, as did Moroni, in our efforts to stand for truth in perilous times. What did he do when facing a lonely and hostile world? He, in faithful obedience to his father’s direction, finished the record on the gold plates. He became familiar with the writings of the prophets. Above all, he fought his way out of his discouragement by clinging to the Lord’s promises for the future. He clung to the covenants that God had made with the house of Israel to bless them forever.</p>

Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained that this joyful anticipation of past prophets, including Moroni, was because they had seen our day in vision. They saw strong, covenant-keeping young people like you who would carry out the Lord’s work in this final dispensation. Elder Holland said, “The leaders in those ages past, were able to keep going, … not because they knew that <span class="emphasis">they</span> would succeed but because they knew that <span class="emphasis">you</span> would … a magnificent congregation of young [women] like you … in a determined effort to see the gospel prevail and triumph” (“Terror, Triumph, and a Wedding Feast,” Church Educational System fireside, Sept. 12, 2004; see <a href="http://www.ldsces.org">www.ldsces.org</a>).

While Catherine and Kimball Herrod and their four young children, ages nine months to seven years, were driving home from a family dinner at their grandparents’ place, a double wheel from a huge semitruck on the opposite side of the freeway suddenly sprang loose, flew across the median, and pounded into the driver’s side of the family van. Kimball, the driver, husband, and father, was severely injured and unconscious. Catherine somehow guided the car to the shoulder and called for emergency help. While she watched the paramedics work on her husband and two older children, she sat in a police car with her two little ones on her lap and prayed vocally, “Heavenly Father, we know that Thou hast the power to heal Kimball if it is Thy will, but if not, we have faith that somehow Thou wilt sustain us through this.” Kimball was life-flighted to the hospital, but he did not make it there alive.</p>

As difficult as it was, she declared to her parents, who were with her, “I know that Kimball and I are sealed by our temple covenants, and we will be together again someday.” In the most terrible trial of a young mother’s life, her covenants sustained her.</p>

She is perfect! I was awestruck, as I am each time a baby is born, with her fingers, toes, hair, beating heart, and her distinctive family characteristics—nose, chin, dimples. Her older brothers and sister were equally excited and fascinated by their tiny, perfect little sister. They seemed to sense a holiness in their home from the presence of a celestial spirit newly united with a pure physical body.</p>

As it states in the family proclamation: “Spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Oct. 2004, 49; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102). In fact, we “shouted for joy” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/38.7" class="scriptureRef">Job 38:7</a>) to be part of this plan.</p>

We knew that our bodies would be in the image of God. We knew that our bodies would house our spirits. We also understood that our bodies would be subject to pain, illness, disabilities, and temptation. But we were willing, even eager, to accept these challenges because we knew that only with spirit and element inseparably connected could we progress to become like our Heavenly Father (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:22</a>) and “receive a fulness of joy” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:33</a>).</p>

Joseph Smith taught: “We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the Celestial Kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The Devil has no body, and herein is his punishment” (<span class="emphasis">The Words of Joseph Smith,</span> ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook [1980], 60).</p>

Therefore he tries to do everything he can to get us to abuse or misuse this precious gift. He has filled the world with lies and deceptions about the body. He tempts many to defile this great gift of the body through unchastity, immodesty, self-indulgence, and addictions. He seduces some to despise their bodies; others he tempts to worship their bodies. In either case, he entices the world to regard the body merely as an object. In the face of so many satanic falsehoods about the body, I want to raise my voice today in support of the sanctity of the body. I testify that the body is a gift to be treated with gratitude and respect.</p>

It was Jesus Himself who first compared His body to a temple (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/2.21" class="scriptureRef">John 2:21</a>). Later Paul admonished the people of Corinth, a wicked city teeming with all manner of lasciviousness and indecency: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3.16-17" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 3:16–17</a>).</p>

The result would be a dramatic increase in chastity, modesty, observance of the Word of Wisdom, and a similar decrease in the problems of pornography and abuse, for we would regard the body, like the temple, as a sacred sanctuary of the Spirit. Just as no unclean thing may enter the temple, we would be vigilant to keep impurity of any sort from entering the temple of our bodies.</p>

Imagine the contrast and my joy when I entered a classroom of modestly and appropriately dressed young women whose countenances glowed with goodness. I thought, “Here are eight beautiful girls who know how to show respect for their bodies and who know why they are doing it.” In <span class="emphasis">For the Strength of Youth</span> it says: “Your body is God’s sacred creation. Respect it as a gift from God, and do not defile it in any way. Through your dress and appearance, you can show the Lord that you know how precious your body is. … The way you dress is a reflection of what you are on the inside” ([2001], 14–15).</p>

It describes not only the altitude of hemlines and necklines but the attitude of our hearts. The word <span class="emphasis">modesty</span> means “measured.” It is related to <span class="emphasis">moderate.</span> It implies “decency, and propriety … in thought, language, dress, and behavior” (in Daniel H.

A loving Heavenly Father has given us physical beauties and pleasures “both to please the eye and to gladden the heart” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:18</a>), but with this caution: that they are “made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:20</a>). My husband used this scripture to teach our children about the law of chastity. He said that the “word <span class="emphasis">extortion</span> … literally means to ‘twist out [or against].’ Our use of … the body must not be twisted [against] the divinely ordained purposes for which [it was] given. Physical pleasure is good in its proper time and place, but even then it must not become our god” (John S. Tanner, “The Body as a Blessing,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> July 1993, 10).</p>

Happiness comes from accepting the bodies we have been given as divine gifts and enhancing our natural attributes, not from remaking our bodies after the image of the world. The Lord wants us to be made over—but in His image, not in the image of the world, by receiving His image in our countenances (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14,19" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14, 19</a>).</p>

I tried to care for my skin properly. My parents helped me get medical attention. For years I even went without eating chocolate and all the greasy fast foods around which teens often socialize, but with no obvious healing consequences. It was difficult for me at that time to fully appreciate this body which was giving me so much grief. But my good mother taught me a higher law. Over and over she said to me, “You must do everything you can to make your appearance pleasing, but the minute you walk out the door, forget yourself and start concentrating on others.”</p>

Charity, or the pure love of Christ, “envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.45" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:45</a>). When we become other-oriented, or selfless, we develop an inner beauty of spirit that glows in our outward appearance. This is how we make ourselves in the Lord’s image rather than the world’s and receive His image in our countenances. President Hinckley spoke of this very kind of beauty that comes as we learn to respect body, mind, and spirit. He said:</p>

In the Word of Wisdom, for example, the spiritual and physical are intertwined. When we follow the Lord’s law of health for our bodies, we are also promised wisdom to our spirits and knowledge to our minds (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.19-21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 89:19–21</a>). The spiritual and physical truly are linked.</p>

She had experimented with a new sweet roll recipe. They were big and rich and yummy—and very filling. Even my teenage brothers couldn’t eat more than one. That night at family prayer my father called upon Mom to pray. She buried her head and didn’t respond. He gently prodded her, “Is something wrong?” Finally she said, “I don’t feel very spiritual tonight. I just ate three of those rich sweet rolls.” I suppose that many of us have similarly offended our spirits at times by physical indulgences. Especially substances forbidden in the Word of Wisdom have a harmful effect on our bodies and a numbing influence on our spiritual sensitivities. None of us can ignore this connection of our spirits and bodies.</p>

Some people are born with disabilities, and some suffer the pains of disease throughout their lives. All of us as we age experience our bodies gradually beginning to fail. When this happens, we long for the day when our bodies will be healed and whole. We look forward to the Resurrection that Jesus Christ made possible, when “the soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 40:23</a>). I know that through Christ we can experience a fulness of joy that is available only when spirit and element are inseparably connected (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:33</a>).</p>

We are not less but <span class="emphasis">more</span> like Heavenly Father because we are embodied. I testify that we are His children, made in His image, with the potential to become like Him. Let us treat this divine gift of the body with great care. Someday, if we are worthy, we shall receive a perfected, glorious body—pure and clean like my new little granddaughter, only inseparably bound to the spirit. And we shall shout for joy (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/job/38.7" class="scriptureRef">Job 38:7</a>) to receive this gift again for which we have longed (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.50" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 138:50</a>).

It said, “I will bring the light of the gospel into my home.” I wondered, “What is that light?” Jesus Christ Himself explained it best when He was teaching the Nephites. He said, “Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world.” Then He explained, “<span class="emphasis">I </span>am the light which ye shall hold up—that which ye have seen me do” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.24" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 18:24</a>; emphasis added).</p>

When the people desired for Him to tarry with them a little longer, He had compassion upon them and lingered with them. Then He healed them, prayed with them, taught them, wept with them, blessed their little children one by one, fed them, and administered and shared the sacrament that they might covenant to always remember Him. His ministry among them was about teaching and caring for each individual, and about completing the work His Father had commanded Him to do. There was no thought for Himself. As I learned this, there began for me a lifelong quest to bring His light into my home through selfless, Christlike acts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/i-am-the-light-which-ye-shall-hold-up.p3" uuid="dbc55091-f53e-4001-b1b8-30607934456a" pid="gnXE9ccaekSD1skqVHSnJw" hash="ZR7exg">This is not an easy task. Good home life often goes unrecognized. It might be easier to “arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the <span class="emphasis">nations</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 115:5</a>; emphasis added) rather than that your light may be a standard for <span class="emphasis">your own families.</span> Sometimes others don’t see us doing good, sharing our light in our individual homes. It is basic human nature to desire and seek praise and attention. Helaman taught his sons Nephi and Lehi to do the good works of their forefathers for whom they were named, “that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.8" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:8</a>). Good works should not be done for the purpose of receiving recognition.</p>

Mrs. Jellyby wants to make sure her good works are grandiose and visible to all. (See Charles Dickens, <span class="emphasis">Bleak House</span> [1985], 82–87.) Maybe some of us would rather help with hurricane relief than home relief. Now both are important, but home relief is our primary and eternal responsibility. “Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Oct. 2004, 49; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102).</p>

Dorothea is the heroine in one of my favorite novels, <span class="emphasis">Middlemarch.</span> She is remembered at the end of the book for her quiet, selfless deeds to family and friends. It says: “Her full nature … spent itself in channels which had no great name on the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs” (George Eliot, <span class="emphasis">Middlemarch</span> [1986], 682).</p>

When you move from that stage to young motherhood, there is a dramatic drop-off in outside commendation. Yet in no other capacity is there more opportunity to serve selflessly as Christ would do by taking care of hundreds of daily physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. You will bring the light of the gospel into your homes—not to be seen of others, but to build others—men and women of strength and light.</p>

In our homes and with our families we sometimes become our worst selves with the people who matter the most in our lives. I distinctly remember one morning when I was 14 years old. Before I left for school, I was cross and unkind with my parents and my brothers. After I left the house, I was polite with the bus driver and friendly to my peers. I felt the discrepancy of my actions, and a huge feeling of remorse came over me. I asked the teacher if I could be excused for a few minutes to call home. I apologized to my mother for my behavior and told her how much I loved and appreciated her and promised to do better at showing it.</p>

The Nephite nation had a perfect society for 200 years with “no contention in the land. … And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.15-16" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:15–16</a>).</p>

And even good families have many challenges. We must try to do in our homes what Christ did with the Nephites. As the proclamation on the family teaches, “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ” (<span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Oct. 2004, 49; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102). We must be the light to help our families overcome sin, anger, envy, and fighting. We can pray together, weep for each other, heal each other’s wounds, and selflessly love and serve one another.</p>

Small, seemingly insignificant things you do can make a big difference. I read about some small glowworms found in caves in New Zealand. Each one by itself produces only an insignificant pinpoint of light. But when millions of them light up a cave one by one, they produce enough light by which one can actually read. Likewise, each of our little deeds may share only a pinpoint of light, but added together they begin to make a significant difference. Tonight the choir will remind us of the importance of sharing our little lights as they sing “Shine On”:</p>

Her baptism was a happy event because, among other things, her whole family attended. Her mother and sister felt the Spirit there and wanted to have the missionary discussions too. This concerned the father, for he felt he was losing all of his family to this unfamiliar church. So he did not allow it, and for a time there was a feeling of discord in their family. However, Raluca remembered that she had made a baptismal covenant to take upon her the name of Jesus Christ. She tried to hold up His light by doing in her home the things He would do. She was a peacemaker. She was an example. She was a teacher. She was a healer.</p>

Then they too were baptized. And finally, much to everyone’s joy, the father of the family also joined the Church. At his baptism he spoke and said that for a time their family had been as two hearts beating at a different rhythm in the same household. But now they were of one faith and one baptism, with their hearts knit together in unity and love. He gave thanks to the missionaries and members who had helped them. Then he paid a special tribute to his daughter Raluca for being so Christlike in their home during that difficult period, for being the peacemaker, the healer, the teacher, the example, and the light that eventually brought their entire family to the Church of Jesus Christ.</p>

Those surrounding them wanted that same light and inquired, “What shall we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.40" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:40</a>).

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="106"></span>Our son-in-law told his daughter, three-year-old Eliza, that for family home evening they were going to have a lesson on a very special subject. She got a big smile on her face and attempted to guess the surprise. “It must be about <span class="emphasis">me,</span>” she said, “because I am very special!” Eliza remembers and knows who she is—a very special child of God. She has learned this from her mother, who from Eliza’s earliest infancy has sung our opening hymn, “I Am a Child of God” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns, </span>no. 301), as a nightly lullaby.</p>

Yet as they grow up, they often grow away from the confident knowledge of three-year-old Eliza that they are very special. Youth often experience an identity crisis, wondering who they really are. The teenage years are also a time of what I describe as “identity theft,” meaning that worldly ideas, philosophies, and deceits confuse us, buffet us, and seek to rob us of the knowledge of our true identity.</p>

I don’t feel Heavenly Father’s love. My life seems hard. Things are not turning out the way I wanted, hoped, and dreamed they would.” What I said to her I now say to young women everywhere: I know unequivocally that you are a daughter of God. He knows you, He loves you, and He has a plan for you. I know this is a message Heavenly Father wants me to share with you.</p>

The proclamation to the world on the family says, “Each [of us] is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny” (<span class="emphasis">Liahona, </span>Oct. 2004, 49; <span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Nov. 1995, 102).

Never forget that. Your Eternal Father is the great Master of the universe. He rules over all, but He also will listen to your prayers as His daughter and hear you as you speak with Him.

If you let this virtuous truth garnish your thoughts unceasingly, you will have confidence in the presence of God, as our Mutual theme scripture promises (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>).</p>

There is a veil between heaven and earth, “a sleep and a forgetting” (William Wordsworth, “Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood,” stanza 5, line 58) when we are born. This is necessary for us to “gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize [our] divine destin[ies] as [heirs to] eternal life” (<span class="emphasis">Liahona, </span>Oct. 2004, 49; <span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Nov. 1995, 102). Heavenly Father loves us and wants to help us remember Him, so He provides for us glimpses into eternity. The Apostle Paul taught that “the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.16" class="scriptureRef">Romans 8:16</a>). The Spirit gives us glimpses into who we are. Often the Spirit speaks to us when we pray, read the scriptures, ponder upon the Lord’s mercies to us, receive priesthood <span class="pageBreak" page-number="107"></span>blessings, serve others, or feel loved and affirmed by others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/daughters-of-heavenly-father.p9" pid="XK1t2fiiA0isXUzetnJ5Kg" hash="6xlH9w">Moses learned who he was through a powerful spiritual experience. He talked with God face-to-face and learned that he was God’s son, with a special mission to perform. After having this experience, Moses was then buffeted by Satan. But because Moses had felt of God’s glory, he recognized that Satan did not have any glory. Because Moses knew that he was God’s son and that God had a mission for him, he had the power and ability to resist Satan, to make righteous judgments, to call upon God for strength, and to continue to have His Spirit to be with him. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.title" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/daughters-of-heavenly-father.p10" pid="X6TvFnbOZk-KRVpHLDMVAw" hash="HIjwoA">The same pattern applies to us. As we come to know and feel who we really are, we are enabled to recognize the difference between good and evil and are empowered to resist temptation. One of the ways we can come to understand the divinely appointed mission the Lord has for us is through our patriarchal blessings. These are very specific and individual messages we can each receive by the power of the priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/daughters-of-heavenly-father.p11" pid="sPzFCjKALke9tN3xQ6Athg" hash="edaBug">Another way to receive spiritual insights about our own eternal natures is from a parent or a leader who can reassure us because of his or her inspired glimpses into who we really are. The Spirit has whispered very specifically to me on occasion about the true identity of my children. I remember the night before one of our babies was born I had the distinct impression that this baby would be a great friend and helper with each of its siblings. This has proved to be absolutely true. Another time when one of our teenagers was very downcast because of involvement in an automobile accident, I distinctly heard these words in my mind: “I love this child and will guide his life.” And He has. Such glimpses have come again and again to me. When they have needed encouragement, I have been blessed with insights into the great and noble eternal spirits of my children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/daughters-of-heavenly-father.p12" pid="Q2MsiK3NekGQhFxgqMP51A" hash="dmEoTQ">Has your mother or father ever reminded you as you were leaving the house to “remember who you are”? What do they mean by that? “Remember that you are part of this family, with a reputation to uphold.” And, even more importantly, “remember that you are a child of God and must act accordingly.” Missionaries wear a badge as a constant reminder that they are representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This reminds missionaries to dress modestly and comely, to treat people with politeness, and to strive to have Christ’s image in their countenances. They must do these things because they wear that name tag, an outward sign of their identity. By covenant, we too have all taken upon ourselves Christ’s name. His name should be engraven inwardly upon our hearts. Likewise, we are expected to act as worthy children of Heavenly Father, who, at least figuratively, has sent us to earth with the admonition “Remember who you are!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/daughters-of-heavenly-father.p13" pid="lEeBO2Cb50yEO8Hvo7D8Ig" hash="D1kyMg">When I was called to serve you, the young women of this Church, I knew I had to behave appropriately. One day one of my daughters got a ticket for parking her car on the street with an expired registration sticker. I took matters into my own hands and went marching into the city government building to explain that the registration papers were currently on their way to us through the mail. As I <span class="pageBreak" page-number="108"></span>walked resolutely through the door, someone said to me, “I know who you are.” That stopped me and reminded me that I also needed to remember who I am—not just the Young Women general president, but most especially a daughter of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/daughters-of-heavenly-father.p14" pid="PjFV2my7Y02mk0AAjZ2L2Q" hash="RdoeHw">In relationships we must remember that others are also children of our Heavenly Father. At the first of our marriage, my husband said quite often, “I didn’t marry you for your looks.” Finally I teased him a bit by saying, “That really doesn’t sound too flattering.” He explained what I really already knew, that this was intended to be the highest compliment he could give me. He said, “I love you for who you are intrinsically and eternally.” The Lord said: “Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; … for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). In families, friendships, dating, and marriage, we should value not just beauty and résumés, but rather character, good values, and each other’s inherited divine natures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/daughters-of-heavenly-father.p15" pid="O2ML5qhy5kygHkrsqsRJ3A" hash="NaCV3w">In a stake in Chile the young women did this at camp by keeping a book of each other’s virtuous qualities. Each day they got better acquainted and wrote down the intrinsic good they were learning about each person there. At the end of the camp, they shared their thoughts, helping each person to see more of the divinity within herself. Their leader said, “We were literally basking in this wonderful spirit of kindness and goodwill. I can honestly say that I never heard a word of complaint from the girls! They were flourishing in a sweet spirit of mutual acceptance that is not often present among teenage girls. There was no competition, no contention. Our camp had become a little bit of heaven” (personal correspondence). The girls recognized and reaffirmed the divine natures of each other, and the Spirit filled the camp as these virtuous thoughts were expressed.</p>

Lewis wisely said: “It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. … There are no <span class="emphasis">ordinary</span> people. … Your neighbor is the holiest object presented to your senses” (“The Weight of Glory,” in <span class="emphasis">Screwtape Proposes a Toast and Other Pieces</span> [1974], 109–10).</p>

I have been impressed with young women who were dressed modestly in a very hot and humid part of Brazil. They said, “Modesty is not about the climate. It’s about the heart.” These young women knew they were daughters of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/daughters-of-heavenly-father.p18" pid="bOmt4OXMXEa5euonRLUUig" hash="CXgb_A">I have been touched to learn of the goodness of five young LDS students from Idaho who recently drowned in a terrible accident. They were known by their peers and in their communities for living standards of righteousness and being sterling examples of virtue and wholesomeness. These youth knew they were sons and daughters of God.</p>

She did not want her younger brother and sisters to feel unloved, so she says prayers with them every night and tells them she loves them. This young woman knows she is a daughter of a Heavenly Father who loves her, and she loves Him by loving her siblings.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="109"></span>And I have been moved to learn about the actions of young women in a poverty-stricken and politically oppressed area of the world. Despite their own hardships, these young women met at camp and planned ways to lift others. They made hygiene kits for women in need. They did additional service in the community, in hospitals, and in homes. We know by their actions that these young women understand their identity as daughters of God. My heart swells with love for these young women and for young women everywhere. I know that you are daughters of God, who loves you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/daughters-of-heavenly-father.p21" pid="YV4KTgoIL0qh9VUPnSyJBA" hash="58ef5w">In conclusion let me share an experience that is tender and even sacred to me. When I was first called to serve as Young Women general president, I felt terrified and inadequate. I lay awake for many nights worrying, repenting, and crying. After several nights of this, I had a very moving experience. I started thinking about my young women nieces, then about the young women in my neighborhood and ward, then about the young women I saw regularly at the high school, and then I envisioned young women of the Church throughout the world, over half a million of them. The most wonderfully warm feeling began to envelop me and surge through me. I felt such exquisite love for Latter-day Saint young women everywhere, each one of you, and I knew that what I was feeling was our Heavenly Father’s love for you. It was powerful and all-encompassing. For the first time I felt peace because I knew what Heavenly Father wanted me to do. He wanted me to witness to you of His great love for you. And so I testify to you again that I know beyond doubt that Heavenly Father knows you and loves you. You are His special daughter. He has a plan for you, and He will ever be there to lead you, guide you, and walk beside you (see “I Am a Child of God”). I earnestly pray that you will know this and feel this, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I especially love to promise with you that we will “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> How can we do this? As I speak, I pray that the Spirit will guide us and testify to each of us as to how we can stand as witnesses for God.</p>

One of our daughters had a golden investigator named JieLei. This young adult woman obeyed each new commandment she was taught, no matter how difficult. She was a student struggling to make ends meet financially, but she began paying her tithing when she learned about that law. Her part-time job required her to work on Sunday, but she had the courage to ask her employer if he could change her hours to another day so that she could attend sacrament meeting.</p>

Our daughter and her companion knew that she needed a witness from the Spirit to confirm its truth, so they prepared a lesson for her about the Holy Ghost. As they worked on it, somehow it didn’t feel quite right. When they prayed about it, they felt impressed to go a different direction, to give a lesson instead about Jesus Christ.</p>

Tears started streaming down her cheeks. She kept asking, “What is this I am feeling?” Then they bore witness to her that it was the Spirit. Exactly what they had wanted to have happen did happen. It was then that our daughter remembered that one of the great roles of the Holy Ghost is as a testifier of Christ. Jesus Himself said, “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, … shall testify of me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Our daughter realized that as she stood as a witness of Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost confirmed it. We too can stand as witnesses as “we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ” and look to Him as the source for “a remission of [our] sins.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

He taught his people about the Lord’s goodness, power, wisdom, patience, and, most of all, Atonement. As he stood as a witness, the Spirit bore witness to them that Jesus Christ is the Savior, as it had to JieLei. King Benjamin then admonished his people to stand steadfast in their faith in Christ. The people all cried out:</p>

Recently my own children and their spouses were remembering times through the years when they had stood for correct values in the face of peer pressure. One would not participate in a cheer competition on Sunday; another told his employer that he could not work on the Sabbath day. One refused to watch a pornographic movie at a friend’s house when he was only 11; another refused to look with classmates at pornographic magazines. Both were ostracized socially for some time thereafter. Another child refused to succumb to bad, crass, vulgar language in her work environment. One refused liquor that his friend had stolen out of his parents’ locked cabinet. Another, who was the only Latter-day Saint member in her class, stood to give an English-class presentation and ended up fielding questions about the Book of Mormon. Our married children <span class="pageBreak" page-number="114"></span>have continued to bear children in the face of worldly criticism.</p>

They also were armed with blessings that come from obedience to God’s commandments.

The oldest child in a less-active family, she was born with the gift of faith. She took herself to Primary and Mutual. She qualified for a temple marriage even before her parents were able to go.

You young women too can stand as a witness of God by nurturing a spirit of faith, love, peace, and testimony in your homes <span class="emphasis">now,</span> preparing you to do the same when you establish your own future homes.

He said that as he was praying, he had felt inspired to ask her to teach Young Women. She told him that she had been baptized at age 10 but had never been active. He seemed undeterred as he showed her the manual and explained where they met on Wednesday night. Then she emphatically said, “I can’t teach 16-year-olds; I’m inactive, and besides I smoke.” Then he said, “You won’t be inactive anymore, and you have until Wednesday to quit smoking.” Then he left.</p>

I had never been scared of anything before. I had grown up in the slums, been in detention once myself, and rescued my father from the ‘drunk tank.’ And all of a sudden there I was at Mutual being introduced as the new Laurel adviser. I sat before two Laurels and gave the lesson word for word, even the parts that said ‘Now ask them …’ I left immediately after the lesson and cried all the way home.</p>

It’s the bishop here to retrieve his manual.’ I opened the door, and standing there were those two lovely Laurels, one with flowers, the other with cookies. They invited me to go to church with them on Sunday, which I did. I liked those girls. They began by teaching me about the Church, the ward, the class. They taught me how to sew, read scriptures, and smile.</p>

We taught them wherever we could find them—in cars, in bowling alleys, and on porches. Within six months, 14 of them were coming, and in a year all 16 girls on the roll were active. We laughed and cried together. We learned to pray, study the gospel, and serve others.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

They have stood as witnesses of Jesus Christ by their exemplary lives and selfless service.</p>

When I have felt afraid or inadequate, I have been strengthened and upheld by His omnipotent hand. I know He will bless each of us as we stand as witnesses.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="81"></span>In the Book of Mormon, Nephi speaks often of delight. He delights “in the things of the Lord,” “in the scriptures,” and “in the great and eternal plan” of our Father in Heaven (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.15-16" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 4:15–16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.2-8" class="scriptureRef">11:2–8</a>). Notably, Nephi often remembers his sources of delight in the midst of affliction, serving to lift and focus his spirit on eternal blessings.</p>

Let me mention a few of the things I delight in.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p3" pid="QXep0utnrE6rPiVS3ITQTQ" hash="Ic7v4Q">I delight in our Savior, Jesus Christ. Like Nephi, “I glory in my Jesus” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.6" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 33:6</a>), in His ministering and saving roles upon the earth. He provides light and hope and has given us the Holy Ghost for further guidance and comfort along the pathway we should go. It is only through Him that we can return to our Father. “Salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:17</a>).</p>

I testify that President Thomas S. Monson is the Lord’s prophet on the earth today. I delight that he is truly a Christlike minister to the one, reaching out in warmth and love to each individual.</p>

Some of my most celestial days recently have been my own children’s temple marriages, with my father performing that holy ordinance.</p>

I love their worthy adherence to the standards leading to the temple and their preparation to be faithful missionaries and righteous mothers and fathers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p7" pid="CA5XQ7SXcUO6KEhJuL2dFA" hash="c-wVaw">I delight that I am a daughter of Heavenly Father, who loves me. I learned of my divine identity in my earliest years at my mother’s side. Just recently I saw my then three-year-old granddaughter learning her identity from her mother. Eliza had gone to bed distraught. She could be comforted only as her mother again told Eliza’s favorite true story about the special night when Heavenly Father distinctly and clearly whispered to her mommy’s heart that Eliza was a special spirit with a noble mission ahead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p8" pid="u6tLbnwEsEKezztPFgtKUQ" hash="CMxzVA">I take great delight in my role as a nurturer, which allows me to express my deepest identity as a woman. I never fail to be struck by the way that women, young women, and even little girls seem to have an instinctive interest and ability in nurturing. It is not only a mother’s primary responsibility but also part of our “individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Oct. 2004, 49; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102). To nurture is to teach, to foster development, to promote growth, to feed, and to nourish. Who would not shout for joy at being given such a blessed role?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p9" pid="FVRZJMvas0mr5pum7DsFEw" hash="oXsuww">The scriptures use the word <span class="emphasis">nurture</span> only twice and in both cases speak of the responsibility of parents to raise their children “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/6.4" class="scriptureRef">Ephesians 6:4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.1" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:1</a>).</p>

He said, “How much more beautiful would be the … society in which we live if every father … and … mother regarded [their] children … as gifts from the God of heaven … and brought them up with true affection in the wisdom and admonition of the Lord” (“These, Our Little Ones,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Dec. 2007, 7; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Dec. 2007, 9).</p>

Recently I delighted in the birth of a new grandchild into a family that understands that parents have the solemn responsibility to rear their children in love and righteousness. The older siblings had a natural curiosity about their little sister’s entrance into this world. Their first lessons about this holy subject were taught by loving parents in a sacred family setting, in the celestial climate that accompanies a new soul’s birth into mortality, and in the context of our Father’s great eternal plan. By contrast, the next day upon returning home from kindergarten, our granddaughter reported that she had learned that day in class “a big new term called sexual abuse.” I felt concerned that at this early age children already have to be aware, for safety reasons, of the negative facets of the subject they had so beautifully talked of the night before. I delighted as never before in a nurturing family founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p12" pid="L_LKb_OuxEySzbMRYSHB-A" hash="oaGPFQ">Jacob taught that the Lord delights “in the chastity of women” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.28" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:28</a>). I delight in the chastity and purity of all women and men. How it must grieve the Lord to see virtue violated and modesty mocked on every side in this wicked world. The Lord has provided for His children great joy through intimate, loving relationships, as my grandchildren were learning. I delight in the clarity of the proclamation to the world on the family, which warns that “individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p13" pid="rnpDy0eu5UufszQjM6e43Q" hash="8gA5-A">I delight in the examples of those in the scriptures who walk by faith on their earthly journey. Each time I walk with Abraham and Isaac on the road to Mount Moriah, I weep, knowing that Abraham does not know that there will be an angel and a ram in the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="83"></span>thicket at the end of the journey. We are each in the middle of our earthly path, and we don’t know the rest of our own stories. But we, as Abraham, are blessed with miracles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p14" pid="RcT4DewYBUGYQ1xJz6ibog" hash="MaM2ZQ">I delight in the Lord’s mercies and miracles (see “Bless Our Fast, We Pray,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 138). I know that His tender mercies and His miracles, large and small, are real. They come in His way and on His timetable. Sometimes it is not until we have reached our extremity. Jesus’s disciples on the Sea of Galilee had to toil in rowing against a contrary wind all through the night before Jesus finally came to their aid. He did not come until the “fourth watch,” meaning near dawn. Yet He did come. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/6.45-51" class="scriptureRef">Mark 6:45–51</a>.) My testimony is that miracles do come, though sometimes not until the fourth watch.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p15" pid="ZG9IH3I6P0Kzx3sUbhn4gQ" hash="RhwblQ">Right now I am exerting my faith and prayers and watching for miracles in behalf of loved ones who are physically sick, emotionally bereft, and spiritually astray. I delight in the Lord’s love for each of His children and in His wisdom to allow us individually tailored earthly experiences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p16" pid="WbYHaIz4-UaraV4W3cRbPw" hash="yZkyaQ">Finally, I delight in, more than I can express, the eternal love and constant help of my husband and the prayers and support of my children and parents during these years of my service as Young Women general president.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p17" pid="nwyIg5ygw06vz4_N4MTt0w" hash="4Lr6gg">“My soul delighteth in the things of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.16" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 4:16</a>)—His law, His life, His love. To delight in Him is to acknowledge His hand in our lives. Our gospel duty is to do what is right and to love and delight in what is right. When we delight to serve Him, our Father in Heaven delights to bless us. “I, the Lord, … delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:5</a>). I want to be worthy always of His delight. “I love the Lord, in Him my soul delights” (“I Love the Lord,” Jackman Music Corporation). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
