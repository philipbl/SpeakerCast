      <title>Keep the Faith</title>

      <description>As a young returned missionary, I and my returned missionary friends routinely bade our farewells with the words, “Keep the faith.” While this was a cliché given casually with very little thought, the admonition is serious, and it is the Lord’s.</description>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p1" pid="-SEIf2s6w0WYELNDaEYrBQ" hash="TpNexg">As a young returned missionary, I and my returned missionary friends routinely bade our farewells with the words, “Keep the faith.” While this was a cliché given casually with very little thought, the admonition is serious, and it is the Lord’s.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p2" pid="pPVhAvK-MUCo74gHGtlmcg" hash="HWsmGQ">The Apostle Paul, in his second epistle to Timothy, declared, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 4:7</a>.) Keeping the faith to the end has always been our charge. In the eighteenth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord admonishes, “And as many as repent and are baptized in my name, which is Jesus Christ, and endure to the end, the same shall be saved.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:22</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p3" pid="wmThLlUYwU2YmJXSeO1KZQ" hash="TjxHZg">I shall never forget the impression left upon me when President Joseph Fielding Smith, in his ninety-fifth year, exclaimed, “I hope to endure to the end in this life.” Today, perhaps more than ever before, our faith is challenged on all fronts. This should not surprise us as it is part of God’s plan. As Abraham proved himself to the Lord with unwavering faith when he took his son Isaac to the mountain to be sacrificed, we also must prove our devotion, our endurance, and our faith to our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p4" pid="NKZ3Omr9Y068Q002Y-tu8A" hash="_hYdMQ">We all face the normal and the expected challenges of mortality. We experience illness, we encounter transgression, we work through the difficulties of repentance, we sometimes wrestle with rebellion, and we deal with the stresses of providing for our families. These are expected. These we prepare for, and these we cope with.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p5" pid="DewjkT85bEOZgo9E2KK0Ig" hash="8WpbJg">For the faithful, the normal tests and trials of life need not be the enemy of faith. While we don’t necessarily look forward to these obstacles and challenges, we accept them, and we build our lives and faith from them. To the faithful, the very obstacles that we overcome draw us closer to our Heavenly Father by helping us develop a humble, submissive spirit and causing us to be grateful and appreciative of those blessings that flow from a loving Father. In short, these experiences can and often do increase our faith. The faithful do not pray to be spared the trials of life but pray that they may have the strength to rise above them. In so doing they come closer to Heavenly Father and to that state of perfection they are seeking.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p6" pid="rWoVfztIBUeRecsbkg6WYg" hash="RioJLA">For Latter-day Saints, often the greater testing of faith—the subtle but more serious testing—comes not from the normal obstacles of mortality but from the successes of mortality. There is a strong relationship, even a cause-effect relationship, between faith and the required virtues of humility and a submissive heart, which have always been key ingredients of faith. So-called temporal achievements, whether materialistic or intellectual, when untempered with the principles of the gospel and the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, often move a person away from the fundamental principles that foster faith. When our successes are received without proper acknowledgment to Him who is the grantor of all blessings, these same successes often lead to false pride and a deterioration of the virtues that bring us to faith. When our successes lead to self-aggrandizement or the substitution of our earthly learning for Heavenly Father’s will, we jeopardize the principles upon which our faith is founded. Anything that erodes humility and submissiveness is indeed a threat to faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p7" pid="bHsribPcwkqzjt6sTHOp0w" hash="dpGvKA">Whatever our station in life, whatever our achievements, no matter how great, a submissive heart and a humble spirit are still fundamental to our faith. We must guard against letting our worldly successes or earthly learning become a substitution for spiritual wisdom and divine direction given through the prophets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p8" pid="qSji0gvK402Xcn_tiB28XA" hash="hPDw_w">In the Book of Mormon, Mormon explains the deteriorating condition of the Nephites resulting from their misplaced sense of achievement in earthly matters: “For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.8" class="scriptureRef">Alma 4:8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p9" pid="uFZv9c9vmUO-3AIZKBr84w" hash="3yrDRQ">The Lord further warns us against relying solely upon man’s strength and wisdom. He said, “Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken unto the precepts of men, save their precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.31" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:31</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p10" pid="EpWJd9FCVU-kMUd7UC9W1A" hash="5o4Ivw">Jacob further enlightens us with the following: “O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.28" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:28</a>.) Jacob then clarifies so we may all understand that learning under the proper circumstances has an important place in our lives. He explains, “But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.29" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:29</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p11" pid="YuvBP3lrLUy0kL5fNFd50Q" hash="1_tzSQ">There are the so-called learned people who have let their intellect undermine their spiritual moorings and who would also attempt to lead the faithful away from those who are appointed by the Lord to lead. There are those who feel that our leaders are out of touch with the realities of the day. They would attempt to lead members by substituting their own knowledge for the revelations from God to His prophets. And unfortunately there are those who would so follow. Christ warned, “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.15" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p12" pid="lmwkvbb8XESl2I3IhSYXxA" hash="4Jmt3g">In an attempt to further prepare the Saints against the inevitable threatening wolves, Paul the Apostle gave his warning: “For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/20.29" class="scriptureRef">Acts 20:29</a>.) Where might these wolves get sheep’s clothing that is so authentic as to deceive the Lord’s flock? Could it be they are clothed with exceeding riches and fine clothing as Mormon warned? (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/4.8" class="scriptureRef">Alma 4:8</a>.) The vainness and frailties and foolishness of men, the learned that hearken not unto the commandments of God, as Jacob warned? (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.28" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:28</a>.) Could it be that sometimes they may clothe themselves to appear as righteous shepherds, that even the very elect might be deceived?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p13" pid="zgbe7xSTfEyR79l3uvXnGQ" hash="57WlTA">Yes, like Abraham of old, our faith is going to be tested. We will suffer sickness, pain, death, and tragedy. This is inevitable. This is a <span class="emphasis">major reason</span> why we opted to participate in mortality. We can endure these trials and tribulations because we can draw upon the gifts of heaven, which will help us see them for what they are. As we conquer them, we are drawn closer to our Heavenly Father. We feel His love, gain His knowledge and truth. We are able to meet the test and endure these to the end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p14" pid="G-m2PaSbVUGAM7Daonce3A" hash="frJDFg">But it is that which we may not recognize for what it is that we must be concerned about—the substitution of man’s will for God’s inspired direction. Let us not be led astray by the sophistry of man, untempered by the principles of the gospel and the Spirit of the Lord. Let us not lose sight of those enduring God-given principles of humility and the submissive heart that have sustained us since the restoration of the gospel. Let us seek truth and guidance from a loving Father. Let us look to our Father in Heaven and His living prophets and personal revelation for guidance. When the prophets speak, let us listen and obey.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/keep-the-faith.p15" pid="gwRSF4punECSahX51xWUfw" hash="lIkWjg">I bear solemn witness that God lives, that He cares enough to direct His prophets for our blessing and edification. I bear witness that as we seek direction from our Father, as we follow the prophets, our faith will be sustained and enlarged. And so, my brothers and sisters, my farewell words to you today, not given casually and not given without meaning and contemplation, but given with the soberness and the sincerity of my heart, are simply, “Keep the faith.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p1" pid="Rw60IDG7k0Kffn6D_Il0KA" hash="xBfJGA">I, like many of you, take delight in watching the extraordinary performance of outstanding athletes on the field of competition. It is always a thrill to see the fulfillment of thousands of hours of practice, dedication, and sacrifice manifest through an unusual play, a last-second touchdown pass, a game-winning goal, or pressure-filled free throws. It always amazes me to see a basketball player step up to the free throw line and consistently, shot after shot, pressure upon pressure, calmly put the ball through the hoop—all net. Last year Jeff Hornacek, after joining the Utah Jazz in midseason, hit thirty-three consecutive free throws—a Jazz season record. <span class="emphasis">He was shooting with great confidence.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p2" pid="EFINrRgJOkqE-Jttk1B-gA" hash="pS0YjA">I am interested in free throw records because I believe I also set a free throw record in high school—unrecorded, but a record that I believe would stand even today. It was in a game between my alma mater, Preston High, and Malad High in Idaho. It was played in the old Malad High School gymnasium in 1954.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p3" pid="FyrF1VheJ0mrLirjXdrM4w" hash="O5B5SQ">Early in the game I was fouled in the act of shooting and was awarded two foul shots. I calmly stepped to the free throw line, set my toe about one-eighth of an inch from the line, and did my best imitation of my then basketball idol, Bob Cousy, by bouncing the ball twice, spinning it in my hands, taking a deep breath, and shooting. It was a pretty good imitation—until I released the ball. I missed both shots.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p4" pid="Kmie1uY4IUiK5keyZRWLlA" hash="Buiszw">A few moments later I was again at the foul line going through the same established routine. To my despair I missed again—twice. As fortune would have it, we were into the game only six or seven minutes, and I was at the line missing my sixth and seventh foul shots. As I approached my ninth and tenth shots, I noticed that the basket, which was regulation size at the beginning of the game, was in some magical way beginning to shrink. Each time I came to the line, it got smaller and smaller.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p5" pid="9ICxlmYxeUCDXQug8uOu8A" hash="N0b0UA">My confidence wasn’t bolstered much as I saw images of distress in the faces of my teammates and expressions of calm glee and a twinkle in the eyes of my opponents each time I came to the line. By my fifteenth miss, my arms and legs were frozen stiff, and I could see the basket getting so small that even a softball couldn’t pass through it. When I approached the line to miss my eighteenth consecutive free throw, the basket seemed about the size of a golf hole, and I knew that even Bob Cousy would not stand a chance. <span class="emphasis">I was not shooting with much confidence.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p6" pid="MVGniCfU9kCZbQ_FwwnGHw" hash="BFw2iw">Thankfully, the final buzzer sounded and my record ceased at eighteen consecutive misses—a record not easily achievable and one I doubt any of you sports enthusiasts have ever witnessed. As I left the court, my confidence was devastated, and ahead of me remained the frightening task of getting ready to face the foul line again in upcoming games. My challenge was not so much related to foul shooting as it was to confidence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p7" pid="WizUoNmJJESdpFfhh1FO3w" hash="-BZhCA">I am fully aware that when Jeff Hornacek was establishing his record, each time he approached the line he was full of confidence, and the basket, in its magical way, was getting larger and larger. Confidence—the big difference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p8" pid="dolsb_Rto0WoLnPgFeaQpg" hash="nnvIVA">As recorded in the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 45, the Lord tells Joseph Smith during his hour of deep despair in Liberty Jail, “Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.” [<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>] What a wonderful promise for us bearers of the priesthood—confidence in the presence of God!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p9" pid="O621quDcnUGaqEltdIecEg" hash="YnyuNA">Each of us present in this great body of the priesthood has been called and ordained of God. We are His emissaries and have entered into a holy covenant with Him to honor and magnify the priesthood, and this becomes our most important and sacred assignment on earth. I repeat—our most important assignment on earth is to honor and magnify the priesthood. It is more important than hitting crucial free throws. It is more important than catching a touchdown pass or kicking goals. It is more important than being accepted by your peers. It is more important than closing on a vital business transaction.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p10" pid="rTYR_Z1n6Uum85lZdxJyhw" hash="wrZgNA">Every time we use the priesthood, whether by assignment or through voluntary acts of service, it is as though we are stepping up to the foul line. Every time the priesthood is tested by temptation or trial, it is as though we are stepping up to the foul line. The hits and the misses that have preceded the moment of testing have a great bearing on how we will perform the next shot. Our spiritual confidence is largely determined by our prior spiritual successes and, unfortunately, by our prior spiritual mishaps. Our prior choices will greatly influence how our spiritual basket will look, large or small, the next time we are at the line.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p11" pid="TqXcV9Nq80mGiD2WW_YmsA" hash="VkLPRA">We cannot say we will sow a few wild oats in our youth or that we will just dabble a little around the fringes of sin. There are <span class="emphasis">no fringes</span> of sin. Every act, good or bad, has a consequence. Every good act improves our ability to do good and more firmly stand against sin or failure. Every transgression, regardless of how minor, makes us more susceptible to Satan’s influence the next time he tempts us. Satan takes us an inch at a time, deceiving us as to the consequences of so-called minor sins until he captures us in major transgressions. Nephi describes this technique as one of pacifying, lulling, and flattering us away until Satan “grasps [us] with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.22" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:22</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:21</a>). There are no fringes of sin. We are constantly shooting our foul shots, and the basket is either getting bigger or, as Satan would have it, smaller. Our confidence is either waxing strong in the Lord or waxing strong in Satan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p12" pid="uPumbcV8nE6GRbXJjhcwFg" hash="8g3xsQ">When Nephi and his brothers were asked to go back to Jerusalem for the plates of brass, Nephi, because of his past experiences and preparation, saw the basket as very large. He knew he could do it. He said, “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:7</a>). On the other hand, Laman and Lemuel, who already had a history of complaining and neglecting their responsibilities, saw the basket as very small and thus rebelled. Laman and Lemuel did not have the confidence or the faith that comes from righteous preparation. They did not believe they could make the shot.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p13" pid="-DiDqqbO7k-Vy0phIkcYjQ" hash="BhUTxA">When David went to battle against Goliath, he was discouraged by Saul, who reminded him that he was just a child and was not able to go against this giant, Goliath. David replied: “Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p14" pid="Gf50K4TriECxMbaZZJqB7Q" hash="FtWlFA">“And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17.34-35" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 17:34–35</a>). David had made his previous foul shots, and he saw the basket as very large.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p15" pid="ELZTetnBTUydKYOB83k2mA" hash="wlNn1g">When Joseph Smith went into the grove of trees, when he began the translation of the Book of Mormon, and when he organized the Church with just six members, his confidence was strong in the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p16" pid="GVT0Rnpy6EOVwkIkn96deg" hash="ygy2mw">The Savior talked about teaching line upon line and precept upon precept. This is also how we prepare ourselves to magnify our callings—act upon act and deed upon deed. Each good act makes the basket larger and prepares us to further magnify our callings. When you young Aaronic Priesthood bearers administer and pass the sacrament worthily and reverently, the view of the basket becomes a little larger, as does your confidence in the Lord and your ability to act in righteousness. For those who have withstood so-called <span class="emphasis">minor</span> temptations, your ability to overcome Satan in the moments of major testing becomes easier. For those of you who have developed a relationship with your Heavenly Father and the Savior through scripture study and prayer, your basket is large and your confidence waxes strong.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p17" pid="fkL7qYl4wkGlui0sWAkszg" hash="32Ddow">I am acutely aware that each of us sees our own basket as a different size. Some may feel as though they are on a string of eighteen consecutive misses, and the basket they are now shooting at is very diminished. I have known men, young and old, whose previous decisions or actions have caused them to lose confidence in themselves and in the Lord. It was as though their arms and legs were frozen stiff, and the task of breaking the cycle of sin or failure seemed almost insurmountable. But a true understanding of the Savior’s mission lets us know that through true repentance our baskets can be restored to regulation size. Every wise choice, every responsible exercising of the priesthood, and every act of service enhances our confidence in the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/that-thy-confidence-wax-strong.p18" pid="3M3tk_7CXkS4Gix7QqBnlA" hash="IBN8NQ">Brethren of the priesthood, let us hit our foul shots, <span class="emphasis">let us do our duty</span>—every single time we step to the line—that our confidence might wax strong in the presence of God, that the doctrine of the priesthood may distill upon <span class="emphasis">our</span> souls as the dews from heaven—for we are the priesthood of God. Of this I humbly testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

I speak as one of approximately 100,000 mothers and fathers of more than 50,000 missionaries from our Church who are serving the Lord in all parts of the world. Paraphrasing the slogan of a prominent greeting card company, “We care enough to send our very best.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

They come from the plains of Iowa and the streets of the Bronx. They come from the cities of Peru and Bolivia. They come from the rolling mountains of the Ozarks and the jungles of Colombia and Kenya. They come from every economic, social background there is. Yet they all have one common trait—“They cared enough to send their very best.” Yes, we send to you for two years our choice young men and women at the dawn of their adulthood. We send to you our children, whom we have loved, taught, and nurtured.</p>

In short, we have the same loving feelings, emotions, and dreams for them as you have for your children.</p>

They live under all sorts of conditions, almost always substantially below the comforts to which they are accustomed. They often live in unfamiliar environments, which are sometimes unfriendly to those who would teach the saving truths of Jesus Christ.</p>

Most are just a year out of high school. Many have just begun their university studies. Some have delayed or even forgone promising professions. Cars are sold, sweethearts are put on hold, college is delayed, scholarships are forfeited, careers are postponed. Behind each missionary is a private story of years of personal commitment, preparation, personal sacrifice, and examples of love for the Savior. And there are those worthy young men and young women who have in their hearts the greatest desire to serve a mission, but because of physical, health, or other limiting circumstances are honorably excused.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/we-care-enough-to-send-our-very-best.p7" pid="LXiV7bDLw0irG_Z4rBOg1A" hash="DU3m-A">A missionary’s life is not an easy one. After preparing through childhood and teen years by studying the scriptures, preparing financially, and maintaining personal worthiness (including sexual purity and abstinence from tobacco, alcohol, and drugs), missionaries enter one of several missionary training centers scattered throughout the world. This is the only formal training they will receive—three weeks if they are called to serve in a country of their native language, or two months if they must learn a foreign language. Their day in the mission field is demanding. It begins every morning at 6:30 <small>A.M.</small> with two hours of study, a dozen hours of hard and often discouraging work, continuing until bedtime—about 10:00 <small>P.M.</small> Their work consists mostly of proselyting and teaching but also includes a generous amount of time for voluntary community service. They can be seen teaching English in foreign lands, donating time in hospitals and retirement homes, serving meals at homeless shelters, or doing other service for the benefit of the community. They have part of one day a week for personal preparedness, letter writing, and some relaxation and recreation. Excluded from their mission are dating, secular music, beaches, swimming, and many other activities considered normal for young men and women of this age.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/we-care-enough-to-send-our-very-best.p8" pid="M_OrOcO_a0WuyyHxQYm90A" hash="HFsPiw">Some outside our Church may feel that a mission is a great and unreasonable sacrifice. Our missionaries do not view it as a sacrifice. They view it as an opportunity to manifest their love to the Savior, who charged, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/16.15" class="scriptureRef">Mark 16:15</a>). They see it as an opportunity to express their love to all mankind. They see it as an opportunity to testify of Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God, the Redeemer of the world. They see it as an opportunity to build faith in Christ and to teach His saving and comforting doctrine. I see it as truly one of the distinguishing characteristics of true Christianity. I see these young missionaries as true Christian servants exemplifying the highest Christian principles by testifying of and serving our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>

At a time when so many young men and women of this age are searching, wandering aimlessly, and struggling with the meaning and purpose of life, tens of thousands are fully devoted to this great cause of serving the Lord. They prepare, they sacrifice, and they come. They come because they believe in God, and they believe in the brotherhood of all mankind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/we-care-enough-to-send-our-very-best.p10" pid="IUBg1F3aqky5-XSMcg2_Ww" hash="dkXFQQ">Some have questioned why our missionaries would be sent to all parts of the world, even among our fellow Christians. In the third chapter of John, verse 16, we read the familiar scripture, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” [<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16</a>] Our missionaries go to all nations and all people because they have a firm, unshakable testimony that God still loves the world and that He has spoken again as an indication of that love. He has restored precious truths lost over the centuries of Christian persecution, dark ages, and years of confusion—truths that are essential to our peace and happiness. These are truths so essential to our eternal salvation that our loving Father restored them in their completeness. After Christ’s ministry and ascension to heaven, the Apostle Peter prophesied of a restitution of all things before Christ would return for His Second Coming. He said:</p>

They testify of a restoration that is so marvelous that only the hand of God could be its author—so miraculous that it can be believed only if one understands the powers of God and His love for all mankind—a story so divine that the truth of it can be truly accepted only through the personal manifestation of the Holy Ghost, which the Savior promised as His way of testifying of the truth to those who prayerfully seek it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/we-care-enough-to-send-our-very-best.p14" pid="JfyWwUhAXU6-qzG7WXx0fw" hash="PjQMtw">Our missionaries do not attempt to take away any precious truths, values, or principles that have led so many of you to a life of righteous service and devotion to the Savior. Rather, they come to your homes to present further evidence, additional scripture, that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, who indeed in Gethsemane and upon the cross atoned for our sins. They bring a message of confirmation of His life and magnification of His goodness and love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/we-care-enough-to-send-our-very-best.p15" pid="3k0azKVcNUm19MpboXqR5w" hash="Ar3RoA">They will testify to you of a marvelous vision, considered miraculous in today’s world of doubt, yet which would easily be accepted if it had occurred 2,000 years ago. These missionaries will explain how God and Christ appeared to a young boy only 14 years of age to commence this Restoration. They will tell you about other heavenly messengers who have come to restore Christ’s authority, doctrine, and teachings in their completeness and simplicity. They will tell you of events and truths so beautiful and wonderful, so marvelous that you will thrill as they unfold before you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/we-care-enough-to-send-our-very-best.p16" pid="prK9WboUlk69oyYnVewidA" hash="bXNM7w">The missionaries will explain to you the very purpose of this life that we call mortality. They will help you understand where we came from, why we are here, and why it is necessary and even desirable to experience the vicissitudes of mortality, including suffering, pain, temptation, and death, as well as joy and happiness. They will explain how through Christ’s teachings, one finds peace and direction in a sometimes troubled and turbulent world. Perhaps most important of all, they will explain God’s view of the importance and sanctity of the family. To husbands and wives who love each other and who love their children, there will be a message of how you can have your families forever—eternally—beyond the grave. And finally, they will explain how you can gain your personal witness as to the truthfulness of these things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/we-care-enough-to-send-our-very-best.p17" pid="eDcBDxHi3E62QFKB36-M2A" hash="Vjjj5g">And so, we do “care enough to send our very best.” To all of you who are not of our faith, when two young men dressed in white shirts and ties, two lovely young women, or a noble couple knock at your door and introduce themselves as representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, may I invite you to let them in. Listen to their message and evaluate for yourself. May I suggest that you not just accept their message but that you inquire fervently of our Father in Heaven as to its truthfulness and its value to you and your family, for He is the author of all truth and has promised His witness to those who earnestly seek it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/we-care-enough-to-send-our-very-best.p18" pid="IQjX2xTZZ0eTO7lxa3R7KQ" hash="HYVg-A">I testify to you that the Spirit has borne witness to me that these things are true. The Spirit has borne witness to over 50,000 missionaries and 100,000 parents and thousands of family members who are sacrificing and giving their most precious gift of all to bring this message to you. We jointly testify that the Spirit will bear witness to you if you will receive the message and ask Heavenly Father for a personal confirmation of its truthfulness.</p>

He is our Savior, our Redeemer, and He loves us—every one of us—and He has restored His gospel in its fulness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p1" pid="jiVapEHPMkC8M-EMZykc8g" hash="v2BHDw">Some years ago when I was working in a different organization, our personnel director, a devout Catholic, came into my office with his secretary, Darlene. I could readily see that Darlene was not there of her own free will and would rather be elsewhere. The personnel director’s greeting words to me were, “Will you please tell Darlene that Mormons are Christian. I have been arguing with her for over half an hour, and I cannot convince her of that fact. She needs to hear it from you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p2" pid="IdBIvB8q-Emz3RIEhNEHvg" hash="kU2gRg">My first concern was, have I done something in my own life that would cause Darlene to question my faith in and loyalty to the Savior? But then I quickly recognized that her doubts were not directed to me personally.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p3" pid="XtSa_DKr6kqZwiDeIkqglg" hash="83aTwQ">After inviting them to sit down, I asked Darlene why she thought we were not Christians. Her answer was that her minister had told her so. I asked her if she knew the official name of the Church. She did not. She knew the Church only by the name of Mormon. I explained the name to be The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and then asked if it did not seem like a rather odd name for a church that supposedly was not Christian. I next asked my Catholic friend if he would explain from our many hours of discussions on airplanes, in hotels, at dinners, and during other private occasions some of the things he had learned about us as they related to Christ, His teachings, and our beliefs. He explained them with perhaps more credibility than I could have done.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p4" pid="6RA3EMnI-km0AfomsZ4j5A" hash="68Y_jg">Darlene’s response was that her minister had told her that we did not believe in the Bible, which we had replaced with the Book of Mormon. I replied by sharing the eighth article of faith: “We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p5" pid="ibmngRX_VEy5xEhUWVAlQg" hash="aBjz9w">I then explained that the Book of Mormon was further scripture complementing the Bible and providing another witness of Christ. It expounded and clarified many of Christ’s most sacred and important teachings. Her response was, “My minister says the Book of Mormon cannot contain the teachings of Christ because there could be no more revelations after the death of the Apostles; thus, no more scripture after the Bible.” My query to her was, “At a time of such rapid change in a turbulent and troubled world, with so many perplexing problems, wouldn’t it make you wonder why a loving Father would cease to communicate with His children, whom He loved enough that He sacrificed His Only Begotten Son for them?” The discussion continued for the next 15 to 20 minutes, with my attempting to explain our literal interpretation of the Atonement, the Resurrection, and other important doctrines of the Savior. I ended with the strongest testimony I could give of a loving Father and a willing Son.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p6" pid="wPY2Sz72vkesQq0J_pBckg" hash="7UguaA">At the conclusion of our discussion her response was the same, “My minister has spoken, and that is the way it is.” And that is the way the matter was left, leaving me both disappointed and somewhat bothered by the misunderstanding.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p7" pid="033SzE60e0C3BigsBvAwig" hash="ZmFFiQ">It is interesting how the lack of understanding by a few can innocently or purposely misguide many. Judging another’s heart and conscience is probably best left to the righteous Judge of us all. Surely the final determination as to who is a true disciple of Christ will be left to the Savior, who said, “I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.14" class="scriptureRef">John 10:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p8" pid="ROVG_bfk6UaiuvsEMMt6xg" hash="swAPEg">After being introduced to a few basic doctrines of the Church, the Reverend Charles Taylor, a minister friend of mine, called to tell me of his enlightened understanding of the gospel. With some excitement he stated: “When you take the time to study the teachings and the doctrines of the Mormon Church, it becomes clear that Mormons are truly Christians. In fact, I have never met more Christlike people than the Mormons I have recently become acquainted with.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p9" pid="jKB02r2KQUyJKQemSSDamg" hash="U8Xipw">I responded that I would be interested in hearing his further feelings and understanding after he had had a chance to read the Book of Mormon and could witness its testimony and teachings of the Savior. His response: “I am already reading the Book of Mormon, and it is wonderful to read. It has expanded my understanding of Christ and His mission. I feel a wonderful spirit as I read it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p10" pid="5HFins6rQEiqxQyi3iFAwQ" hash="1PqWhw">My friend took the time to learn for himself before forming a judgment. He did not try to influence others based on lack of understanding or misconception. This seemed responsible to me—seeking understanding before judging, and certainly before trying to persuade another to one’s own misconceptions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p11" pid="H1MkfOebbUmWuKzPgEo0lg" hash="kND2Kw">To my friend Darlene, may I again point out that Jesus Christ is central to every doctrine, every ordinance, and every principle of the Church—as its very name suggests. The Book of Mormon testifies of Jesus Christ, giving emphasis and clarification to His teachings. The Book of Mormon prophet Nephi declared to the world, “And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p12" pid="NqRndfNPCES_4GVPosZFCQ" hash="6o9yyQ">Nephi further stated, “There is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:20</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p13" pid="lkDOi66v0EmRmzTWOPUI_A" hash="T3KZlg">Over the years I have pondered this experience with my friend Darlene, bothered by its conclusion. However, I have since concluded that viewpoints based on misunderstandings and fallacious teachings should not trouble me, except as I have a responsibility to attempt to clarify such misconceptions. The real issue is not how others define us but how the Savior defines us. So the question is, how does He personally view each and every one of us?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p14" pid="QZJbT92Jb0WFaDrh01Zkdg" hash="yJSU9g">Therefore, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we need to focus our concern with our own relationship to our Heavenly Father and the Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p15" pid="6tm4zhDtjUmifsARG6KRVw" hash="v-ZZ7g">In the last moments of my father’s righteous and exemplary life, with all of the strength he could muster, he uttered in a hardly audible voice, “I only hope the Savior will find me worthy to call me His friend.” Oh, to be called a friend of the Savior! As my father yearned, I also wondered, would Christ count me as one of His sheep? Would He see me striving to exemplify His teachings and live His divine principles? Would He call me a disciple? Would He call me a friend? This is what really matters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p16" pid="mhMaI5pYJU-1kK4GVhSelg" hash="rzYo2Q">The Savior gave the criteria for His friendship in the 15th chapter of John, in which He states, “Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.14" class="scriptureRef">John 15:14</a>). He further gave the acid test when He said, “Ye shall know them by their fruits” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.16" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:16</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.17-18,20" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:17–18, 20</a>). This is how we will all be judged—by our fruits, good or bad. In the final judgment, if our fruits so warrant, we will be invited to sit on the right hand of God. There I believe will be His friends.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p17" pid="rYr1GiVsHk6qefcoMnkfdg" hash="0f26yQ">So, if we, even in our weak and stumbling way, are earnestly striving to live a Christlike life, how others choose to characterize us should be of little consequence. The responsibility for our Christianity is ours. Others may characterize us as they will, but the true and righteous Judge will judge us as we are. Our discipleship is for us to determine, not someone else.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/a-disciple-a-friend.p18" pid="lopRoyVgEUKgz8wahRJAJg" hash="FDyiAQ">When we were baptized we each voluntarily took upon ourselves the name of Christ.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p1" pid="OvYi5DBMyUSFf2bWgN6T2Q" hash="_r5n3w">A few months ago I received a letter from a family friend whom we had not seen for many years. Her letter was an expression of hopelessness and a plea for help. After struggling to raise her children as a single mother, she was now remarried. Her nonmember husband was a rough outdoorsman who attempted to express his manhood through drinking, foul language, tough talk, and questionable behavior. Her great concern was that her husband’s example was teaching her son that these indeed were the traits of manhood. Her plea to me: Is there some way, even though separated by great distances, that I might speak to her son, whom we shall call Ben, about the characteristics of true manhood? In answer to that plea, tonight I shall attempt to respond. Thus I address my remarks to a faraway friend and to all the “Bens” in the Church attempting to measure up as a man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p2" pid="FNszi_0fh0uQWp8ghyQNfg" hash="9hBREw">So, Ben, let’s talk. We all seek acceptance and recognition as we enter the adult world. Adulthood comes to us one way or another if we live long enough. True manhood, however, comes only if and when we earn it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p3" pid="NU0bj048CEu8vqocNM1XMw" hash="iefgcw">Satan is known as the great deceiver. His religion, his philosophy, and his work is based on deception and lies. His objective is to thwart the work of the Lord by misleading us and eventually making us “miserable like unto himself” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>). He would have us believe that he is the man and that his ways bring us to manhood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p4" pid="FIS1GMs2EUOzJV8KQaJBqw" hash="qd6vig">By contrast, Jesus voluntarily submitted Himself to the will of the Father. As a result He was betrayed, accused, beaten, and judged. His sacrifice was not mandatory. It was borne out of courage, duty, and love, and it led Him to the bitter cup that caused Him to bleed from every pore. After Pilate had witnessed the enormous suffering and humiliation of Jesus and even argued for His release, he finally succumbed to the demands of the Jews. As he turned Him over for crucifixion, he did so with the simple but defining words, “Behold the man!” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/19.5" class="scriptureRef">John 19:5</a>). Yes, Jesus is the man. He possesses all characteristics of the true, ideal man. His ways, not Satan’s ways, lead to manhood. Anyone who believes otherwise is already tangling himself up in the everlasting chains of Satan’s deception (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.19" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:19</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p5" pid="eKS0LaojWEmzZH8sxif_0g" hash="JJkJuQ">Ben, every young man must choose between good and evil and between the ways of God and the ways of Satan. When a young man begins to smoke to prove he is a man, whose man is he becoming? When a young man begins drinking, takes drugs, participates in immorality, is boisterous or unruly, whose man is he becoming? It has been said that many a boy begins smoking as a teenager to prove he is a man, and he tries to quit at age 30 for the same reason. There is no manhood in succumbing to Satan. There is no manhood in being defeated by his principles.</p>
      <div class="figure" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.f2">
	<p pid="rwdmVCKxz0ebCC8H43gThQ" hash="cbXMlQ">So, Ben, with this background, let me give you my criteria for true manhood. Because of time constraints, I limit myself to only two criteria of what could be many:</p>
	<ol class="number">
	  <li pid="IfXQ_lCI3Uq2sCTLQVTGpA" hash="iLOJOA">
          <span class="label">1.</span>
          <p pid="VTlEhJU0qkutDGihQg_N1A" hash="Mvoatg">A true man is strong enough to withstand the wiles of Satan.</p>
        </li>
	  <li pid="E3r41vsbe0CI4v4Ajlvnmw" hash="Kxr-TQ">
          <span class="label">2.</span>
          <p pid="h5e0sjcUgU2UgU4B0MO2Fg" hash="_pGYMw">A true man is humble enough to submit himself to the redemptive powers of the Savior.</p>
        </li>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p6" pid="zMqnddJ_DEO7vXbGbBUIxg" hash="VeXP1Q">I suppose it is natural for us to equate strength, machoism, and maybe even boisterous and aggressive behavior with manhood. However, the attributes of true manhood are not necessarily physical. Let me attempt to explain.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p7" pid="Us2Bnt2jVUatLTM_IiR4fA" hash="I9NmZQ">The Apostle Paul warned, “We wrestle not against flesh and blood [which is not the real test of manhood], but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/6.12" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 6:12</a>). Real courage includes standing against the evil one, even when we stand alone, often feeling the disdain and the ridicule of others. This is courage. This is strength. This is manhood, and it can be tough.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p8" pid="oXSB9m8D2UGARmU9PNVDjg" hash="IBiPqw">I know a young man who was thrilled to be selected for an all-star basketball team to play in a tournament in another state. The first evening at the hotel, the other roommates decided to watch pornographic movies. This boy left the room and walked the city by himself well into the night until the movies were over. I am sure it was embarrassing, lonely, and challenging. But that is courage; that is manhood in its truest sense. And I say, “Behold a man!”—an 18-year-old boy turned man. I know hundreds of young men who have withstood ridicule and embarrassment to turn down drugs, alcohol, and sex in order to turn to serve one another, provide a righteous example, or defend the principles of righteousness. All young men must face the wiles of Satan. It is impossible to escape this fight. But it is always possible to come out victorious. Yes, a true man is strong enough to withstand the wiles of Satan.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p9" pid="M6k0dDCDp0GSfRD2dP40BA" hash="Q3hSag">Ben, some burdens that we are called to bear are so heavy that we can only conquer them through humility, submissiveness, and contrition. That sounds like a contradiction, doesn’t it—gaining strength and power through humility, submissiveness, and contrition. But that is one of the great ironies of life—we can receive power beyond our natural ability by submitting our will to the Father. We all fall victim to the tempter to some degree. Sometimes we even get entangled in serious transgression—transgression that has eternal consequences. Those who have committed serious transgression must follow the carefully planned path of repentance provided by the Savior and often directed by a bishop or stake president. This becomes the true test of manhood, and not all are man enough to meet this challenge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p10" pid="qwfFLTVbMkOPTfjd-YOXaw" hash="xikmrg">Some months ago I was given the assignment to interview a young man, 21 years old, to determine if his repentance was sufficient for him to serve a mission. My heart ached as I read of the serious problems and transgressions in his past. I wondered if it would be possible that one with such a background could ever prepare himself to worthily serve a mission. At the appointed time for my interview I saw a handsome young man approaching me. He was immaculately groomed and had a wonderful countenance about him. He looked like a returned missionary, and I wondered who he was. As he approached he extended his hand and, to my surprise, introduced himself as the young man I was to interview.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p11" pid="ryoak4FNVEGsfR5ngcG0vg" hash="CMmGuw">During the interview I simply asked, “Why am I visiting with you tonight?” Then he laid out the sordid details of his past. After reviewing and confessing again his transgression, he began talking to me about the Atonement and the years of painful repentance that brought him to this very interview. He expressed his love for the Savior and then explained that Christ’s Atonement was sufficient to rescue even a boy like him. At the conclusion of the interview, I placed my hand on his shoulder and said, “When I get back to Church headquarters, my recommendation will be that you be permitted to serve a mission.” And then I said, “I ask only one thing of you—just one. If you are privileged to serve, I want you to be the best missionary in the entire Church. That is all.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p12" pid="6ZjCkL3JfEWg4AktnMkVmw" hash="ZNSzMw">About four months later I was speaking at a missionary devotional at the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah. After the devotional I was standing in front of the podium greeting missionaries when I noticed a familiar face approaching me. My first thought was that I was about to be embarrassed because I was supposed to know this young man. I could not remember where I had met him, and I knew the first question that he was going to ask me. Sure enough, he extended his hand and asked, “Do you remember me?” Apologetically and somewhat embarrassingly, I answered: “I am sorry. I know I should know you, but I just do not remember.” He then said: “Well, let me tell you who I am. I am the best missionary in the MTC.” I could not withhold the tear that slowly trickled down my cheek as I thought: “Here is a man. He met his Gethsemane. He paid the painful price of repentance. He has humbled himself and submitted himself to the redemptive power of the Savior. He has met the challenges. He has measured up to true manhood.” And I say, “Behold a man,” a man humble enough to submit himself to the redemptive powers of the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p13" pid="_TNPKjOts0CfOLK8o83JPg" hash="uHYSSA">Ben, you can describe a man in inches, pounds, complexion, or physique. But you measure a man by character, compassion, integrity, tenderness, and principle. Simply stated, the measures of a man are embedded in his heart and soul, not in his physical attributes (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 16:7</a>). But they can be viewed in conduct and demeanor. The qualities of manhood are so often evident in this thing we call countenance. When Alma queried, “Have ye received his image [meaning the Savior—the true man] in your countenances?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>), he, my friend, was talking about the attributes of true manhood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p14" pid="Ey3hnaFjEE-gjUN71xrgLg" hash="e-ib_A">Yes, Ben, Satan has his man and God has His man, and Satan has his characteristics of manhood and God has His. Satan would present his characteristics as the true measurement of manhood and God’s criteria as weak and wimpy. But one must understand that Satan’s criteria will almost always be the easiest and the wimpiest. Satan’s way takes no courage, no character, no personal strength, and it proves no manhood at all.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p15" pid="h4nP0CwMs0acAI8yxcs2MA" hash="Nj_7Ng">A true man does not need Satan to lead him down the easy path with his everlasting chains of destruction. A true man is strong enough to withstand the wiles of Satan and humble enough to submit himself to the redemptive powers of the Savior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/behold-the-man.p16" pid="GnHw5QyxtUGDF_SkGi86Lw" hash="ciiKLA">Moses, in a moment of both motivation and rebuke, charged the Israelites, “Who is on the Lord’s side?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/32.26" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 32:26</a>). What he was really asking was, “Whose man are you, anyway?” Our Father in Heaven is called “Man of Holiness” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.57" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:57</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.35" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:35</a>). That is a title we reserve with reverence for the Supreme Being. It is not a title we take upon ourselves, Ben. But every priesthood bearer should seek to be known simply as a man of God. That, my dear friend, is manhood. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Many college-age youths came to work in that pristine, beautiful area.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/satans-bag-of-snipes.p2" pid="Cv2JSXyDEUqwGXzxb7gybA" hash="99BCoQ">One such person was Jill, a young woman from San Francisco, California. Feeling that a young woman from a big city might be a little bit naive about her new environment, I and a few friends felt it our obligation to teach her about the ways of the real West. We decided to take her on a “snipe hunt.” For those of you who may not be familiar with a snipe hunt, it is a practical joke, as there is no such thing as a snipe, at least not in the western United States. The tools necessary for a snipe hunt are a stick and a cloth bag. The “hunter” is told to go through the brush, beating the bushes with a stick while calling the snipe in a high-pitched, ridiculous voice. The nonexistent snipes are thus to be driven into the cloth bag.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/satans-bag-of-snipes.p3" pid="FStnFbzbWE2Y8BQAS7Ni6g" hash="9jwYYA">We gave Jill her cloth bag and a stick and an area to hunt across the hill. The plan was to return to our starting point in about 15 minutes, at which time we would supposedly count our snipes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/satans-bag-of-snipes.p4" pid="upFy4A9QMkSlE9XvRJKXrg" hash="-Z-sXA">When she did not return at the appointed time, we gloated and took delight in the seriousness with which she took her hunt. After about 30 minutes, we felt it was time to rescue her, explain the joke, have a good laugh, and all go to dinner. However, it became apparent that she had taken her snipe hunt more seriously than we had expected—she was not to be found in her assigned area. After searching rather extensively and still finding no evidence of her, we began moving into the woods, calling for her at the top of our voices, but to no avail.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/satans-bag-of-snipes.p5" pid="nrVJrcrHZ0SY48aJG3H6Uw" hash="_LaqBQ">Hoping she might have gone back to her dormitory, we returned and asked some young women to search for her there, but this also was to no avail. It was now turning dark, and our concern heightened. We enlisted all the young men we could from the boys’ dormitory, and with flashlights continued the search deep into the woods. Well into the darkness of night—frightened, concerned, and hoarse from calling—we decided it was now time to report our ridiculous deed to the park rangers. While we were standing in front of the dorms, trying to determine which brave soul would have the privilege of reporting her disappearance, Jill suddenly appeared—not from her dormitory, but rather from that of a friend, with whom she had enjoyed dinner (which we incidentally missed) and a comfortable evening with her friends. Her first words to us as she approached said it all: “How do you fellows like hunting <span class="emphasis">snipe hunters?</span>” Well, so much for big city naïveté, and so much for the ways of the real West. The joke was on us, and I have never had a desire for any more snipe hunting.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/satans-bag-of-snipes.p6" pid="wh8nXuma6EK8vY8PEnHhew" hash="UYlyHw">But there is another “snipe hunt” going on all around us, and we may be the naive victims. It is not a practical joke, and it will not end with a good laugh and a little warm fellowship. Satan is the great deceiver, liar, and enemy to all that is good, including our happiness and our well-being. His great desire is to thwart our Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness and make us “miserable like unto himself” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>). Being the very author and perpetrator of deceit, he in effect would invite us to join him in his snipe hunt, to fill our bags with excitement, fun, popularity, and the so-called “good life.” But his promises are as illusionary as the nonexistent snipe. What he really offers are lies, misery, spiritual degradation, and loss of self-worth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/satans-bag-of-snipes.p7" pid="eZnbewWdoEy1cURGbotcWg" hash="6bUNTw">Satan’s sales pitch as he sends us off to fill our bags is “Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:7</a>). His invitation may seem enticing and convincing. Nephi describes his sales techniques as pacifying, flattering, and lulling as he declares, “All is well” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21-22" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:21–22</a>). Among other things Satan would have us put in our bags is immorality in all its forms, including pornography, language, dress, and behavior. But such evil deeds bring emotional distress, loss of spirituality, loss of self-respect, and lost opportunity for a mission or temple marriage, and sometimes even unwanted pregnancy. Satan would enslave us by having us put drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and other addictive behaviors into our bags.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/satans-bag-of-snipes.p8" pid="U3CTzOmiiUiEco-kDPCYsQ" hash="_uCdEA">Satan will tell us that these things are OK and that “everybody is doing it.” He will tell us that they bring popularity and acceptance.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/for-thy-good.p1" pid="bbZ6obdRrE2e8HF1XPpWNA" hash="i2Vc5A">Some time ago I received an anonymous letter from a heartbroken mother expressing her suffering and pain for a son who had committed grievous transgressions, badly hurting innocent loved ones.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/for-thy-good.p2" pid="-6ejKb2YIEil21XIDYs2CQ" hash="cVFnIg">Since her anonymous letter to me, and feeling her despair, I have had a great desire to express my love to her and others in similar circumstances in an attempt to give some comfort and hope to those who are anonymously and privately carrying heavy burdens, often known only to them and a loving Father in Heaven.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/for-thy-good.p3" pid="d7OL7UMLekuWi01Op7pakg" hash="xHnWaw">I know, Sister Anonymous, that what I say will only be a reminder, but still another testimony to what you already know.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/for-thy-good.p4" pid="2lHHs6wO7EuJF9Ua2EeUMg" hash="OHL8vQ">When the Prophet Joseph Smith, suffering what had to be one of his darkest moments while confined to the dungeon called Liberty Jail, cried out, “O God, where art thou?” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:1</a>), the Lord comforted him with these words: “Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:7</a>). How difficult it is and painfully foreign it may seem to find the good out of our personal tragedy and suffering. How inconsistent the words “for thy good” may seem.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/for-thy-good.p5" pid="I-kY5Wxup068hoG8gvWooQ" hash="uA6pGQ">However, an understanding of Christ’s plan of redemption helps put it all into perspective. In our preexistent state our Father in Heaven presented His plan for mortality, which Alma described as the “plan of happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.8" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:8</a>). I believe we all understood that by coming to earth, we would be exposed to all of the experiences of earth life, including the not-so-pleasant trials of pain, suffering, hopelessness, sin, and death. There would be opposition and adversity. And if that was all we knew about the plan, I doubt if any of us would have embraced it, rejoicing, “That’s what I have always wanted—pain, suffering, hopelessness, sin, and death.” But it all came into focus, and it became acceptable, even desirable, when an Elder Brother stepped forward and offered that He would go down and make it all right. Out of pain and suffering He would bring peace. Out of hopelessness He would bring hope. Out of transgression He would bring repentance and forgiveness. Out of death He would bring the resurrection of lives. And with that explanation and most generous offer, each and every one of us concluded, “I can do that. That is a risk worth taking.” And so we chose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/for-thy-good.p6" pid="f3AwI3axJU6SaMKRNWI72A" hash="WLzxRQ">The unfathomable extent of Christ’s mercy and His Atonement are explained by Amulek in the 34th chapter of Alma in the Book of Mormon. Amulek explains that there must be a “great and last sacrifice” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:10</a>). And then he clarifies that this cannot be a sacrifice of beast or fowl similar to those already known to man. It had to be a sacrifice of a God—Jesus Christ. For this must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice. And so the sacrifice was made, and by faith we find ourselves traveling this journey we call mortality. As a result, our hearts are saddened with the unexplained loss of a child, or the supposed untimely illness or disability of a loved one. Single parents struggle to provide financial security and the reassuring influences of the gospel in their home. And maybe most difficult of all is the pain experienced of helplessly watching the suffering of a loved one because of sin and transgression.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/for-thy-good.p7" pid="c-CjdbwwNE-3zQ7tXVO4jQ" hash="Iobnpg">There are few of us, if any, who don’t walk the refiner’s fire of adversity and despair, sometimes known to others but for many quietly hidden and privately endured. Most of the heartache, pain, and suffering we would not choose today. But we did choose. We chose when we could see the complete plan. We chose when we had a clear vision of the Savior’s rescue of us. And if our faith and understanding were as clear today as it was when we first made that choice, I believe we would choose again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/for-thy-good.p8" pid="wTGvUAHyOk64CxzM78xVWg" hash="bMf4tA">Therefore, perhaps the challenge is to have the kind of faith during the hard times that we exercised when we first chose. The kind of faith that turns questioning and even anger into acknowledging the power, blessings, and hope that can come only from Him who is the source of all power, blessings, and hope. The kind of faith that brings the knowledge and assurances that all that we experience is part of the gospel plan and that for the righteous, all that appears wrong will eventually be made right. The peace and understanding to endure with dignity and clarity of purpose can be the sweet reward. This kind of faith can help us to see the good, even when life’s path seems to be layered only with thorns, thistles, and craggy rocks.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/04/for-thy-good.p9" pid="Bq9Vl31RaEeMkukj6k27DA" hash="pE0DaQ">When Jesus and His disciples passed a man who was blind since his birth, His disciples queried, “Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>

We can seek out those memorable moments that are frequently hidden by the pain and agony. We can find peace in extending ourselves to others, using our own experiences to provide hope and comfort. And we can always remember with great solemnity and gratitude Him who suffered most to make it all right for us. And by so doing we can be strengthened to bear our burdens in peace. And then, the “works of God” might be manifest.</p>

That means the Atonement was for you in your suffering. It is personal, as He is intimately acquainted with your trials and sorrows, for He has already suffered them. It means there can always be a new beginning for every one of us—even a son who has committed serious transgressions. It means as we move ahead through life’s trials and tribulations, shackled with feelings of hopelessness, we focus not on where we have been but where we are going. We focus not on what has been but what can be.</p>

But, may I point out, it was from the cold, dark corners of Liberty Jail that came some of the most beautiful, comforting scriptures given to man, concluding with the words, “All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.” Likewise, out of our adversity we might seek our greatest triumphs, and the day may well come that from our challenges we will understand the familiar words “for thy good.”</p>

As each member took his turn responding, the answers were not unexpected. Of course someone named the Savior, the Redeemer of the world. Another spoke of Abraham Lincoln, who freed the slaves, led the United States through a civil war, and eventually unified the country. Others chose the Prophet Joseph Smith and our beloved current prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley. As each named a hero, I silently concurred and acknowledged that all were men worthy of emulating and that I would be a better person if I possessed some of the qualities that made those men great.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-empowerment-of-humility.p2" pid="mVjnnJNg00yHTP20FFyFxA" hash="5XDb6A">When my turn came to respond, I turned to a brother on my right, a few seats down the row from me, and said, “My hero is Ken Sweatfield and his wife, Jo Ann.” For 20 years I watched Ken and Jo Ann care for their comatose son with all the love and patience a parent could possibly give. I had often pondered the shattered hopes and dreams they surely had for Shane before he suffered a terrible automobile accident just two weeks before he was to begin his mission in Leeds, England. I have watched Ken and Jo Ann wheel Shane into the sunlight or push him through the neighborhood, describing the scenery, hoping that he might hear and feel, and hoping that the fresh air and sunlight might lighten a very subdued spirit. For 20 years there were no vacations from this care, few evenings out, but there was always a spirit of faith, optimism, and gratitude—never a show of anger, despair, or questioning of God’s purposes.</p>

When I heard of the accident, I rushed to the hospital, hoping to hear that Zach was alive and would recover. The parents, in a most dignified and peaceful manner, explained that Zach would now be serving his mission on the other side of the veil. As I witnessed the calm resolve of these two strong parents, I realized that through the pain and anguish there was a peace that could come only through a deep and abiding faith in a loving Father and an atoning Savior. My faith was strengthened, and through their inspiration my resolve to follow their example in meeting similar trials and tragedies was reaffirmed.</p>

I could have named dozens of others that I admire and could call my heroes. Many do not hold so-called high or prominent callings in the Church, but all are worthy to hold any position. None are widely known to the general membership of the Church, but all, I am certain, are known by name to our Heavenly Father.</p>

Some I have seen regularly in sacrament meeting for more than 20 years. Again, most are not in the limelight of the Church, but all consistently attend their meetings and privately meet life’s challenges.</p>

They are not seeking position, prominence, or fame, but each is earning a place in our Father’s kingdom by taking care of the business of everyday living. They are consistently doing the unnoticed, the unspectacular, but humbly and righteously doing the important. Challenges they have, but out of their bitter struggles they are able to find the sweetness that is so often the silent companion to adversity. This picture is duplicated hundreds of times in thousands of wards throughout the world. They are The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

These humble members come from all nationalities, all social strata, and every economic background. They include those of the highest educational backgrounds as well as those of the humblest who live in the smallest hamlets in the most remote areas of the world—all having hearts throbbing with a vital testimony of Jesus Christ and a desire to serve the Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-empowerment-of-humility.p8" pid="1Q3tq_Wyjk-BidSzk6P-ng" hash="YJNb5g">As I have pondered these faithful members, I am struck by two qualities they all seem to have. First, regardless of social or economic status or position, their humility leads to submissiveness to the Lord’s will. And second, in spite of the difficulties and trials of life, they are able to maintain a sense of gratitude for God’s blessings and life’s goodness. Humility and gratitude are truly the twin characteristics of happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-empowerment-of-humility.p9" pid="WhB00HEZuU-KW6bea1lrZQ" hash="ezPkag">A story is told of an encounter between the Prophet Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. In the presence of a rather large group of brethren, the Prophet severely chastised Brother Brigham for some failing in his duty. Everyone, I suppose somewhat stunned, waited to see what Brigham’s response would be. After all, Brigham, who later became known as the Lion of the Lord, was no shrinking violet by any means. Brigham slowly rose to his feet, and in words that truly reflected his character and his humility, he simply bowed his head and said, “Joseph, what do you want me to do?” The story goes that sobbing, Joseph ran from the podium, threw his arms around Brigham, and said in effect, “You passed, Brother Brigham, you passed” (see Truman G. Madsen, “Hugh B. Brown—Youthful Veteran,” <span class="emphasis">New Era,</span> Apr. 1976, 16).</p>

Not many corporations or institutions include humility as a value statement or a desired characteristic of their management. Yet as we learn about the workings of God, the power of a humble and submissive spirit becomes apparent. In the kingdom of God, greatness begins with humility and submissiveness. These companion virtues are the first critical steps to opening the doors to the blessings of God and the power of the priesthood. It matters not who we are or how lofty our credentials appear. Humility and submissiveness to the Lord, coupled with a grateful heart, are our strength and our hope.</p>

We see the prominent business executive graciously and humbly receiving and being taught by a humble, sometimes even intimidated, home teacher. We see the highly educated humbly following counsel from their bishops, who sometimes have little formal education. We see former bishops and stake presidents graciously and humbly accepting calls to teach in the Primary, assist in the nursery, or assemble humanitarian kits to be sent to the needy throughout the world. We see thousands of mature couples leaving their comfortable homes to live in circumstances to which they are not accustomed, to humbly serve the poverty-stricken throughout the world—and then serve again and again and again. We see the poverty-stricken in the world humbly sacrificing to share their meager substance of life with those who are even more destitute. And each, in their humility, is serving and giving with a grateful heart and giving praise to God.</p>

It is the power to meet life’s adversities, the power of peace, the power of hope, the power of a heart throbbing with a love for and testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ, even the power of redemption. To this end, the Savior is our supreme example of the power of humility and submissiveness. After all, His submitting His will to the Father brought about the greatest, and even the most powerful, event in all of history. Perhaps some of the most sacred words in all the scriptures are simply, “Not my will, but thine, be done” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.42" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:42</a>).</p>

And, as President Hinckley has asked of each of us, they are just doing their best—one day at a time.</p>

Ninety-six scientists from 24 countries attended. As I surveyed the audience during my remarks, I was impressed by the many nations represented, as evidenced by their dress, skin color, language, and other distinguishing features.</p>

As I sat on the stand in preparation for the priesthood leadership session, an African man entered the chapel and sat down by the aisle. He looked vaguely familiar, but I couldn’t remember where I might have seen him. I leaned over and asked the stake president who the man was. The stake president answered, “Oh, he is not a member of the Church. He is a visiting professor from Africa teaching at a prestigious university in the area. A few months ago he attended some kind of scientific seminar in Salt Lake City. He picked up a pamphlet about the Church, which led him to read everything he could find about the Church. He now attends every meeting possible.” Half in jest, the stake president then said, “I would be surprised if he were not attending Relief Society meetings.”</p>

He affirmed his excitement for this newly discovered source of truth. He explained that his family, still in Africa, was studying with the missionaries and would be joining him in America in about four weeks, at which time they would all be baptized together.</p>

I can hardly contain it in my body. I don’t know if I can wait the four weeks for my family to be baptized.” I suggested he ought to slow down his heart and wait for his wife and children, so all could be baptized together.</p>

As Elijah stood upon the mount before the Lord, he felt “a great and strong wind … ; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.11-12" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 19:11–12</a>).</p>

The answer to that question is simply a still, small voice and then a throbbing heart. In this busy, tumultuous, and noisy world, it is not like a wind, it is not like a fire, it is not like an earthquake; but it is a still, small, but a very discernible voice, and it causes a throbbing heart. It is a quiet burning within that this is the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, with all of its doctrine, priesthood, and covenants that had been lost through the many centuries of darkness and confusion. Yes, it is a still, small voice and a throbbing heart that testifies of the miracle of the Restoration.</p>

It is a still, small voice and a throbbing heart that motivates thousands of retired couples to serve missions, usually for 18 months or longer. They put aside the comforts of life to go into the world, serving others at their own expense and at what some would consider substantial sacrifice, often serving in remote parts of the world where a hot shower and a comfortable bed are luxuries that linger only in their memories.</p>

It is a still, small voice and a throbbing heart that gives our young people the desire and courage to stand for purity, honesty, and principle, even at the expense of sometimes being ridiculed and rejected. It is a still, small voice and a throbbing heart that motivates one to joyfully keep God’s commandments and share the burdens of those less fortunate. Yes, there is power in a still, small voice and a throbbing heart.</p>

He asks, “Have ye spiritually been born of God?” And then: “Have ye received his image in your countenances? <span class="emphasis">Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>; e”mphasis added). In other words, is your heart throbbing with a testimony of Jesus Christ?</p>

First, my heart throbs with the knowledge that Jesus Christ is my personal Savior and that His love for me was sufficient that He would suffer unimaginable pain and even death. My heart throbs when in the solitude of my deep thoughts I realize I can be cleansed, purified, and redeemed through the blood of Jesus Christ. My heart throbs when I contemplate the price that was paid—the suffering incurred to spare me of similar personal suffering for my sins and transgressions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/a-still-small-voice-and-a-throbbing-heart.p11" pid="KjijTF4YI0ar0q_kGx-VQg" hash="B299_A">Second, my heart throbs with the knowledge that a young boy, only 14 years of age, went into a grove of trees and from a simple, humble prayer the heavens opened, God and Christ appeared, and angels descended. And thus, the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored with all of its priesthood, covenants, and purity of doctrine. My heart throbs when I consider what this boy prophet endured to bring about the fulness of the restored gospel. While heavenly angels were descending, Satan’s angels were also at work. The persecutions began, and like the lives of prophets of old, Joseph’s life culminated in his martyrdom. Throughout all his trials and persecutions, the young prophet remained steadfast and determined.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/a-still-small-voice-and-a-throbbing-heart.p12" pid="rSP95Fthx027Yej6rcVEKQ" hash="MHh0-w">Because of the Prophet Joseph Smith, I understand more fully the magnitude of Christ’s Atonement. Because of the Prophet Joseph, I better understand the significance of the Garden of Gethsemane—a place of great suffering as Christ assumed our personal suffering not only for our sins, but also for our pains, infirmities, trials, and tragedies. I understand the infinite and eternal nature of His great and last sacrifice. I better understand the love our Savior exemplified in His last redeeming act. Because of Joseph Smith, my love and gratitude for the Savior is magnified and my worship more meaningful. Among the many hymns in our hymnbook written by W. W. Phelps is the familiar song with the words “Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!” (“Praise to the Man,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 27). My heart throbs as I sing that song.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/a-still-small-voice-and-a-throbbing-heart.p13" pid="xTJsxcvfLE-jttxZEaCSfA" hash="HkonbA">Yes, because we sing with enthusiasm and gusto, “Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!” we sing about the Savior with even more reverence, emotion, and gratitude with the words “Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me / Enough to die for me! / Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!” (“I Stand All Amazed,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 193). My heart throbs because of the enlightenment the Prophet Joseph brought to my life regarding the personal effect of the Atonement of my Savior.</p>

Because of this sacred companion to the Bible, my understanding of Christ’s doctrine is expanded; thus many of the questions left unanswered in the Bible are explained to my full satisfaction. The Book of Mormon is tangible evidence that Joseph is a prophet of God, Christ did in reality appear to him, and the gospel has been restored in its purity and its fulness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/a-still-small-voice-and-a-throbbing-heart.p15" pid="hf9u1aJ4HkqyjqmDzTqk4g" hash="0VGsjQ">My heart throbs just to contemplate the miracle of the Book of Mormon’s existence—the laborious job of engraving on metal plates, the careful custodianship through the centuries by God’s chosen, and the miraculous translation. Truly it fits the perfect definition of holy writ. Because of God’s majestic love for us, He provided this evidence that we can handle, we can peruse, we can study, and we can even challenge. But, most important, God loves me enough that He will give me and anyone else who sincerely seeks a personal revelation of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon—the tangible evidence of the Restoration and that Joseph Smith was a true prophet.</p>

Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.45-46" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:45–46</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/a-still-small-voice-and-a-throbbing-heart.p19" pid="OIRdz9buoU2xumKGPeQp1w" hash="0oAUUw">Like Alma of old, each of us, members and sincere investigators alike, can know with surety that these things are true. It is our great privilege to know. It is more than a privilege; it is our responsibility to know. It is our enormous loss to not know when such a privilege is given. The Lord has said, “Knock, and it shall be opened unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:7</a>). The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob says, “Come with full purpose of heart” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6.5" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 6:5</a>). We do not need to rely upon intellect or our physical senses. We study, we pray, and, like Alma of old, we may even fast, and then comes a still, small voice and a throbbing heart. Imagine a personal revelation from God that these things are true. The very thought of it makes my heart throb. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="72"></span>In front of this vast worldwide audience and with some reservation, I make a personal confession. I do this as an introduction to a subject that has weighed heavily on my mind for some time. In 1955, after my freshman year of college, I spent the summer working at the newly opened Jackson Lake Lodge, located in Moran, Wyoming. My mode of transportation was a 14-year-old 1941 Hudson automobile that should have received its burial 10 years earlier. Among the car’s other identifying traits, the floorboards had rusted so badly that, if not for a piece of plywood, I could have literally dragged my feet on the highway. The positive is that unlike most 14-year-old cars in this time period, it used no oil—lots of water in the radiator, but no oil. I could never figure out where the water went and why the oil continually got thinner and thinner and clearer and clearer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p2" pid="eqTwooaJWEiEvnijV9ryEg" hash="bxhTug">In preparation for the 185-mile (298-km) drive home at the end of the summer, I took the car to the only mechanic in Moran. After a quick analysis, the mechanic explained that the engine block was cracked and was leaking water into the oil. That explained the water and oil mystery. I wondered if I could get the water to leak into the gas tank; I would get better gasoline mileage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p3" pid="Rribu55SdEmUI9DoyjQErQ" hash="9dK-BQ">Now the confession: after the miracle of arriving home, my father came out and happily greeted me. After a hug and a few pleasantries, he looked into the backseat of the car and saw three Jackson Lake Lodge towels—the kind you cannot buy. With a disappointed look he merely said, “I expected more of you.” I hadn’t thought that what I had done was all that wrong. To me these towels were <span class="pageBreak" page-number="73"></span>but a symbol of a full summer’s work at a luxury hotel, a rite of passage. Nevertheless, by taking them I felt I had lost the trust and confidence of my father, and I was devastated.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/three-towels-and-a-25-cent-newspaper.p4" pid="lrphchbgq0yOGd3YoJQyng" hash="Tb4aSw">The following weekend I adjusted the plywood floorboard in my car, filled the radiator with water, and began the 370-mile (595-km) round trip back to Jackson Lake Lodge to return three towels. My father never asked why I was returning to the lodge, and I never explained. It just didn’t need to be said. This was an expensive and painful lesson on honesty that has stayed with me throughout my life.</p>

In the past few years an increasing number of business leaders have been exposed for dishonesty and other forms of bad behavior. As a result, tens of thousands of loyal, long-term employees have lost their livelihoods and pensions. For some this has resulted in loss of homes, change of education and other life plans. We read and hear of widespread cheating in our schools, with more concern about receiving a grade or degree than learning and preparation. We hear of students who have cheated their way through medical school and are now performing complicated procedures on their patients. The elderly and others are victims of scam artists, often resulting in the loss of homes or life savings. Always this dishonesty and lack of integrity are based on greed, arrogance, and disrespect.</p>

When he handed me a newspaper, I put a quarter in the machine and, trying not to offend but to make a point, jokingly said, “Jim, for 25 cents I can maintain my integrity. A dollar, questionable, but 25 cents—no, not for 25 cents.” You see, I remembered well the experience of three towels and a broken-down 1941 Hudson. A few minutes later we passed the same newspaper vending machine. I noticed that Jim had broken away from our group and was stuffing quarters in the vending machine. I tell you this incident not to portray myself as an unusual example of honesty, but only to emphasize the lessons of three towels and a 25-cent newspaper.</p>

For Latter-day Saints, honesty is an important requirement for entering the Lord’s holy temple. Honesty is embedded in the covenants that we make in the temple. Each Sunday as we partake of the holy emblems of the Savior’s flesh and blood, we again renew our basic and sacred covenants—which encompass honesty. As Latter-day Saints we have a sacred obligation to not only teach the principles of honesty, but also to live them, perhaps with examples as simple as three towels or a 25-cent newspaper. Honesty should be among the most fundamental values that govern our everyday living.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="9"></span>A couple of years ago a humor columnist for a local newspaper wrote on a serious and thought-provoking subject. I quote from this article: “Being a go-to-church Mormon in Utah means living so close to fellow ward members that not much happens that the entire congregation doesn’t know about in five minutes tops.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="nn9fmixiZ06yBBjqZrqByw" hash="1AVH8g">He continues: “This kind of cheek-to-jowl living can be intrusive. … It also happens to be one of our greatest strengths.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="cZwODL2kqU2Y2X6zEh39xw" hash="2KoVpg">The author goes on to say: “At work on Tuesday, I caught the noon news broadcast on television. A van had been obliterated in a traffic crash. A young mother and two small children were being rushed to emergency rooms by helicopter and ambulance. … Hours later I learned that the van belonged to the young couple living across the street from me in Herriman, Eric and Jeana Quigley.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="osslh__ZwEOyVmAnFSNLqw" hash="86dHnA">“Not only do I see the Quigleys in church, … we ate dinner with them at a neighborhood party the night before the crash. Our grandkids played with daughters Bianca and Miranda. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="ti7XVGv980mhLGlGIdx8GQ" hash="hchfdw">“Fourteen-month-old Miranda suffered serious head injuries and died three days later at Primary Children’s Hospital.</p>

Although the accident occurred several miles from home, the dust literally had not settled before someone from the ward stopped and was pulling through the wreckage. The rest of the ward knew about it before the cops and paramedics showed up.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="Q0zgfDpP8kSnlznVVNSmRA" hash="5YPTgw">“Ward members went to all three hospitals, contacted Eric at work, and organized into labor squads.

C1).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="RUR6ys7zfEKaHVXnIQuenA" hash="YYzLxw">The compassion and service rendered by caring ward members as a result of this tragic accident are not unique to this particular incident. The Book of Mormon prophet Alma explained to prospective followers of Christ: “As ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light; yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort,” then, as Alma explained, they were prepared for baptism (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:8–9</a>). This scripture lays the foundation for ministering and caring in a most compassionate way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="m3e7BpheSUGUGJBduwCNzg" hash="7G1esg">The ward is organized to minister to the needs of those who face even the most difficult and heartbreaking trials. The bishop, often considered the “father” of the ward, is there to provide counsel and resources. But also close at hand are Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood leaders, the Relief Society presidency, home teachers, visiting teachers, and the ward members—always the ward members. All are there to administer comfort and show compassion in times of need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="diksGtAaAkiIbNzsb7YItw" hash="Ztmvxg">In my own immediate neighborhood we have had our share of heart-wrenching tragedies. In October 1998, 19-year-old Zac Newton, who lived only three houses east of us, was killed in a tragic automobile accident.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="LtCeOLIy6UC7oxQesTm1RA" hash="Gu-X5g">Less than two years later, in July, 19-year-old Andrea Richards, who lived directly across from the Newtons, was killed in an automobile accident.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="AoLgeWk0AkePa20NDerd_w" hash="6q7MRg">One Saturday afternoon in July 2006, Travis Bastian, a 28-year-old returned missionary, and his 15-year-old sister, Desiree, who lived across the street and two houses north of us, were killed in a terrible automobile accident.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="JPIvnLsEskeXm3gG4rSRNA" hash="GeKcYw">One month later, in August 2006, 32-year-old Eric Gold, who grew up in the house next door to us, suffered a premature death. And others in this neighborhood have also suffered heart-wrenching experiences privately endured and known only to themselves and God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="DMuTxt4IAEix1DfUWxid3Q" hash="9kXZHg">With the loss of five young people, one might assume that this is an unusual number of trials for one small neighborhood. I choose to think the number only seems large because of a close, caring ward, whose members know when there is a pressing need. It is a ward with members who are following the admonition of Alma and the Savior—members who care and love and bear one another’s burdens, members who are willing to mourn with those that mourn, members who are willing to comfort those in need of comfort, members who endure together.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="3nGjTRJLxE-9Ls3woswGdw" hash="oGYyRA">In each of these instances we saw an outpouring of love, service, and compassion that was inspirational to all. Bishops arrived, home and visiting teachers went into action, and Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthood quorums and Relief Societies organized to take care of both spiritual and temporal needs. Refrigerators were stocked, houses cleaned, lawns mowed, shrubs trimmed, fences painted, blessings given, and soft shoulders were available for crying on. Members were everywhere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/10/enduring-together.p" pid="ajwkeLV5OkOiqQcIiyIoIQ" hash="gDb2tw">In every one of these instances, the families who lost a loved one expressed increased faith, increased love for the Savior, increased gratitude for the Atonement, and heartfelt thankfulness for an organization that responds to the deepest emotional and spiritual needs of its members. These families now speak about how they got to know the Lord through their adversity. They relate many sweet <span class="pageBreak" page-number="11"></span>experiences that grew out of their pain. They testify that blessings can emerge from heartbreak. They give praise to the Lord and would echo the words of Job, “The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/1.21" class="scriptureRef">Job 1:21</a>).</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="53"></span>My brethren of the priesthood, in recent years we have witnessed many emergencies and natural disasters throughout the world. Among them have been hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, and a devastating tsunami.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/this-is-your-phone-call.p2" pid="EmmwEwqRe02csmILIeqoVg" hash="-v8orQ">The Church has responded to these and many other disasters in marvelous ways. Groups of members have quickly mobilized to go and help those in need. They all felt good knowing they were blessing the lives of others through their service.</p>

They ask, “How do you do it?” The response to this question can be simply stated as “We are prepared, we have organization, we have empathy, and we have charity.” It usually just takes a few phone calls from presiding authorities to local leaders to mobilize hundreds and sometimes thousands of individuals to go to the rescue of their fellow brothers and sisters in distress.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/this-is-your-phone-call.p4" pid="ZBZy6ecOOEW3vIZZu6-TxQ" hash="iwOOhQ">Tonight I wish to speak of another challenge to which we have opportunities to respond, and brethren, <span class="emphasis">this is your phone call.</span> This challenge is not one of natural causes; however, its effects are real and are being felt globally. And while we are optimistic about the future, we continue—as we have for decades—to espouse the fundamental principle that we are our brother’s keeper.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/this-is-your-phone-call.p5" pid="4AoP4teJXEuYAhIi4wVosg" hash="l-_02g">Elder Robert D.

The impact of this economic storm on our Heavenly Father’s children requires a gospel vision of welfare today more than ever before.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> The unemployment and financial wakes of this storm are splashing over every stake and every ward throughout the Church. I suspect they have been felt in some way by each of us, whether personally—through members of our families or extended families—or through someone we know.</p>

We have the organization. Stake presidents, bishops, elders quorum presidents, and high priests group leaders—we now call upon you to mobilize our priesthood quorums in response to the employment and financial challenges facing our members. <span class="emphasis">Consider this your personal phone call.</span> Now is the time to rally around, lift up, and help the families in our quorums who may be in distress.</p>

Among our quorum members, you will likely find those who know of job openings and others who are skilled at writing résumés or assisting in interview preparation. Regardless of titles or skills, you will find a brotherhood committed to bear one another’s burdens.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/this-is-your-phone-call.p8" pid="ikIscpskp0OwAc_7ch1sYg" hash="3TKf_w">President Monson tells the story of a retired executive named Ed who lived the example of a quorum member. On one occasion President Monson was speaking with Ed and asked him, “‘Ed, what are you doing in the Church?’ He replied, ‘I have the best assignment in the ward. My responsibility is to help men who are unemployed find permanent employment. This year I have helped 12 of my brethren who were out of work to obtain good jobs. I have never been happier in my entire life.’” President Monson continues, “Short in stature, ‘Little Ed,’ as we affectionately called him, stood tall that evening as his eyes glistened and his voice quavered. He showed his love by helping those in need. He restored human dignity. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="54"></span>He opened doors for those who knew not how to do so themselves.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/this-is-your-phone-call.p9" pid="MmwIvgzZLUO61WovSl2fCQ" hash="Xrzomw">There are many ways bishops and quorum members can help to relieve the suffering and anxiety of the unemployed. Phil’s Auto of Centerville, Utah, is a testament of what priesthood leadership and a quorum can accomplish. Phil was a member of an elders quorum and worked as a mechanic at a local automobile repair shop. Unfortunately, the repair shop where Phil worked experienced economic trouble and had to let Phil go from his job. He was devastated by this turn of events.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/this-is-your-phone-call.p10" pid="6dQai2tEbkaeNEHs9KRP9Q" hash="YOBGJg">On hearing about Phil’s job loss, his bishop, Leon Olson, and his elders quorum presidency prayerfully considered ways they could help Phil get back on his feet. After all, he was a fellow quorum member, a brother, and he needed help. They concluded that Phil had the skills to run his own business. One of the quorum members offered that he had an old barn that perhaps could be used as a repair shop. Other quorum members could help gather needed tools and supplies to equip the new shop. Almost everyone in the quorum could at least help clean the old barn.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/this-is-your-phone-call.p11" pid="utGLgd81kkm4ZValDPRZQQ" hash="-wlnvA">They shared their ideas with Phil; then they shared their plan with the members of their quorum. The barn was cleaned and renovated, the tools gathered, and all was put in order. Phil’s Auto was a success and eventually moved to better and more permanent quarters—all because his quorum brothers offered help in a time of crisis. Priesthood quorums can and must make a difference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/this-is-your-phone-call.p12" pid="oCZO7JVEx0WUWMDiaypgGg" hash="z_4VlQ">Many wards and stakes have called employment specialists to provide bishops and quorum leaders with additional support. Do not hesitate to call upon them for help.</p>

The staff in these centers have been trained to assist you with your quorum, ward, and stake employment needs. Their close relationships with employers will be an asset with career development and employment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/this-is-your-phone-call.p14" pid="yBg1kb_PuUaoOOgaLjMpqA" hash="086QNg">The Church’s Deseret Industries thrift stores offer employment and education opportunities to people of all backgrounds. Those with special needs are given the opportunity for rehabilitation, training, and job placement. Where available, Deseret Industries can be a valuable resource.</p>

Because of the economy, many mothers are finding it necessary to make budget and other living adjustments. Some are even finding it necessary to leave the home to find work. The Relief Society sisters, with their specially endowed, compassionate hearts, can help. They can help identify the needy. They can teach. They can babysit, console, comfort, and encourage. They can make a difference.</p>

The responsibility for finding employment or improving your employment rests with you. Continued guidance comes from the Lord through regular fasting and prayer. Your quorum leaders, bishops, specialists, and employment resource center staff will help in your efforts. We fear, however, that often priesthood leaders are unaware of your situation. <span class="emphasis">Speak up!</span> Let them know you are looking for work. And bishops and priesthood leaders, <span class="emphasis">rise up</span> and let the brotherhood of the priesthood engage themselves in the wonderful opportunity to truly be a quorum, a brotherhood, a brother’s keeper.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p1" pid="Nj3AP0s1kkieUoab-fjBtw" hash="XRYrrg">We live in one of the greatest dispensations of all times—a time former prophets looked forward to, prophesied of, and, I believe, yearned for. However, with all the heavenly blessings bestowed upon us, Satan, ever so real, is ever so active, and conflicting messages are continually bombarding all of us. The angel Moroni warned the young Prophet Joseph Smith that his name would be known for good and evil throughout the world (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.33" class="scriptureRef">Joseph Smith—History 1:33</a>), and never has the fulfillment of a prophecy been more evident. The Prophet gave his life for his testimony, and the attacks continue today against the Church and even the Savior Himself. The reality of the Savior, His atoning sacrifice, and its universal application for all of us is challenged and often dismissed as a myth or the baseless hope of a weak and uneducated mind. Furthermore, the reality of the Restoration of the gospel in these latter days continues to be challenged. The continual bombardment of such messages may cause confusion, doubt, and pessimism, each attacking the fundamental truths we believe in, our faith in God, and our hope in the future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p2" pid="WLjFFYtfA0yKq5LeImjoZQ" hash="lb5MWg">This might be the reality of our world, but we can still choose how we react to it. When our sacred doctrine and beliefs are challenged, this is our opportunity to become acquainted with God in a most private and intimate manner. This is our opportunity to choose.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p3" pid="OX8FY6JTlkOWhZnu2Upogw" hash="R9cIPg">Because of the conflicts and challenges we face in today’s world, I wish to suggest a single choice—a choice of peace and protection and a choice that is appropriate for all. That choice is faith. Be aware that faith is not a free gift given without thought, desire, or effort. It does not come as the dew falls from heaven. The Savior said, “Come unto me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 11:28</a>) and “Knock, and it shall be [given] you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.7" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 7:7</a>). These are action verbs—<span class="emphasis">come, knock</span>. They are choices. So I say, choose faith. Choose faith over doubt, choose faith over fear, choose faith over the unknown and the unseen, and choose faith over pessimism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p4" pid="5UxJCA9oAkytzEI3jfJNCg" hash="3xmVqA">Alma’s classic discussion on faith, as recorded in the 32nd chapter of Alma in the Book of Mormon, is a series of choices to ensure the development and the preservation of our faith. Alma gave us a directive to choose. His were words of action initiated by choosing. He used the words <span class="emphasis">awake, arouse, experiment, exercise, desire, work,</span> and <span class="emphasis">plant.</span> Then Alma explained that if we make these choices and do not cast the seed out by unbelief, then “it will begin to swell within [our] breasts” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:28</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p5" pid="2AF6Pilxn0enpo8wlN9Rvg" hash="mkUOPQ">Yes, faith is a choice, and it must be sought after and developed. Thus, we are responsible for our own faith. We are also responsible for our lack of faith. The choice is yours.</p>

I do not know the details of the organization of matter into the beautiful world we live in. I do not understand the intricacies of the Atonement, how the Savior’s sacrifice can cleanse all repentant people, or how the Savior could suffer “the pain of all men” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:11</a>). I do not know where the city of Zarahemla was, as referred to in the Book of Mormon. I do not know why my beliefs sometimes conflict with assumed scientific or secular knowledge. Perhaps these are matters our Father in Heaven described as the “mysteries … of heaven” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:19</a>) that will be revealed at a later date.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/10/faith-the-choice-is-yours.p7" pid="AXPKrGdXOUGJU74B-zjEKA" hash="a8vEBA">But while I don’t know everything, I know the important. I know the plain and simple gospel truths that lead to salvation and exaltation. I know that the Savior did suffer the pain of all men and that all repentant people can be cleansed from sin. And what I don’t know or don’t completely understand, with the powerful aid of my faith, I bridge the gap and move on, partaking of the promises and blessings of the gospel. And then, as Alma teaches, our faith brings us to a perfect knowledge (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.34" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:34</a>). By moving forward into the unknown, armed only with hope and desire, we show evidence of our faith and our devotion to the Lord.</p>

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="52"></span>In recent months increased emphasis has been placed on establishing “real growth” in the Church, bringing all who will to the receiving and keeping of covenants and saving ordinances and living with a mighty change of heart as described by Alma (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>). One of the most meaningful and important ways to establish real growth in the Church is to reach out and rescue those who have been baptized yet are wandering in a less-active state, void of the blessings and saving ordinances. Regardless of our individual calling—home or visiting teacher, Sunday School teacher, bishop, father, mother, or General Authority—all can engage in the rescuing effort in a meaningful way. After all, bringing all—our family, nonmembers, less active, sinners—to Christ to receive the saving ordinances is the divine calling that we all share.</p>

He explained that his ward had grown so rapidly that he could no longer provide a meaningful calling to all worthy members. His plea to us was that we divide the ward. While waiting for such approval, we decided as a stake presidency that we would visit the ward and call all these wonderful, worthy brothers and sisters to be stake missionaries.</p>

After chatting for a few moments, I issued the call to serve as a missionary. There was silence for a few moments. Then she said, “President, don’t you know that I am not active in the Church?”</p>

You worry about a lot of things. You worry if someone will greet you or if you will sit alone and unnoticed during the meetings. And you worry about whether you will be accepted and who your new friends will be.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p12" pid="ZV2XktqTeEClvbO15ef8Vg" hash="4lxafw">With tears rolling down her cheeks, she continued, “I know that my mother and father have been praying for me for years to bring me back into the Church.” Then after a moment of silence, she said, “For the last three months I have been praying to find the courage, the strength, and the way to come back into activity.” Then she asked, “President, do you suppose this calling could be an answer to those prayers?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/04/the-rescue-for-real-growth.p13" pid="Hhr6kgCFLUOnVmdya8T3sg" hash="jkb7Qw">My eyes started to water as I responded, “I believe the Lord has answered your prayers.”</p>

During World War II approximately 500 U.S. soldiers and supporting locals were held captive in a prison camp. Because of the suffering and concern for their safety, a volunteer force of approximately 100 U.S. soldiers was selected to rescue these prisoners. After the volunteers were assembled, the commanding officer instructed them something like this: “This evening you men meet with your religious leaders, you kneel down, and you swear to God that as long as you have a single breath of life, you will not let one of these men suffer one more moment.” (See Hampton Sides, <span class="emphasis">Ghost Soldiers: The Forgotten Epic Story of World War II’s Most Dramatic Mission</span> [2001], 28–29.) This successful rescue was a rescue from physical and temporal suffering. Should we be less valiant in our efforts to rescue those who could suffer spiritual and eternal consequences? Should we make less of a commitment to the Lord?</p>

I believe we can bring thousands to the joy, peace, and sweetness of the gospel, and hundreds of thousands, even millions, in their following generations. I believe we can succeed because this is the Lord’s Church, and by virtue of our priesthood and our membership, we are called to succeed. I bear that witness to you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
