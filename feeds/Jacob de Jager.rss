Therefore, I am sure that many of you could tell an interesting story about your conversion and baptism into the Church; about your first contact with the missionaries; and about the three stages we all have to go through when entering the kingdom here on earth—the entry stage, the development stage, and the stewardship stage—all part of man’s eternal progression from the preexistence to the life hereafter.</p>

He is teaching personally, in his turn, to those wonderful people over there, what we as parents and so many faithful dedicated teachers have taught him with love and patience about the plan of salvation in all its details.</p>

For it is written in Doctrine and Covenants, section 68: “And they [the parents] shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:28</a>.)</p>

Fathers know: “And whoso is found a faithful, a just, and a wise steward shall enter into the joy of his Lord, and shall inherit eternal life.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/51.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 51:19</a>.) The part of this promise “shall enter into the joy of his Lord” is even given to us for this life while we are here on earth. And if we are faithful and just and a wise steward now, we “shall enter into the joy of [our] Lord” and Savior now and prepare ourselves for eternal life. Now, brethren, we determine where we will be when we leave this mortal life, because when the hour of redemption has come, the hour of preparation has passed.</p>

And wherever you have come from, shout it from the rooftops: “The kingdom of God has been restored to the earth by the Prophet Joseph Smith.” And if you suffer from acrophobia—that is fear of heights—don’t climb the roof, but simply stay on the ground and give your friends and neighbors this same message: “The kingdom of God has been restored to the earth by the Prophet Joseph Smith.”</p>

These are the blessings of faithful Latter-day Saints all over the world, bringing great joy and happiness to their lives.</p>

That is, brethren, what brings happiness to us.</p>

Kimball is indeed a prophet of the living God to guide us in these the latter days. I testify that these brethren who are members of the Council of the Twelve are indeed called to be special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world, like the members of the First Council of the Seventy have been called to preach the gospel in all the world. I love and admire them for the example they set, for their friendship, and for the way they teach us by the Spirit all the things we need to do to return to our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/shout-it-from-the-rooftops.p15" pid="99HGbGBHak6bfhzNpYSgMQ" hash="s2ON3A">This conference will touch our hearts and change our lives, and I bear witness to you that your life will not be the same when you return to your respective wards and branches. We will return edified, wiser, more sensitive to the needs of others, and better equipped with the knowledge we need in our homes and therefore will be happier and closer to our Heavenly Father. May peace and happiness be with you this day and always, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

It symbolizes the great spiritual uplift and the importance of the Lord’s true church on earth, in accordance with the revelation given through Joseph Smith, the Prophet:</p>

I have held many fascinating positions in various countries and have had choice business experiences, but there is nothing that compares with the work and the service in the Church. I testify to you that nothing will give a person the enjoyment and satisfaction that he gets from service to his brethren and his fellowmen.</p>

Visiting with them was a great privilege and a remarkable inspiration to me. My faith and my testimony have been strengthened because of their glorious example. Their devotion, their loyalty, their willingness to take care of all Church assignments, and their missionary zeal are truly a great tribute to building our Heavenly Father’s kingdom in that part of the world. I feel very grateful whenever or wherever I can be of assistance by sharing my Church experience with them—strictly in accordance with last year’s direction and guidance given by the First Presidency of the Church to all stake and mission presidents, stating:</p>

Moreover, there are at this moment still 230 million children of our Heavenly Father in the eight missions of the area who must yet hear the message of the restored gospel and accept it through the Holy Spirit of conversion.</p>

But I have heard so many remarkable testimonies about wonderful men and women that have been brought into the Church that I would like to say: “You never know whom you will save.”</p>

They were fishermen or had other related vocations, like fishing-boat builders, sailmakers, or fishing-net repairmen. Many of them were also involved in the voluntary but hazardous task of lifesaving. They were stouthearted, experienced men who always were ready to man the rowing lifeboats to go on a rescue mission. With every westerly gale that blew, some fishing boats ran into difficulties, and many times the sailors had to cling to the rigging of their stricken ships in a desperate fight to escape inevitable drowning. Year after year the sea claimed its victims.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/you-never-know-who-you-may-save.p13" pid="8dDxgJc2xESbwlNsV0JPUw" hash="zbD2Jw">On one occasion during a severe storm, a ship was in distress, and a rowboat went out to rescue the crew of the fishing boat. The waves were enormous, and each of the men at the oars had to give all his strength and energy to reach the unfortunate sailors in the grim darkness of the night and the heavy rainstorm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/you-never-know-who-you-may-save.p14" pid="y8pJ_BH_PECRl8PGPwRgUQ" hash="ohsVVg">The trip to the wrecked ship was successful, but the rowboat was too small to take the whole crew in one rescue operation. One man had to stay behind on board because there simply was no room for him; the risk that the rescue boat would capsize was too great. When the rescuers made it back to the beach, hundreds of people were waiting for them with torches to guide them in the dreary night. But the same crew could not make the second trip because they were exhausted from their fight with the stormwinds, the waves, and the sweeping rains.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/you-never-know-who-you-may-save.p15" pid="Txwb80Epbk6hHSxq5qECYA" hash="cwTf-w">So the local captain of the coast guard asked for volunteers to make a second trip. Among those who stepped forward without hesitation was a nineteen-year-old youth by the name of Hans. With his mother he had come to the beach in his oilskin clothes to watch the rescue operation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/you-never-know-who-you-may-save.p16" pid="3gFo47ydiE2RkUfdxKywAw" hash="68zeug">When Hans stepped forward his mother panicked and said, “Hans, please don’t go. Your father died at sea when you were four years old and your older brother Pete has been reported missing at sea for more than three months now. You are the only son left to me!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/you-never-know-who-you-may-save.p17" pid="TvTcUsuE80-6xtu63gxbpw" hash="ds3mOg">But Hans said, “Mom, I feel I have to do it. It is my duty.” And the mother wept and restlessly started pacing the beach when Hans boarded the rowing boat, took the oars, and disappeared into the night.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/you-never-know-who-you-may-save.p18" pid="0yOzNuooj0igmjrqMayUyQ" hash="BgdUwA">After a struggle with the high-going seas that lasted for more than an hour (and to Hans’s mother it seemed an eternity), the rowboat came into sight again. When the rescuers had approached the beach close enough so that the captain of the coast guard could reach them by shouting, he cupped his hands around his mouth and called vigorously against the storm, “Did you save him?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/you-never-know-who-you-may-save.p19" pid="8f_I79AFXkGkZld3f5Kn2w" hash="U_Jf1Q">And then the people lighting the sea with their torches saw Hans rise from his rowing bench, and he shouted with all his might, “Yes! And tell Mother it is my brother Pete!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/you-never-know-who-you-may-save.p20" pid="J9Q_G3cFkk-hTS-uto3IAw" hash="E8HVmQ">My dear brothers and sisters, many of us have or will soon have nineteen-year-old sons. Their names may be George or Juan Pedro, Guillaume or Heinrich, Paavo or Sing Tong, depending on the country they live in, but let Hans be their example. Let them join the rescue team of missionary workers. You never know whom they will save! It may be the one that on life’s billows is tempest tossed or it may even be the one that had been reported missing at life’s sea. And when someone is saved through their rescue mission, oh how great shall be their joy with him or her in the kingdom of our Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/you-never-know-who-you-may-save.p21" pid="GRTbe3j-3EKltlbNoLm2MQ" hash="Y94DAQ">My beloved brothers and sisters, I pray that the Lord may inspire us to be valiant. That means that we also have the personal courage to go on a rescue mission by sharing the gospel with others, bringing the Holy Ghost into their lives. And I do so humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

At the end of that seminar President Marion G. Romney, on his way out of the auditorium, walked through the aisle where I was standing with two big binders under one arm and a stack of printed materials under the other arm. President Romney stopped and said, “Now, Brother de Jager, how are you going to teach all these inspired materials?”</p>

Sometimes this is indeed true; and they had better find out why, because they will then discover their own shortcomings and what ways there are to improve themselves. The Lord does not ask whether a person comes to his church from prison or from a successful and respectable background. He accepts a soul, not his history! And then a door opens and that person starts to progress, learning line upon line, precept upon precept, through example and through the scriptures like the beautiful parables of Jesus Christ.</p>

They take us back to the first century <small>A.D.</small> In my vivid imagination, when reading the parables I enter that home and watch the housewife making the bread or patching the old garment or looking for the lost coin. I see the bustle of the marketplace and watch the travelers on the road. I work the fields with the sower, I climb the hills with the shepherd, or stand by the lakeside and help the fishermen to pull the net ashore.</p>

Let us remember this when we, as a team, build branches and districts, wards and stakes, priesthood quorums, and auxiliary organizations in our Father’s kingdom here on earth, and always keep in mind the words often quoted by President Harold B. Lee: “There is no limit to the good that you can do, if you don’t care who gets the credit” (see Antoine R. Ivins, in Conference Report, Apr. 1946, p. 42).

I hope by what I have just said that they now have a better insight and will reconsider the possibility of service, especially when they hear that, contrary to the established policy for other callings in the kingdom, they can come forward and express their desire to go on a six-, twelve-, or eighteen-month mission.</p>

I have many friends there. It’s a real privilege for me to share my testimony this afternoon and give the thoughts that are in my heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p2" pid="Bs1XhoSUCE2mCxx89ZvmQA" hash="8xsDeQ">Since the beginning of recorded history, man has marveled at the mysteries of the sky and has had a desire to escape the bonds of gravity.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p4" pid="lyqR_I9T1kegB9eOeBHNmg" hash="Gcxgyw">What is the situation in 1983, two hundred years later?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p5" pid="JkLA1oSlUEiHeS5Rt4ssfw" hash="CFcS4g">Man has been to the moon and has sent spaceships to distant planets. Close to three hundred satellites have been put into an earth orbit 22,300 miles above the equator to expand television and telex communications and also to study and forecast weather conditions. Yesterday, and last night during the general priesthood meeting, we were able to reach by satellite more than half a million priesthood holders at the same time.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p6" pid="QUinPQGTY0eP3TcuBQZpbQ" hash="VwK2Nw">Let’s realize that all of these innovations have their origin, however, in ballooning, which gave mankind a first new perspective on his home planet as well as a physical and spiritual uplift in silent flight.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p7" pid="ux8cK0eRkkC6FTNlJRzGmw" hash="9kxCow">I have personally experienced, though only once, the exhilaration of a real balloon flight. It was during the exciting time immediately following World War II when in Holland, my native country, many public festivities were held to celebrate the regained liberty after five years of war. There were big parades, neighborhood dance festivals, and in some cities manned balloon flights to attract large crowds for yet other festive events.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p8" pid="g-PqED9H00qVYvegwaXQbg" hash="xFGBlA">A friend taught me a lot about ballooning in preparation for a flight that I was promised to be able to make as a guest, when at some future date the weather conditions would be suitable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p9" pid="1CMnIKXV4EOyOgw3JaXfnA" hash="VDRhsQ">I learned that we would go up in a class A gas balloon filled with coal gas and that it would ascend until its weight would be in equilibrium with the air around it.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p11" pid="dTd3VcA9Akq7dB2x4LPepQ" hash="6ZXIbw">Furthermore, I discovered that if gas is released from a balloon through a valve, it descends. But this was not all! I also heard from my friend many delightful stories about previous balloon flights. On one occasion, as the story goes, clouds developed unexpectedly during a flight, and the two men in the wicker basket had not the faintest idea over which part of the country they were sailing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p12" pid="rEATa4217kiJIghQ5RzRlA" hash="OmC31Q">They decided to lower the balloon, and all of a sudden they saw a Dutchman walking on a lonely country road. When they were able to draw his attention, one of the men in the basket shouted: “Where are we?” And the lonely walker looked up, cupped his hands around his mouth, and shouted back, “You are in a balloon.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p13" pid="CbETBGvNCU-dVOXjow9jsA" hash="jvGJNA">To make their urgent request for direction more clear, the man in the balloon cried vigorously, “Where are <span class="emphasis">you?</span>” And the man called back at the top of his voice, “I am on the ground!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p14" pid="we_P-RL2SUyggPTiIMca6A" hash="eUJT7w">Discouraged, the balloonists unloaded some ballast and sailed again into the clouds, while one of them remarked: “The man down there must be a bureaucrat.” The statements he made were perfectly true, but totally useless!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p15" pid="3n3klWpPY0eweju1FPNk4A" hash="b-Gv4A">After what I have shared with you thus far, I have come to the conclusion that a strong parallel can be drawn between the steady rise of a balloon and <span class="emphasis">our</span> spiritual upward mobility.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p16" pid="y1erDwIF-UqXdvgRJm-LKQ" hash="lJO-Ww">Just as gas is necessary to fill a balloon to push it upward, so must the individual be filled with inner motivation in order to move upward. Just as the balloon can rise higher by throwing ballast overboard, so must a person be willing to rid himself of unnecessary ballast that limits his rise in spirituality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p17" pid="CJ-p3f7o40uIQxlZK_r2pg" hash="VQTrow">When I made my balloon flight, strangely enough, I did not have the feeling that I was going up. I had the impression that I remained stationary, as it were, and the world floated silently away from me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p18" pid="JES_2vrmVkOYRuJn3HKpKg" hash="YuUGig">Later, when through the missionary effort I joined the Church, I gained as a new member that peaceful feeling of being safely placed in the environment of true gospel living and that Babylon had floated away from me. As it was expressed by an early European balloonist: “I felt as though I had left behind me, all the cares and passions that molest mankind.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p19" pid="8TpWXBze2UOxfBniVUwHWQ" hash="cjmyeQ">I testify that we all can have that peace of mind if we are willing to rid ourselves of the ballast that prevents us from rising to greater spiritual heights. It will facilitate our ascent to a loving Father in Heaven, who will, in his due time, await our return after our journey through life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p20" pid="uvR364VPJkuWVtfAYQ-YBg" hash="3i3nLg">Let us, therefore, get rid of our sandbag of impatience and learn to be more patient with our spouses and children, our friends and neighbors, because the Lord has counseled us to “continue in patience until ye are perfected”! (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/67.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 67:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p21" pid="deTLyouWEki_UQZ487nkCw" hash="V0VBEA">And for those of you who do not know what the word <span class="emphasis">patience</span> really means, I offer a simple definition: Patience is learning to hide your impatience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p22" pid="igkpjC58UU2de8yc-0GQLg" hash="JVEkww">And how many of us still go through life with a ballast bag called criticism? We should, instead, give more praise wherever and whenever possible because we have been told and retold, “Cease to find fault one with another.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.124" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:124</a>.) And let us in this respect also remember that the faults and shortcomings we see in the members of our own ward or branch are of less consequence to us than one of the smallest in ourselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p23" pid="PF1vi4R3QEa2vPg-LQ8_eg" hash="b92ZXg">Furthermore, do we still have a sandbag with unfriendliness in our basket, even though the Savior asks us to be friendly and loving? As he said: “Ye are they whom my Father hath given me; ye are my friends.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.63" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:63</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p24" pid="ZjLc35piZkazUCGdcompyg" hash="LCLTVw">While on our spiritual flight, let us totally empty our ballast bag of pride and be more humble in all things, always remembering the Savior’s glorious promise to all: “And inasmuch as you have humbled yourselves before me, the blessings of the kingdom are yours.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 61:37</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p25" pid="LO3lzjwy60Sh3ZTR48dyUQ" hash="ocFNEQ">And will we really ascend in our spiritual balloon if we are not prepared to dispose of our sandbag of greed? Living prophets have counseled us to pay an honest tithing and to give a generous fast offering; and, moreover, the scriptures reveal in a very candid way: “Wo unto [them] that [do] not give [of their] substance to the poor.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/56.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 56:16</a>.) And, unfortunately, some people think they are being generous because they give so much free advice!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p26" pid="jxp8WMxMv0madEQheskDYQ" hash="_oGb5A">Finally, we must get rid of the heavy ballast of frustrations. All of us must discover in the wicker basket of our personal spiritual balloon those frustrations against which we continually have to be on guard. It was revealed unto us, and we have already heard it twice from this pulpit in this conference: “The works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught … remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated, but the work of men.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.1,3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 3:1, 3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p27" pid="O5QJc3Gw1kip6nTBWPpzSw" hash="EAqM7g">The only way we can move upward from our present level of spirituality and performance to a higher level is by doing away with the ballast that holds us back. We have to learn to live the commandments, not only for our own good, but also for the good of other people because we reform others unconsciously when we keep the commandments of God and live the teachings of the Church. That’s another way of doing missionary work and lifting the spirituality of those around us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p28" pid="n0wFB0zxn0eEUgOlYKuhvA" hash="h8Pntg">Therefore, let’s start our flight today. If we are still at ground level, let’s cut the cords; and our rise will start immediately! However, even that will not ensure our continuous spiritual mobility. Our balloon will rise only so high and then will begin to stall. At that time we have to investigate what ballast we need to get rid of in order to rise even higher. If you find it hard to cut the cords, you will find it even harder to do away with the sandbags to lighten your load.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p29" pid="iGca4lXVK0mHnuL_LvIrtQ" hash="bLgTGQ">The balloon trip of our spiritual upward mobility is a demanding and sometimes difficult adventure, and only the person with true perseverance will make it to the highest realm!</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/04/climbing-to-higher-spirituality.p32" pid="JP7iHBLCIEmm8wJGFmo3vQ" hash="KoLT6Q">To those who are quietly drifting at the same elevation with little upward mobility, take a close look at the ballast that prevents you from going to a higher level of performance. Make a decision and remove the restraining weight from your spiritual flight.</p>

Because I know with all my heart that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ.

Of which I testify this day, gratefully and happily, and in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

And having journeyed from the land of Japan eastward, away to the state of Utah, to attend this general conference, what adds more to my joy, as Alma continues, is to see that you are still my brothers and sisters in the Lord; yea, and that you have waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2" class="scriptureRef">Alma 17:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-greatest-news-of-all-times-is-that-jesus-lives.p4" pid="DbdmpzwgA0C6GvV7RoMshw" hash="fH0VOA">May I also, by way of introduction, add that when foreigners like myself are taught the English language, they are usually advised by their teachers to shy away from difficult and complicated words because they may not sound right when spoken with a foreign accent; that is, trying to impress rather than express! Language teachers do, however, allow an exception to this general rule in the case of medical terms, when properly used. I would like, therefore, to share with you a few thoughts on the medical term <span class="emphasis">logokophosis,</span> which literally means “word deafness” or, in an extended gospel meaning, “the inability to hear or understand spoken directions.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-greatest-news-of-all-times-is-that-jesus-lives.p5" pid="6lbqamFxMEm-XtubvaRGFg" hash="S1PoaA">The scriptures are replete with directions spoken by holy prophets in all dispensations because “the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that will hear may hear.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:11</a>.) Yet time and again we have to be asked to be better listeners. President Marion G. Romney sometimes wonders out loud, “How many tellings does it take—how many repetitions of counsel? How many individual corrections must be given?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-greatest-news-of-all-times-is-that-jesus-lives.p6" pid="L49ZN4OC3Eak9LeXAHljvw" hash="ZoRI3g">As parents may pose these questions to their children, Heavenly Father may also wonder the same about <span class="emphasis">his</span> sons and daughters. How many of us turn a deaf ear to the admonitions from our modern-day prophets and stay passive, uninvolved, as when we half-listen to the radio?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-greatest-news-of-all-times-is-that-jesus-lives.p7" pid="SSPU-0_u1Ua1U_H-_7cWqw" hash="IbZDag">We all know the hymn “Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice.” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 21.) Why then do some suffer so badly from <span class="emphasis">logokophosis,</span> the inability to hear or understand? And I am of course not referring to those among us who have physically impaired hearing. We often find among <span class="emphasis">them</span> the most faithful members of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-greatest-news-of-all-times-is-that-jesus-lives.p8" pid="g5JOziHBoEK0rDbaKpjydw" hash="aqk3CA">The Apostle Paul was an inspired teacher, and he gave many spoken directions to the people during his apostolic travels. But often he later had to remind them in writing because many who heard him had apparently neither fully understood nor acted in accordance with the divine principles he taught.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-greatest-news-of-all-times-is-that-jesus-lives.p9" pid="hdmhDwH700-YYpSzzZsjQA" hash="KMQW3g">Therefore, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, Paul reminds the Greek people, who composed the Church of God at Corinth, of the gospel truths which he preached to them. He again informed them in writing that Christ died for our sins, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day, and that he appeared to Simon Peter and then to the Apostles. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.3-4" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:3–4</a>.)</p>

Through conversion, he had come to know what it was like to become alive, knowing and accepting the truth that Christ had risen.</p>

Having a partnership with the Lord in saving others is for me another definition of missionary work. And I want every young man who is preparing himself for a mission to read the Book of Mormon in order to realize that he is indeed preparing himself to have a very personal partnership with the Lord in saving others, for the duration of his mission and beyond. The same is true for every young woman preparing for her mission.</p>

Latter-day Saints everywhere, as the covenant people of the Lord, play an important part in this process.</p>

I can testify to you that while I labor in the countries of Asia and see the enormous progress there in the work of the Lord, the Spirit repeatedly bears witness to my soul of the truthfulness of the prophetic words of President Brigham Young concerning opposition to the Church. He said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/the-greatest-news-of-all-times-is-that-jesus-lives.p17" pid="X3jK6-vi4EOsFNfBNX04Vg" hash="a8CKtw">“The Kingdom will continue to increase, to grow, to spread and prosper more and more.

Then, and only then, differences between nations and peoples will disappear, and the world will be one, when the Savior returns to rule and reign for a thousand years.</p>

These were the words of a prophet who spoke to all of us.</p>

The first one is, “The full evaluation of one’s life is not complete until the moment of passing.” And the other one is, “We must look for true friends after one hundred years.” On the basis of my acquired knowledge of the plan of salvation and the just-quoted sayings, I firmly believe that our good works should be performed <span class="emphasis">now,</span> but always with life beyond the veil and future generations in mind.</p>

To speak in priesthood meeting of general conference is for me literally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because I have never before had this privilege in the fifteen years that I have belonged to the Quorum of the Seventy, and it is not likely that I will have another chance to do so. I therefore consider it a personal blessing to address such a vast audience of worthy men holding the priesthood of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/change.p2" pid="YNIkybTbK0CCYJyNSZ4_kQ" hash="bSgL9A">A great number of you are still single, and many of you are married. To those who are married, I would like to testify, based on my personal experience, that a loving, supportive wife at home is a great source of strength. You probably have heard the saying, “Behind every great man stands a great woman.” In the Church we have changed that adage somewhat by saying, “Behind every great man in the Church stands a surprised mother-in-law.” Because she may say, “Is this the boy who married my daughter? Is he a bishop now? I can’t believe it.” Yes, Mother, that boy has matured, has gained experience by taking upon himself greater responsibilities and has learned to serve the Lord while serving others. In short, he has <span class="emphasis">changed!</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/change.p3" pid="45y8qlbZX0CxUNjFQjKX-w" hash="w9Iw5g">I would like to talk tonight about <span class="emphasis">change</span> because everything around us seems to be changing at an accelerated pace. In the last two years we have observed tremendous changes in Eastern Europe. Also the recent events in the Persian Gulf region have, understandably so, changed the lives of many people in a dramatic way. It was inevitable that our personal lives as well were influenced by the events around us, and maybe we experienced the discomforting feeling that these changes in the world are beyond our control.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/change.p4" pid="7sRZuJhpwU6xR1sjckuCxQ" hash="JNRSdQ">Yet there are important changes everyone should be able to make through proper preparation, changes over which we do have control. Brethren, as priesthood holders we should ask ourselves these questions: “Am I giving enough attention and time to personal change, which will make me a better person in the eyes of the Lord?” And “Am I, as a father and spiritual leader in my own home, giving enough attention and time to my basic duties and responsibilities?” These are:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/change.p5" pid="b2z4Z2304UqECEBIUSrUCQ" hash="10W4JA">Number 1. To lead and direct my family in regular family prayer and study of the scriptures.</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.4" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 1:4</a>.) This means that through personal change we develop a desire to live in harmony with the divine teachings of the Lord and to free our minds from all ill feelings toward other people. To do so will make us more worthy, even more perfect.</p>

As far as I was able to determine this morning, the vote of thanks was unanimous in the affirmative. For this I express my gratitude to all of you who were present here.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/10/service-and-happiness.p2" pid="LMI_SxtbDkyXTWoUxt_hvQ" hash="TJ6A6Q">When I was called to the Quorum of the Seventy in April 1976, Elder LeGrand Richards, who, as many of you will recall, was a Dutchman by adoption, used to call me the “Happy Dutchman.” After seventeen and a half years, I want you to know that I am still the Happy Dutchman, and I will tell you why. Because these years of service in the Quorum have brought great joy and countless blessings to my life and the life of Bea, my eternal companion.</p>

This message enables them to learn that the most important part of their lives is making sacred covenants that will bring them back to their Father in Heaven.</p>
