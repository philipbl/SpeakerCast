At this time I would thank you from the bottom of my heart for the sustaining power of your love and faith and prayers as evidenced by the uplifted hand.</p>

We’re serving in the mission field at the present time and feel we are repaying in some small measure the great work that was done by some young missionaries so many years ago. They came to our home in the late summer of 1950, knocked on the door, and opened the eyes of our understanding to the fulness of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/what-would-the-savior-have-me-do.p3" pid="ekBk1OW7WUO2L_x1AGC0bg" hash="QZo0tA">I’ve heard many missionaries express appreciation to their missionary companions, and I would like to express my appreciation at this time for my wonderful missionary companion, who is also my eternal companion—a devoted wife and mother who has always smoothed the way for me to be able to serve the Lord. I’m grateful for wonderful children, some of them with their own families now who have been raised in the Church and married in the temple—all because missionaries knocked on our door. I know that through the sacred temple ordinances we can all be together, and shall be, eternally.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/what-would-the-savior-have-me-do.p4" pid="rUJGpX6g9kyrjlL3zccC_w" hash="3sc0pQ">What a great blessing comes to us when we hear and accept the gospel! I earnestly pray that everyone, all people, will listen to the missionaries—that those who are members of the Church will listen to the missionaries as they teach their friends in their home, that all those who have not yet accepted the gospel will open their hearts to the gospel message.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/what-would-the-savior-have-me-do.p5" pid="Zu_FcJ_6bkOeFO5NbtQ4wQ" hash="CSsNqA">The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in these last days. I know that to be true. It has brought us so much happiness in our lives. We have learned to pray meaningfully; we have learned to pray in our family; we have learned to pray as husband and wife; we have learned to pray in secret and to pour out our hearts to the Lord and receive guidance. How grateful we are for those eternal blessings!</p>

I bear testimony that the Lord Jesus Christ does live. He did live in mortality and gave us the perfect example. He did show us the way to live, and we can always say (and I do many times, indeed, each day), “What would the Savior have me do? What would the Savior do?” He did ransom us and make the supreme sacrifice and infinite atonement which only the Son of God could make. I know that he lives and that he has restored his gospel in its fulness in these last days. He has restored his church. He has restored the saving ordinances.</p>

I know that he speaks today and reveals his will through a mighty prophet, even President Spencer W. Kimball, whose faith and works are great, even unto miracles and unto the opening of the doors of the nations. We pray for him, and we pray that the doors of the nations will be unlocked.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/04/what-would-the-savior-have-me-do.p8" pid="-6uzgthls0KiGErhW8FTfw" hash="ijjusw">We pray for the success of the missionaries and are so grateful to be involved in this wonderful latter-day work. We love Sister Kimball so much and pray for her, the wonderful, eternal companion for the prophet of the Lord.</p>

And we feel of their sustaining strength and are so grateful for it. My cup runneth over as I rededicate myself and my family to serve the Lord all the days of our lives and to follow his prophet, in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

      <description>My wife and I have just celebrated a remarkable thirtieth anniversary. Thirty years ago, young missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints knocked on our door in Nottingham, England.</description>

      <img src="ensignlp.nfo-o-24e8.jpg" alt="Elder Derek A. Cuthbert" pid="dH7jnSV5OES1VNhoqsMpKQ" hash="Zfl7Yg" />
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p1" pid="_EgOcANeQ0G1nY5_VHFqvA" hash="0UcEIA">My wife and I have just celebrated a remarkable thirtieth anniversary. Thirty years ago, young missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints knocked on our door in Nottingham, England.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p2" pid="ZLQmNBlhBEuJAwn-wG2ARA" hash="fz2Wgw">How did their message appeal to two active members of another church? We, and generations before us, had held membership in the established church of the land. Furthermore, we were very happy with our way of life. Two precious children had graced our home, and a new job in a large industrial company was giving challenge and enjoyment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p3" pid="vE9O75aUu0mJ8EfBEexdLw" hash="kBCAxg">What more could we hope for? What could add to our happiness? As the missionaries taught us and prayed with us, we began to realize that there were gaps in our life, that we had unfulfilled needs. For a few minutes may I share with you ten ways in which our lives became even more purposeful and happy as these needs were fulfilled. I am sure you will be able to identify some of these needs in your life, in your home, in your family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p4" pid="jkPzqu6h8USs1uANB_VLtg" hash="sRf3tQ">First, we realized that our communication with God was not often enough or strong enough. True, we had always said our individual prayers, but when, because of the missionaries, we also started to pray together regularly as husband and wife and with our children, we experienced a tremendous feeling of closeness, not only with each other but with the Almighty God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p5" pid="heX5UQwyakW5azU-wy_FNQ" hash="8tOs3g">The missionaries had taught us that he is a personal being, that he is literally our Father, and prayers began to flow from the heart and were no longer repetitious. We came to know him as a loving Father, just and kind, reliable and true. What great need there is in the world today to commune with the Infinite, to talk and walk with God, to know that he speaks to us today and that we are in reality his children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p6" pid="DCicpHZWRkq6ICySXlSZZQ" hash="muvn-A">Second, we came to know Jesus Christ, not just as a historical figure, but as the living Son of God. In high school and the years that followed I had made a special study of the New Testament. However, the Savior’s life and mortal ministry had no great impact on my life until the missionaries testified, as did Job of old, that our Redeemer lives (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/job/19.25" class="scriptureRef">Job 19:25</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p7" pid="3cuG7iyqBUOIuxnuqwOq2g" hash="usCi_A">I came to know him as my personal Savior, who gave his life for me and for each of us. “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.13" class="scriptureRef">John 15:13</a>). Everyone needs a friend and everyone has a friend beyond compare—Jesus Christ and him crucified and resurrected for us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p8" pid="4kA8Yq6Yo0KdO_2p7A0zjQ" hash="YVaxxw">Third, as a young married couple, we were seeking security in an insecure world. We had grown from youth through teenage years during World War II. I had been a member of the Home Guard at sixteen, trained to defend my country, and at seventeen had volunteered for the Royal Air Force. Now, more than five years after the war had finished, there was still rubble in the streets and rationing in the shops.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p9" pid="Wf-FAGpoPkC6pMaZmgOefw" hash="YVVPAg">We grasped at the secure message that the missionaries gave us, that God speaks today as he did anciently, through prophets. Yes, he is mindful of us, he <span class="emphasis">does</span> love us, he <span class="emphasis">has</span> restored his church and the fulness of his gospel as he promised. Oh, how the world needs a prophet to lead us and guide us in these troubled times. I testify that we have such a prophet. He sits behind me as I speak in this tabernacle. He presides over The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Lord’s church and kingdom here on earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p10" pid="7NYUC8TV10GMh0H5fkkzFg" hash="5uqmSg">Fourth, we began attending the Church at the missionaries’ invitation—and what a friendly reception! We soon learned what true sociality is, and sincere brotherhood and sisterhood which bind together people of all nations and tongues. “Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:19</a>). What a wonderful feeling of belonging, of being needed and appreciated, beyond anything we had previously experienced.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p11" pid="GxVwTMbRJECKCM8P-pimHA" hash="XgNUnA">Soon we were singing in choirs; visiting other Church members in their homes, just as they visited us; and giving service to others in some of the many service projects the Church provides. We were able to choose from a wide range of activities—drama, dancing, sport—to supplement the spiritual progress that came rapidly by worshiping and learning with other Latter-day Saints. Everyone needs to experience the warmth of friendship and happy social activity on a continuing basis.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p12" pid="f6U-5w0FfUK8GMBQ6XV2cg" hash="kyRong">Fifth, my family and family life became even more meaningful and precious to me as we commenced having wonderful family home evenings together. We learned that all over the world, members of the Church spend at least one evening a week together in a balanced evening of spiritual instruction, fun, and talent sharing. We love our children, and we were glad to learn from the missionaries that although baptism is essential for the remission of sins, infant baptism is not necessary since “all children who die before … accountability are saved in the celestial kingdom” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 137:10</a>). We have known a number of parents who have been distressed at the death of a small child because of the un-Christian doctrine of infant baptism.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p13" pid="H64IowMw1ki12Q72KXmbag" hash="9QRWnA">Again, we also became concerned about our wider family: our grandparents, our great-grandparents, and all of our ancestors. This is also a universal need, as Alex Haley expressed, “a hunger, marrow-deep, to know our heritage” (“What <span class="emphasis">Roots</span> Means to Me,” <span class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest,</span> May 1977, p. 73). Everyone has some family, sometimes near, sometimes far, sometimes living in mortality, sometimes passed on and awaiting the Resurrection. The strength that comes from family in all its aspects is a vital need, one that can be fulfilled by the principles and programs learned from the missionaries.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p14" pid="U5gnEfvA4EOqaRo41A2sLQ" hash="vL8c1Q">Sixth, everyone appreciates good health, and there is a basic need to have our spirit housed in a well-functioning body if at all possible. Personally, I had suffered internal discomfort for some years, but the health code, or Word of Wisdom, taught by the missionaries helped me to overcome this. I can testify that the exclusion of the habit-forming stimulants of alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee has been a great blessing in my life and the lives of my wife and my children. I am glad the Lord gave this revelation through Joseph Smith, the Prophet, almost 150 years ago, bringing increased health and vitality to millions of people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p15" pid="3RJLbn_NPkKV596yybCyIw" hash="q1iiiA">Seventh, as provided for our young family, I was not only concerned about physical and spiritual well-being, but indeed with personal progress generally. I soon found that in the Lord’s Church all kinds of resources are provided to fulfill this need. Before long I was involved in educational activities and leadership training and cultural pursuits of various kinds. Progress within my company organization was a natural outgrowth of progression in the Church. This was not surprising, for early in our discussions with the missionaries we had learned of God’s plan of eternal progression for his children. Does not everyone deep down have this yearning, this need to progress and improve, to develop and refine?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p16" pid="XDQKKWBfBkisu6lHNHpsYg" hash="k_uf-A">Eighth, I think along with these needs there is also a spirit of adventure in most of us in varying degrees, a need to discover, a need to explore. For many this need is met by reading adventure stories or traveling to new places. For myself, I had always been fascinated by the study of Middle Eastern archaeology, particularly of the great Egyptian civilization.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p17" pid="dZzPRvKnE0yTc0p0yw2Hcg" hash="VXVuGA">The message of my missionary friends even fulfilled this need, for they told us of an ancient record on gold plates, inscribed by people from the Middle East in the pre-Christian era. Imagine my excitement to learn that these ancient people with their prophets and culture had left the Old World and traveled to the New, to become a mighty people on what is now the American continent. Their records were hidden and preserved and a little over 150 years ago were discovered, not by archaeologists, but by a teenage youth. The faith and worthiness of this young man, Joseph Smith, enabled him not only to find the gold plates, but later to translate the hieroglyphic record by the power of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p18" pid="z7rhdPGNZEuuXiEPz48W4A" hash="cls9ew">What a thrill it was to see some of the reformed Egyptian characters as copied by the hand of Joseph Smith. I knew by the feeling I had that they were true characters. Then, to hold this book of scripture, this Book of Mormon, in my hands and read it eagerly, sincerely, prayerfully, was a powerful spiritual experience. The need I had for the adventure of discovery was fulfilled through the Book of Mormon. This was not merely discovery of ancient peoples, but a complete discovery of the divinity of Jesus Christ. I testify that the Book of Mormon is a witness, a modern-day witness, of the Savior of the world, who visited this continent after his resurrection.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p19" pid="sj_UszL9ukuyVmlggIfmbg" hash="KSwSCg">Ninth, as one who had lived less than perfectly, and yet had no serious matters to disturb my conscience, I felt the need to make some changes in my life. I was overjoyed to learn the pure teaching of Jesus Christ concerning faith, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the laying on of hands to receive the Holy Ghost. What joy to start afresh with a clean sheet, having turned away from unsound doctrines, vain traditions, and perverted ordinances.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p20" pid="jr_nr7eg9kicIGQVNGXnWg" hash="eTYm-g">Again, this would seem to be a universal need, all men having been born into this earth life innocent and pure, and having been tainted by the things of the world. The marvelous thing is that Jesus gave his life for everyone. His resurrection was for everyone, “for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:22</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p21" pid="Sp-mwjTjRkeUShYLn6ev-w" hash="3l0x_A">Tenth, and finally, since being baptized into this wonderful restored Church of Jesus Christ, I have felt an inner peace, “the peace of God, which passeth all understanding” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.7" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 4:7</a>). I have heard many people say their greatest need and desire is to obtain peace of mind. How does this come? It comes by knowing the truth, for “the truth shall make you free” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.32" class="scriptureRef">John 8:32</a>). I testify that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true Church of Jesus Christ, and teaches true principles and true ordinances.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p22" pid="L1lAWZmMb0eOquTY12SIqQ" hash="xH2yBg">How grateful I am that my ten most fervent needs have been fulfilled through listening to the missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Then, by study and prayer and obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, I have found happiness not only here but for eternities to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/our-thirtieth-anniversary-as-latter-day-saints.p23" pid="LDCRTToUX0eY68MLrldEuw" hash="vmiXsQ">May all within the sound of my voice, and all God’s children everywhere, have the same fulfillment, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-meaning-of-maturity.p6" pid="qjgKfJ-mmUylKW4KshDddw" hash="iBiUow">Wisdom, understanding, largeness of heart are signs of maturity. When Solomon acquired these qualities, he was no longer “but a little child.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-meaning-of-maturity.p7" pid="20ev0NcCTkGtIAfBv_e0-Q" hash="21JYSg">However, the process of maturing is not as simple as acquiring wisdom. Did not the Savior say: “Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.3" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:3</a>.) To mature, then, is to retain or regain some childlike qualities we need to have and to develop other qualities which children do not have. I would like to suggest to you ten aspects of maturity, five of which are childlike and five of which are developed later.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-meaning-of-maturity.p8" pid="Ezjudexgm026AfLz9S8mDg" hash="WhngKw">First, <span class="emphasis">innocence.</span> Can anyone deny the innocence of a newborn babe or a very small child? The Savior taught, “Suffer little children … to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.14" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 19:14</a>.) In latter-day revelation the Lord has enlightened us further by proclaiming: “Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:38</a>.) Yes, the challenge to each one of us in these days of deceit and discord is to be innocent, to be guileless.</p>

How wonderful to hear the humble prayer or testimony of a child. I think of the young boy I heard relate the Joseph Smith story in great detail and bear his testimony in the Xhosa language in southern Africa as we met in a one-room African home in Cimizile.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-meaning-of-maturity.p10" pid="AtLlIGubYk-8fcIWmasmgw" hash="nsVzkA">We live in a world where men have largely turned away from righteousness and are self-seeking, gratifying their pride and vain ambition. We have the challenge to humble ourselves before God and become, in King Benjamin’s words, “as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us], even as a child doth submit to his father.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>.)</p>

How inspiring to see them overcome hardship and affliction. I remember interviewing a fine young Shona man, a Church member in Zimbabwe, to be the first missionary from his nation. Although permanently on crutches because of polio, Elder Peter Chaya submitted happily to the call to serve.</p>

The Apostle Paul counseled the Saints at Corinth: “But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/11.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 11:3</a>.) I have always been impressed that, although Paul was a very learned man, after his conversion he declared: “For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.2" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:2</a>.) These thoughts came to mind when, on a recent visit to Ghana, I heard Dr. Emmanuel Kissi, a prominent surgeon and now the district president, teach the simple truths of the gospel in the district conference meetings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/the-meaning-of-maturity.p13" pid="J3psCAeqKEGB3XEy_DLUXg" hash="rK-7SQ">Yes, we need to strive for the simplicity of a child, and raise our own children to have simple, unshakable testimonies of Jesus Christ. Then they will not fall prey to those temptations which would divert them from the strait and narrow way. As Elder Matthew Cowley used to say, “Life should be beautifully simple. And then it will be simply beautiful.” (“Learn to Live,” address delivered at Brigham Young University, 19 June 1953.)</p>

The occasions have been numerous, but the one that comes to mind is when one of our children was suffering from a bad earache and was very upset. I remember that after I had given her a blessing she settled down and went to sleep and experienced no further pain. It is a wonderful thing that when the Lord restored the fulness of the gospel, he made it possible for fathers to bless their families in so many ways.</p>

What father can resist the little upturned face saying, “I love you, daddy”? What mother does not feel an inward glow on finding a little note on her pillow: “I love you, mummy? It has been my privilege in many lands to hear the sweet voices of children echo the words of the Savior: “As I have loved you, … love one another.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/13.34" class="scriptureRef">John 13:34</a>.)</p>

Throughout the world, our missionaries are going two by two, preaching faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and repentance. There may be few who have retained all of the five qualities mentioned, but all can regain them through repentance and change.</p>

Many of us are not wise, for we are blinded by the material world around us. Wisdom comes from a realization of true values and priorities. It is a spiritual quality, for it is founded on discernment and an understanding heart. Great is the wisdom of the prophets, and all who heed them are blessed.</p>

Wisdom is a sign of maturity. It is usually related to age and experience, but not necessarily so. When serving as a mission president in Scotland, I saw the Lord quicken the understanding of many young missionaries so that they developed beyond their years. Now, less than five years later, six have been called as bishops and two into stake presidencies in the British Isles, and all are giving fine leadership.</p>

The family is the basic unit of society and the foundation of a nation. It is sobering to realize that, as parents, our children have been placed in our care as a sacred trust by the Almighty God himself. Our sons, our daughters, are his spirit children whom he expects us to love and cherish, teach and lead.</p>

However, it is not being accountable that brings maturity. It is realizing that we are accountable, acting accordingly, and being prepared to give an accounting to those in authority over us and eventually to the Lord himself.</p>

The adversary is constantly trying to distract us and deter us from living righteously and being able to render a good accounting of our actions.

We change friends quickly and change our view of the world according to circumstance and surroundings. As we mature, we become more dependable and stable. Paul the Apostle expressed the hope that “we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.14" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:14</a>.)</p>

However, as we “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, … and endure to the end” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>), we shall achieve the maturity of dependability, consistency, and spiritual endurance. I am very grateful for our beloved President Kimball who exemplifies these qualities. He has been a significant help to me, and I am sure to many of us, in the quest for spiritual maturity.</p>

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, became our Savior and Redeemer because he overcame the world. When Satan tempted him, he did not succumb; when he was ridiculed and reviled, he did not compromise.

        <span class="emphasis">Question number one: Why doesn’t God speak to us today?</span> My wife and I grew up as teenagers during the Second World War, and this question often came to our minds. We felt strongly the need for God’s guidance then, as we do today in these challenging and perilous times. Anciently, through the prophet Amos, the Lord had declared, “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>.) I never felt that revelations had ceased just because those already given had been bound into a book, the Holy Bible.</p>

God does speak again, through prophets, and revelation once more flows down from the heavens. These and many other wonderful truths enlightened our minds and lifted our souls as the missionaries taught us. How exciting to realize we are living in the latter days, “the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/3.21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 3:21</a>.) How wonderful to learn of another book of scripture, the Book of Mormon, revealed through a latter-day prophet as another testament of Jesus Christ.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Question number two: What is God like?</span> The Lord himself, in his beautiful intercessory prayer, petitioned: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.3" class="scriptureRef">John 17:3</a>.) What a contrast to the teachings of most churches that it is a mystery, that we cannot know and should not know what God is like.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/whats-the-difference.p7" pid="wriXZy3ZIk6AlSK63EdR2A" hash="8s6JRQ">How wonderful that the Almighty God has identified himself to us through his beloved son, Jesus Christ. He has revealed himself as our Father in Heaven, who wants us, his children, to keep in touch with him while we are away from our heavenly home. Ask a little child to close his eyes and think of God and then describe him. Will he describe a spirit? No! He will tell of a loving, kindly faced, white-robed personal being. In his epistle to the Hebrews, Paul describes Jesus, in relation to God the Father, as “being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/1.3" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 1:3</a>.) Yes, the Holy Bible answers the question as to what God is like, but people have been led astray by nonbiblical teachings and by half-truths. To correct the traditions of error handed down through the centuries, God himself has appeared in a pillar of light, together with his beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to the Prophet Joseph Smith.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Question number three: What does your church teach about family life?</span> The strength and moral fiber of a nation are in its families, and any church purporting to be Christian must cherish family life, both as a precious, God-given heritage and as a priceless, promised inheritance. I shall be eternally grateful that our missionary teachers expanded our vision of family significantly. They encouraged us to gather our children around us night and morning in family prayer. We were then introduced to family home evening, an institution in Latter-day Saint homes throughout the world. It is indeed a great anchor and fortress to gather together at least one evening a week to discuss applications of gospel principles, have happy, healthful activity, develop talents within the family circle, and to pray together. We often reminisce about the family home evenings we have had over the years, but there is something to be prized even more. Although previously married “until death do you part,” we have now been married in a Latter-day Saint temple for “time and eternity.” Our family can be forever!</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Question number four: How can God be just if baptism is essential and many die without knowing this?</span> I had been baptized by sprinkling as a baby, but I came to realize that baptism is for remission of my own sins, not for Adam’s or anyone else’s transgressions. I was happy to learn that little children need no baptism, for they are innocent until the age of accountability. But what of those who were accountable who had not received baptism before dying?</p>

The minister looked at me and quietly said: “Thank you for explaining that doctrine.” I was glad he had been enlightened but sad that he and so many others had failed to see before.

He is concerned, and in the year 1833 he gave such a warning through the latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith. This health law is called the Word of Wisdom. Oh, that the world would heed this counsel from the Lord through a prophet, for a great part of crime, sickness, and unhappiness in the world is drug related.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Question number six: How does your church care for you and fulfill your needs in addition to your Word of Wisdom?</span> Over the years of my membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I have greatly appreciated the opportunities for service, for there is no paid ministry. Every worthy male member of the Church above the age of twelve may hold an office in the priesthood. Similarly, the girls and women of the Church receive many assignments to lead and teach and serve. Each family is visited monthly by priesthood home teachers, who care for their needs, and by visiting teachers from the women’s Relief Society, whose motto is “charity never faileth.” We also enjoy all kinds of physical, spiritual and social activity, and receive instruction on such subjects as personal and family preparedness, including home production and storage.</p>

Such assistance comes from the general membership, who fast two meals each month and give the money to relieve the poor and the needy. Yes, the Lord does watch over us and counsel us and warn us through his appointed and ordained ministers. These teachings and inspired programs are now being shared with God’s children all over the world.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Question number seven: Why do you send missionaries all over the world, when most churches concentrate on third-world countries?</span> I must confess that question was in my mind when the young men knocked on our door and announced they were missionaries. Having studied the New Testament, I should have known the answer, for the Savior gave it so clearly as he instructed his Apostles just before his ascension. “Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/28.19" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 28:19</a>.) The fact that the Lord gave the commission is sufficient justification for carrying the gospel to the ends of the earth. People of all nations need the truth and purpose and happiness which the fulness of the gospel brings. Everyone should be interested in truth, and so we say to people of all faiths, Keep all the truth you have and we will add to it. This is why tens of thousands of young men and women and well over a thousand retired couples are voluntarily giving eighteen months to two years, preaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to all the world.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Question number eight: What is your understanding of the purpose of life?</span> In its basic form, this question might be expressed as “Why am I here?” There is a yearning deep down in all people to know the answer in order to live a purposeful life. As all loving parents do, our Heavenly Father had made a plan for us, his children, before this earth ever existed. In that period of time, which we call the premortal existence, we lived with God as his spirit children. In order for us to progress further, it was necessary for us to experience mortality by receiving a physical body provided by earthly parents. Being away from the presence of God for a while, we learn to walk by faith and develop qualities which will eventually qualify us to return to our heavenly home as resurrected beings.</p>

He has revealed the purpose of life and has given us the Holy Ghost that we might testify to others and know for ourselves that this is the living Church of the living Christ, and that he speaks through a living prophet, even our beloved President Spencer W. Kimball. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p1" pid="7oZi6OEeq0Kp4nyYf54C7w" hash="f9jQtA">President Benson, who speaks for the Lord to all the world, has challenged us to “live by the Spirit and teach by the Spirit.” How many times have we heard him say, “It’s the Spirit that counts in this work”? Yes, the Lord’s work is spiritual work. It relates to changing lives, developing true values, and overcoming worldly influences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p2" pid="9sDNRiogNU6kMlNjhCJXZg" hash="dNUOsg">Over the years, many people, especially youth, have asked me, “Elder Cuthbert, how can I become more spiritual?” My reply has always been the same: “You need to give more service.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p3" pid="uz7SmdDbCU6DPLrnrjqY_g" hash="j20acw">Service changes people. It refines, purifies, gives a finer perspective, and brings out the best in each one of us. It gets us looking outward instead of inward. It prompts us to consider others’ needs ahead of our own. Righteous service is the expression of true charity, such as the Savior showed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p4" pid="gGgFxR3ii0qN1pl5uAMtKA" hash="XoZxJA">How, then, does service increase our spirituality? May I share with you briefly ten aspects, from which you can choose those most applicable to your own situation?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p5" pid="MWlevmFrE0qA-MIF8XFqKw" hash="k-Bzvg">First, service helps us establish true values and priorities by distinguishing between the worth of material things that pass, and those things of lasting, even eternal, value. Our beloved prophet counsels: “If you would find yourself, learn to deny yourself for the blessing of others. Forget yourself and find someone who needs your service, and you will discover the secret to the happy, fulfilled life.” (Ezra Taft Benson, <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1979, p. 34.) We have a lovely sister who is living by us who has been confined to a wheelchair for twenty-seven years; she truly forgets herself in service to others as she gives firesides and helps wherever she can, with a cheerful smile and a positive attitude.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p6" pid="CPsHAhbjcUyrEd_0blWBmw" hash="IBtjPQ">Second, service helps us establish a righteous tradition. This is so necessary, particularly among young people. Wise parents will provide service opportunities in the home for their children from an early age. Growing up with this tradition will blossom into community service and Church service. It will develop a spirit of volunteerism in a world where people more often ask, “What’s in it for me?” The Lord has counseled: “For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p7" pid="ebIGTLSWek-v48Fs97aYUg" hash="numm_Q">“Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.26-27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:26–27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p8" pid="6tEz3W_jnkGtcKRo7iLcwg" hash="IYyIfQ">As I travel to stake conferences I am delighted to hear of youth service projects of various kinds, such as baptismal work in the temple, community cleanup efforts, and youth missions during vacation time. This is the way we shall save the rising generation from becoming a totally selfish, indulgent generation. We shall not save them by providing fun activities which are inward-looking.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p9" pid="_KJAGhgllkuH-6zt9ZqQJw" hash="KmMVlQ">Third, service helps us overcome selfishness and sin. Have you ever realized that all sin is selfish, whether it be lying, cheating, stealing, immorality, covetousness, or idleness? Sin is for one’s own ends, not another’s—certainly not for the Lord’s ends. Service, on the other hand, is unselfish and constitutes a positive power for good.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p10" pid="-X39k6AnlUSuWfZfcHBCiw" hash="Ztl4oQ">Anciently Isaiah lamented, “We have turned every one to his own way.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/53.6" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 53:6</a>.) In modern parlance, they “did their own thing,” whatever the adverse effect upon others. Even many of those who profess to understand free agency, or moral agency, turn liberty to license, as we can see all around us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p11" pid="SfM85jkmS0-MWiaBTFPOrA" hash="-GgSHw">Fourth, not only does service overcome selfishness and sin, but it helps to recompense for sin. The prophet Ezekiel explained this when he declared, “None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ezek/33.16" class="scriptureRef">Ezek. 33:16</a>.) Again, James taught that to “save a soul … shall hide a multitude of sins.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/5.20" class="scriptureRef">James 5:20</a>.) We can express regret and feel remorse for things done wrong, but <span class="emphasis">full</span> repentance should include recompense, such as service gives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p12" pid="9ktHWwG-5U27MSPhW2bHcQ" hash="Nf7pcA">Fifth, service helps us generate love and appreciation. We come to know people by serving them—their circumstances, their challenges, their hopes and aspirations. My wife and I have the privilege of visiting some widowed sisters who have become dear friends. What a blessing for us to learn of their missions and temple service and now family record extraction service unselfishly performed, despite many trials and heartaches.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p13" pid="KpcfCUjUvk2kDvCDoVDiPg" hash="ycItrQ">Sixth, service is the principal way of showing gratitude to the Savior. We need to fill ourselves up with gratitude for His redeeming love, His infinite atoning sacrifice, His obedience to the will of the Father. As we become full of gratitude, it overflows into service, and “inasmuch as [we] have done it unto one of the least of these [his] brethren, [we] have done it unto [Him].” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p14" pid="ihceZZxXP0eEQQD0r-bwYA" hash="v-_P3A">Seventh, service channels our desires and energies into righteous activity. Every son and daughter of God is a storehouse—even a powerhouse—of desires and energies, which may be used for good or evil. This great potential needs to be harnessed to bring blessings to others. I think of a group of young people who saw a film on famine in Africa and organized a charity concert to help those in need. I think of tens of thousands of Church members who responded to the First Presidency’s call for a special fast. This year’s famine and destitution is expected to be even worse in Africa, and again we need to prioritize the use of our resources in the Lord’s own way—not only for those in distant lands, but for the poor in our own communities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p15" pid="KV2-ybtv3U2_fCZs5bIOHg" hash="y2XGSg">Eighth, service helps us cleanse ourselves and become purified and sanctified. Not being perfect, are we not all sinners? Yes, we all need the redeeming and atoning blood of Christ to purge us of our sins. How is this accomplished? The way is through Christlike service, as expressed by the prayer of St. Ignatius Loyola, which I learned in my youth:</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p16" pid="HrGGI_mzkEmSn632VG64qA" hash="YBgQrw">Ninth, charitable service helps us do as the Savior did, for was not His whole ministry one of reaching out and helping, lifting and blessing, loving and caring? Jesus declares, “I am among you as he that serveth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.27" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:27</a>), and again, “For I will raise up unto myself a pure people, that will serve me in righteousness” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/100.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 100:16</a>). There are good people everywhere giving charitable service. Once, when we were visiting our missionaries and members in Nigeria, our vehicle broke down on a lonely road. Finally a car approached, and two young Nigerians got out. “The Lord told us to stop and help you,” they said. Help us they did, for they knew what the Lord would have them do. And so it should be with us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p17" pid="nhSV1fispkSXG0jVaolNpg" hash="nXL1mg">Tenth, service helps us to get to know the Savior, for “how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:13</a>.) As we immerse ourselves in the service of others, we find our spiritual selves and come unto Him. I was impressed while visiting the California Sacramento Mission a few months ago to meet a young, blind missionary elder. He had completely immersed himself in missionary service, despite his special needs, and his spirit shone through.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p18" pid="WZaEOxSRb0OqomLG-d8dMQ" hash="urc25Q">In all of these ways, righteous service brings us nearer to Christ, increases our spirituality, and brings others likewise. Such service is helping to prepare a people worthy, in the Lord’s due time, to redeem Zion.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p19" pid="-Uz-K55xy0G4FfProBOnMw" hash="2sCmig">As some of you may know, just after last October general conference, it was discovered that I had been seriously stricken with cancer, which was in its last stage. May I express my love and gratitude for the prayers and blessings and loving concern on my behalf which have brought about a miracle of recovery. As I give thanks for each new day of life, I express gratitude for the opportunities of service—past, present and future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p20" pid="A2FkcDK7806XXm3DNYAELg" hash="An2JUw">The wonderful thing about service is that there is no end to it. As President Benson says, “Therefore, let us serve one another with brotherly love, never tiring of the demands upon us, being patient and persevering and generous.” (<span class="emphasis">So Shall Ye Reap,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1960, pp. 173–74.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p21" pid="BScSp5g89Eeql1Wy7zyGdA" hash="XVOVAQ">Yes, as we give Christlike service, it helps us grow spiritually, “[put] off the natural man and [become] a saint” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>)—that is, one who is honestly trying to follow the Savior and doing what He would want us to do. What a marvelous feeling it is to have the Spirit of the Lord poured out more abundantly upon us as we bear one another’s burdens and share with and mourn with those in need. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-10" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:8–10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/the-spirituality-of-service.p22" pid="FK3jaWACfU2JsSygKQIfsA" hash="1y_jkQ">May this be our happy lot, I humbly pray, bearing my personal witness of the risen Lord Jesus Christ, His restored Church, and His living prophet, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
