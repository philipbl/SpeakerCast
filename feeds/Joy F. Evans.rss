      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/overcoming-challenges-along-lifes-way.p4" pid="UMhuqEFaJU2fBTMXT3ijag" hash="NEVhiQ">Some years ago, my husband, David, and I took our young children to a lake to vacation. He has always had the greatest confidence in their ability to do anything for which they are prepared. He taught a small son, age nine, how to manage a one-man sailboat, then let our son take the boat by himself out onto the lake. He joyfully sailed away, his bright life jacket and silhouette getting smaller and smaller against the horizon. Finally, we felt that Dave should make sure all was well, so in another little boat he sailed out to him. When he arrived Doug was sitting calmly in the boat, but he had forgotten how to turn it around! The thing I love was his response to his dad. He looked up and said, “I knew you’d come.”</p>

In some places fewer than 50 percent of the adult population can read or write; 70 percent of these adults are women.</p>

As with the pioneers, it is their faith that their Father will come, their faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

All of us have had losses or will have. Perhaps it is for this that we are taught “to mourn with those that mourn” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>) and to “weep for the loss of them that die” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:45</a>).</p>

We do miss those who die. No matter how many friends or family members one has, the loss of one beloved person is difficult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/overcoming-challenges-along-lifes-way.p13" pid="y5WbiJpD7kedbZMDdW4r7g" hash="zL11qg">One great difference for us is our added knowledge that death is not permanent, that families can be forever. The understanding we have of the reality of the Resurrection makes the waiting endurable and purposeful. Indeed, “sweet is the peace the gospel brings” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 14). Here, too, the solace sisters bring to each other and to sorrowing families is part of the work of love assigned to women.</p>

Many single sisters are living rich, full lives. They have made happy homes for themselves, their families, and friends. They serve as auxiliary leaders and teachers. They serve missions. They attend the temple and do genealogy work. They give compassionate service. They make the world better for their being in it.</p>

There are widowed sisters who live alone and those whose marriages have been shattered by divorce.</p>

Should they pursue a career? Can they be successful in what is traditionally a man’s business world? Should they try to be? How do they balance their expectations with the reality of their lives? How do they find worthwhile relationships that do not have sexual overtones? How can they best fulfill the role given by the Lord to women?</p>

Their challenges are many as they try to be both father and mother on what is most often a diminished income. If they are employed and trying to be self-reliant, there is great concern about quality child care. Even when their children are grown, single mothers are still mothers and share in the trials as well as the joys of their children. These are sobering realities for many sisters.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/overcoming-challenges-along-lifes-way.p18" pid="u8u7KP1IVUmRwhnPAPSvvg" hash="vt22sw">For all of them, there are no simple answers except, as for all sisters, to do the best they can every day—to look up; to learn; to evaluate resources within themselves, their families, their communities; to pray with faith; to search the scriptures; to find ways to be of service; to keep their own lives clean and pure, their relationships true; to forgive those who have caused the hurt.</p>

May she be included, welcomed, given opportunities to serve.</p>

The Lord God has decreed, “Thou shalt not.” And however hard the task, these people must likewise keep the commandments. Marriage and intimate relationships are to be reserved for husbands and wives, and any sexual relationship outside of marriage, whether between men and women or between those of the same sex, is forbidden.</p>

If such a person is listening, could we plead with you this night to repent, to seek help and forgiveness.</p>

He said, as it might be said today, “Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6.18" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 6:18</a>).</p>

I do not know, nor need I know, what her problem was, but she did summon the courage to go tearfully to her bishop to confess. A Church court was held. She was excommunicated and began the difficult process of repentance. Quite a long time later, after the spiritual healing had taken place and at the time of her baptism, she expressed great appreciation to a bishop who had shed tears of caring for her, even while being firm in the steps that must be taken; to a dear friend in Relief Society, who, she said, had helped her “to understand and forgive all those who couldn’t understand or forgive” her; to those who had helped to keep her testimony strong in those quiet, desperate times when “coming home again” seemed nearly impossible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/overcoming-challenges-along-lifes-way.p24" pid="oN7AwxNxPUiY66RF8E9q2w" hash="e-tyRA">I recently had a note from this friend, married now in the temple with a lovely family. She says, “Tell the sisters that it is all worth it. Tell them how beautiful and joyful life can be when you keep the commandments.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/overcoming-challenges-along-lifes-way.p25" pid="qbDjPjPXVkOoOq4XDGSnHA" hash="BkcnTw">Perhaps this lesson is twofold: If you are not personally living a pure, righteous life, if you have somehow slipped away, repent and come back. Love and hope are real!</p>

Sometimes what is said or done is less important than that someone cares enough to say or do anything at all.</p>

Some are themselves dependent on alcohol or on either legal prescription or illegal drugs. Some are the loved ones of alcoholics or drug users.</p>

Pretending there is no problem, covering up for the behavior, or shielding the person from the consequences of that behavior will never solve the problem. There are excellent professional resources and support groups, some of whom, though not connected officially with the Church, still support LDS values. Above all, acknowledge your dependence on the Lord. Let him help and heal you.</p>

All can be well again.</p>

The story he illustrates tells of Icarus, who tried to fly, using wings made of wax created by his father. He did indeed fly, but in his enthusiasm flew too near the sun; the wax melted, and he fell into the sea. In Bruegel’s painting, only his white legs are visible as he disappears into the green water. A nearby fisherman and a ploughman go unconcernedly about their work, and in spite of something amazing—a boy falling out of the sky—a beautiful ship in the harbor sails calmly on.</p>

Their house burned down, leaving little in the place of all their worldly possessions. The blessing was that even though five of their six children were at home, their two teenage sons remembered the training they had been given, picked up the little ones, and ran from the house. All were safe. And they felt great comfort from their ward and neighborhood, who rallied around with food, clothing, and offers of help. Such a blessing it is to belong to “the household of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:19</a>). No one simply turned away or sailed calmly on.</p>

Sometimes the service is given to our family, our children, our husbands or wives, our parents, our loved ones. Sometimes it is a neighbor or a friend in need, sometimes a stranger.</p>

They bless the lives of others and buoy up those who may be discouraged or homesick, frightened, or disheartened. They remember the counsel given us by a prophet that “God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom.” (Spencer W. Kimball, <span class="emphasis"> Ensign,</span> Dec. 1974, p. 5.) The book of Proverbs admonishes us to “withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/3.27" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 3:27</a>.)</p>

Seven of them are living, which means, of course, that three of them are not. During the times that I was pregnant I had to stay in bed much of the time, and it was always a great worry that I carry those precious babies until they were big enough to survive. During many weeks, my visiting teachers came with lunch for me or dinner for my family. They tended our toddlers and sent library books for me to read.</p>

How wonderful to have two little people with only one pregnancy! It was not to be for long, however—at least in this life. Our baby boy lived two days; our baby girl lived three. The sisters were there again, not only with food, but with a beautiful rose bush called “Duet” which flourished and grew. It was a sweet reminder of a tender time. The lovely blossoms helped us to remember our little ones, our friends, our gratitude for the gospel and for the Church.</p>

They will find friends somewhere; they will find comfort somewhere. What is our failure if they find it elsewhere because we were not there, were not welcoming?</p>

Times have changed greatly since those early days in Nauvoo when the sisters gave much of the only care given to the sick and dying, when they sewed the casket linings, made the burial clothes, cared tenderly for the bodies of the dead, and comforted the living. Life is not so hard now in our time and generation and has been lengthened for most of us and made infinitely more comfortable.</p>

We still are to help “bear … one another’s burdens” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/6.2" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 6:2</a>), “comfort those that stand in need of comfort,” and “mourn with those that mourn” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>).</p>

They are afraid of intruding or of saying the wrong thing. Perhaps they do not know how to relate to a dying person or to the family. They may feel emotions of anger, sadness, or confusion. Nevertheless, even they can find many ways to help.</p>

She herself was struggling to absorb the news, trying to pack for her own little family to leave the following day for the funeral. A good friend and neighbor arrived at her door with the announcement that he had come to clean their shoes. She had not even thought about shoes.</p>

He quietly slipped away when he finished, leaving the shoes ready to pack; even the soles were washed.</p>

And if the person says to me, ‘How did you know I needed that done?’ I reply, ‘It’s because a man once cleaned my shoes.’” (Madge Harrah, “He Cleaned Our Shoes,” <span class="emphasis">Reader’s Digest,</span> Dec. 1983, pp. 21–24.)</p>

It is most often a profound emotional and physical experience. The sick person and the family usually welcome regular emotional and spiritual support.</p>

The length of such care depends upon individual circumstances; even an hour or two can make a great difference to an overburdened family.</p>

People respond to grief in different ways. Not everyone recovers in the same period of time, and not everyone acts the same. The griever might be irritable, depressed, quiet, or withdrawn, but through kindness and friendship, he or she will almost always recover and will come to acceptance.</p>

This assurance guides those bowed down with grief out of the shadow and into the light. This knowledge we can share with one another: “I know that my Redeemer lives. What comfort this sweet sentence gives!” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 136.)</p>

How sensitive we should be to those who are suffering or hurting, to those with special problems—the sister who has had a miscarriage or a stillbirth, a premature or handicapped child; the one whose beloved husband has died; the lovely woman to whom marriage and family have not yet come; the new convert whose family has rejected her because of her baptism.</p>

I love something Dag Hammarskjold once said when he was secretary general of the United Nations: “You have not done enough, you have never done enough as long as there is something more that you can contribute.” (Richard L. Evans, Jr., <span class="emphasis">Richard L. Evans—The Man and the Message,</span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1973, p. 256.)</p>

It is often the lives, like the stars, which simply pour down on us the calm light of their bright and faithful being, up to which we look and out of which we gather the deepest calm and courage. It is good to know that even when we can no longer do something for our fellowmen, we can still be something for them; to know, and this surely, that no man or woman of the humblest sort can really be strong, gentle, and good without the world’s being better for that goodness.”</p>

We may worry or fret or doubt, yet we want to believe. It is comforting to me to know that the Lord knew even that this would be so and gave us in the book of Mark a wonderful story of a distraught father who brought his son to the Savior to be healed of a condition which sounds perhaps like epilepsy. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/9.14-29" class="scriptureRef">Mark 9:14–29</a>.)</p>

As Alma said, “Even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:27</a>.)

Then perhaps we shall be remembered among those on the right hand of the Lord when he shall come in his glory.</p>
