      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p1" pid="c86GtkFNL0KjQxUkGL0oCw" hash="C7ECOg">In the early spring of 1842 the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo united the charitable efforts of women in a desire to support the priesthood in the cause of Zion. The Prophet Joseph Smith told the sisters “their offering [was] accepted of the Lord,” and the sisters gave unstintingly (“Story of the Organization of the Relief Society,” <span class="emphasis">Relief Society Magazine,</span> Mar. 1919, p. 129). Following his injunction to search out the poor and needy and minister to their wants, they called a committee that went from house to house. The members who had means were asked to give, and the needy were referred to the society for aid.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p2" pid="o94Ez8MHaU--eznBKbRrLA" hash="DP8nmw">Their reports typically read: one family “poor, sick &amp; distressed and no bedding,” two families by the river “sick &amp; nothing to eat,” one widow “destitute of money” (Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, <span class="emphasis">History of Relief Society 1842–1966,</span> Salt Lake City: General Board of Relief Society, p. 24). Donations included sugar, bedding and clothes, onions, flour—whatever they had to give. One sister, having no goods, offered her time, “any portion or all,” she said. Another would “knit, sew or wait on the sick” (<span class="emphasis">History of Relief Society 1842–1966,</span> p. 23). When President Joseph Smith organized the Relief Society, he predicted “better days [for] the poor and needy,” and through the efforts of these devoted sisters many Saints were cared for and comforted (see <span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:607).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p3" pid="2YWhAqfAU0uVhYRorwlKlw" hash="sVWqvQ">Perhaps this one line, taken from the records, could best describe these efforts: “We have not said be ye warmed and clothed without trying to do it” (<span class="emphasis">History of Relief Society 1842–1966,</span> p. 25). To a divine concept they added their commitment—and to gospel principles, practice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p4" pid="Q6K9C7Tb1kaJBtov-rpHEg" hash="Svzgxw">Today’s problems of families reflect the increasing complexity of our time. The welfare services of the Church include multiple systems and long-range plans, but the <span class="emphasis">constant</span> through all its development is the application of gospel principles in loving concern for another’s need.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p5" pid="WzwjNzpCiE-tx8lX3bBQ3w" hash="RB7ASg">A Relief Society president knows that, in spite of a report which shows members receiving temporary assistance constitute 4 percent of a ward, to the sister in distress it is 100 percent. Her needs are whole and real. Consider the case of a woman we shall call Sister Allen. Troubled and lonely, she had just returned from a hospital stay and major surgery. Two months before, her husband had abandoned his responsibilities to their family of five. The bishop had visited, and now the Relief Society president came. It was a family-needs visit, and as they talked Sister Allen spoke wistfully of having some cream of asparagus soup and blueberry muffins. These items were not on the bishop’s order form and could have been dismissed as not available. But the president really wanted to serve Sister Allen and wondered if this rather special request might suggest a need for more than food. What was Sister Allen’s real need? Was it for commodities or for consideration, for someone to demonstrate that she was worthwhile by giving her special attention now, when her problems seemed to overwhelm her?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p6" pid="22rRjf8xxk-P0aZJDNFPgQ" hash="MU_rxA">Sensing the larger need, the Relief Society president ordered the items available through the storehouse, then assigned compassionate service responsibilities to her visiting teachers and others to provide meals that included the muffins and the soup and also to show their concern in other visible and tangible ways. Sister Allen responded. She got better, aided by the food but more so by their friendship.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p7" pid="A3Tedb3qsUaT4U0CZa6ufg" hash="fd1A-g">Each problem is in some way unique and may require a special sensitivity to the care needed. President Romney said at last October conference that no hard-and-fast rules will ever be given in answer to the questions, Who should assist? How much assistance should be given? How long and how often should I assist? (see <span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Nov. 1979, p. 96).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p8" pid="xerxH4nCBEi80liKcpF3Fw" hash="PUBGeQ">Caring for others, like the “quality of mercy,” is “twice blest: Bless[ing] him that gives and him that [receives]” (William Shakespeare, <span class="emphasis">Merchant of Venice,</span> act 4, sc. 1, lines 184, 186–87). In giving we grow in patience, humility, faith—all the elements of that pure love called charity. Every sister, whether she is single or married, living alone or in a family, needs the opportunity to develop these Christlike attributes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p9" pid="FDa4Xy27cU-J6dVzn9lvRw" hash="m6Rgjw">Relief Society works with priesthood leaders to care for the sick and needy and at the same time teaches, through its curriculum, the welfare principles and concepts which help every sister meet her own needs and give to others the kind of care that has always distinguished truly compassionate service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p10" pid="Ob2Dlfeb9k2g2sc923Y5oQ" hash="tpKWIQ">The six welfare principles stressed by President Kimball—love, work, service, stewardship, self-reliance and consecration—are the foundation stones upon which all welfare services are built. Relief Society, incorporating them into its lessons, teaches the Christlike qualities of pure love, or charity; teaches that work sustains, that service gives work its meaning, that stewardship brings accountability, and that self-reliance allows a freedom to focus on another’s needs, and that consecration is to give all one has.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p11" pid="lSUFmhFKaUidhLAeWXwqtA" hash="e127mQ">The stake Relief Society education counselor can foster an understanding of these principles by first identifying them in Relief Society lessons; for example, the relationship of work and self-reliance to problem solving, or the importance of love and service in building self-esteem. Then, recognizing the importance of these principles not only in helping sisters to serve but in preparing them to meet or prevent crises in their own lives, she can make certain that they are emphasized in Relief Society teaching.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p12" pid="4LdIkqVbqUuVUhujooPViw" hash="P_Mr7A">An education counselor should remember the words of the Lord when he said, “I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/8.10" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 8:10</a>). She should recognize her stewardship to see that these gospel principles are taught in the Relief Societies of her stake—taught so effectively that sisters “having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/8.15" class="scriptureRef">Luke 8:15</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p13" pid="v7P6Cbbc9Uqm16n5Hr_giw" hash="CW_YNA">Recently, we met a young woman who had learned to make these principles operative in her life. Bringing Sister Smith a beautiful rose, she came to express her love and her gratitude for the blessings of the gospel. She is handicapped, and so is the more grateful for blessings because she knows so well pain and difficulty. When telling of how she is able to keep a house and care for a husband, she said it does take her longer, but a friend goes to the store to get what she needs, and she has learned to do almost everything else for herself. Cutting carrot strips for a ward dinner is a challenge, but she does it and in accepting such opportunities enjoys the fulfillment of service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p14" pid="wnNqKKwEskGHZnCzmcybCw" hash="VAnQ_g">The desire to support the priesthood in this great latter-day work, first seen in the Nauvoo sisters, has led Relief Society women over many years to establish health facilities, store grain, serve adoptive parents, and meet other critical needs. This same desire motivates the Relief Society today. Teaching is one means of helping the sisters and their families realize the great promise declared by President Kimball:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p15" pid="yjf2PHD_7EGZxY5PYpu7BA" hash="3hJu-A">“As givers gain control of their desires and properly see other needs in light of their own wants, then the powers of the gospel are released in their lives. They learn that by living the great law of consecration they insure not only temporal salvation but also spiritual sanctification” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1977, p. 77).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/04/welfare-principles-in-relief-society.p16" pid="QwqrNQQSTECpnhFW1W0jYg" hash="SF9xnw">That we may each fulfill our stewardship and earn this great reward I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-doctrines-of-the-kingdom.p2" pid="sHAM7ZQNS0CIKEOzm33v5Q" hash="VlmPBg">In our anxiety to find ready solutions to the problems we face, we do sometimes overlook fundamental truths and thereby fail to learn the sure way. Love one another; sow and you will reap; uphold the priesthood—these and other doctrines of the kingdom become a firm foundation. In their truth lie answers and solutions. As we learn and live these truths, we can bless the lives of others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-doctrines-of-the-kingdom.p3" pid="nuCTbHE7-EKfhtX9Rm2ncg" hash="Tb3Qzg">At a meeting recently, a friend told of how, facing a particularly difficult problem, he asked Elder Boyd K. Packer for direction. In giving his counsel, Elder Packer asked, “Would it make any difference if you remember that this is truly the Church of Jesus Christ?” Set clearly against the reality of truth, the problem was easily confronted.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-doctrines-of-the-kingdom.p4" pid="Ud7uV5zerEyiB1MJNowGBw" hash="elybUg">Perhaps we could apply this same kind of test to a Relief Society problem: does a woman need an education or career-related training if she is to be a housewife and rear a family? Would the answer to the question become clear if we remember that we are children of an Eternal Father, striving to return to his presence?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-doctrines-of-the-kingdom.p5" pid="1AzBk4I34E6nE_jyaDd8LA" hash="mionUw">Since it is true that we are children of God, then should not every woman seek for light and truth, to achieve her own perfection, and when she is blessed with children, to provide for them an environment in which they can grow toward godhood?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-doctrines-of-the-kingdom.p6" pid="bddIrDLlIECGSamsAdOXzg" hash="YH6_7Q">Providing that environment can sometimes tax one’s preparation. I recall vividly the time when one of our children, then a first-grader, came bursting into the kitchen to tell me of a new word he had just learned. It was a hard and adult word, but he was so proudly spelling and pronouncing it. Yet, when he spelled it one letter was wrong. As I look back, I am not sure why I did not correct him. Perhaps I thought it wouldn’t matter for the moment. He went from the kitchen to where his father was studying and told him his new word. His father explained the error and corrected it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-doctrines-of-the-kingdom.p7" pid="jLJjjx7ymUqEMIAs6gyoCQ" hash="6yHPeQ">Our son came back to me and asked, “Mother, why didn’t you tell me it was wrong?” I didn’t have a very good answer that day, but I had a good lesson. I learned how much it does matter, and that children depend upon mothers to tell them what is wrong—what is wrong and right about words, about life, and about the world with which they are trying to cope. I think it is not possible for a mother to be overtrained for her role.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-doctrines-of-the-kingdom.p8" pid="zxGQc-Jn60KrfkP4oK6fAw" hash="kFSk_g">Learning is for every woman; it is not a function of being married or single, of being a mother or not.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-doctrines-of-the-kingdom.p9" pid="n9GXssg1lUezqTfnRUFPow" hash="ugYk5w">In the newly structured Relief Society stake board, additional emphasis has been given to welfare, compassionate service, and the needs of individual women. The remaining work of Relief Society has been divided into two basic areas of women’s responsibilities—homemaking and education. Significantly, it is not homemaking <span class="emphasis">or</span> education, but homemaking <span class="emphasis">and</span> education. For a Relief Society woman, the wholeness that is so closely related to holiness is achieved, in part, through her acceptance of the responsibility to establish a home whatever her circumstances—and then to bring to that home, learning and the light of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-doctrines-of-the-kingdom.p10" pid="o5ZLi6cyVkCmMSCbVjbrcg" hash="ktL3Cg">The emphasis on education given in the Relief Society program is designed to help a woman make a place in her life for learning, for learning as much as she can, and for developing her gifts and talents. What she learns will expand her influence for good as she then teaches and blesses others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1980/10/the-doctrines-of-the-kingdom.p11" pid="Pjqjak-2_kGy-1LLK_qBcg" hash="yqHLzw">Our President Kimball has strongly urged us, each one, to become well informed and articulate; to be strong, independent, and faithful.</p>

Fortified by the true principles of the gospel, Relief Society women must accept the challenges of the day.</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p6" pid="Nr4vfuFw1EC8FVpuxjzpDw" hash="BJz0lw">We do not speak much of matriarchs; we call them instead, mothers. The mother is the counterpart to the patriarch of a home. Mothering is also an eternal, fundamental work. It has to do with bringing life and love, and it is largely learned.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p7" pid="MVGkfXiJAkixpKtAux7QMA" hash="rA7gFQ">Some young college students learned it when, as Relief Society members, they visited weekly with sisters in a local nursing home. The first weeks found many of the women in a resigned, even lethargic state. For the most part they had given up trying to do anything with their lives; they were simply waiting them out. But the girls continued to visit, some bringing short musical programs, others reading or helping them write letters. Gradually the women began to look forward to the weekly visits, and then, some of the vitality of these young Relief Society sisters carried on through the week. The girls nurtured every spark of interest. When they found that many of the women had been quilters, they got the necessary equipment for them and set it up. The women quickly finished one exciting quilt and were ready to start a second. A few chose to do other projects the students brought. The story continues to be one of activity and vitality. These young students brought new life and love; they were “mother” to the elderly sisters.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p8" pid="8Gb90_60OE-xYezYy_tMgA" hash="0YJxyQ">Mother Education lessons deal not with the physical processes of giving birth but with the nurturing qualities that can help every child of God live in the light. As we focus on gospel principles and adapt lessons to the current needs of sisters, Mother Education can be not only suitable but enriching for all Relief Society members.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p9" pid="4bSTXrs7G02RmLuFifbuiw" hash="c8F8Tw">We are told in <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.26" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:26</a> that Adam called his wife Eve because she was the mother of all living. We are all daughters of Eve. I think of one sister who fills a very responsible position in Relief Society. Although, being single, she has no children, she has important work in her profession. She touches the minds as well as the hearts of young people; she uses fully her excellent talents and training; she brings love and light to the lives of others. I believe that her role is directed and accepted of the Lord as is my neighbor’s, a mother of eight. Mothering roles differ and may yet take on other dimensions, but we can each learn to use the principles that relate to motherhood.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p10" pid="2Gq8oHvjMUW5Eh_wb7N5XQ" hash="cRIo-Q">The young mother who must constantly care for the needs of her children and at the same time be the example on which they might appropriately model their lives, has a responsibility that challenges the most able. She it is who must learn and practice patience, teach and persuade with love, correct but not coerce; in short, develop every maternal attribute.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p11" pid="XH8jEcyinkaWqbMkQFd3MA" hash="bOzfEQ">But we all must find ways to learn and keep these qualities, for, Eve-like, we shall ever be the mothers.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p12" pid="I4vS-e9D9EGR2zThBZc47Q" hash="B1AEVQ">The Social Relations, Cultural Refinement, and fifth-week service-related lessons all contain gospel principles in a priesthood supporting context that make them meaningful to our day-by-day effort to follow the way marked by the Savior. Our lessons have helped us to refine our perception of arts and people, thereby reinforcing an appreciation of our world-wide Church.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p13" pid="3_oaVveLRUCPJetF6Gd-Nw" hash="I0dO1A">Positive reinforcement is equally effective in our supervisory relationships. For instance, a monthly meeting of each class leader with the ward Education Counselor can help a teacher learn from every lesson. This one-to-one exchange will be most useful if the Education Counselor’s comments on the lessons are positive and specific.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p14" pid="b6GQHIoOjkGMEf42Csd_Bg" hash="1S_IVw">A teacher often knows what went wrong in a lesson, and although she may choose to discuss it, she probably does not need to be reminded of it. On the other hand, she may not realize what part was most effective and would be grateful for commendation; if, however, a teacher is simply praised for a beautiful or wonderful lesson, she may not know what made it successful and how to build on her strengths. But if the Education Counselor learns to look for specific elements, such as an arresting beginning, a thoughtful handling of class comments, she will be able to help the teacher by positive reinforcement.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p15" pid="Ryr3ecvYrEq-A2HZlVacXw" hash="QbgQBw">Finally, the ongoing Relief Society learning opportunities will be effective in the lives of sisters to the degree that learning and teaching are by the Spirit. Let me tell you of a sister who helped me appreciate teaching by the Spirit.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p16" pid="A7czuKU8lUCSZDmcEToX0Q" hash="pcf04w">She was an older woman, one of many immigrants who had been able to come only as far as New York City on the way to Zion. She had not had great opportunity for learning and was having difficulty adjusting to a new culture. We were the only two in our department at stake leadership meeting one night.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p17" pid="l8ApwMz_OUulHs94079tlA" hash="AZabQA">The board member asked us each to describe how we prepared our lessons. I had been trained as a teacher and could say some things about lesson plans and objectives; but this lovely sister, haltingly, in a language newly learned, spoke of how she studied the material and then got on her knees and asked the Lord what in that lesson she should stress for the sisters of her ward, and she said, “He always directs me.” As I heard her speak and experienced the sweetness of her spirit, I felt sure that he did, because she taught me what I needed to hear. Though it has been many years since that night in Manhattan, I have never forgotten her nor her message.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/an-opportunity-for-continual-learning.p18" pid="RPY8T2n09kmFi19VBz3J-A" hash="NEYe1g">As we continue to learn, with the Spirit of the Lord as our guide, we prepare for his coming. The Lord declared that when he comes again there will be no need for each one to tell his neighbor that he is the Christ, for all shall know. That we may increase in knowledge and intelligence and be prepared for that glorious event, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
