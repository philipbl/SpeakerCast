        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="16"></span>Years ago I visited Nauvoo, Illinois, with my family. There the early Saints had come seeking refuge. Many had lost their homes and their farms, and some had lost their loved ones to the growing persecution. In Nauvoo they gathered and built a new and beautiful city. But the persecution was relentless, and by 1846 they were once again forced to leave their homes—this time in the middle of winter. They lined up their wagons on Parley Street, awaiting their turn to cross the frozen waters of the Mississippi River into an unknown future.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p2" pid="aMBTDqeP0ke7RNbmMqsXkQ" hash="snjhUg">As we stood on Parley Street reflecting upon their desperate conditions, my eyes were drawn to a series of wooden signs nailed to fence posts upon which were etched quotes from the diaries of these suffering Saints. As we read each quote, to our amazement what we found in their words was not desperation and discouragement but confidence and commitment and even joy. They were filled with hope, the hope that is reflected by this quote from the diary of Sarah DeArmon Rich, February 1846: “To start out on such a journey in the winter … would seem like walking into the jaws of death but we had faith … [and] we felt to rejoice that the day of our deliverance had come.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p3" pid="tqxTLnXUx0i4_kKGWUMBug" hash="cMSF6A">These early Saints were indeed homeless, but they were not hopeless. Their hearts were broken, but their spirits were strong. They had learned a profound and important lesson. They had learned that hope, with its attendant blessings of peace and joy, does not depend upon circumstance. They had discovered that the true source of hope is faith—faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His infinite Atonement, the one sure foundation upon which to build our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p4" pid="2gayc25TWUu-0_A69edk7Q" hash="VzuYuw">Today another group of pioneers exemplifies this important principle. On Tuesday, the 12th of January, a massive earthquake struck the country of Haiti. The earthquake left the capital city of Port-au-Prince in shambles. Its impact was devastating—an estimated 1,000,000 people were left homeless, and over 200,000 were reported dead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p5" pid="r9kv8z9WjkuG-7-wuw3m_A" hash="24D2nA">While the world followed the unprecedented international response, another remarkable and inspiring rescue effort was under way in Port-au-Prince—this one directed by a committee made up of local Haitian Church leaders organized according to the priesthood pattern and operating under inspiration. Members of the committee included, among others, the two stake presidents and the two stake Relief Society presidents in Port-au-Prince and the mission president, who at age 30 presides over 74 full-time missionaries in the Haiti Port-au-Prince Mission. All of his missionaries are Haitian, and miraculously not one of them was injured in this devastating earthquake.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p6" pid="q_HONy_5CU6A6h2Mpgmddw" hash="ujfDyA">Into the hands of these local inspired leaders were placed the resources of the Church, resources which included the generous contributions of many of you. For these contributions, the people of Haiti are profoundly thankful. Under the direction of the committee, truckloads of provisions arrived from the Dominican Republic almost immediately. Within days of the earthquake, planeloads of food, water purification systems, tents, blankets, and medical supplies arrived, along with a team of doctors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p7" pid="3RePfA3AwEaH9U5g8R8dqg" hash="93vqcg">The nine chapels in and around Port-au-Prince were mostly undamaged—another remarkable miracle. During the weeks that <span class="pageBreak" page-number="17"></span>followed the earthquake, they became shelters for over 5,000 Haitians and bases from which food, water, and medical attention were distributed. Basic needs were met, and order began to emerge out of chaos.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p8" pid="rlHMnduUREOktw04P9BFpg" hash="MY7wOQ">Though the faithful Haitian Saints have suffered greatly, they are filled with hope for the future. Like the early pioneers in 1846, their hearts are broken but their spirits are strong. They too are teaching us that hope and happiness and joy are not products of circumstance but of faith in the Lord.</p>

If you are one of those, remember that hope comes as a result of faith. If we would build our hope, we must build our faith.</p>

The Apostle James taught that even the devils believe and tremble.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> But true faith requires work. The difference between the devils and the faithful members of this Church is not belief but work. Faith grows by keeping the commandments. We must work at keeping the commandments. From the Bible Dictionary we read that “miracles do not produce faith but strong faith is developed by obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ; in other words, faith comes by righteousness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/the-rock-of-our-redeemer.p16" pid="1sxlAGJGnUiXcKntPbpS6g" hash="-exDaw">When we strive to keep the commandments of God, repenting of our sins and promising our best efforts to follow the Savior, we begin to grow in confidence that through the Atonement everything will be all right. Those feelings are confirmed by the Holy Ghost, who drives from us what our pioneer mothers and fathers called “our useless cares.” In spite of our trials, we are filled with a sense of well-being and feel to sing with them that indeed “all is well.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

For some, solutions to depression and anxieties will be found through consultation with competent professionals. But for most of us, sadness and fear begin to melt away and are replaced by happiness and peace when we put our trust in the Author of the plan of happiness and when we develop faith in the Prince of Peace.</p>

He and his family are people of great faith. It was inspiring to see how their faith carried them through this very difficult time. They were filled with an inner peace that sustained and strengthened them. With their permission I would like to read from a family member’s letter written just days before her father passed away:</p>

We are at peace. … It has been the hardest thing any of us has ever experienced, but we feel peace in the knowledge that … our Father in Heaven has promised that we will live together as a family again. After the doctor told Dad in the hospital that there was nothing left to be done, he looked at all of us with perfect faith and boldly asked, ‘Does anybody in this room have a problem with the plan of <span class="pageBreak" page-number="18"></span>salvation?’ We do not and are grateful for a father and mother who have taught us to have perfect trust in the plan.”</p>

			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p5" pid="obg8jmuwakqzsjlRQ18MMw" hash="UVcvew">Years ago I listened to a radio interview of a young doctor who worked in a hospital in the Navajo Nation. He told of an experience he had one night when an old Native American man with long braided hair came into the emergency room. The young doctor took his clipboard, approached the man, and said, “How can I help you?” The old man looked straight ahead and said nothing. The doctor, feeling somewhat impatient, tried again. “I cannot help you if you don’t speak to me,” he said. “Tell me why you have come to the hospital.”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p6" pid="yRu98M4090uTfGU5p1vC-w" hash="RWDnRA">The old man then looked at him and said, “Do you dance?” As the young doctor pondered the strange question, it occurred to him that perhaps his patient was a tribal medicine man who, according to ancient tribal customs, sought to heal the sick through song and dance rather than through prescribing medication.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p7" pid="VqonMjIfqEy19R6l4M_TAA" hash="dODkJA">“No,” said the doctor, “I don’t dance. Do you dance?” The old man nodded yes. Then the doctor asked, “Could you teach me to dance?”</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p8" pid="h6FCRsAyvUK_zEA_s8gujA" hash="xJ1UxA">The old man’s response has for many years caused me much reflection. “I can teach you to dance,” he said, “but you have to hear the music.”</p>
		</span>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p9" pid="7XBEM6OjjEOrDR0m-s9tqA" hash="UbasNg">Sometimes in our homes, we successfully teach the dance steps but are not as successful in helping our family members to hear the music. And as the old medicine man well knew, it is hard to dance without music. Dancing without music is awkward and unfulfilling—even embarrassing. Have you ever tried it?</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p10" pid="_QZTV8vjv0GkkqjgvZZVOw" hash="I7u8gA">In section 8 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord taught Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, “Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2" class="scriptureRef">verse 2</a>). We learn the dance steps with our minds, but we hear the music with our hearts. The dance steps of the gospel are the things we do; the music of the gospel is the joyful spiritual feeling that comes from the Holy Ghost. It brings a change of heart and is the source of all righteous desires. The dance steps require discipline, but the joy of the dance will be experienced only when we come to hear the music.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p11" pid="1O6t_ATlL06B2sUjn4oQaQ" hash="pXj_OA">There are those who ridicule members of the Church for the things we do. That is understandable. Those who dance often appear strange or awkward or, to use a scriptural term, “peculiar” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Peter 2:9</a>) to those who cannot hear the music. Have you ever stopped your car at a stoplight next to a car where the driver was dancing and singing at the top of his lungs—but you couldn’t hear a sound because your windows were rolled up? Didn’t he look a little peculiar? If our children learn the dance steps without learning to hear and to feel the beautiful music of the gospel, they will over time become uncomfortable with the dance and will either quit dancing or, almost as bad, keep dancing only because of the pressure they feel from others who are dancing around them.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p12" pid="H5BJziSMOECC9isfIpntRQ" hash="WKCO0w">The challenge for all of us who seek to teach the gospel is to expand the curriculum beyond just the dance steps. Our children’s happiness depends on their ability to hear and love the beautiful music of the gospel. How do we do it?</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p13" pid="ZCJz2WlRaky22HMUsslR5w" hash="G4BREg">First, we must keep our own lives attuned to the correct spiritual frequency. Back in the olden days, before the digital age, we found our favorite radio station by carefully turning the radio dial until it lined up perfectly with the station’s frequency. As we approached the number, we could hear only static. But when we finally made the precise alignment, our favorite music could be heard clearly. In our lives, we have to align with the correct frequency in order to hear the music of the Spirit.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p14" pid="mYJQbB4X2UC8hMTkmUJHhw" hash="mKyNdw">When we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost after baptism, we are filled with the heavenly music that accompanies conversion. Our hearts are changed, and we “have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>). But the Spirit will not endure unkindness or pride or envy. If we lose that delicate influence in our lives, the rich harmonies of the gospel can quickly become dissonant and can ultimately be silenced. Alma asked the poignant question: “If ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:26</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p15" pid="yPtFAXSJa0igcxPTPLVwNg" hash="4e1LIg">Parents, if our lives are out of tune with the music of the gospel, we need to tune them up. As President Thomas S. Monson taught us last October, we must ponder the path of our feet (see “Ponder the Path of Thy Feet,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign</span> or <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Nov. 2014, 86–88). We know how to do it. We must walk the same path that we walked when we first heard the heavenly strains of gospel music. We exercise faith in Christ, repent, and take the sacrament; we feel more strongly the influence of the Holy Ghost; and the music of the gospel begins to play again in our lives.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p16" pid="h9JGNq4X5UK9KclOgqjtxw" hash="Sbp4MQ">Second, when we can hear the music ourselves, we must try our best to perform it in our homes. It is not something that can be forced or compelled. “No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood”—or by virtue of being the dad or the mom or the biggest or the loudest—“only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, … by love unfeigned; [and] by kindness” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41-42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:41–42</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p17" pid="8OkLQAzcxkOhwgmihTSTBg" hash="MXJe8w">Why would these attributes lead to increasing power and influence in a home? Because they are the attributes that invite the Spirit of the Holy Ghost. They are the attributes that tune our hearts to the music of the gospel. When they are present, the dance steps will be performed more naturally and joyfully by all of the dancers in the family, without the need for threats or intimidation or compulsion.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p18" pid="v0U8-kdtWUaUV8QHUoWL-Q" hash="eS272Q">When our children are little, we can sing them the lullaby of love unfeigned, and when they are obstinate and refuse to go to sleep at night, we might need to sing the lullaby of long-suffering. When they are teenagers, we can tune out the cacophony of arguments and threats and, instead, perform the beautiful music of persuasion—and perhaps sing the second verse of the lullaby of long-suffering. Parents can perform in perfect harmony the tandem attributes of gentleness and meekness. We can invite our children to sing along with us in unison as we practice kindness toward a neighbor who is in need.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p19" pid="jraCaVJ1-EeNSgmLEj1WUg" hash="tLJZ8A">It won’t come all at once. As every accomplished musician knows, it takes diligent practice to perform beautiful music. If early efforts at making music seem dissonant and discordant, remember that dissonance cannot be corrected by criticism. Dissonance in the home is like darkness in a room. It does little good to scold the darkness. We must <span class="emphasis">displace</span> the darkness by introducing light.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p20" pid="oKGIWWIVdkasvJ0y0Ja79g" hash="hjTpew">So if the basses in your family choir are too loud and overbearing, or if the string section in your family orchestra is a little too shrill or a little bit sharp, or if those impetuous piccolos are out of tune or out of control, be patient. If you’re not hearing the music of the gospel in your home, please remember these two words: <span class="emphasis">keep practicing.</span> With God’s help, the day will come when the music of the gospel will fill your home with unspeakable joy.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p21" pid="CQ0wndf6N06lfoxSGeiNGg" hash="gxv47w">Even when performed well, the music will not solve all of our problems. There will still be crescendos and decrescendos in our lives, staccatos and legatos. Such is the nature of life on planet earth.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p22" pid="2GXRWwzCUkKbHdveh2XV_A" hash="3_bTcw">But when we add music to the dance steps, the sometimes complicated rhythms of marriage and family life tend to move toward a harmonious balance. Even our most difficult challenges will add rich plaintive tones and moving motifs. The doctrines of the priesthood will begin to distill upon our souls as the dews from heaven. The Holy Ghost will be our constant companion, and our scepter—a clear reference to power and influence—will be an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth. And our dominion will be an everlasting dominion. And without compulsory means it will flow unto us forever and ever (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45-46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45–46</a>).</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/04/the-music-of-the-gospel.p23" pid="aLsvC9Qau0u9c5ycmeFv7w" hash="lFD5uw">May it be so in each of our lives and in each of our homes is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
