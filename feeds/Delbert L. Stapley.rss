Most worthwhile messages have been given, which recalls a statement by a young man in his late teens. He sought out his stake president following a stake conference attended by our beloved brother, the late Elder Thorpe B. Isaacson, and enthusiastically said, in the jargon of youth, “President, this conference really shook me. Elder Isaacson was really round.” And then he added, “This was a hairy conference.” Now you dig his meaning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p2" guid="cc94dc39-f757-4072-9563-1b134c4d63ea" pid="LD6zRISX402arIEyO9jIwA" hash="2vCQcA">The first part of the thirteenth Article of Faith states: “We believe in being honest.” [<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:13</a>] Honesty embraces many meanings, such as integrity, sincerity, according to the truth, just, honorable, virtuous, purity of life, moral character, and uprightness in mutual dealings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p3" guid="90977803-7d04-45d5-a7d3-cc9d685ed8e0" pid="NpzeKtigX0iBzPZLwIPF_w" hash="WI84sA">These principles are required virtues of true Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p4" guid="a8bb919a-1a00-40fa-9c97-8d6e27303ea4" pid="2ap2hZa_ekG_g5WMSEqKnQ" hash="mCOf8g">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands for the highest ideals, principles, and standards known to man. There is nothing about the Church, its teachings, or what it represents that we need be ashamed of. The Church has immeasurable influence for good in the lives of men and women everywhere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p5" guid="f1c517c1-57a3-4f9c-a558-632d5a8351a3" pid="2vAtaffEkUWL2HV55xI3YQ" hash="RRihtg">Robert Burns said: “An honest man’s the noblest work of God.” Today, with honesty and integrity among men of high position at a low ebb and becoming lost virtues, some group must diligently teach, practice, and enthrone these principles as cardinal qualities in the character of man. It is more and more important that we have complete moral integrity in the men who shape our destinies, else the freedoms of this country will be sacrifices. The reports of dishonesty, graft, and corruption in government, business, professional, and financial circles in our national life lessen our position and strength as a world leader.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p6" guid="d926ca3a-d3fb-4e8b-bfbc-1d9734e4da10" pid="rUqghVnnXU-VGQS6S2A-uw" hash="Bhx2Nw">In all humility and sincerity we must admit a power higher than ourselves from whom is derived a positive moral code that will give our lives significance and purpose. We also must remember once and for all that honesty, respect, and honor as such are not for sale on the market block. They are ingredients that you and I and all people should put into our daily lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p7" guid="0b6b33f1-2500-45d1-a200-4772f101889d" pid="8pTizJnrhE2rpwgz6kmJmQ" hash="YbgF0A">Carlyle said: “Make yourself an honest man, and then you may be sure there is one rascal less in the world.” Can there be a truly honest man without him being a good man, or can there be a truly good man without him being an honest man? It seems honesty must begin with oneself; otherwise we could not recognize this quality in others. We see things not as <span class="emphasis">they </span>are, but as <span class="emphasis">we </span>are. It is the responsibility of each of us to be honest ourselves—honest in our dealings and relationships, honest in our church membership, honest in keeping the commandments of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p8" guid="69e373ac-f6bd-41c3-8fb1-3f22cb6ef909" pid="6Gu03Xs70024ufRhiiIqLw" hash="rL_0fA">It was said of King Mosiah’s sons: “… they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/53.21" class="scriptureRef">Alma 53:21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p9" guid="644ccf94-e132-4419-b882-39ca64d5aec2" pid="knenXJ9NFECvNCB7jyU17g" hash="KbfcVw">Honesty and integrity as perfected virtues in parents are more likely to become the heritage and rich endowments of their children. Parents cannot give to their children that which they do not possess. All these fine ideals and principles that are a part of the gospel teachings, together with all the virtues that make for good character and good life, should be perfected in each of us. In that perfection they become a part of our nature, and when parenthood comes, these virtues are more apt to be transmitted to our children. We read in Proverbs: “The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/20.7" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 20:7</a>.) How true and basic this statement is!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p10" guid="c4cb14d8-09ad-4aa0-9cb3-9db1d27b9db0" pid="bsDZ6lb9-USpUMFxzpsaWw" hash="A8UhjA">As parents, are we honest with our children? Do they hear us tell little white lies to excuse ourselves from certain responsibilities? Can we blame them too much if they follow the example of their erring parents? The instruction to parents is found in the Doctrine and Covenants: “And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p11" guid="37321556-f3e4-4a86-bac1-5a9cae876078" pid="mhnQSPpMgUKigrDFuBhqEg" hash="Mumdrw">In order to teach children to walk uprightly, the example must be set by parents. Husbands and wives, are you faithful and true to your mate? Are you living lives of moral soundness and purity? We cannot afford to support iniquity. To do so would be dangerous to our eternal salvation and that of our children. We must walk uprightly before the Lord and be scrupulously honest, and thus be blessed with a high moral and ethical sense that governs all our actions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p12" guid="d2238262-0e13-4308-a30d-d697b7e0a2c9" pid="J9xggh7tVUSKIvNlPRch4w" hash="vfq_Jg">George Eliot has said: “There is only one failure in life possible and that is not to be true to the best one knows.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p13" guid="4bde9b84-c383-4b48-b9c2-871459c8a0f9" pid="-D_FT-gcCUWB0w_otjfkVw" hash="o-xkNg">Throughout our lives we must correct not only the mistakes made against us, but also those in our favor. Now that seems a simple thing, but in the building of character it is very important, for little omissions lead to more serious errors and subtle practices. How often have you gone into a place of business and had given back to you more change than you were entitled to? It quite frequently happens. And it also happens that you are occasionally shortchanged. One never loses an opportunity to call attention when a mistake occurs against him. Honesty, to be true and perfect, must work both ways.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p14" guid="c49d3af4-f3db-4205-93e0-3bb2dfd8a0fe" pid="7zm2vqjtRUGdPj3uZGlV5Q" hash="yb_5fg">If employers, are we honest with our employees? Do the rules apply to all or are there exceptions, and do these exceptions apply to the same few?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p15" guid="922b6e65-bddb-49e9-aac6-8ddbbb9b29bf" pid="qcGILWXVUkiuMo_hO6FlOA" hash="CLwI5Q">If employees, are we giving an honest day’s work? Do we fudge on the lunch hour, or take time to run unnecessary errands under false pretense? In dealing with our fellowmen, do we give more than is expected, or do we try to get by with the minimum amount of service?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p16" guid="205dc1da-d901-4949-902f-b6c6ac3a0760" pid="GgwWjloubk25DkpIDHrnZA" hash="R416Vw">If in business, do we “pad the bill” to get a little extra benefit we are not entitled to, thinking that no one will ever know? While a person may seemingly get away with such tactics, surely he is cognizant of his own dishonesty, as likewise are those whom he has cheated. Cheating is a form of dishonesty. It hurts both the individual and those around him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p17" guid="701a3a86-c91f-4015-b6c6-ce453b11af73" pid="X-K73iAdDE-K-JmXFlP1Fg" hash="DeH1Fw">And you teachers, are you honest in the grades you give? Do you mark according to what the student has earned, or do you let personalities interfere? The juggling of grades or disregarding rules and regulations to produce winning teams are acts of dishonesty and should be avoided. When winning becomes more important than the character and spiritual values these activities are planned to produce, then there is something lacking in leadership. We must not justify ourselves doing what the law or rule does not encompass. Laws and rules cannot make people honest. Evil practices encourage youth to be dishonest. It is the small and seemingly unimportant practices that lead to more serious habits of dishonesty, dishonor, and lack of strong moral integrity. We must inculcate into the heart and character of an individual the virtues that he so much needs to meet honorably the problems of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p18" guid="97b101ed-96f1-49de-9dfe-7ee43434a6b1" pid="gbvJt8enekGB-idESjOhMQ" hash="PN1Qhw">And on behalf of students and youth, do we honestly and sincerely listen to their wants and needs? Do we really try to understand them, or are we giving them what <span class="emphasis">we think </span>they should have?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p19" guid="643c190a-567d-4b59-8591-742d883a8619" pid="uRxojFGIT06lvXxEvZD1JQ" hash="kfF4rw">And those of us who teach in church organizations—are we honest in living as we teach, or do we have a double standard? It was observed recently that a young married woman teacher appeared at church in a very short mini-dress. Can she be honestly teaching the dress standards of the Church while not keeping them herself? Shakespeare said it so well: “This above all: to thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.” (<span class="emphasis">Hamlet, </span>act 1, sc. 3.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p20" guid="2be74eac-3dec-4add-b0c9-edd2cf8421f7" pid="qLvl752aQUmBtmjN4doSdA" hash="rLjVbg">One’s purpose in life must exemplify honesty and sincerity. A person should always abide by his agreements and be willing to pay for his own mistakes. Honesty and integrity build confidence, friendships, and secure the goodwill and support of people that so often pay satisfying dividends. When a person sees the honesty and integrity of another, he will go out of his way to be of help and assistance to such a sincere and reliable individual.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p21" guid="23541d6f-431e-4a82-b1d8-90760e8d03c9" pid="bpQdLUnv0Umy_hRMaT1bVA" hash="wTycuQ">An early lesson in honesty was taught a boy many years ago by his father. When he was just a young lad, he went to the store owned by his father and two business partners and, wanting a pocketknife, proceeded to take one from the display case. Word got to the boy’s father. The father took the lad back to the case and had him replace the knife. Then he pointed out that he had two other partners in the business, and two-thirds of the pocketknife belonged to them. It was not the boy’s privilege, as his son, to take anything from the company because it was not all his. This father was honest and upright in his dealings; he was a man of integrity. When he made a bargain or a deal, he kept it regardless of what the cost to him might be. His reputation was for fairness with people. To him this attribute was more important than money.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p22" guid="3717018d-45b3-420e-9762-1bbaff2d75c0" pid="MivWCWCCFEaJRda5Oz22SQ" hash="iBao0g">One can overlook many sins, but the sin of dishonesty is most difficult to forgive. We are sympathetic to the weaknesses of men and tolerant in our relations with them, but there is nothing that upsets or disturbs confidence more than dealing with a dishonest individual.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p23" guid="e02f4936-7f06-418b-8b2f-8a9e847d0589" pid="D9Upo1aR7kuX1lvtZQTIxw" hash="NUPuXg">George Washington placed emphasis upon honesty when he said: “I hope that I shall always possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what I consider the most enviable of all titles, the character of an honest man.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p24" guid="be78accb-6c77-45b7-968e-466af5592fcc" pid="d_MgpvtKlk2hjQQK1N8V2A" hash="p24yng">How can honesty be mentioned without relating a preliminary event that led to the Savior’s crucifixion? When Jesus was brought before Pilate to be tried by the chief priests and scribes, Pilate found no fault in the Savior, but he was willing to satisfy those who clamored for his life, considering prestige above honesty and integrity, and therefore he yielded to their demands.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p25" guid="c5ffc710-4277-4e08-8764-cee824967a31" pid="77DtzhJ1IESkB4ZbarBPFA" hash="FRxf6Q">My brothers and sisters, we belong to the true church of Christ. Membership in it is a glorious privilege, opportunity, and blessing. We of all people must stand firm in sustaining the revelations the Lord has given for the guidance of his children. Let us be true to the principles, ideals, standards, and covenants in all our doings and relationships. Let us be honest and truthful. Let us be sincere and upright and fully practice what we teach.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p26" guid="ccfa155f-4517-44cd-9f96-987feeece296" pid="gQPtYrbzg02_YLgFkwsSAQ" hash="Rxzvew">Yes, “we believe in being honest.” We also believe in “being true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p27" guid="b7e11d8a-53ca-4f8c-862b-f3e7dfe6f878" pid="y1F_XYkvtkqERBasb1GxqQ" hash="ZWToaw">I have a firm conviction, my brethren and sisters, to the truths of the gospel of Christ. I know they are given for our guidance, benefit, blessing, and the salvation of man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/honesty-and-integrity.p28" guid="09080cf5-43b6-4438-a3aa-af7c8d11add0" pid="fhUsLbh9B0CHQHkppsbBwQ" hash="gL3ptA">I bear witness to you of these things. I know that we must be Christlike in all of our relationships with our fellowmen. If so, we will be exemplary and will be fit servants of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. This I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

These conditions exist today, as is evidenced by the increased numbers of killings, by lawlessness, and by moral transgressions. All standards that were so sacred in the past are crumbling under the pressure of the ungodliness of agnostic, atheistic, subversive, and radical groups. Evil designing people get financial gain from trafficking in drugs, alcohol, prostitution, pornography, and dishonest schemes regardless of the destruction to the moral, ethical, and spiritual values of life.</p>

We have been properly taught, but we are not all living as we are taught. How many of us because of our failure to keep the commandments of God take the devil with us into our lives, into our homes, into the temples of God, into sacrament and other church meetings? We have the scriptures before us and the living oracles of God among us to direct and guide us in all our activities throughout life. The Lord expects us to be different from the people of the world. We should be a special people to him; however, we must prove we are by our conduct and behavior and obedience to his commandments.</p>

Each time we let down in living gospel principles, someone is sure to observe our conduct and form an unfavorable opinion about us and the spiritual values of the Church.

This responsibility rests not only upon the leadership of the Church, but upon the membership of the Church as well. The true gospel of Christ is the hope of the world. It is the only plan that will unite the ethnic and national groups and break down the barriers that divide mankind today. History has proven that man cannot forsake God or his Son, our Savior, and live in peace and security. No individual or people can be in rebellion against God’s commandments and be in harmony with him. Today there is open rebellion in many areas of the world against the established order of decency and obedience to the laws of God and man.</p>

She feels that using marijuana leads to hard drugs and that abortions should be illegal. She added: “I am not a typical coed, but I feel my peers and the majority of young people feel the way I do.” What a choice example to the youth of America are her personal standards of conduct!</p>

As the polluted tributaries of water enter the main stream, our lives too become polluted when we allow tributaries of evil and wickedness to enter. It is these tributaries of evil we must be concerned about and fortify ourselves against. Wickedness never was happiness, but to the contrary, it is depressing; it destroys conscience and ultimately the spiritual life of the constant, erring individual. A child improperly taught and improperly trained by parents is apt to succumb to the temptations of evil and thus contaminate and ruin his life, both now and eternally. We must remember that no unclean thing can enter into the presence of God. One cannot win by following the path of evil. The earlier in life we learn this lesson, the more rewarding and fruitful our lives will be.</p>

They choose to forget that he is the source of all knowledge, he controls all life, and all things are his works of creation.</p>

Such a course can only lead to utter confusion and ultimate destruction. Not knowing the mind, will, and purpose of an infinite God, man does not have, regardless of his advanced knowledge, the wisdom and judgment, nor the correct answers to solve all world problems. With implicit faith we must all turn to the God of our fathers in humility and sincere prayer for counsel and guidance.</p>

Worsening, frustrating world problems, aggravated by a general departure from true Christian teachings and ethical practices, give warning of impending dangers and much sorrow unless man forsakes sin and turns to God in sincere repentance. Only by avoiding the pitfalls of evil and following Isaiah’s counsel can we expect to receive God’s mercy and his abundant pardon.</p>

Unfortunately, for the most part, the thoughts of mortal men are centered in this temporal life and not on the eternal life. The philosophies of men cannot replace nor transcend gospel philosophy as given in the revelations of God, nor can the science of man replace the truths revealed by God through his prophets.</p>

We should repent of our evil doings and confess them in order to give our lives spiritual direction. We are counseled to have faith in our Eternal Father and in his Son, our Redeemer. We should seek the desire, through righteous living, to once again dwell with them in the heavenly mansions they have prepared for the faithful. The following scripture sustains this thought:</p>

Hear the words of encouragement as given to the prophet Ezekiel: “Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord God: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ezek/18.23" class="scriptureRef">Ezek. 18:23</a>.)</p>

The apostle Paul so encouraged the Corinthian saints: “Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 1:10</a>.)</p>

The apostle Paul instructed the Corinthians: “Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/9.14" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 9:14</a>.) This counsel can be applied to every member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—that by living the gospel and setting a good example we are automatically preaching its tenets and showing the right way for others to follow. The greatest gift we can give another is the gift of a good example.</p>

Our eternal happiness and joy depends upon the kind of life we chart and live here in mortality. The apostle Paul taught: “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.21" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 10:21</a>.) In other words, we cannot serve two masters, for either we will hate the one and love the other, or else we will hold to the one and despise the other. We cannot serve both God and mammon. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.24" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:24</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.1" class="scriptureRef">John 10:1</a>.) Christ gave this parable to his disciples:</p>

Its attainment is worth every effort and sacrifice we make. To be saved in the kingdom of God is the greatest of all the gifts of God, for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation, and he that hath eternal life, proclaims the Lord, is rich.

Then compare your life after a year’s trial of faithful gospel living with your previous manner of living, and ask yourself conscientiously which way is best. Give the gospel a chance in your life by living it, to prove its worth and value to you and to your family.</p>

If you have its spiritual influence, it will bring conviction into your hearts. It will build testimony and create in you a desire to love the Lord. You will manifest that love by keeping his laws and commandments and serving him. The Holy Spirit will testify to the truth of these teachings and you will know, as the apostle Paul knew, that the gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation.

It takes courage to accept the challenge to seek the Lord while he may be found and call upon him while he is near; but I promise you, if you do so, it will pay off in dividends of peace of mind, joy of heart, comfort of soul, satisfaction of personal needs, and a love that never fails.</p>

I know that Jesus is the Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, the very Son of God. He sacrificed his own life upon the cross that we might live eternally. He broke the bonds of death through his resurrection, which guarantees the resurrection of all mankind. He bought us with the price of his own blood. We can show our gratitude by living righteously and setting a proper example to all people everywhere.</p>

He gave encouragement and counsel for all of us to walk uprightly before the Lord and to keep his laws and commandments. It is the only way we can find our way to the eternal life that God has held out to the faithful of his people. In fact, our God gave this promise: “… if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-path-to-eternal-life.p2" guid="32e647b2-2e1b-45d2-b08b-d23a4fe8e8a8" pid="IejymrXu802zUyFKCNfSZA" hash="YoqbBw">“Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:7</a>.) Very few people give enough thought to eternal life. Yet it is something each of us should keep uppermost in our minds and hearts. As children of God, we cannot afford to forget our origin and destiny if we desire the realms of celestial glory.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-path-to-eternal-life.p3" guid="52a61ee6-55cd-41a0-bbe9-6dc54bdd9390" pid="XRxZgL_RMUeEvpikfLohLA" hash="AST_Aw">Through revelation, God has given the gospel plan of salvation and exaltation for men to live by. Eternal life is God’s life, which he hopes to share with all his children. But we are free to act for ourselves, “… to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>.)</p>

Our Savior set the example when he went into the water with John the Baptist, who was authorized of God to baptize Jesus by immersion. This sets the mode of baptism for all men to follow.</p>

If we believe in Christ and his mission, we cannot bypass him and obtain eternal life. The Savior gave his life as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of the world, thus opening the door for man who, through faithfulness, may gain eternal life and exaltation.</p>

One is the force of evil which takes away man’s agency, destroys freedoms, and makes the nonvaliant a follower of Satan; which can only lead to unhappiness in life and eternal misery. The second is the force of God. This is the power to do good; to live righteously, to enjoy freedom of choice, and to be courageous, faithful followers of Christ through whom only is salvation and exaltation assured.</p>

Our duty is to constantly do the works of righteousness. The Lord has said that light and truth, which is the word of God, forsake the evil one. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:37</a>.) Without light and truth in our lives, we are subject to the powers of Satan.</p>

Life is a real challenge, but blessed with God-given powers, we can overcome every stratagem and obstacle Satan may place in our path. The path to eternal life may not be an easy one to follow with all the worldly enticements about us, but when we consider the rewards and blessings we gather if we travel the narrow way, it is worth every sacrifice we make.</p>

The same condition prevailed during the dark ages, requiring a new gospel dispensation—the restoration of Christ’s church to earth.

He is a great individual and one whom we can admire, respect, and look up to for teaching, counsel, and guidance. May God bless us to be faithful and true to all the covenants and obligations we have entered into with him, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

This occurred in the great council in heaven before the peopling of this earth. The children of God were endowed with freedom of choice while yet but spirit beings. The divine plan provided that they be freeborn in the flesh and become heirs to the inalienable birthright of liberty to choose and act for themselves in mortality. It was essential for their eternal progression that they be subjected to the influences of both good and evil.</p>

It is a gift from him given with the hope that we will apply it wisely in the conduct of our personal lives. Freedom of choice is a moral agency which we should keep uppermost in our minds in all our activities and decisions. “By virtue of this agency you and I and all mankind are made responsible beings, responsible for the course we pursue, the lives we live, the deeds we do in the body.” (Wilford Woodruff, <span class="emphasis">Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</span> Bookcraft, Inc., 1969, pp. 8–9.)</p>

Man is free to choose the good or the evil in life, and to obey or disobey the Lord’s commands as he may elect. He can choose to act without compulsion or restraint.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/using-our-free-agency.p12" pid="stSAFJmew0qms7DraFleVw" hash="0wCuMQ">Free agency doesn’t suggest we do wrong or infringe upon the rights and privileges of others. We often hear a person who transgresses console himself by saying, “I am only hurting myself.” If a man chooses to commit adultery, he must pay a penalty for his sin. Because of his transgression, he is infringing upon the rights of his wife and family, overlooking those who love him and look to him for guidance, good example, and eternal blessings of family unity and togetherness. He hurts others in the process of doing what he calls “exercising my free agency.”</p>

They use it as a negative force in their lives rather than as a positive one. Perhaps you have heard this statement: “I can smoke and drink if I want to. I have my free agency.” But why not think in terms of eternal values and say, “I can smoke and drink if I want to. I have my free agency, but I choose to use my agency in bettering my life—in choosing the right and not the wrong.” This can apply to any vice in one’s life. Have the right attitude and a vice can turn to a virtue, and virtue has its own reward. To use our agency for good, we must set aside the defensive, arrogant, and haughty attitude of a transgressor.</p>

Brigham Young answered this question by saying: “There are limits to agency, and to all things and to all beings, and our agency must not infringe upon that law. A man must choose life or death. … the agency which is given to him is so bound up that he cannot exercise it in opposition to the law, without laying himself liable to be corrected and punished by the Almighty.</p>

The late James E. Talmage said: “Obedience to law is the habit of free men. The transgressor fears the law, for he brings upon himself deprivation and restraint, not because of the law which would have protected him in his freedom, but because of his antagonism to the law. It is no more a part of God’s plan to compel men to work righteousness than it is his purpose to permit evil powers to force his children into sin.” (<span class="emphasis">The Great Apostasy,</span> Deseret Book Co., 1958, pp. 34–35.)</p>

He has given us our agency to combat the trials, temptations, and evils of every kind. However, he gives certain principles that, if followed, will lead us back to his presence. God’s kingdom is founded upon perfect liberty. Every man, woman, and child has the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. Each person alone is responsible to his creator for his individual acts.</p>

The early prophets revealed the events which would precede his birth and described his earthly mission, thus enabling the people of the world to recognize him as their Savior, Lord, and God. Although the house of Israel possessed a written record of numerous prophecies concerning Christ’s earthly life, still the Eternal Father sent a special messenger, John the Baptist, “to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/1.17" class="scriptureRef">Luke 1:17</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p1" pid="VEq21-fB2Uyv9ye8BXuxRQ" hash="3QYg4A">As we approach the Easter season, the hearts and emotions of Christians are mellowed by the sacrifice of the life and the resurrection of the Lord, Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p2" pid="Z1pBcWnxx0-5wjPobDdU8w" hash="tjV9cA">Shortly before Christ’s betrayal, he lifted up his eyes to heaven in a pleading intercessory prayer for his disciples, whom the Father gave unto him. He uttered this profound statement: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.3" class="scriptureRef">John 17:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p3" pid="QrpjnY7QvkCk5Cx1PkJWpQ" hash="ONSn7g">To know God the Father and his Beloved Son Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, is life eternal. Do men truly know them—their attributes, characteristics, and powers? Surely such knowledge can be had: otherwise, our Savior would not have made this statement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p4" pid="JL0vu-1BZku-Ycxzx5yKdg" hash="pZI-Qw">When Philip said unto Christ, “Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us,” Jesus answered, “Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.8-9" class="scriptureRef">John 14:8–9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p5" pid="SM7elxTFd0eVRV1sYsEqQw" hash="FRK9ug">Paul declared to the Corinthian saints that Christ is “the image of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/4.4" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 4:4</a>), and to the Hebrews that Christ is “the express image of [God’s] person.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/1.3" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 1:3</a>.) It is logical for the Only Begotten Son of the Eternal God to be in “the express image of his [Father’s] person.” Like produces like, and any earthly son we know—and the earthly is typical of the heavenly—is in the image of his father. It is true in mortal life that some sons are in the express image of their father’s person.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p6" pid="dslG2UUKG0aNSiFtEOMQuA" hash="JyGE-w">In modern revelation we learn that Seth, the son of Adam, “was a perfect man, and his likeness was the express likeness of his father, insomuch that he seemed to be like unto his father in all things, and could be distinguished from him only by his age.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.43" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:43</a>.) Could that be what Christ meant when he said to Philip, “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father”? (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.9" class="scriptureRef">John 14:9</a>.) This statement also accords with modern-day revelation that God “the Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:22</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p7" pid="nf_yWdu9jEqhayzbeqkl-w" hash="0BTt3Q">Now Jesus said, “The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.19" class="scriptureRef">John 5:19</a>.) Also: “As my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.28" class="scriptureRef">John 8:28</a>.) Here Christ informs us that he was following the example and teachings of his Father and the works which the Father had performed previously in his own experience, which proves both Father and Son possess like individual characteristics, attributes, and powers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p8" pid="3QjTsFAfpk-acsrY8Tj4Uw" hash="uqayFw">When Thomas asked the Lord, “How can we know the way?” Jesus answered, “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.5-6" class="scriptureRef">John 14:5–6</a>.) “For there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved,” declared the apostle Peter to the rulers, elders, and scribes of the Jewish factions. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/4.12" class="scriptureRef">Acts 4:12</a>.) As Jesus walked in Solomon’s porch, the Jews came to him and solemnly asked, “If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.” Jesus answered them, saying, “The works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.23-25" class="scriptureRef">John 10:23–25</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p9" pid="9C2EBHfHE0qOSThoRvf88Q" hash="hVSX6g">Truly the works, miracles, and teachings of the Christ, together with heavenly appearances and confirmations of angelic personages—also the declarations of God the Father in the presence of accredited witnesses—testify fully and conclusively that Christ is the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh, our Redeemer, Savior, and Lord.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p10" pid="QG4P5R2FhEOl0lVCqPb3Fw" hash="LjKdBw">After Christ’s ministry on earth, his death on the cross, and glorious resurrection from the dead, he appeared unto his disciples and opened their understanding to the scriptures concerning him: how that all the scriptures written concerning the happenings of his life, death, and resurrection had been fulfilled. Then he said unto them, “And ye are witnesses of these things.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.48" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:48</a>.) The apostle Peter taught Cornelius and his household all about the Christ, his message, death, and resurrection, declaring God showed the resurrected Lord openly: “Not,” he said, “to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. … To him,” said Peter, “give all the prophets witness.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.38-43" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:38–43</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p11" pid="U0SW3sp5qE6jJlwmFlw5BQ" hash="uQVFOw">The prophets before Christ did testify of his coming and prophesied sufficiently concerning his life, ministry, works, and miracles to identify him with absolute certainty. They also foretold his death on the cross and resurrection to glory as a sealing act to his ministry and divine commission to atone for the sins of men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p12" pid="DafZe0LEN0qR9hXoPbyJtA" hash="y3YLvQ">John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, was given a sign by which he could recognize the Son of God. When he saw Jesus coming toward him, he said to his disciples, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.29" class="scriptureRef">John 1:29</a>.) God the Father also spoke from heaven testifying of his Son to all the people assembled at the baptism of the Christ by announcing, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 3:17</a>.) In answer to the query of the Lord to Peter, “Whom say ye that I am?” Peter emphatically declared, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.15-16" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:15–16</a>.) Even unclean and evil spirits who knew Christ in the spirit world recognized him in the flesh and confessed him with positive knowledge, calling him, “Jesus, thou Son of God most high.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/8.28" class="scriptureRef">Luke 8:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p13" pid="0HVNyG7rXk2RmPSmAHmetw" hash="ll6raw">The works and the miracles of Christ, the evidences and testimonies of faithful, true, and actual witnesses of all they had seen and heard, even to the voice of God speaking from the heavens, are convincing proof that Jesus was not merely a well-principled man and a great teacher, but the actual Son of God, the Redeemer and Savior of the world, the exemplar to all mankind, whom to know and love and follow is life eternal.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p14" pid="MXkescAEC02NyZ2Ey9VtMQ" hash="fmC9gA">Now, the other evidences and testimonies of true witnesses who saw the risen, resurrected Lord prove that he is alive today; just as the angel Gabriel declared to Mary, the mother of Jesus, “of his kingdom there shall be no end.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/1.33" class="scriptureRef">Luke 1:33</a>.) There were many appearances of the risen Lord to his disciples after his passion. I shall mention a few very briefly: First, to Mary Magdalene. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.16-18" class="scriptureRef">John 20:16–18</a>.) Second, to the two disciples on their way to Emmaus. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.13-35" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:13–35</a>.) Third, to his disciples who were gathered together following his resurrection. He invited them to “behold my hands and my feet, … handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.36-40" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:36–40</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p15" pid="GUVzd6sBy0SO5OMzLdnvhA" hash="38Vqlg">Fourth, Luke tells us that Christ, after his passion, “shewed himself alive … by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/1.3" class="scriptureRef">Acts 1:3</a>.) Fifth, Paul the apostle testifies that after Christ’s resurrection “he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve, [then] of above five hundred brethren at once; …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p16" pid="aCKo0HsmfkiAt6k30teP9A" hash="N9Z79A">“After that, … of James, then of all the apostles,” and last of all by Paul himself. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.5-8" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:5–8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p17" pid="YwRMwK4VhkGgPBk9rIiroQ" hash="qznwUQ">Sixth, the concluding New Testament account of witnesses for our consideration is highly significant, for it furnishes hope and faith to all God’s children for the future. It deals with an important event subsequent to Christ’s resurrection and following the forty days spent with his disciples, teaching and instructing them in the things of his kingdom. “And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p18" pid="TqA8tCakekWyN5DLyox0Mg" hash="FldkLw">“And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p19" pid="3Wt0-8DpekKJhx8o5nfGSA" hash="i0zzLQ">“Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/1.9-11" class="scriptureRef">Acts 1:9–11</a>.) Christ was received into heaven with his resurrected body. If he is to return in like manner at his second coming, as this scripture affirms, he will come with his same body. This is further verified by prophecy to a branch of the house of Israel who shall ask the Lord at his second coming, “What are these wounds in thine hands and in thy feet?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p20" pid="oZtOju5NhUGzlyWwiz7urA" hash="snRhaQ">“Then shall they know that I am the Lord; for I will say unto them: These wounds are the wounds with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. I am he who was lifted up. I am Jesus that was crucified. I am the Son of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.51-52" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:51–52</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/ot/zech/13.6" class="scriptureRef">Zech. 13:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p21" pid="3Xm9AmNnD067tiSN_NXEGQ" hash="c6mG-A">In the Book of Mormon, one of four standard works of scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is recorded a beautiful account of Christ’s visit to the people on this continent after his resurrection from the grave. At that appearance, God the Father spoke from heaven, declaring, “Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.7" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p22" pid="ArVuzgTOBEeAuM35MWzxsQ" hash="RsjAFQ">On that occasion Jesus Christ also announced himself, saying, “Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.10" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:10</a>.) At the invitation of their Lord, a large number were privileged to come forward, in order, according to the historical account, “that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.14" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:14</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p23" pid="UbQRICacDU-3ClIoRmGPdg" hash="einIIQ">“And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p24" pid="wl7an0DDi0Kfs2RQSriqoQ" hash="wpJQ-A">“Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.16-17" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:16–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/easter-thoughts.p25" pid="nL8LMjP-I0KWHBTRpqB-Xw" hash="tnH3kw">By this friendly and compelling demonstration, Jesus assured the people assembled that he was truly their risen Lord, as several of their prophets had foretold. All these evidences and testimonies of witnesses are persuasive and convincing to the seeker of truth, light, and knowledge concerning God and his Beloved Son. Mankind need not struggle in the dark to gain faith in the only true God and Jesus Christ, nor in the gospel plan of life and salvation. The Comforter, or the Holy Ghost, which Christ promised to send, is the Spirit of truth and is to guide his followers into all truth. The Holy Ghost is to testify of the Father and the Son and is a teacher, also a revelator. Witness Peter’s statement that “holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 1:21</a>), and Paul’s declaration, “No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.3" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 12:3</a>). John, the beloved apostle, taught, “It is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/5.6" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 5:6</a>.)</p>

A prophet-writer of Book of Mormon history and doctrine gave this wise and understanding counsel and admonition: “I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>

Paul was born as Saul of Tarsus, being both a Jew and a Roman citizen. He became a powerful persecutor of those who accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and King. Saul was not motivated by malice, but by the belief that he was working against an enemy of his Jewish faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/teachings-of-the-apostle-paul.p2" pid="DB-5yQnAjk29BaOZgeJ4jA" hash="BwgTLw">As he was en route to Damascus to pursue his persecutions, a bright heavenly light suddenly enveloped him and he fell helplessly to the ground. A voice asked, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” In response, Saul asked two questions: “Who art thou, Lord?” and “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/9.4-6" class="scriptureRef">Acts 9:4–6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/teachings-of-the-apostle-paul.p3" pid="UE9u8FcZAkG9vXKQhalLng" hash="f5dfeg">The Christ identified Himself as “Jesus whom thou persecutest.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/9.5" class="scriptureRef">Acts 9:5</a>) Then He told Saul to go to the city of Damascus where he would be instructed. Having been struck blind, Saul was assisted into the city by his companions. There, Ananias, a disciple and servant of the Lord, restored Saul’s sight and informed him that God had chosen him to know His will and hear His voice; that he was to be a witness unto all men of the resurrected Christ. He was baptized by Ananias and from that time on dedicated himself to the upbuilding of the Lord’s kingdom. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/9.4-19" class="scriptureRef">Acts 9:4–19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/teachings-of-the-apostle-paul.p4" pid="JrNDF04Xr0KeQxGEDaISNw" hash="-zX-bw">When he was ordained, Saul became a great defender of the faith, a dynamic teacher of righteousness, and a fearless preacher to the world. He went first to the Jews in their synagogues, then subsequently made three missionary journeys, carrying the message of the resurrected Christ to many peoples. While on a mission to the gentiles, he became known as Paul. His love for and interest in his converts found him returning to oversee their progress and writing them letters of exhortation.</p>

To teach the message of faith, repentance, and baptism, to bear witness to the divine mission of the Savior, to outline man’s relationship to Jesus and to God our Father, to strengthen testimonies, to define doctrine, and to reinforce the teachings of the Christian church. He also instructed the people in their everyday living, and gave warning to the world.</p>

Do all Christian churches teach the true gospel and its principles and also have the authority to administer the saving ordinances which will guide and exalt their members in God’s heavenly kingdom?</p>

My intent is to assert with testimony and persuasion of scripture the reasons there can be only one Lord, one acceptable faith, one baptism, and one true church. Then if any of you are convinced you are mistaken in your present beliefs, you should have the courage to investigate and the faith to change and follow the true path Christ has outlined that assures one’s eternal happiness.</p>

Jesus prayed in His intercessory prayer to His Father concerning those who complied with His doctrines and ordinances: “And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, <span class="emphasis">even as we are one.</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.22" class="scriptureRef">John 17:22</a>; italics added.)</p>

There were then, as there are today, many versions of truth represented by different religious denominations. The Savior didn’t choose any of the churches established by man, either when He ministered on earth or in these latter days. He organized His own church with prophets and apostles, with a gospel plan of salvation and exaltation. It was the church of Jesus Christ.</p>

When many religious leaders became offended by His teachings, Jesus then proclaimed most of His doctrines by using parables. These made clear to the spiritually attuned person that there was to be only “one fold, and one shepherd.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.16" class="scriptureRef">John 10:16</a>.)</p>

Jesus knew His hearers were acquainted with the prophecy that a shepherd had been promised the children of Israel. David, the shepherd boy who became king, wrote the beautiful Twenty-third Psalm that begins: “The Lord is my shepherd.” Isaiah prophesied that when God would come down, “He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/40.11" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 40:11</a>.) There was no mistaking what Jesus meant. He was their Lord—the promised Messiah!</p>

A stronger indictment could not be imagined! Then to make His point so clear that no one could misunderstand, He stated: “There shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/10.16" class="scriptureRef">John 10:16</a>.)</p>

These apostles were not self-appointed servants, for Jesus said to them: “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.16" class="scriptureRef">John 15:16</a>.)</p>

Jesus had conferred the priesthood authority on them. As long as they remained on the earth, functioning under the authority Jesus gave them, unity of doctrine and uniformity of the ordinances prevailed. The gospel message, which they were commanded to take to all the world, was the same to everyone everywhere. People were not taught different gospels and then given a choice. There was only one plan for all.</p>

On another occasion he wrote: “But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/1.8" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 1:8</a>.)</p>

Thus God’s revelation to leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ was reasonable, consistent, and unified.</p>

The pure doctrines Christ taught became diluted with the philosophy of the world, and profane innovations appeared in the ordinances of the church. Eventually, that which had once been clear and understandable became mythical and confusing. Confusion is the field where Satan operates to deceive and lead mankind astray. Jesus and His apostles predicted a “falling away” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.1-4" class="scriptureRef">2 Thes. 2:1–4</a>), which did occur, and Christianity entered a long night of darkness.</p>

Such a claim, of course, defies reason and contradicts the teachings and pattern established by Jesus Christ. A sincere seeker for truth must ask: “Which, if any, of the varying Christian groups is right?” For guidance, the apostle James gave this counsel: “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a>.) If you sincerely put this promise to the test in seeking light and truth, you will be rewarded.</p>

He exhorted: “And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>

Some of these gifts are: revelation, healing, miracles, prophecy, and many others—as found in First Corinthians, twelfth chapter; Doctrine and Covenants, forty-sixth section; and in the tenth chapter of Moroni in the Book of Mormon. Charity—the pure love of Christ—will be in evidence among its membership.</p>
