      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p1" pid="fZioYoYjuUuxymPZWyauHw" hash="-Atk9w">Many years ago while my children were very young, the nighttime bottles and the daytime diapers seemed as endless as the frozen ground outside our military apartment. When I feel sorry for myself, it helps me to do something for someone else. That winter my need was great, so I needed a grand solution. I decided to make a sport coat for my husband. Having no experience in tailoring, I began by finding the best pattern and materials on the market. With great enthusiasm I took out the pattern guide. My heart nearly failed me. There were pages of instructions—138 steps, as I remember. It was beyond my ability. The next few days I took that pattern everywhere I went. I decided to work on no more than two steps per day so I wouldn’t get discouraged. When two steps were completed, I would read the directions for the next day’s task. Occasionally I got overanxious and had to unpick, but fortunately mistakes in good materials don’t remain if they are carefully removed. A few months later, I had created a masterpiece. The pattern had made the miracle possible. Patterns had become very important to me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p2" pid="6YeYBTIsJkWBjzVFfM4STQ" hash="oipChA">As my awareness of patterns has continued, I have become very appreciative of the Lord’s patterns. Patterns for his handiwork are detailed in the scriptures. They describe the building of a tabernacle, an ark, an altar, and temples. The materials are important; the purpose is grand. Then comes that most important pattern of righteousness set by Jesus Christ, “a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/1.16" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 1:16</a>.) In every imaginable setting from ancient times to modern days, we see this pattern repeated—faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p3" pid="K0xGXkfkxkupsgol8_2Isg" hash="cxIywg">Patterns are meant to be repeated. A pattern of righteousness is worthy of duplication, yet there are those who suppose that our righteousness involves climbing some imaginary vertical ladder. We then think we hasten our progress by trying to get above or ahead of others. I believe this is pride. In Alma we are told, “The preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man according to his strength.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 1:26</a>.) Righteousness is reproduced horizontally, not vertically. When we establish a pattern of righteousness in our lives, we commit to our Heavenly Father to do all in our power to help others reproduce this pattern in their lives. This can happen over and over until, as it says in Isaiah, “the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/26.9" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 26:9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p4" pid="Gq--SebqqUG2wQpSV2FBDw" hash="VdRPJQ">Heavenly Father tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants, “I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/52.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 52:14</a>.) To avoid deception, we should watch for patterns of righteousness in our lives. I would like to mention three—prayer, scripture study, and service to others.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p5" pid="zDYlA2lEY0axWB66PwjFOQ" hash="LSUNKg">When we have learned the importance of prayer, the habit of daily prayer can be reproduced in the lives of others by teaching and good example. My youngest daughter said that prayer became more meaningful to her as she watched her older sister kneel by the bed at night when she thought others were asleep. As a student at BYU, I remember kneeling in prayer with eight roommates each morning at 6:30 and then having breakfast together. Years later, if we missed having prayer with our children, I was sure my old roommates would be concerned. What a great pattern they set for me. Is that happening in homes and apartments today?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p6" pid="xXtkQYOr6k-Jx-AS6k139g" hash="aNscYQ">A few months ago, I was kneeling in prayer with a young family in Albuquerque. I had a wonderful warm feeling as I opened my eyes and looked around that circle. It was as if I imagined families in homes throughout the world having that same experience. Hopefully, if the pattern of prayer is established in our homes, individual family members will help reproduce that pattern for others as my roommates did for me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p7" pid="gTtjIUmbkkeKw6DPX-32CQ" hash="TgN6kA">Scripture study helps us increase our understanding of the pattern of righteousness. As we live the words of God, we are told, “He will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 98:12</a>.) I am encouraged by the examples of scripture reading I see. I have a daughter who likes to warm her feet before going to bed. I love to see her sitting on the bathroom counter with her feet in a sink of warm water as she reads her scriptures. My two grandsons, ages two and four, report with satisfaction the stickers they receive on their progress charts as they say their prayers and hear scripture stories each day. These fundamental patterns will always need to be taught to our children if righteousness is to continue.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p8" pid="TBJ7QKvtRk6yIT5RBZydFw" hash="JpqaAQ">Giving loving service is another beautiful pattern of righteousness often learned in our homes. The scriptures teach of the importance of service, and leaders testify of its importance. Harold Glen Clark, the first president of the Provo Temple, wrote a story for his grandchildren called, “Good for One Pass into Heaven.” Brother Clark wrote:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p9" pid="CFkmtWWCw0yb84gMMmR0kA" hash="7CsuPw">“I was thinking of what one thing I had ever done that might have pleased the Lord most. Deacons quorum president? Bishop? Patriarch? Temple president?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p10" pid="gfoB-FIUa0GLNXH880KgNQ" hash="rB-AuQ">“Then it came to me what it might be. It was when I was 16 or 17 years old. My mother, who often took in the unfortunate, had the care of two grandpas at one time. Someone said to her in jest, ‘Why don’t you put up a sign, “Grandpas wanted”?’ But it wasn’t funny because I was assigned to take care of one grandpa, who had to be bathed, dressed and undressed, and helped to the table to eat. Now I was a fun-loving 16-year-old, and here I was too many times, nursing Grandpa while a good game of basketball was going on outside.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p11" pid="Q8QOsBW3p0qLZK15ncSmRg" hash="ITenCA">“Once when my pals were calling me, I was inside doing the tedious chore of taking off his wet pajamas. I was impatient and upset. Then I felt Grandpa’s trembling hand on mine. I turned and met his tearful countenance and heard him say, ‘God bless you, my boy. You will never regret doing this for me.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p12" pid="bJUvm8RW9EmQu_hJpX-QwA" hash="FlG6Bg">“I was so sorry I had been resentful. … To this day, I have a warm glow about this little service I performed for a quite helpless grandpa.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p13" pid="b7bQmP-PgE6-529TvwdgLQ" hash="1cnfwA">“I suppose doing something for someone else which they cannot do for themselves brings you close to God, because that’s what He and His Son are doing all the time, out of pure love for us.” (Unpublished manuscript.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p14" pid="zrgkMtIyeUiIpAmwHPTIQA" hash="TRAKRg">Our young people need role models as they establish a pattern of righteousness in their lives. As I thought about my commitment to the youth of the Church, words of Elder Boyd K. Packer had added meaning. Elder Packer has spoken of the warnings of Alma and Helaman as they told of the Church in their day. Quoting Elder Packer: “They warned about fast growth, the desire to be accepted by the world, to be popular, and particularly they warned about prosperity. Each time those conditions existed in combination, the Church drifted off course.” (Address delivered at regional representatives’ seminar, 30 Mar. 1990.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p15" pid="xi68FOPhHk63vjGf1DdEhQ" hash="RTQnvA">Again I was thinking about the youth of the Church. Consider the transition of a young person beginning at the age of twelve and lasting until the eighteenth year. The conditions spoken of in the Book of Mormon are almost always present in the lives of young people—a period of fast growth, a desire to be liked by others, to be popular, and often, prosperity. A pattern of personal righteousness which includes prayer, scripture study, and service is the answer to avoiding the dangers spoken of in the Book of Mormon. Nephi knew this when he asked the Lord, “O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness!” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.33" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:33</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p16" pid="kqtFUba0QEa_YNQX-NLL-g" hash="QhHw3g">When I looked for a definition of <span class="emphasis">pattern,</span> I found it had a Latin origin derived from <span class="emphasis">pater</span> or <span class="emphasis">father,</span> one who served as a model or pattern to be emulated. Our Savior Jesus Christ set the pattern and asked us to follow him. Nephi asks, “Can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.10" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/a-pattern-of-righteousness.p17" pid="Jo5CykM9VEGgYQEZ7Xrj9A" hash="fQ-K7g">I am grateful to men and women and people of all ages whose lives help us see this pattern of righteousness. I am thankful for a living prophet. A few days after being called as a counselor in the Young Women General Presidency, the First Presidency of the Church approached my chair to set me apart and give me a blessing. I realized the prophet of God was about to lay his hands upon my head, and I was in awe. Following the blessing, as I turned to face the prophet, I was quite unprepared for the magnificence of the spirit I felt. I bear testimony that Ezra Taft Benson is a prophet of God and that Jesus Christ is our Savior. He has given us a pattern of righteousness that, when followed, will lead us back to our Heavenly Father. I bear this witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/you-are-not-alone.p1" pid="R1rcN0Dzw0SFOtV-yTo8ZQ" hash="qooV6w">How I love Ardeth Kapp and Jayne Malan and the recently released board members. And what a wonderful feeling came over me when President Monson called to tell me that my counselors had been called. He said, “You shouldn’t be alone.” And then he quickly added, “You are not alone.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/you-are-not-alone.p2" pid="NWbrVHjeX0GjrGvwK8uEJw" hash="QIUh7A">I have a testimony of those words and what comfort they give. Four years ago, when I found myself quite suddenly a widow and the youngest of my five children leaving for a mission, I felt alone. I did a lot of walking at that time, and one day I told a neighbor I found myself thinking about youth. She said, “Really? I wonder why?” I concluded that perhaps I was trying to remember who I was before I was married. I said, “If I ever have a chance to work with young people again, I will be so much more patient, so much more gentle, and so much more loving.” And I have since added, “I will do all in my power to encourage young people to prepare for the future.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/you-are-not-alone.p3" pid="hn7cNn3czUq1VdlCA74LWg" hash="qjGZ-A">There are times when we are growing up when we feel alone or left out. Times of change are growing-up times: things like moving, changing schools, going on a mission, having a baby, having your baby go on a mission, a serious illness, losing someone you love. I believe that there are some things that help in these growing-up times so we don’t feel so alone. Spend more time talking to Heavenly Father and reading the scriptures. Listen to the still, small voice. In the words of a young woman of Beehive age: “At first when I would say my prayers and read scriptures, I would never get a good feeling about it. But after about two months of my scriptures and prayer, I began to feel very happy, and I loved my family, and I felt like being nice to everyone.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/you-are-not-alone.p4" pid="kXDSX2_3b06VJOAwGnBCyg" hash="7wtqig">When the prophet Enos listened to the words of the Lord, he began to feel a desire for the welfare of others. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.9" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:9</a>.) When we start to think of others, we feel less alone.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/you-are-not-alone.p5" pid="IwcAa1mwhUKqP1Yt1lUY5w" hash="TF4Qzw">Another thing that helps is to build a support system. As a president needs counselors, we all need caring and interested family and friends. A father said to his daughter: “Somebody does care about you. It may not always be the people you want to have caring about you, but there is always someone who is there and who cares. In fact, you probably already know who they are because they are the ones you have always been able to count on. That won’t change.” (Joseph Walker, “ValueSpeak,” <span class="emphasis">Chicago Tribune, </span>3 June 1991.) We need people who care. “Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/you-are-not-alone.p6" pid="fKks_T_SrEqQ_7_4RD1zoQ" hash="fDRk0A">Growing up does not take place without a work effort. Not long ago, my youngest daughter came home and said her bishop had asked her to be a Sunday School teacher. She said, “I just don’t feel like a Sunday School teacher.” I said, “You aren’t yet, Mary, but you will be.” Growing up involves developing our potential. Heavenly Father is counting on each one of us. Confidence will grow quietly from within as we work and gain experience.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/you-are-not-alone.p7" pid="s-immcLidUWt6YAnkRZOHQ" hash="Nj10Bw">Sometimes we make the mistake of feeling we are alone just because we are not getting recognition. Only a small part of what we do takes place in a public setting. The rest takes place in small and often unseen deeds. When you add the small deeds together, however, they are a thousand times greater than those receiving public recognition. Albert Schweitzer said that when you compare the public deeds to the small, private ones they are “like the foam on the waves of a deep ocean.” (Albert Schweitzer, <span class="emphasis">Out of My Life and Thought, </span>New York: H. Holt, 1949, p. 90.) This is a good thing to remember when growing up.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/you-are-not-alone.p8" pid="CVgTvLIWNEy-jWHXCdw8aw" hash="GHQ7rg">To every young woman of the Church, in your growing up years you are not alone. I want you to know how much I love you. Do you have any idea how much you are thought about, talked about, prayed about, and loved by your parents and leaders? Learn to work and develop your abilities. Consider the needs of others and give loving service. Support one another as you stand for truth and righteousness. Our Heavenly Father loves you. He understands your challenges. He knows you were prepared before you were born for this time. I have complete faith in the words of our prophet, who said, “You have been born at this time for a sacred and glorious purpose.” (Ezra Taft Benson, “To the Young Women of the Church,” General Women’s Meeting, 28 Sept. 1986.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/you-are-not-alone.p9" pid="0HuQhabiIUe3cJykVFsLTw" hash="oICGXw">Now, to every adult member of the Church, may I suggest that you learn the names of the young people in your ward or branch and call them by name. Encourage them in their work efforts. Recognize them for the good things they do. They need our support, and we need theirs. Probably the hardest thing about growing up is that you have to keep doing it. But we are not alone. I bear testimony and express gratitude for this knowledge, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

As my daughter and her husband met me at the door with their little three-day-old infant, there was an obvious radiance in that apartment. As they placed Hannah, who will be named after my mother, in my arms, she looked like a curled-up little doll with lots of dark hair. Within a few days, Hannah was stretching out her long legs and her long, thin feet, and I started to think of all of the things she will experience as she starts growing up. Perhaps she’ll have some of the same fears that I had—like being afraid to be alone in the dark at age six or seven. At age thirteen or fourteen, she may be sure, as I was, that there will never be boys as tall as she is. That concern was increased for me the following year when I became convinced that a person with feet as large as mine would surely never marry.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/growing-up-spiritually.p2" pid="7CnxUdwPxkq_hFTZK8niJA" hash="Z9U94w">Those kinds of concerns are pretty normal, and the things that concern any of you would surely be concerns to me. But my greatest concern is that each one of you is growing in your spiritual understanding.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/growing-up-spiritually.p3" pid="ehYuujf0wkiMqL6QAZV6IQ" hash="LFqmKg">I have tremendous reverence for each one of you. My hope for you during these important years between the ages of twelve and eighteen is that you are going from being a dependent child to becoming a righteous, problem-solving woman of faith. It is a mighty work you do during these years, and when you do your work well, you will build a foundation for a responsible and righteous life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/growing-up-spiritually.p4" pid="g9IxASgLlkKV4OXCHaS4xQ" hash="JlPFdg">When your leaders encourage you in the Young Women program to get involved with Personal Progress, I hope you will understand that this represents much more than goal-setting and receiving recognition, although that is very important. The greatest goal is that you would constantly choose experiences that would exercise or strengthen your faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/growing-up-spiritually.p5" pid="-IvMhaWLvEe4Lzx1-o7Bug" hash="Sz_-HA">There is a chapter in the book of Alma—chapter 32—which seems to me to be written especially for young women. Alma teaches us how to exercise our faith and increase our belief in the words of our Heavenly Father.

And then in verse 14, “And <span class="emphasis">the Word</span> was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.14" class="scriptureRef">John 1:14</a>; emphasis added).</p>

Sarah disregarded a feeling that what she was doing was wrong because of her eagerness to learn to drive. After a bad experience, faith gave her the motivation or the courage to evaluate her very frightening experience and make changes. Did you notice that at first she felt unworthy and unloved because she had made an unwise choice? She said she felt kind of worthless. Those feelings are normal after making a mistake, but she wisely evaluated what had happened and why it had happened that way. She reminded herself of her Heavenly Father’s love and what He would have wanted. She learned to listen to parents and acknowledge the feeling of warning. She recognized how she might use this understanding in another situation. This way every experience can become a growth experience. Our Heavenly Father wants us to overcome bad experiences and not remain stuck in our feelings of being unworthy.</p>

She knew about the great power of faith, a power that could move mountains, but when her friend’s mother died, she exercised her faith by trusting in Heavenly Father’s plan for us. Growing up spiritually requires us to see beyond our own desires and to enlarge our way of seeing things. We not only have to let go of our selfishness but sometimes let go of things we want very badly to come to understand our Heavenly Father’s point of view.</p>

As you exercise your faith and feel that spirituality grow, you will begin to feel more secure. You will feel more confident. Gradually we will come to more fully understand what it means to completely trust in our Heavenly Father and stand as a witness of God (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>). As we become righteous, problem-solving women of faith, we will learn to represent Him and do His work.</p>

On the day of her blessing, I felt a tremendous desire for her welfare and a hope that the good things in life would come to her. In that instant, I thought of what it means when each one of us takes upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ through our baptismal covenants. I have thought of His great desire for our welfare. I feel the love He has for the young women of His church. I have also thought of His great love and appreciation to you leaders—those of you who teach doctrine, who model righteous behavior, who provide an environment of trust where others can develop faith and practice righteous living.</p>

The atoning gift of Jesus Christ allows us to let go of our weaknesses and be strengthened by His perfection. I bear my testimony of His atoning gift to us in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In knowing the scriptures and trusting our Heavenly Father’s words, our Savior himself was an example to us. It is recorded in the fourth chapter of Luke that when Jesus had fasted for forty days and was tempted by the devil, the devil suggested that if Jesus were the Son of God, he turn a stone into bread. Even after fasting forty days, Jesus said, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/4.4" class="scriptureRef">Luke 4:4</a>). Jesus knew the words of the prophets.</p>

Jesus resisted the temptation and responded with the words, “It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/4.8" class="scriptureRef">Luke 4:8</a>). Jesus knew his Father’s will, and the words strengthened him in a time of temptation.</p>

The scriptures have been given to us to help us find peace and reassurance in times of crisis, to help us find solutions to our everyday challenges, to strengthen us in times of temptation. The scriptures will help us improve our behavior as we come to know our Savior, Jesus Christ. The young women of the Church are invited in 1995 to make a commitment to read the scriptures regularly.</p>

I see open books of scriptures at camp, at youth conferences, in Sunday lessons; a read-a-thon; or scripture reading in a retirement center. Young women may be reading the scriptures to little brothers and sisters or to a grandparent whose eyesight is failing. I see scriptures on pillows, on nightstands, in family home evenings. Alma’s heart would be touched this night seeing young women gathered in chapels and stake centers with scriptures in hand. Would all of you open your scriptures to the thirty-second chapter of Alma.
