A very good friend, Alin Spannaus, baptized me that day, and I felt happy, lighter, eager to learn more.</p>

Well, in my case it was love—love for a girl, a girl named Renee. I fell in love with her, and I wanted to marry her. She was different and had standards different from most young women I knew. But I fell for her and asked her to marry me—and she said no!</p>

I was handsome, 24 years old, and a college graduate with a great job. She spoke of her goals—of marrying only someone who could take her to the temple, of having an eternal family—and she declined my offer. I wanted to continue the relationship, so I agreed to listen to the missionaries. Is this a good reason to meet with the missionaries? Well, it was for me.</p>

After I had finished taking all the missionary lessons, I was still not convinced I needed to change anything in my life. It was Elder Cutler, a young, confident missionary with limited Spanish, who one day said, “Joaquin, let’s read together <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42</a>, and we will include your name as we read it.”</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church.p26" pid="8YuVASyAKUuwiTqATNWyxg" hash="-kn9ew">I thought it was silly, but I did as Elder Cutler asked and read in <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.1" class="scriptureRef">verse 1</a>: “And now, my son [Joaquin], I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understand.” Oh!

Then I was struck by a powerful force. The book spoke <span class="emphasis">directly</span> to me, and I started to cry as I read, “And now, [Joaquin,] my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you … unto repentance” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.29" class="scriptureRef">verse 29</a>).</p>

Before that moment, I had thought of repentance as something negative, associated only with sin and wrongdoing, but suddenly I saw it in a different light—as something positive that cleared the path to growth and happiness.</p>
