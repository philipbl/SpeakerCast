      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p1" pid="-4L5byhlvku6yBriNVLUng" hash="YhKJSA">“Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13.9" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 13:9</a>). A salutation with reverence, love, and obedience is invoked in this introduction of a model of prayer given by our Savior himself. Every word is chosen for its particular meaning and inspiring, noble thoughts, elevating our souls to a new level of understanding. We truly have here an expression and example of divine language.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p2" pid="Nj8XoroFM0GO9lIBk3Pe_w" hash="7pAJog">Words, sentences, languages: What are they? How do they affect us, our families, and our Heavenly Father?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p3" pid="-pFXqnZMIUek3hyLO5ymcw" hash="hBapPQ">One word—just a single, simple word—can bring a variety of thoughts and influences. A combination of words can make sense or express foolishness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p4" pid="cz504fZeO0iRuOSnMUSjPg" hash="MZIwiw">One word could mean approval or denial, blessing or cursing, doubt or knowledge, friendship or enmity. The way we say one word, the intonation we use, may cause love or hate. Words can be harsh, melodious, soft-spoken, announced, or even shouted. They can roll like a wave and enthuse and bring victory and pride. We read in Shakespeare: “Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, cry ‘Caesar’” (<span class="emphasis">Julius Caesar,</span> act 1, scene 2, lines 15–17). Words can be distilled drop by drop like a poison, or eat away like a cancer. They can be articulated or mumbled; but every time a word is said, watch it, because it can never be retrieved. It is gone with the wind, gone forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p5" pid="5jZ8MEqjDEec2D0ga9zypA" hash="T0I9tg">Usually we select our words, sometimes using a particular vocabulary, and we employ certain words because of their meanings and the connotations that we want to project. Usage varies, depending on whether we ask, want, pray, persuade, force, influence, or subdue.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p6" pid="r1Lzx5iq3kC2Bkf_1E0RdQ" hash="rabLXA">Words are a form of personal expression. They differentiate us as well as fingerprints do. They reflect what kind of person we are, and tell of our background, and depict our way of life. They describe our thinking as well as our inner feelings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p7" pid="nHjfhselaE6nKqNVGwMJjg" hash="wtz1nA">But where do they come from, and why is language so peculiar? It started in the beginning, as we read in <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:5–6</a>:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p8" pid="q4mmTwlT10KPxX_gHhiS0Q" hash="UiM17A">“And a book of remembrance was kept, in the which was recorded, in the language of Adam, for it was given unto as many as called upon God to write by the spirit of inspiration;</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p10" pid="58kiWMWR2E-C7PefYRx4PA" hash="Nqj-tQ">Language is of divine origin. Only man speaks (and women do even better), and he does so because of the purpose for which he was created. Let us listen to Paul when he said: “Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.1" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13:1</a>). Anacharsis, when asked what was the best part of man, answered: “The tongue.” When asked what was the worst, the answer was the same: “The tongue.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p11" pid="zmDdfVLV9EqJYHuDDNUSaw" hash="yLTI4A">“Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p15" pid="fPCUgf8Mg02DsBjsuDpJOA" hash="9l6qpg">In the Book of Mormon we read that “it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:11</a>). We know by experience, however, what opposition in words can do to individuals, if not controlled. So when we are counseled to be a righteous people, is it only concerning our attitudes? What about corrupted language; foul language; slang; and words evoking evil, dirt, and destruction of the body and soul? The name of Deity is to be used to touch hearts and give light; it is not to be used in vain or to be mocked. Too often, it seems that this kind of language attracts young people and male adults because it is a way in their eyes to be recognized, to look tough or virile. Would this mean that education and manners, charm and reverence are an exclusive feminine matter? What about missionary language that uses words and expression to describe their companions, their investigators, or their leaders in a way that not only sounds disrespectful but also shows a lack of reverence and love?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p16" pid="BfJ_Y8odO0GM-75lR8K8qA" hash="AFVwLg">Words can get things done, commitments fulfilled, or miracles accomplished. We may, because of words, be moved to tears or to laughter, feel great or miserable, be exalted or condemned. “Man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/8.3" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 8:3</a>). Words are sacred in prayer, for example: “Our Heavenly Father”; in sharing a testimony and testifying of the truth: “And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.22-23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:22–23</a>); in giving a status: “I am a child of God”; in summarizing a mission: “Charity never faileth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.46" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:46</a>); in showing love to our family members: “I love you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p17" pid="mqy6YXgNyUmp_ixHJszZGQ" hash="A9wXsw">Words, when expressed by prophets—by a living prophet like Spencer W. Kimball—tell us about the will and the mind of the Lord and are an example of divine language and perfection. “For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p18" pid="dQJave8CvE2K87M2yURxOw" hash="B2zCnA">For example, in one of his recent addresses, President Kimball emphasized the need to learn and know more than our own language. “We need much more language training. We need more people fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese” (Regional Representatives Seminar, 30 March 1979). By studying other languages, we can also improve in our ways to give the message of the restoration of the gospel to the world. The Lord’s people must be distinguished among other nations not only by their calling and behavior, but also by the purity of their language. In Deuteronomy we read: “For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/7.6" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 7:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p19" pid="Idv2yNrnFEaEYDAVmr7paQ" hash="5Mv8Dg">Language is divine. Some may know this but do not realize its implications in their daily family life. Love at home starts with a loving language. This need is so important that, without loving words, some become mentally unbalanced, others emotionally disturbed, and some may even die. No society can survive after its family life has deteriorated, and this deterioration has always started with one word—one single, simple word.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p20" pid="PTkJSYqvXUC6ghKmuoZK9Q" hash="IEMUTA">My prayer is that as children of our Heavenly Father we can glorify him and his Son Jesus Christ with better words of love and appreciation to our loved ones and our neighbors in a language pure and undefiled and with a desire to communicate in a divine way.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1979/10/language-a-divine-way-of-communicating.p21" pid="xU5mUjiu-E6vrB6KRR70sA" hash="yGtrdg">Our Heavenly Father lives; his Son is Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer; his prophet on earth today is Spencer W. Kimball; he is the mouthpiece of the Lord. May His holy name be sanctified by our words forever and ever, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

The life of prisoners as we are, we’ve got to take it in both hands. You’ve got to endure everything, even injustice—and <span class="emphasis">that’s</span> the king that’s reigning now—and the shameful and disgusting sights we see, so as to come out on top, and win. But if we’ve got to make such a sacrifice,’ adds the shapeless man, turning over again, ‘it’s because we’re fighting for progress, not for a country; against error, not against a country.’” (Henri Barbusse, <span class="emphasis">Under Fire: The Story of a Squad (Le Feu),</span> trans.

I need to live my own life.” And he left.</p>

One of the greatest temptations that man has faced throughout half of history is the temptation to serve himself and to satisfy his own appetites first. This choice can lead to the spirit of desertion. Whoever <span class="emphasis">we</span> are, rich or poor, powerful or humble, faithful or not—all are subject to this temptation.</p>

      <description>Since the beginning of humanity, man has divided his world into two camps, friends and foes, with the purpose of gratifying his pride and ambition and exercising power, dominion, or compulsion over the other camp.</description>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/friend-or-foe.p2" pid="SmhmceOQ5kubv_bLuPOz3g" hash="KvaQjg">Military leaders have canonized the expression “friend or foe” and have devised different ways to quickly identify who was who. Early biblical stories tell us about this selection process. At the end of a battle, the Ephraimites were trying to escape through the passages of the Jordan. Unfortunately, these escape routes were already occupied by their enemies, the Gileadites, who had to know who was friend or foe. They asked the fugitives: “Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/friend-or-foe.p5" pid="289AGPZGYkWSiTvxGJjVNw" hash="xQxWcQ">There are not many alternatives to answer the question “Friend or foe?” It is simply one or the other. You may, of course, try to pretend to be a friend because of fear of losing your life, but the end result is almost always the same. We will see that there is an analogy between this selection process used by the natural man and the selection process of finding the potentially divine man.</p>

Are we strong enough to refuse to be a friend of the world and its representatives? Are we strong enough to accept friendship with Christ? Is to be a friend to be complacent and surrender to lower standards, or is it to maintain Christlike standards and defend them? Do we consider mutual friendship as a way to maintain and develop the foundation of our testimony of Christ? “Feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 32:3</a>.) The conditions are set; the model is given. Then why not become his disciple by being his witness? Why entertain the constant dilemma of your mind? Be committed to be his friend!</p>

Do we treat our sons and daughters as children of God? Do we teach by example? Do we pray with them? Do we attend church with them? Do we have family home evening regularly? Our spiritual progress and qualifying to become friends with Christ and his Father depend on how faithfully we live the gospel in our homes and how diligently we impart the teachings to our children.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p1" pid="Cl0sYSi8akuADL_V97TO0A" hash="KguUdw">Since the beginning, truth and knowledge about ourselves and our environment have been a quest for the natural man and have led him to great scientific discoveries and also to debatable theories. There seems to be no limit to his questions, and the proposed answers that might have been true yesterday will probably change today and again tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p2" pid="-C4EMiIPy0qRhwxMp0Ir3A" hash="be3wLw">This quest is not limited only to science, but to every aspect of our lives. More than ever before, our values and roles as men, women, and children are being challenged and scrutinized—supposedly to liberate individuals from anxiety, bondage, fears, and bigotry, and to give them a feeling of security. It seems that the natural man always wants to secure his truths and knowledge to fit his own carnal security.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p3" pid="FER7Ae4450ChkyIf7baJXA" hash="kfSN0Q">Submerged by this continual flow of conflicting reconsideration of every possible value, one should not be surprised to see that these constant changes bring a state of constant insecurity rather than security in the lives of common people to the point where many, especially the youth, have abdicated their responsibilities, and many have even given up their lives. What a paradox!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p4" pid="cgRRS4KdCkStlDLfkP6bwA" hash="EZcA3g">In our lives of trials and tribulations and constant changes, it is obvious that we all seek for some measure of security—something steady and unchanging to cling to—and we have surrounded ourselves with all kinds of devices or organizations that carry the word <span class="emphasis">security.</span> For example, we use security blankets to soothe and comfort our children. We install security systems to protect our homes and our personal possessions. The Social Security system was created as a protection against temporal storms. In the political arena, the Security Council of the United Nations attempts to maintain peace among the nations of the world. At times we are amused by this all-consuming search for so-called security, but we require it and are willing to pay for it. However, despite all our efforts, we still do not gain the <span class="emphasis">real</span> security that we seek. Is it because we put our trust in the arm of flesh?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p5" pid="l6pMSCMtz0afnPXujyVhkw" hash="rLngZg">Security is an essential ingredient in our lives. It includes knowledge about our true identity and the purpose of life, how to interact with others, and how to face our daily adversities and challenges. It can be a matter of life and death. Every day of our lives we are faced with what is good and what is evil, what is right and what is wrong. From childhood to old age, if we don’t feel secure or if we live by deceiving carnal security, our attitudes, goals, and interrelationships with others will suffer. When we gain a feeling of security from loving parents as a child and continue on to experience the security enjoyed by obeying laws, we bless our own lives and the lives of others. The real issue, then, has always been where and how to find righteous security as opposed to carnal security. For our purpose here, we will call righteous security spiritual security.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p6" pid="-gupsVtPoEKT9wDZmZ5vEA" hash="GyKX9Q">Spiritual security provides interesting advantages: you do not have to pay taxes on it, it does not change, it does not take away your liberty or free agency, and it brings positive, comforting, spiritual, and eternal results.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p7" pid="IZxouvsIV0WM36TrVwKMUw" hash="uUrn4w">Security cannot be guaranteed because free agency also brings insecurity, and spiritual security does not automatically suppress or eliminate danger, oppression, or opposition.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p8" pid="hSy8foe1Kk-dgg1w8u873A" hash="KLFpOA">Then how can we gain spiritual security? The very simple answer is perhaps too simple for too many: first, turn to the Lord. King Limhi said, “But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/7.33" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 7:33</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p9" pid="RtolSAGmxkads6ROSjey7g" hash="XNV_TA">Second, trust the Lord. As Nephi of old said:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p10" pid="AoAIpdMPdkO8qqfbxp8eDw" hash="lepaJg">“O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p11" pid="CVpYnidi90-zh1oUiFpgzA" hash="dvbIbA">“Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.34-35" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:34–35</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p12" pid="N2078GLzZUqEU0IDhzJVRw" hash="etHh6A">To turn to the Lord and to trust him is to learn from his revelations. Spiritual security comes from revelation that unveils the true nature of Deity. The kind of God in whom we believe generally determines the kind of people we are and will become. Without revelation about the true nature of Deity, the natural man will walk “in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p13" pid="5Y-A1usQdEi-GZ6GApSsnQ" hash="RykL3w">Spiritual security is derived from revelation describing a plan of salvation for our benefit. “God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.30" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:30</a>). The plan of salvation gives a direction to be followed, a sure way to strengthen ourselves against the pitfalls of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p14" pid="jJR2lPfZY0WaMmFYLbd9Cw" hash="69_1QQ">Spiritual security is revelation that tells us about the source of the plan of salvation: Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p15" pid="w4XR3bchuEGNhKVnjhZnIw" hash="p66I3g">“And we talk of Christ,” said Nephi, “we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:26</a>). The source is identified, clarified, and verified. We do not need to seek elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p16" pid="xj8I7xXUvkiab4xV_0MeQw" hash="bqJy_w">Spiritual security comes from revelation that relieves the anxiety of death. “But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16.8" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 16:8</a>). How reassuring it is to know the reality not only of the Resurrection, but also of eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p17" pid="jB9140VwpkqMOQCh_czsgQ" hash="Q2VU6w">“And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.41" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:41</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p18" pid="RllXOlE0KkiksbDqSc3vKQ" hash="COi85A">Spiritual security is enhanced as a result of revelation that promises an unchanging, everlasting, eternal way of life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p19" pid="qBd0a5G240SRDnc8nkHaug" hash="JKzNjA">“For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and in him there is no variableness neither shadow of changing?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.9" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 9:9</a>). There is no need for daily heartrending revisions or reconsideration of our values.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p20" pid="tWr3HDu5VUSxBrzPsDqYQA" hash="bhB5WA">Spiritual security increases because revelation teaches us about our true identity and our relationship with God. From the beginning this was revealed to Adam: “Behold, thou art one in me, a son of God” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.68" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:68</a>). Then it was revealed to others, such as Moses: “Thou art my son” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.4" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:4</a>). “Thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.6" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:6</a>). In our day it has also been revealed to Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and to many others: “Behold, I say unto you, my son” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 9:1</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p21" pid="SVpLE_ZXL0W14scTAYxKrQ" hash="wGYLYQ">Knowing who we really are prepares us to use that knowledge to face temptations, to resist them, and then to act righteously. Moses, knowing he was a son of God, as revealed to him, told Satan, “Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not; for God said unto me: Thou art after the similitude of mine Only Begotten” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.16" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:16</a>). The result did not wait, as the Lord called him, saying, “Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, have chosen thee, and thou shalt be made stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy command as if thou wert God” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.25" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:25</a>). The spiritual security becomes evident as the Lord added, “I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.26" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p22" pid="potVaiiABUmZlA34PgGvUw" hash="V_Ucgw">Spiritual security is edified by revelation that describes the roles of men and women. After the Fall, Heavenly Father addressed Adam and Eve personally and directly and instructed them about their roles. Relationships, gender, behavior, marriage—all matters related to males and females were and still are clearly defined to strengthen us in our divine roles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p23" pid="7XYnVFSqMUOys8bjErP0Gg" hash="IbNv1w">Spiritual security is strengthened by revelation that explains the results of observing the commandments. “And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:41</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p24" pid="lg9cvAHCyUqtggQI9Jx66A" hash="FzJCpg">Finally, spiritual security is reinforced step-by-step by revelation, and this security becomes power as we receive, one by one, the ordinances of salvation. The ordinances of salvation represent covenants with the Lord. John A. Widtsoe said, “When ordinances are performed, blessings are received which give power to man, power that belongs to the everyday affairs of this life as to a future life. It is not merely knowledge; not merely consecration; not merely a labeling, so to speak; but the actual conferring of power that may be used every day” (<span class="emphasis">The Message of the Doctrine and Covenants,</span> ed. G. Homer Durham, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969, p. 161).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p25" pid="ipwAFQxdO0acHinLSR-XYg" hash="eN6m-g">Yesterday’s revelations gave security to the people about the coming of Jesus Christ and the assurance that the words of the Lord spoken by holy prophets are always fulfilled. Today’s revelations in the Book of Mormon, to which I have purposely referred, carry the same promise. President Ezra Taft Benson has declared: “God expects us to use the Book of Mormon in several ways. We are to read it ourselves. …</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p30" pid="vUxf2dU9FEaC_aUPZ3yv7A" hash="1FlR4w">Because of its message for our day, the Book of Mormon helps us to respond to the call of God and of a living prophet to become partners in the plan of salvation and to build spiritual security by helping us to resist and combat the false concepts and evil influences of our time that bring insecurity, unhappiness, and destruction of our ethics and moral values.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p31" pid="KNJvspBw0Eaal1wNUTp27Q" hash="wjWYLA">To turn to the Lord and to trust him through revelation will help any individual, at any time, in any part of the world, understand and interpret correctly and righteously life’s experiences from the only true perspective, which is the Lord’s perspective revealed to man. To turn to the Lord and to trust his revelations is to live in such a way as to resist the floods and the winds of doubt and uncertainty.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/04/spiritual-security.p32" pid="wXwEXGgTuE2YvGzZkmPtVA" hash="MQf0Ew">It is truly the foundation of our commitment to serve and to make the right choices.

We are also witnessing events that, perhaps not as visible but certainly as tangible, profoundly affect the quality of individual lives and families, followed by even more far-reaching consequences and changes specifically in relation to God, churches, and religious behavior. These changes have caused a significant shift in traditional or religious values toward world practices, and this is well described in one verse of modern revelation: “They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p3" pid="GdDoXH-y0UKvOEBeENHN0A" hash="lhDGzQ">What is the true foundation that should motivate us to act accordingly? Elder Heber C. Kimball once said: “Let me say to you, that many of you will see the time when you will have all the trouble, trial and persecution that you can stand, and plenty of opportunities to show that you are true to God and his work. This Church has before it many close places through which it will have to pass before the work of God is crowned with victory. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p4" pid="otWGl7vPfUe3OFMwnvfVaw" hash="wx-8Fg">“The time will come when no man nor woman will be able to endure on borrowed light. Each will have to be guided by the light within himself. If you do not have it, how can you stand?” (Orson F. Whitney, <span class="emphasis">Life of Heber C. Kimball,</span> 3d. ed., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1945, pp. 449–50.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p6" pid="FQPuXSZ8G0OAzjDtMnDA7A" hash="-lwXyw">President Harold B. Lee said, “The real strength of the Church is to be measured by the individual testimonies to be found in the total membership of the Church.” (In Mexico City Area Conference Report, Aug. 25–27, 1972, p. 117.) Based on this quote, we might also say that the real strength of an individual is to be found in his testimony and in living it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p7" pid="tKzHqhgB-UeBPeNrGoB9xA" hash="jZ8qbw">If the measure of strength and the stability or true foundation of an individual and his subsequent conduct lies in a testimony and we do not fully recognize its importance, or do not understand what it really means, or cannot or will not bear it or share it with others, and if we cannot teach it or explain it to others, maybe we ought to explore the deep, spiritual meaning of it and the blessing of obtaining, maintaining, and sharing a personal, individual testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p8" pid="QKXq2qsSlkqqvE2XieTllg" hash="ipZS9w">Early in the scriptures, the sacredness of the word <span class="emphasis">testimony</span> is illustrated when Adam was told that “all things are created and made to bear record of me.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.63" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:63</a>.) It was vital for Adam to have a knowledge of our Father and his Son, and that has not changed in our time and will never change. This applies as well to the principle of gaining a testimony and knowing what it is. It is knowing by the power of the Holy Ghost that God lives and is the same yesterday, today, and forever (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:12</a>) and that “this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.3" class="scriptureRef">John 17:3</a>). A testimony is not only a witness that Jesus is the Christ, but also a statement or affirmation of the fact that Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son; a conviction that the Book of Mormon has a divine origin and is another testament of Jesus Christ; and a knowledge that the Church of Jesus Christ, with its gospel and holy priesthood, was in truth and fact restored.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p9" pid="Njk4nRTptEyInpgWNR4wog" hash="ltKLVw">Joseph Fielding Smith defined it this way: “A testimony of the gospel is a convincing knowledge given by revelation to the individual who humbly seeks the truth.” (<span class="emphasis">Answers to Gospel Questions,</span> comp. Joseph Fielding Smith, Jr., 5 vols., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1957–66, 3:31.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p10" pid="xi_P1CbyQE6268YLiij2iQ" hash="l0eO8w">What are the essential steps to obtain a testimony? First, to humbly seek the truth, to have a desire to know by exercising belief or faith. When we obtain any blessing from God, such as an answer to prayer or a convincing knowledge, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:21</a>.) Here, then, are the required standards of the law: ask in the name of Christ and exercise faith in him, have a sincere heart, humbly seek the truth, be receptive, discard preconceived religious concepts, and cleanse yourself from the sins of the world. You must adhere to the rules, tune in correctly to receive the proper signal, and, once in harmony with the Holy Ghost, you may know the truth of all things. This represents a spiritual gift available from God, not to be denied but to profit us. It is permanently available, never to be taken away except by our unbelief or unwillingness to humbly seek the truth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p11" pid="AI3E2XCZGUKOnnUH6_yKfQ" hash="uSYESw">The second step is to know by revelation, where Spirit speaks to spirit. It is one thing to be able to say, “I believe, I think, I hope that the gospel is true,” but it requires personal revelation and personal acknowledgment and recognition to declare, “I <span class="emphasis">know</span> that the Church is true.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p12" pid="RA5GySflIUWHGPg_D5uL5A" hash="jphfYw">Alma gives us a perfect example of this convincing knowledge that he received by revelation. In four verses we learn about this light within himself. First, the assurance of his testimony: “Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.45" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:45</a>.) Second, the source of his testimony: “They are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.46" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:46</a>.) Third, the process of gaining his testimony: “I have fasted and prayed.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.46" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:46</a>.) Fourth, the evidence of his testimony: “The Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.46" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:46</a>.) Fifth, the origin of his testimony: “The words which have been spoken by our fathers are true.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.47" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:47</a>.) Sixth, the power of his testimony: “I say unto you, that I know of myself … that Jesus Christ shall come.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.48" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:48</a>.) This convincing knowledge or testimony would not be complete without also accepting the responsibility of carrying such a testimony. And Alma further stated, “I am called … to preach … to cry unto them that they must repent and be born again.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.49" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:49</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p13" pid="Hc9dOdrKTEuSdkC4yMLwyg" hash="AEIsww">Let us now examine the keys of the spirit of revelation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p14" pid="EFj-m0uWLEqL1p5HivhRmg" hash="PmxI2g">Key number 1 is to know for yourself. Do not be dependent on someone else.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p15" pid="zBpfHVMK90SFyVRYJoESHw" hash="aSCnFg">Key number 2 is to know by the power of the Holy Ghost. Do not look at reason, logic, or the philosophies of men and theories of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p16" pid="Gmb_G32EAkOd0LdRTVjhcQ" hash="f5Vzvw">Key number 3 is to know by searching the scriptures and the revelations given and published in our day by the prophets—the First Presidency and the Twelve. Do not listen to apostate, unauthorized voices or speculation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p17" pid="Qxwf72GTiEStymawNDkgog" hash="N_mmxw">Key number 4 is to know by asking your Heavenly Father in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ. Do not turn to public discussions and forums. The purpose of having and using certain keys is always very simple: to open the right door with a particular key. The purpose of these spiritual keys is to open spiritual doors, one by one, to come to a plain testimony as described by the prophets. When children first start to read, they look at the letters and ask what they are. After a time they can recognize the letters by their names and put them together to form a word. And then a miracle happens. They can read a word, then a sentence, then a book. The steps of gaining a testimony follow the same pattern. We want to know; we begin with what we know; and when we know, we further enrich our knowledge by sharing and practicing what we know.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p18" pid="Esk9tn-TIUiyANYuOPw_lw" hash="EnJbfg">Once a testimony is in place, just like a fire that needs fuel and oxygen to burn, it needs to be fed and tended or it will burn out and die. A dying testimony corresponds, in fact, to a forthcoming denial of Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. Nephi taught: “For the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.28" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p19" pid="SKB5DgHzJECDvjPSTlV0GQ" hash="g0C17A">Unfortunately, there are those who gain testimonies and then deny them and lose them. How does this happen? If you follow the steps to obtain a testimony, you do exactly the opposite to deny it or lose it. Do not pray; the door to revelation will be closed. Do not be humble but listen to your own superior voice. Do not participate in the ordinances of the gospel but follow the practices of the world. Do not follow Church leaders but be critical of them. Do not listen to prophets and follow their counsel but interpret their declarations according to your own desires. Do not obey the commandments but live according to your own appetites and desires.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p20" pid="4P76ksh2Zk2Wv5GYvpN-MA" hash="HwOygg">These are only a few of the most evident problems leading to a loss of testimony. As ashes represent the evidence of a dying fire, the demise of a testimony is characterized by spiritual ashes, such as a lack of gospel appetite, charity, and purpose, as well as having feelings of apathy, bitterness, and emptiness. Spiritual ashes might be all that are left of what was once a burning, loving, meaningful, and uplifting testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p21" pid="nf1IlkPvrk2ZMmGGXjo2tQ" hash="WJEizQ">To maintain and strengthen a testimony, prophets have always reminded us to bear it and share it. Elder Spencer W. Kimball stated, “To hold his testimony one must bear it often and live worthy of it.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1944, p. 45.) Make it known after you know, make its power evident after you know, and live accordingly after you know.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p22" pid="jrS4Y-Q44k2VoMTHl55mBQ" hash="W1i9RA">To have a testimony and to share it provides a firm foundation for us to stand on and a way to control our lives in this constantly changing world.</p>

Moses and his people had quite a convincing knowledge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p24" pid="zwgQXi-5ykajXeMxkNwNvg" hash="-IQLng">When Joseph Smith received his vision, he also knew. It was an indelible testimony.

What about us? Are we any different when we have received a testimony of the covenant? Perhaps we now begin to perceive and understand the importance of a testimony and the strength that can be derived from it, with its mortal and eternal consequences. It is definitely a most precious possession, something to be desired now and forever because it determines our life here and eternal life hereafter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/testimony.p26" pid="mlyW5pDpE0WjB0oFrUS3Fw" hash="AQGAJg">President Benson, our living prophet, stated: “A testimony is one of the few possessions we may take with us when we leave this life. … A testimony of Jesus means that you accept the divine mission of Jesus Christ, embrace His gospel, and do His works; it means you accept the prophetic mission of Joseph Smith and his successors.” (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1982, p. 62.)</p>

The Lord, by revelation, reminds us that when we are assembled, as we are here tonight, we are to be instructed and edified that we may know how to act upon his law and commandments (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.8-9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 43:8–9</a>). How important is it to remember these instructions?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p2" pid="l5Yfowa85EmY6FROoshiBg" hash="NMJiiQ">To remember is to keep in mind, to store in memory for later attention or consideration. I remember something so I can use it later for a certain purpose or result. For students like you young men, it means that you memorize facts or information to pass an exam, resulting in good grades and happiness. You may also have learned—perhaps by sad experience—that to forget is to cease to remember, resulting in poor grades and unhappiness. There is always a relationship between remembering, doing, and happiness or forgetting, not doing, and unhappiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p3" pid="ILNwYCTLr0OeB_7atku0_A" hash="NKrgZQ">The process is the same, of course, with spiritual matters. I remember the gospel and the covenants, and I act or participate. I commit and receive the blessings associated with the covenants or commandments. If I forget my faith and my covenants and do not commit and work for my salvation, I fail to receive the promised blessings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p4" pid="C4UYVis7SUe96590wpxzWQ" hash="Lr-vYQ">Reflecting on this spiritual teaching pattern in my life, I would like to share with you some of my memories as a convert to the Church. This might help someone—young or older—learn how to “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>) under any circumstances.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p5" pid="upQJY0RaVUaeepI2RpQBfw" hash="_oTsBw">It all started on the day of my baptism. I was twenty-two years old and a college student. I was part of a small group that assembled at a swimming pool in Brussels, Belgium. We didn’t have a chapel at that time. There was no baptismal font, no bishop, just two missionaries and a few branch members to support us. I had no family members with me. It was a first step in the known and the unknown. The known was a sure testimony of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer; of Joseph Smith, a prophet; of the Book of Mormon; and of the Church, the only true one. The unknown was yet to be discovered and experienced. It started to be unveiled by receiving the priesthood after baptism. According to the procedures followed at that time, a convert almost had to stand at the bar of judgment to receive the priesthood. Three months passed before I was interviewed and ordained a deacon. Then on that Sunday morning I stood in front of the sacrament table to distribute the emblems of the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. I still remember the surroundings, which were quite different from the ornate decorations of the church where I had previously worshiped. The dining room of a home had been transformed into a meeting hall for sacrament meetings that were attended by a few members. It was my first experience to magnify my priesthood calling. Nine months later I was ordained a teacher and learned how to teach and to watch over the few members of the branch during their contentions and ups and downs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p6" pid="WUDi-RvWsU2MIJcJa-Bsqw" hash="qqPUaA">These were also interesting days, when attending priesthood meeting meant sitting in a circle with two missionaries and two other brothers, and reading from one mimeographed sheet of paper that was the lesson. There was no priesthood manual, and only twenty sections of the Doctrine and Covenants had been translated into French. There was no Pearl of Great Price, but most importantly we did have the complete Book of Mormon. We passed this great book from hand to hand and learned about the covenants and teachings of the Lord and his doctrine. Precept upon precept, stone upon stone, I was building my spiritual memory bank and enjoying spiritual happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p7" pid="8KM2RAvYekOBq8VnTw18uw" hash="dESWDg">Another four months passed, and I was ordained a priest. Now I stood on the other side of the sacrament table. The decor was the same, but I felt different. It impressed me that now I was blessing the emblems of the Atonement and memorizing “that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, … and always remember him and keep his commandments … that they may always have his Spirit to be with them” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>). It was an unforgettable experience, and I still visualize it today when I bless the sacrament as a General Authority.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p8" pid="8yi2vI9NIUOJ0qc9Nw4u0A" hash="c1H5Kw">Two years passed after my baptism, and the day arrived for me to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and to be ordained an elder. The mission president once again laid his hands upon my head. The authority and power to act in the name of the Lord were given. It was received by mutual agreement by an oath and covenant. The oath represented the assurance that the promises of the agreement would be kept by both participants; the covenant, that the conditions of the agreement would be kept.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p9" pid="ytzum8xNPUWwz25Sa5VYVg" hash="xgO41g">As I recall that priesthood preparation in the service of the Lord, I can see how remembering my covenants helped me to honor and magnify my priesthood calling, to keep the commandments, and to bring spiritual happiness into my life in preparation for eternal life. During those trial years, many of my young friends in the Church forgot their covenants and one by one returned to the world. The world always stands between man and God, representing two alternatives but only one true choice.</p>

By simply focusing on the doctrine of Jesus Christ that will ensure the salvation of those who remember it, accept it, and act upon it. How did the process work for me?</p>

This was of great interest to me and a determining factor in my conversion. I had witnessed the breakup of my parents’ marriage; I had seen sorrow caused by death without spiritual knowledge and friends marrying without temple ordinances. I wanted to avoid these tragedies.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p12" pid="6TEkmwi-VUmgpmXIq5WvlQ" hash="sM8gUA">What is this doctrine? In the Bible, it states that Adam was created, but he was alone. We read, “But for Adam there was not found an help meet for him” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/2.20" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 2:20</a>). Thus, the Lord created woman—not another man—and commanded that they should be united in the sacred bonds of marriage. The first divine, righteous, ordained union between a man and a woman was sealed by these words, “A man … shall cleave unto his wife” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/2.24" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 2:24</a>). This is the established doctrine, and it will never change. It is repeated in modern revelation: “Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:22</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p13" pid="iwizgNoDXEemr82RviURLw" hash="NDGjvw">This union is solemnized by the authority of the everlasting priesthood into a holy and sacred ordinance, the temple sealing. It is also called the new and everlasting covenant of marriage, and its purpose is to bind couples together on earth and bring them to a fulness of exaltation in the kingdom of God in the hereafter. Then, Adam and Eve were also commanded to multiply and replenish the earth. “And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/3.20" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 3:20</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p14" pid="0PJldpNETUeV10obh20jyA" hash="Q2Pcqg">The true concept of marriage and family, the unit composed of a husband, wife, and children sealed together, was instituted at the beginning by God to create eternal families. That foundation principle became my vision and my goal and also reality as my companion and I were sealed in the temple in Zollikofen, Switzerland. As a husband and father and later as a grandfather, I was and still am responsible for the development, temporal support, protection, and salvation of my family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p15" pid="lTKzGvslgE6oeajjKgphig" hash="1pnD2Q">Another determining factor in my conversion was the Church as a divine institution led by the authority of the priesthood.

Widtsoe wrote: “The Church, the community of persons with the same intelligent faith and desire and practice, is the organized agency through which God deals with His children and presents His will. Moreover, the authority to act for God must be vested on earth in some one organization and not independently in every man. The Church through the Priesthood holds this authority for the use of man” (<span class="emphasis">Priesthood and Church Government,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 180).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/04/remember-your-covenants.p17" pid="ptz0UoDKjkKOiG6Csaizyw" hash="s1IKGQ">The Church provides a unique support for individuals and families to do things that they cannot do by themselves, such as receiving the essential ordinances of salvation. It brings temporal relief in times of hardship. It is also a laboratory outside of the home where we can serve, learn, and practice charity, the pure love of Christ.</p>

He is at the head, and following this pattern, the priesthood is conferred upon worthy men so they can preside in their homes and families. The husband and father, a patriarch, is to preside in righteousness and exercise the power of his priesthood to bless his wife and family. The husband and wife serve as partners in governing their family, and both act in joint leadership and depend on each other. They are united in the vision of their eternal salvation, one holding the priesthood, the other honoring and enjoying the blessings of it. One is not superior or inferior to the other. Each one carries his or her respective responsibilities and acts in his or her respective role.</p>

In essence, therein is the true doctrine of the Father, the irreversible correct principles to govern ourselves, and the know-how to act upon the law and commandments that we were given.</p>

How do you overcome the temptation to have it your own way, to satisfy your own appetites, and to follow the world’s trends?</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p2" pid="O_9VpjhKwkaZaAt2-UB1tQ" hash="1cNinQ">Indeed, walls are usually built to separate two or more entities physically, mentally, or even spiritually and to create obstacles. They are built because they represent the idea of defense, protection, or separation. Some walls have acquired fame because of that nature: the walls of Jerusalem, the Great Wall of China, the Wall of Berlin. Walls, as a symbol, are also used in our common vocabulary to reflect this idea of separation, as in “a wall of incomprehension,” “a wall of intolerance,” or “it is like talking to a brick wall!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p3" pid="e-zI2K8UgUCm-an46lqz2Q" hash="2awJDw">Bridges are the opposite of walls. Bridges are built to bring together, to join two or more entities, and to create unity. They are built to overcome obstacles. Some bridges have also become famous, like the Bridge of Sighs, the Allenby Bridge, and so many others. The term is also used in our language to express the idea of reunion or unity, as in “to bridge a gap” or “to bridge differences.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p4" pid="Abuntj3o0ES6XeoK2HRFbQ" hash="FDz-Pw">As we consider our mortal existence on this earth and the purpose of life expressed by Alma that “this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.32" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:32</a>), what is the Lord’s way to help us achieve this very purpose? It is simply, by using this metaphor, to help us build a bridge of faith in our life for crossing and overcoming the walls of unbelief, indifference, fear, or sin. Our mortal life is the time for men to meet God by building a bridge of faith, opening the door into immortality and eternal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p5" pid="666iMGjA7EqihzwBGp-PTA" hash="Oe4I0w">How do we build such a bridge of faith?</p>

At that time, only one bridge connected the two cities. It had been built and rebuilt over the remnants of a bridge built centuries before by the Roman conquerors. It had become too narrow for the traffic, and there were too many small arches to allow the passage of large boats and barges. A new bridge was necessary, wider and with only one arch. The work to establish the foundations soon started on both sides of the river. Rapidly, two huge metallic arms began to stretch from each side with the aim to meet together in the middle of the river. I was fascinated by the engineering and rode my bicycle almost every day to watch the progress of the work. Finally the day came when the centerpiece, a cornerstone made of steel, was going to link the two arms together. Crowds were now watching with me the delicate operation, the final step that would join the two arms together and permit crossing the bridge for the first time. When it took place, people applauded, workers embraced; the obstacle of the river had been conquered and overcome.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p7" pid="P8dRikhIjE2DsU1IJjQmMQ" hash="R3QL1g">I mention this experience because of the symbolism that it represents. The bridge is more than a bridge of metal. It symbolizes the bridge of faith enabling us, children of our Heavenly Father, to meet Him again. The centerpiece of the bridge, the cornerstone, represents the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Mediator, the link between mortality and immortality, the connection between the natural man and the spiritual man, the change from temporal life to eternal life. It is because of Him that mankind can be reconciled with their Heavenly Father and that we can overcome the walls of sin and mortality, these obstacles that represent spiritual and physical death. The Atonement of Jesus Christ is the centerpiece of the plan of salvation, the promised reunion with our Heavenly Father, as we read in the book of Moses: “This is the plan of salvation unto all men, through the blood of mine Only Begotten, who shall come in the meridian of time” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.62" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:62</a>).</p>

The greatest of all the gifts of God is the supreme sacrifice of His Son, His Atonement, that brings not only immortality but also eternal life if we keep His commandments and endure to the end (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p9" pid="Ps5Bh1fQFkeZpI3oY4b3TA" hash="qgOXgQ">And so, as we attempt to build a bridge of faith, we need to build in our lives a firm testimony of the Father and the Son and His Atonement. This bridge of faith will make a difference between the reality of eternal reunion with our Heavenly Father or eternal separation from Him if we erect walls of sin that turn us away from His love and mercy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p10" pid="ybaRNO895U6yTxmph7Pblg" hash="vQYo9Q">The gift of the Holy Ghost is the foundation of the bridge of faith. Salvation comes only by Jesus Christ and by our divine exercise of faith in Him, allowing us to repent of our sins and to receive the ordinances of salvation, the railings of the bridge. The inner feelings and promptings to overcome the obstacles of life and to make righteous choices will come by listening to the voice of the Holy Ghost. Crossing the bridge of faith may not be as easy as we may think. A bridge will only resist the storms because of the strength of the pillars of its foundation. Storms in life, crises of faith—such as death, serious illness, loss of a job or financial security—are part of our mortal existence. Sometimes these crises may be exacerbated to the point where one may even question the very existence of a God and of a Savior. A cry for increased faith at such a time will always be answered by the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, a “constant companion, … an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:46</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p11" pid="_aGdq34-z0G9507_lOJOHQ" hash="OJ6iXw">Yes, the solutions to our daily problems can always be found by daily seeking, by our faith, the influence of the Holy Ghost, who brings all things to our remembrance (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.26" class="scriptureRef">John 14:26</a>). Let me illustrate this point by quoting from a letter written many years ago by a new convert at that time and addressed to President Harold B. Lee after he spoke at a stake conference: “As you spoke, an idea kept repeating itself in my mind: how life as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is like crossing a swinging bridge suspended between the points of birth by baptism into the Church and death into eternal life over the turbulent stream of worldliness and sin. As one starts out onto the bridge, the nearness of his baptism lends a feeling of security and faith, but as one becomes aware of the stream below and the vast expanse to be crossed, the sense of security gives way to spasmodic twinges of doubt and fear, causing one to lose the rhythm of prayer, faith, and love, and work which makes one’s progress smooth. The mists of doubt and apathy arise and corrode one’s heart and mind, impeding one’s progress and restricting one’s response to the magnetic force of love which streams across the bridge. It is then one breaks step and falls to his knees and hangs on until the force of love restores faith and direction to the crossing” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1965, 15).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p12" pid="TSOvJQE4l0qgDWNw1WEMLw" hash="yEg3WA">Finally, a bridge of faith would not be complete without the linking of parents and children, uniting them to achieve an eternal family. The purpose of building this bridge of faith between generations is so they become one, as the Father and the Son are one—one in purpose in achieving life eternal. In order to do so, commandments are given to us: first, for children to honor their father and their mother, then for parents to teach their children “to walk uprightly before the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:28</a>). Let me illustrate:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p13" pid="IqR-brB6WE6PslEBqClvbA" hash="i1CJPg">As a little boy during the Second World War, my country had been invaded; danger was all around us. My mother taught me a great lesson of trust and unity that I have never forgotten. She alerted me to the perils of war and simply said: “Trust my word and follow me; listen to my voice. If you do so, I will protect you the best I know how.” I simply listened to my mother because I loved her and trusted her.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p14" pid="kEhOWzOhl0q4iZR7vh7qQQ" hash="B4qE-w">A little later, school started, and this, for me, was a new bridge to cross. As a preparation for this new experience in my life, leaving the home, my mother told me to listen to my teacher and to be obedient. Again, I trusted my mother’s advice. I decided to be obedient to my teacher and a new code of rules. School therefore became a bridge of knowledge instead of a wall of ignorance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p15" pid="UrxMutFVGEC6oUuF30m0yQ" hash="Z_b_EQ">That lesson of trust and unity was vital to become one with my parents, family members, and teachers. It allowed me later to become one with my Savior by being baptized into His Church. It reminded me as a husband, father, and grandfather to continue to build trust and unity among our family members by keeping the temple covenants. As President Hinckley has stated: “The temple is concerned with things of immortality. It is a bridge between this life and the next” (<span class="emphasis">Stand a Little Taller</span> [2001], 6).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p16" pid="zaUShw_CaUmx51x5DE56FA" hash="jXXQ3A">In our day, it is so easy to isolate ourselves by erecting temporal, spiritual, and even family or religious walls. Let us instead build more bridges of faith, of reconciliation, and live by the peace that is given “not as the world giveth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>), but by Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He is the bridge of faith unto eternity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/10/building-a-bridge-of-faith.p17" pid="H3JEaCfBmUadJLx5Qg8z3Q" hash="oKmP8A">I testify that Jesus is the Christ; I put my trust in Him and in His gospel of salvation to be reunited someday. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

It is a record of God’s early revelation to His prophets, dealing with mankind. It starts with an account of Adam and Eve, our first parents; their creation; their fall, with its consequences—mortality and separation from God; and their first steps in the mortal world. Probably then one of their first questions was “Why are we here?” To find out, their only solution was to call upon the name of the Lord, their only source of true knowledge (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/4.26" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 4:26</a>). By direct revelation, they heard the voice of the Lord commanding them that they should worship the Lord their God and should make an offering unto Him (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/4.4" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 4:4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.4-5" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:4–5</a>). Further revelation to Adam and Eve taught them that the offering was in similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, that Jesus Christ was the only name whereby salvation would come unto them. Then the gift of the Holy Ghost was promised to them whereby whatsoever they would ask, it would be given to them (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.6-7" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:6–7</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.52" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:52</a>).</p>

There was a literal restoration of an understanding of the mortal status of the fallen Adam and Eve by giving them knowledge about their relationship with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; knowledge about the Atonement and the Resurrection; and further knowledge about the first principles and ordinances of the gospel of salvation.</p>

His major responsibility now was to preserve the truth of the gospel as well as to teach it as it was given to him. Satan, on the other hand, representing the opposition, was going to do and teach anything to deny, to reject, or to ignore the gospel received by revelation, thus inducing the people who had accepted it into apostasy, a state of confusion, division, abandonment, or renunciation of their previous faith! The rest of the story of the Old Testament became then a religious history of continuous revelation through various prophets like Noah, Abraham, and Moses, at various times—called dispensations—to restore what had been lost because of renewed apostasy. These prophets were always called by God. They were given divine authority; they had the keys of the priesthood; they had a divine commission to speak in the name of the Lord and teach and prophesy of the coming and the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>).</p>

It is an account of the birth, life, and ministry of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; His Atonement; and His Resurrection. It tells about the establishment of His Church, His divine authority, His gospel, and His commandment to His disciples to share, to “go … into all the world, and preach [His] gospel to every creature” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/16.15" class="scriptureRef">Mark 16:15</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-message-of-the-restoration.p10" pid="JFl_3zZuG0SAtX6h2BYfig" hash="CmPdaQ">The message of the New Testament was clear: there was one fold, one faith, one gospel, one priesthood, one church in order to be “in one, the children of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.17" class="scriptureRef">4 Ne. 1:17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-message-of-the-restoration.p11" pid="f0rwhCusbk2P9FgYpJ-c9A" hash="RyIMfQ">But again persecution, denial of divine identity, and rejection of Christ’s gospel and His authorized priesthood servants characterized the post-Resurrection era. And religious history shows us evidence of how rapidly the priesthood authority was superseded by the secular authority; how the divine doctrine was traded for shifting, distorted human philosophies; how the ordinances of salvation were altered or purchased for money; how revelation was replaced by a veil of obscurity leading into the ages of spiritual darkness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-message-of-the-restoration.p12" pid="SEKaB3zrJ0iqye-i4ukYpg" hash="WoSRpg">However, there came a time during this great Apostasy, which had been prophesied before, when the religious quest surfaced again—the “Why is it so?” Men of great faith emerged to try to reform false doctrines and false spiritual authority. Their honest and sincere efforts only resulted in the creation of more churches carrying their names and their protest and adding more confusion and more divisions. In reality, two major elements were missing in the reform: revelation and authority, the Lord’s only way to communicate divine truth to mankind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-message-of-the-restoration.p13" pid="q8466lXT8kyk7JScr14AhQ" hash="8cK4yQ">As we continue to move rapidly along this time line of religious history, we find a date and a name. The date is 1820; the name is Joseph Smith. Pondering about the total religious confusion and church division of his time, this young man asked himself, “If any one of [these churches] be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.10" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:10</a>). Why such confusion? The prophetic model was to ask of God. Religious history suddenly repeated itself according to God’s scenario of how to answer mankind’s <span class="emphasis">whys.</span> Once again a vision came as an answer, this time a vision of the Father and the Son. Once again a divine testimony of the Father was given: <span class="emphasis">“This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!”</span> (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.17" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:17</a>). Once again direct revelation answered Joseph Smith’s question: “Which of all the [churches] was right … and which I should join. I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.18-19" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:18–19</a>). Once again apostasy was declared from the source of truth—by Jesus Christ Himself. And once again it had to be followed by a restoration, and indeed it was.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-message-of-the-restoration.p14" pid="0QQbdBFyLUmv9GCdNju_hg" hash="2c9PfA">In the following years, by revelation, Joseph Smith received full divine doctrinal knowledge and the authority and the keys of the priesthood. Finally in 1830, the Church of Jesus Christ, with all the doctrines of salvation and the ordinances thereof, was restored. Joseph Smith qualified to be called the prophet of the Restoration in modern times.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/the-message-of-the-restoration.p15" pid="3kutXEbutEKjsq_EvRcfDQ" hash="2V8nvQ">As the Bible is the tangible evidence of divine revelation to the prophets of ancient times, in the same way the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is also the modern convincing evidence that Joseph Smith was a prophet receiving revelation and authority as they did. A testimony of the veracity of the Book of Mormon helps people to find an answer to <span class="emphasis">why</span> the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ have been restored by a prophet and <span class="emphasis">why</span> we have a living prophet today, namely Gordon B. Hinckley. It also answers the ultimate <span class="emphasis">why:</span> all the ordinances of the gospel provide the greatest blessing to prepare our salvation and to fulfill our mortal purpose to create eternal families. This message of the Restoration is true because it is divine.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p1" pid="NwC8nwqVxUKfbZwCpZc5qg" hash="92H7qg">Among this vast audience tonight are three special guests—three dear old school friends. They made a long trip from Belgium, my native country, to be here to celebrate the 50th anniversary of our high school graduation and to attend this conference. To them, to you priesthood holders, and especially to you young men preparing to become missionaries, I dedicate this message. It is about man’s search for divine truth. Once found, it is to be applied in this world of increased religious confusion and moral decadence. It must become the personal spiritual foundation that leads us to live according to the principles of righteousness. As the Lord said, “In righteousness shalt thou be established” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/22.14" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 22:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p2" pid="aDjANoY3d0ue2w-wFBNeTg" hash="kKyN3A">Where is divine truth to be found? It is to “hear the voice of the Lord, … [hear] the voice of His servants, … give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:14</a>). Hear and heed. To hear is relatively simple. To heed and apply what is heard becomes life’s perpetual challenge.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p3" pid="CiF2FHyTF0OpFpcMDS5tFg" hash="_4oeaw">First, hear the voice of the Lord. Communication from the Lord about divine truth or spiritual knowledge is found in the scriptures. It is called revelation—literally, “to make known or uncover” (Bible Dictionary, “Revelation,” 762). It is given to “know how to worship, and know what you worship” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:19</a>). Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, “Only with revelation can we do the Lord’s work according to His will in His way and according to His timing” (“Revelation,” <span class="emphasis">First Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</span> Jan. 2003, 5). “Without revelation, all would be guesswork, darkness, and confusion” (Bible Dictionary, 762).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p4" pid="ZLajUuaB5UOY-44g2ri55g" hash="AFFeFQ">Second, hear the voice of His servants. Revelation or divine truth is given by the will of the Lord to His servants in different ways and times and is also found in the scriptures. “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Amos 3:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p5" pid="fIQoK7cvzUqYf0xM_bs4Mg" hash="HVp0Cg">Third, give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles. To give heed is to pay special attention. It is to listen to those who have been called by God to be the especial living witnesses of Jesus Christ for our time. It implies that they are recognized in this role, that a response is given to their invitation to receive a personal spiritual confirmation that their teachings are true, and that a commitment to follow them will be made.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p6" pid="65UF5wt8tUGQLxf4wk61Vg" hash="Ahdq5A">In summary, the Lord has a pattern of sharing divine truth with prophets to guide and bless us through the challenges and evils of life: hear and heed. Our personal spiritual foundation needs to be built upon this pattern if we want to enjoy the blessings of the Lord. So it is not enough to search the scriptures to know the mind of the Lord. It must be followed by an act of faith, accepting to do the will of the Lord by obeying His commandments, before we can enjoy the blessings of the Lord. A personal spiritual confirmation of this process by asking and believing that we will receive becomes, then, the prayer of our lifetime.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p7" pid="NDmSPSg72UiqlrzhOJUOtQ" hash="TEVwbA">In reality, the communication or hearing about divine truth can be summarized in three words: revelation, commandments, blessings. However, it is going to be a lifetime challenge to first hear and then heed the voice of the Lord and His servants. Why? “For the natural man is an enemy to God … and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>). Spiritual preparation is a prerequisite to receive a personal spiritual impression. The rest of the verse reads that we must become “a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord” and also become “as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to” the will of the Lord, meaning His commandments. Then says the Lord, “When we obtain any blessing … , it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:21</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p8" pid="dQP6sLMjd0ShXhySQPDFXg" hash="oStU6Q">Let us now understand this pattern with a recent example of hearing and then giving heed to the words of the prophets and apostles of our time. The First Presidency recently extended an invitation to all members of the Church to read the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ before the end of the year. The challenge ended with a promise: “[You] will be blessed with an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a greater resolve to obey His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (First Presidency letter, July 25, 2005).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p9" pid="tZXTJB4_HkqDrmwuJrS1xA" hash="MMAIhg">Why would we need to grow a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God as found in the Book of Mormon? Today there is much confusion in the Christian world about the doctrine of Christ—not only about His divine nature but even about His Atonement and Resurrection, His gospel, and especially the commandments related to it. The result is a belief in a self-made-man Christ, a popular Christ, and a silent, crucified Christ. Wrong religious beliefs lead to wrong religious behaviors.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p10" pid="8ZJ_nJBFJEuYNM2tBW8Fvg" hash="kV8RmQ">A personal spiritual foundation can and must rely on a personal spiritual confirmation by the Holy Ghost of the living reality of Jesus Christ, the prophets, and the scriptures containing the revelations of the Lord. More specifically, the living reality of Christ is associated with the Restoration of His gospel and its message “that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith is his revelator and prophet in these last days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s kingdom once again established on the earth” (Book of Mormon introduction).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p11" pid="WMvTzM_O0EiY8NTAUVV0KQ" hash="85XoBw">This spiritual confirmation by the power of the Holy Ghost is given on the Lord’s conditions to anyone who is willing to ask in faith, believing that an answer can come by that power. It starts by listening to the voice of the Lord, His servants, His prophets and apostles, and it continues by giving heed to their words. Spiritual knowledge of the Restoration is a matter of faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p12" pid="3HANbO3LK0-7oYCjxw63gw" hash="e58nig">May I share my personal spiritual experience as a convert, as an example of this spiritual process. When the missionaries came to our home, I had the desire to listen to the message of the Restoration of the gospel. My motivation was mainly curiosity. Attending church, I heard more new spiritual knowledge. It was interesting and I liked it, but I was missing the essential: giving heed. I had to build a personal spiritual foundation upon the living reality of Christ and the confirmation that Joseph Smith was the prophet of the Restoration. That confirmation came only when I gave heed and tested my beginning faith in the Book of Mormon, the physical evidence of modern revelation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p13" pid="o5iclEojNECId9A4sl1nqQ" hash="qtvOIw">However, acquiring that knowledge was not enough; it had to be followed by a commitment to transform my faith into certainty that the Book of Mormon was true and so was Joseph Smith as a prophet. My faith in Christ had never been in question. I trusted the Lord and His promises. Peace in my mind, inner peace, was the answer—no more questions. The spiritual foundation was set and followed by a commitment in my heart to accept the covenant of baptism. Then came the gift of the Holy Ghost to guide me and help me make righteous decisions to endure to the end. I knew from then on what to do with my future in this mortal life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p14" pid="prbGi15xOEm-SPe43MWUUw" hash="4CtAkw">Test divine revelation. Hear the voice of the Lord. It is real; it is personal; it is true. Reason does not and cannot replace revelation. Quoting President James E. Faust, “Do not let your private doubts separate you from the divine source of knowledge” (“Lord, I Believe; Help Thou Mine Unbelief,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2003, 22).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p15" pid="kHRPS2DdoE2uZmT4y2kU6w" hash="O5k5PQ">Test and feel the powerful effect of the word of God upon your mind as given by the Lord’s servants (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/31.5" class="scriptureRef">Alma 31:5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p16" pid="jL16tGuas0uGqwGV5hO3ow" hash="Cild7Q">Test, ask and receive in faith, then give heed to the words of prophets and apostles, and you will “receive a crown of eternal life” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p17" pid="jJzCLjC9xk2YYXdTzWFJUA" hash="QJysyA">Now, just remember, in conclusion, that following the Lord’s pattern to hear and give heed to divine truth will help you build a personal spiritual foundation and determine what you will become in this life and in the life hereafter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/mans-search-for-divine-truth.p18" pid="907KMoeVA02Ks3bu0kH3qg" hash="K0efJw">In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
