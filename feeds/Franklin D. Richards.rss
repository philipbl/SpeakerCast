      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p2" guid="e828492b-0571-444a-a236-1e8c282cb94f" pid="FDLCDVuxvkqKBLEBtNnoNw" hash="vkkhig">Regardless of the difficulties existing in the world today, we as a people must recognize that we have been blessed abundantly with the resources of this world; yet we know that whatever we have is the Lord’s and that he has blessed us with these things to see how we will use them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p3" guid="9646271e-fb7e-49b4-b2d4-b7547efd4b0e" pid="8tlsojZ8a0WSLb_mX8HzXg" hash="tlJxMQ">I think it might be said, Life is God’s greatest gift to man, and what we do with our life is our gift to God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p4" guid="fc4272fc-fc65-4b4f-b433-535c9f0be0ec" pid="BACoG_R5Z06gmcmIc4yVBA" hash="nMg2hQ">President Brigham Young, in referring to making our life a gift to God, had this to say: “Our religion is worth everything to us and for it we should be willing to employ our time, our talent, our means, our energies, our lives.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>vol. 11, p. 119.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p5" guid="07ac89b4-286b-48c6-b334-c1c747aa898f" pid="L_xFqwA49EeT2AacZx6GYg" hash="1rpJzA">And, “If we do right, there will be an eternal increase among this people in talent, strength and intellect, and earthly wealth, from this time, henceforth, and forever.” (<span class="emphasis">JD, </span>vol. 1, p. 110.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p6" guid="33e4bfe1-1c87-4305-b95c-8200fd385a82" pid="foNmMRkEeUavaQlNP4xFCw" hash="pzaBFw">“No blessing that is sealed upon us will do us any good unless we live for it.” (<span class="emphasis">JD, </span>vol. 11, p. 117.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p7" guid="e4eacaec-7d14-4fde-bd59-d75a066bf73f" pid="puvnmxvhP0ejYadSSGOOoQ" hash="qsxpXQ">It is interesting to note that here, as elsewhere in the scriptures, promises of earthly wealth and increased talents are made to those who live the gospel principles, and counsel is given to use our talents and wealth for the building of the kingdom. Many scriptures, however, contain words of admonition regarding temptations brought about through the acquisition of wealth and its use for unrighteous purposes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p8" guid="3017acb6-5c9f-434d-bdb5-b7cb4d92cadd" pid="8l56jj35rE-dKB-yehImCw" hash="qOvNAQ">The great apostle Paul, in writing to his beloved associate Timothy, told him that “the love of money is the root of all evil,” and to “charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute. …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/6.10,17-18" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 6:10, 17–18</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p9" guid="462a81d3-fc9f-415d-8a3a-e4e30c8eb8aa" pid="qW6BthSckk-e0QLdBuyeLg" hash="U89MlQ">Throughout the history of the Church its leaders have taught the value of the principles of work, industry, and thrift; and as they have been practiced, Church members have prospered in numerous ways. Likewise, members have been counseled to establish and maintain their economic independence, and employment-creating industries have been encouraged.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p10" guid="9e808852-1f23-4e89-91ba-e0ecc4f4ccd1" pid="OXtpblRjuEWOo56Tr99kfg" hash="PoKsLw">In furtherance of these teachings, every man who has property and means should live so as to obtain wisdom to know how to use them in the best possible way to produce the greatest amount of good for himself, for his family, for his fellowmen, and for the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p11" guid="75f692ce-a9d2-4698-aace-27c623f17916" pid="eBQfKdUZyEutqdRE9wPLmA" hash="gP_J2A">Again quoting from President Young: “When this people are prepared to properly use the riches of this world for the building up of the Kingdom of God, He is ready and willing to bestow them upon us. I like to see men get rich by their industry, prudence, management and economy, and then devote it to the building up of the Kingdom of God upon the earth.” (<span class="emphasis">JD, </span>vol. 2, pp. 114–15.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p12" guid="f77236b6-1a47-40a2-b6fb-e724428988ea" pid="v8ELKMCTR02K19cAUxtkfQ" hash="-QcjVg">Andrew Carnegie, one of this country’s great philanthropists, stated his attitude toward wealth as follows: “This, then, is held to be the duty of the man of wealth: First, to set an example of modesty, unostentatious living, shunning display or extravagance; to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him; and after doing so to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds, which he is called upon to administer, and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which, in his judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community—the man of wealth thus becoming the mere trustee and agent for his poorer brethren, bringing to their service his superior wisdom, experience, and ability to administer, doing for them better than they would or could do for themselves.” (<span class="emphasis">The Gospel of Wealth.</span>)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p13" guid="69779be7-6b18-4893-9116-0e00999b8011" pid="50LHrg7X8U2jAFSZL0l2IQ" hash="MR60dQ">With this philosophy of wealth in mind, one might properly say, “What I am worth is what I am doing for other people.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p14" guid="e394dd53-b9be-49d1-b80d-4d89f2ca36e8" pid="s7RU-DXTFEyZqZNV22VWiw" hash="juqYFw">In many respects the real test of a man is his attitude toward his earthly possessions.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p15" guid="813a690f-a3f9-4504-9605-c51d2ac8ec05" pid="Rb5XIMEgOEOykOGDnj7kaw" hash="99-I7g">In line with this thinking, our business, then, should be to build the kingdom of God. Many of us have said, in our more generous and unselfish moments, “If I only had the wealth, I would build a beautiful church, provide a school for underprivileged children, supply a hospital where it is needed, etc.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p16" guid="4170fb8c-782a-4d05-8219-d02bdaf98665" pid="QyYBjP1fEkaqO4yfhVKnsw" hash="piZK5A">Probably few of us will have the great wealth needed to do any of these things by ourselves; nevertheless, each of us, as we have the desire, can have a share in such wonderful projects by our contributions, including the payment of our tithes and offerings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p17" guid="9438e51b-0cf0-43c7-996e-76b8f093aa3c" pid="AUqUiv4KKkih4c3V47tewg" hash="5giGUQ">Throughout the ages the Lord has commanded his people to remember the needy and to pay tithes and offerings for the purpose of building the kingdom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p18" guid="eb27c739-4b0c-4439-9bf7-7ff8921b487f" pid="nA7uOrNZJ06p_LENUQ_qgA" hash="ZH6EXQ">In this dispensation the Lord has revealed to us that “it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:23</a>.) I think it should be noted that a very substantial number are today honestly meeting this requirement. Yet, on the other hand, many are negligent in the payment of their tithes and offerings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p19" guid="b5b6318e-bf76-4c67-a009-0501aeac7a1d" pid="t4HMC7mBUEyOpWke4FZ9vA" hash="gWH1jQ">The Lord has said: “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p20" guid="db76ce28-63be-4b8d-a9f9-9c3745200c68" pid="EJ2ZGUulhEWk3cd1203Iuw" hash="kpxcVw">“Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse … and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.8,10" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:8, 10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p21" guid="58df1db2-c713-4886-ac3d-fc39f480b468" pid="-hce2B3y4Uujy9eG8oCfpQ" hash="cj2rMw">Tithes are sacred funds, and the Lord in this dispensation has revealed that tithing “shall be disposed of by a council, composed of the First Presidency of my Church, and of the bishop and his council, … and by mine own voice unto them, saith the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/120.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 120:1</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p22" guid="3170fdc6-38e8-4b02-ba1d-ae58596d2575" pid="_lcx2gC-T0-bON8XlF3WBQ" hash="vXFEsA">With the accelerated growth of the Church throughout the world, more and more buildings and facilities are required—chapels, schools, seminaries, temples, hospitals, mission homes, visitors centers, and many other buildings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p23" guid="e5fd5be4-9b36-4c24-b910-1db75a241c6f" pid="6JNTL7RDQEaHd689Y68MKw" hash="8RH--A">Not only does the construction of these new church facilities require the expenditure of large sums of capital, but the operation and maintenance of these buildings become heavy financial responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p24" guid="66c3e69e-7fcb-47f1-b0bc-5a0849ca1ac2" pid="cGLGu6JOoU-v-nxkfCrAug" hash="rgUH4Q">The Church is designed to take care of the spiritual and temporal needs of its members, both living and dead; and the pattern encompasses programs such as educational, missionary, welfare, auxiliary, social services, genealogical, and many others. These programs functioning on a worldwide basis likewise require great financial assistance.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p25" guid="d80fb095-7f9b-4804-baf2-d09d18a204bc" pid="qvwbp_jY20igndd4HcjWPA" hash="AgXebw">We have been looking to this day for more than one hundred years, and I am sure that as we keep the commandments of the Lord, he will open up the way whereby we can meet the financial obligations relative to the growth and development of the Church, as well as our own responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p26" guid="369848d3-3602-4d6f-a692-3a4c13402a05" pid="52-1ftFHTUeQkioYmfqKWg" hash="49bEzA">The apostle Paul, in writing to the Corinthian Saints, told them that “he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p27" guid="2381c07d-4637-4985-b25f-7161ed5b6555" pid="ezGxyBzT4UWd6utXmsCFhw" hash="0F7FAQ">“Let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/9.6-7" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 9:6–7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p28" guid="9f7fcd37-1e98-473c-a0ea-d6c27aac61f3" pid="17_WPrLfsEew5sMExNWE8g" hash="KfSr_w">In this dispensation the Lord has said, “Thou shalt not covet thine own property, but impart it freely.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:26</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p29" guid="51d562a0-ae84-4660-9044-61ae27e40b4c" pid="RttfNoEntE--UnfrPeXj0A" hash="grcfrA">As we consider ourselves trustees of wealth for the benefit of God’s children, we should not worship property, whether it be of great or small value. If we are guilty of worshiping property, then we have need to repent and straighten out our values.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p30" guid="eb912f27-c996-41c8-abb8-af5b0c6c9e5c" pid="SrcHCthn20uUmMjoUNis7w" hash="17dSiw">A person who places the wealth of this world in the scales against the things of God evidences little understanding of eternal values.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p31" guid="863db283-107c-4e99-ab40-1e6b2d427a44" pid="vL2x3KG-3U24dCJNkRWlyg" hash="3mJ1Gw">We talk about making sacrifices to build the kingdom of God, but the word to me is a misnomer—to be able to participate in building the kingdom is a great privilege and blessing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p32" guid="c294aa53-a066-44f5-8920-ea85d12fbfc3" pid="4375Vww-FkS6qvvTsALc4Q" hash="dfKv2w">Recently I dedicated a beautiful little chapel, and at that time I was told that in order to pay the balance of the ward’s share of the construction cost ($5,000), the bishop had asked all members to limit Christmas presents to small children and to donate the amount thus saved to the building fund. The members responded beautifully, considering this an opportunity to receive a blessing rather than as a sacrifice, and at the dedicatory service many bore witness to this effect.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p33" guid="37969298-13ba-40e5-97f8-ef8fdf824ca1" pid="5Hau9-sPdUKH9HfNIlNAPg" hash="cBzA5w">As long as one is honest with the Lord, the amount paid is not material. The widow’s or child’s mite is as important and acceptable as the rich man’s offerings. When men, women, and children are honest with God and pay their tithes and offerings, the Lord gives them wisdom whereby they can do as much or more with the remainder than they could if they had not been honest with the Lord. Many times they are blessed and prospered in various ways—spiritually, physically, and mentally, as well as materially. I bear my witness to you that this is true, and I am sure that many of you can bear such a testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p34" guid="d1ec929f-e10d-4550-bf3d-534739670be1" pid="wMJyOo7JLUeWEXjWZlfU9w" hash="a3w6hA">Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/20.35" class="scriptureRef">Acts 20:35</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p35" guid="2aeab476-affd-487a-92d0-f7453449ace1" pid="HBZXt_ZqU0OxM7fEJvPuIg" hash="DwZy1A">What are riches for, then? To be used in doing good. Therefore, let us dedicate our means to the building of the kingdom of God. Let us this day resolve to be honest with the Lord in the payment of our tithes and offerings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p36" guid="e2828fab-bdc7-4a10-83d9-e5d9c89c8532" pid="N4JXoeL5vEanZI23KA9ewQ" hash="RHOEEw">I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, and this is far more important than earthly riches.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p37" guid="04b4af78-7687-49fc-8f32-f1c3aac90f2c" pid="GgSzCewyH06OA3oEkCDLmQ" hash="DQu1Qw">And I know that the gospel in its fullness has been restored in this dispensation through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and that there is a living prophet at the head of the Church today, President Joseph Fielding Smith. This is likewise of more value than any amount of earthly wealth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p38" guid="9954f424-670b-4a4e-b4f4-b70c5acdfbc9" pid="JwwM3J9n00euFsPCgJX2ww" hash="xOMmlA">However, a testimony alone will not save us. It is the keeping of the commandments of God—living the life of a true Latter-day Saint. It is important, then, to appreciate that the gospel has to be lived in order to be fully realized and its power received.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/04/the-law-of-abundance.p39" guid="f206ccb9-4667-4cbe-879b-1a37d74d7c59" pid="3P3TrQM7UkeNRcTWawbM5w" hash="o1NMdw">Therefore, let us dispense the means which the Lord has given us to enrich the lives of others who are less fortunate than we are and to build the kingdom of God, that we may make of our life a good gift to God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

The Lord instructed the Prophet to assemble at least one hundred young and middle-aged men and to go to the land of Zion, or Missouri. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.19-34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:19–34</a>.)</p>

By the time they reached Missouri, the camp had increased to approximately two hundred men.</p>

A brother in Kirtland who did not go with the camp, meeting Brigham Young upon his return, said to him, “Well, what did you gain on this useless journey to Missouri with Joseph Smith?” “All we went for,” replied Brigham Young. “I would not exchange the experience I gained in that expedition for all the wealth of Geauga County,” the county in which Kirtland was then located. (B. H. Roberts, “Brigham Young, A Character Sketch,” <span class="emphasis">Improvement Era, </span>vol. 6 [June 1903], p. 567.)</p>

There were hardships and disappointments, but these experiences had real value because from this group many became the leaders in the exodus of 12,000 people from Missouri to Nauvoo, and then later many became leaders in the great western exodus from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley.</p>

The Prophet explained that the trials and tribulations endured by the members of Zion’s Camp were not in vain, and it was the will of God “that those who went to Zion, with a determination to lay down their lives, if necessary, should be ordained to the ministry, and go forth to prune the vineyard for the last time.” (<span class="emphasis">Documentary History of the Church, </span>vol. 2, p. 182.)</p>

The Saints had been persecuted, robbed, and murdered. The Prophet and his associates had been betrayed and were imprisoned in Liberty Jail. Dissension and apostasy were rampant, and the Church appeared to be faced with disintegration and ruin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-purpose-of-life-to-be-proved.p18" guid="bb3ab945-8285-4741-8ae9-70e0df877141" pid="scnzo7FZZk26aVDjeZPktw" hash="gct6hQ">But emerging from this dark period were the men who led the Church through trying experiences as well as amazing growth and development. But this was not all. It was during these dark days that the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith, while in Liberty Jail, a great revelation. Liberty Jail for a time became a center of instruction.</p>

Roberts, in the <span class="emphasis">Comprehensive History of the Church, </span>has this to say: “The eyes of the saints were turned to it (Liberty Jail) as the place whence would come encouragement, counsel—the word of the Lord. It was more temple than prison, so long as the Prophet was there. It was a place of meditation and prayer. A temple, first of all, is a place of prayer; and prayer is communion with God. It is the ‘infinite in man seeking the infinite in God.’ Where they find each other, there is holy sanctuary—a temple. Joseph Smith sought God in this rude prison, and found him. Out of the midst of his tribulations he called upon God in passionate earnestness.” (Vol. 1, p. 526.)</p>

His reply was, “I teach the people correct principles and they govern themselves.” (Recalled by John Taylor, <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>vol. 10, pp. 57–58.) The doctrine of righteous dominion so beautifully described in the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants is a good example of how the members of the Church are taught correct principles that enable them to govern themselves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1971/10/the-purpose-of-life-to-be-proved.p28" guid="78e707e0-1780-4f48-9f4c-df61b41cf268" pid="EGLABcwANkSdgFfcWCAd8w" hash="NPPGHA">We believe that one of the important purposes of this life is to be proved, tried, and tested. Both the Zion’s Camp and Liberty Jail experiences truly constituted a refiner’s fire for those who participated in them, and they emphasize the necessity of experiencing difficult and complex situations in life in order to properly develop and draw close to our Heavenly Father. These experiences certainly give us a better understanding and appreciation of the greatness of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the early leaders of the Church.</p>

Let us avoid setting our hearts upon the things of the world, and as we exercise our priesthood, let us incorporate the great principle of righteous dominion. By so doing and keeping the commandments of the Lord, we shall have joy, happiness, growth, and development and “eternal life, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>.)</p>

I know that President Joseph Fielding Smith is God’s mouthpiece on the earth today, and may the Lord bless and sustain him in his most important calling.</p>

May we meet them successfully, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Make a decision and then ask the Lord if your decision is right; if so, you will receive a burning of your bosom or a good feeling; if not, you will receive a stupor of thought or a questionable feeling.

Our prayers should simply be our soul’s sincere desire. In our church worship there are only three set prayers: the baptismal and two sacramental prayers.

That is the way that we ought to do, and cultivate a spirit of devotion and trust in God, dedicating ourselves to him, and seeking his blessings.” (<span class="emphasis">JD, </span>vol. 21, p. 118.)</p>

However, it is most important to remember that our attitude and approach in prayer should be similar to that of the Savior, in one of his last prayers in which he said, “Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup [ordeal] from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.” Three times he prayed in this manner. And then “there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.42-43" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:42–43</a>.)</p>

Roberts, in his letter of release to me, promised me that I would “find new beginnings from time to time … even more missions.” As I left the mission field I prayed fervently and at length that this promise might be fulfilled. Twenty-four years later it was partially fulfilled when I was called to be the stake mission president of the East Mill Creek Stake. At that time Elder Gordon B. Hinckley was president of that stake, and also at that time President Harold B. Lee gave me a beautiful blessing as he set me apart.</p>

We felt otherwise, and as President McKay set me apart, he promised me that it would be the happiest time of our lives. And it was, because our entire time was spent in serving our fellowmen. And we remembered the words of King Benjamin, “… when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:17</a>.)</p>

We will ever be indebted to him and thankful to him for asking us what we knew about the Mormon Church and would we like to know more. Through the missionary discussions we were thoroughly convinced that this was the true church.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p2" pid="-JiOZ6YNcEuClmU5xoDpdA" hash="ELr18g">From the Passover feast of 19 centuries ago came this great message of promise and exhortation from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>.) There is so much conflict and contention in the world today that the subject of peace seems most appropriate for me to discuss.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p3" pid="edFRk5U-Gk2_0LOhHaIpCQ" hash="l-ezEQ">There can be no real happiness without peace, yet honest men and women in all parts of the world are seeking personal peace and know not where to find it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p4" pid="GGmfIOwQRUKVP3EGRd1v1A" hash="5ojvww">Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is called the Prince of Peace, and his message is a message of peace to the individual and to the world. It is the peace that makes us really appreciate mortal life and enables us to bear heartbreaking tribulations.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p5" pid="F8xkAPTRz0uXpQBqijXoWA" hash="YGWCWg">The mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to establish this peace in the hearts and homes of the people. A recent letter from our grandson who is serving a mission in Brazil bears this out as he relates how a convert of one month spoke at a sacrament meeting. He said, “Just a month in the Church and he is in the pulpit expounding on the parable of the sower. The greatest joy of missionary work is to see the changes the gospel makes in the lives of people.” This is so true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p6" pid="QAvnlG2tAkS9idUffJKpqg" hash="kujqlQ">I have listened to hundreds of converts bear their testimonies, and practically every one has related how the gospel has brought peace, joy, growth, and development into their lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p7" pid="UpyA1K2Bs0yEQRe3wS7mWw" hash="UJKuFw">Undoubtedly one of the greatest messages given by our Lord and Savior was the Sermon on the Mount. This message contained the Savior’s plan for the abundant life. In it he admonished all to be peacemakers as he said, “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p8" pid="Dg2YyjrbSkCsuFvj-9vFiw" hash="xe4JIw">Have you ever wondered how you can be a peacemaker? Really, our opportunities are unlimited.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p9" pid="6d0xkDM5LkiCcbolRkJMuA" hash="F-nUgg">Certainly in our homes we can all be peacemakers by exhibiting love and goodwill, thus offsetting the evil of contention, envy, and jealousy. Where misunderstandings exist between children and parents, we can encourage adjustments on the part of both. We can pray together for the spirit of peace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p10" pid="Gut67GQnNEajCjWMNfL7lA" hash="suExVQ">We can be a peacemaker by avoiding criticism. Remember that Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount said, “Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/7.1-2" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 7:1–2</a>.) Did you ever stop to think that every time you criticize you are judging?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p11" pid="LwLz80LgrUa21iZ7PuLTLQ" hash="ILt-qw">We can be a peacemaker by practicing and teaching forgiveness. Jesus was asked how many times one should be forgiven, and he replied that we should forgive without limit. Forgive him “seventy times seven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.22" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:22</a>.) An important part of forgiving is forgetting. In some ways, being able to forget is almost as valuable as being able to remember.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p12" pid="nFIal9XBJkaqWcgnSnnoVA" hash="R3JybA">In dedicating the Hyde Park chapel in London, among other things, President David O. McKay said, “If you want peace, yours is the responsibility to obtain it. The Restored Gospel teaches that our homes should become warm nests where children may be protected and grow into noble men and women; where … old age [may find] repose; where prayer will find an altar.” (<span class="emphasis">Church News,</span> 11 Mar. 1961, p. 15.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p13" pid="hN7PgfzSvkuarYKLxayZaA" hash="cFPPPA">A very wise bishop called several young people into his office and said to them, “I would like you to help me in an experiment. I would like to prove the impact and influence of one member on the spirit of the family. For one month I would like each one of you to be the peacemaker in your home. Now don’t say anything about this to your family, but be thoughtful, kind, and considerate. Be an example. Where there is quarreling or bickering among members of your family, do whatever you can to overcome these faults by creating an atmosphere of love, harmony, and happiness.</p>

I would like to see every home in our ward be as President McKay counseled, ‘a warm nest or a bit of heaven on earth.’ At the end of the month I would like you to meet with me again and report.”</p>

It’s really been different this last month. I’ve been wondering if much of the turmoil and strife we used to have was caused by me and my attitudes.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p17" pid="i2sLkWSbY0e9iTilU_vVbA" hash="WuTCSw">A young lady said, “I guess we were just the normal family, with our selfishness causing little daily conflicts, but as I have worked with my brothers and sisters, a lot of this has been eliminated and there has been a much sweeter spirit in our home. I believe you really have to work at it to have the spirit of peace in your home.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p18" pid="rP8c3FoLYUSSP3h7O88jyA" hash="KgHWFg">Another young lady reported, “Yes, there has been a much sweeter, cooperative, and unselfish spirit in our home since I began this experiment, but the biggest difference of all has been in me. I’ve tried hard to be a good example and a peacemaker, and I feel better about myself than I have ever felt. A wonderful feeling of peace has come over me.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p19" pid="_UjW3sgY-km0hZwdQvZF-g" hash="YNRy1g">Yes, homes can be disrupted because of family strife. Husbands and wives in an atmosphere of contention destroy their own happiness as well as that of their children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p20" pid="1z2C5qgRIU-KH7uDFNieMg" hash="ylR7Hg">Are you shutting out of your life the peace and security you so much desire? Thousands of people are doing so because they are so filled with worries, doubts, and concerns. Many people are filled with fears about what will become of them as they grow older. I met a lovely lady in her 80s working in the temple. The spirit of peace and tranquillity radiated from her. She was so busy helping others that she had little concern for herself. Her needs were not great, and as she said, “The Lord is taking care of my needs.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p21" pid="u9W9H4YLnkmy59QcUuNR1g" hash="7-q2fg">The Lord tells us, “But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:23</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p22" pid="kNuXrPzXJ0eraYbBriRyoQ" hash="wWFlog">Yes, the Lord will take care of our needs and help us overcome those things that worry us when we do our part, put our faith and trust in him, and concern ourselves with serving him by serving our fellowmen. I’ve seen this in my own life, in the lives of those close to me, and in the lives of hundreds of others all over the world. It is the only way to personal peace, that peace that is not of this world and is beyond our understanding and comprehension, but yet so sweet to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/the-blessings-of-peace.p23" pid="XtucN9H_z0yQZ1gB82Kjaw" hash="IAaU0g">Possibly there is a greater need of peacemakers today than ever before. If this world had no need of peacemakers, our Savior never would have said, “<span class="emphasis">Blessed</span> are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.9" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:9</a>.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-message-of-easter.p3" pid="1FgfUGaKNUGu8FQdg1wNCA" hash="V13piA">Easter time is indeed a forceful reminder that the human spirit cannot be confined. It does not deny the reality of death, but it offers us an assurance that God has preserved life beyond the grave.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-message-of-easter.p4" pid="iIQPV0jVI0qFE1A1x9DS3A" hash="5cBwig">It is interesting to note, however, that the restored gospel as taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encompasses the belief of a literal resurrection, which is radically different from the concept taught by most Christian churches and other faiths.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-message-of-easter.p5" pid="RV_T4M68EkefuF1mSpIXKA" hash="Y-7RmQ">President Grant often told how several hundred ministers were asked, “Do you believe that after you die you will live again as a conscious entity, knowing and being known as you are?” No doubt all of these ministers had conducted Easter services, but in answering, none actually believed in a literal resurrection as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches.</p>

But neither can man explain how life came to be; but who denies that we live? If we gave up everything we cannot explain, we would have to give up life.</p>

We came to this earth for our spirits to receive bodies of flesh and bones and to receive experiences, to see if we would do all things whatsoever the Lord should command us.</p>

At death the spirit leaves our earthly body until the morning of the resurrection.</p>

Growth is a problem we can enjoy solving.</p>

I would like to suggest that one very effective way to lengthen our stride is to start working with groups of prospective elders and others rather than individuals.</p>

In such cases it would be appropriate for the elders quorum president to request the ward mission leader to have the stake or full-time missionaries teach the nonmember wives with the cooperation and in the presence of the inactive husbands. Of course, the home teachers should continue the fellowshipping of these families.</p>

I have also experienced better results when working with groups that are compatible insofar as their age, education, and interests are concerned. With a little effort it is generally possible to get them together in compatible groups.</p>

I recall listening to thrilling stories where prospective elders and new converts were assigned jobs such as to raise and lower the chapel flag each day, or to keep the songbooks in repair, or to act as an assistant secretary in the elders quorum; and in each instance, the persons involved were happy and received worthwhile experiences.</p>

It is our responsibility to set an example in our own homes and as home teachers to encourage and motivate our families to do likewise. All of you who are holding family home evenings can testify that there is greater love between the parents, between the parents and the children, and between the children. Let us continue to emphasize this inspired family home night program.</p>

Members of the majority groups are responsible to accept the minority groups living within their area and to provide full fellowship and encouragement in Church participation so that they can receive the blessings resulting from such activity. Church organizations will also encourage and assist minority people to accept the majority and to join with them. The First Presidency, in a letter dated October 10, 1972, and now being reissued, outlines basic principles to guide us in this area.</p>

In the military, there are many strong Church members that set a course of righteousness and follow it, and, in addition, find time to share with others and provide examples of courage and integrity for many who sorely need that assistance. Yes, in the far reaches of distant lands, home teaching is faithfully performed. We are vitally interested in and proud of the examples and contributions of our faithful members in the military service.</p>

Why? Because it has the potential to meet all of their needs, whether they be religious, social, educational, recreational, or individual needs. Most important of all, the Young Adult program changes lives. I have seen many quiet, reserved people, who might have otherwise gone unnoticed, accept callings of responsibility and blossom into outstanding leaders. Indeed, it is an inspired program.”</p>

I asked this young man if he was going on a mission, and he replied, “That’s what I’m saving my money for.” I am sure that with this type of planning he will be worthy to be ordained an elder and prepared for missionary service.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/perfecting-the-saints.p28" pid="-ERmn12ozEWcsrn9tRLr8A" hash="mxopJQ">Excellent results have been achieved by many elders quorums in teaching temple project groups. Retreats for prospective elders and their wives with home teachers or quorum officers and their wives have developed friendships and spirituality that have changed many lives forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/perfecting-the-saints.p29" pid="P-4hrR8QBUGptS69EnrKaQ" hash="EnUDnQ">Just a few days ago a man and his wife, neighbors of ours who have just been involved in such a temple project group, told us that the results were far beyond their expectations. This particular prospective elder had previously been reluctant but is now preparing to take his family to the temple. They were greatly impressed by the spirit of caring shown by the brothers and sisters involved in the teaching process.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/perfecting-the-saints.p30" pid="7hcMWS3Q9kq1pP5PITOeMg" hash="hddPBg">Many prospective elders are married to nonmember wives. These cases provide an excellent opportunity for the elders quorum president to arrange for the ward mission leader to assign stake or full-time missionaries to teach the nonmember wives, with the cooperation and in the presence of the inactive husbands.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/perfecting-the-saints.p32" pid="7IJptG4mWEW5_w__0TTwqw" hash="JDqR9A">We should involve prospective elders in Church activities, even though at first assignments may be of a minor nature. I recall listening to thrilling reports from prospective elders and new converts who were assigned jobs to raise and lower the chapel flag each day, or to keep the songbooks in repair, or to assist quorum officers. In each instance the persons involved were happy and had very worthwhile experiences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/perfecting-the-saints.p33" pid="QF5Fq-TTwkac6BL1f_S_cQ" hash="GNIAjQ">In conclusion let me share with you some of the feelings of a prospective elder who has recently come into full Church activity. He writes: “Returning to church activity after years of absence would have been impossible without a lot of help. I’ll always be grateful for that evening when my elders quorum president came to my home and said, ‘Roger, starting next Sunday evening we are having two other couples over to our home once a week to talk about some important gospel principles. We would be pleased if you and Pat would join us.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/perfecting-the-saints.p34" pid="kFGFgWEld0eZwqWGbIGtOg" hash="ecN1xg">“I know it took courage for him to invite us, but that was an important beginning. That was the first time anyone had ever asked me to get back into Church activity. In those fireside meetings my wife and I learned things about the gospel that we had never understood before. When testimonies were expressed, we felt feelings that had been dulled by many years of inactivity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/perfecting-the-saints.p35" pid="zdqwkrGSPEa3IBQYuAIBNg" hash="ecazvQ">“As we started having family prayers together, we felt a special spirit enter into our home. Before long I became so anxious to learn about the gospel that I found myself reading the scriptures on the bus going to and from work and even during my noon hour.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/perfecting-the-saints.p36" pid="04HZ327u1EyBD7C6Jvx1JQ" hash="Oz6MiQ">His letter then tells of the great joy he and his wife felt when they went to the temple, where they and their children were sealed together for time and for all eternity. And now they are helping prepare their three sons for missionary service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/perfecting-the-saints.p37" pid="NlnfaT8DQ0CHa4QOTkLLHA" hash="dfmIjw">To you who are not now involved in Church activity, we extend to you our love and want you to know how eager we are to share with you the blessings of the priesthood and the gospel. There will never be a better time than now to become active in the process of self-perfection. I promise you it will bring you peace, happiness, and joy, along with growth and development.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/perfecting-the-saints.p38" pid="VWj56-jHh0iqXlI4p3zmcg" hash="LuZdAQ">May all of us seek to perfect our lives in the pattern of the Savior, and may we help each other in the perfection process, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Ways must be found to increase the time missionaries spend in teaching. One of the best ways to do this is to make the “every member a missionary” program work more effectively, with the members finding and fellowshipping people for the missionaries to teach.</p>

          <p pid="6vzcm5Bmb0OUD391ix2uZA" hash="R6dM8A">Living the gospel principles. Thousands join the Church each year as they are attracted to the Church by the life of a good member.</p>

          <span class="label">2.</span>
          <p pid="j_Pc2GbEPkSeiayRClmNNg" hash="L1UQTA">Beginning a gospel conversation by asking your friends and neighbors what they know about the Church. Whether they know little or much, we can follow with another question: “Would you like to know more?” If they would like to know more, invite them into your home to be taught the gospel by the missionaries. If it is impossible to invite them into your home, send their names to the missionaries so that they can follow up. Many of these referrals can give the missionaries the names of other interested persons, and this can go on indefinitely, if pursued with enthusiasm.</p>

Thousands of our members have married nonmembers. Our goal is to fellowship these nonmembers, teach them and their families the missionary discussions, and, when they have received a testimony, bring them into the Church through the waters of baptism.</p>

Although we now have more than 25,000 full-time missionaries, young men and women and older couples are needed in greatly increased numbers as more and more missions are organized in many parts of the world. President Kimball has asked that more and better-prepared missionaries from overseas stakes and missions be called, and this is being accomplished. Since many of these missionaries, particularly those called from overseas areas, are not able to meet the entire cost of their missions, priesthood quorums and Church members can assist these missionaries by making contributions to the Church Missionary Fund.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p14" pid="qFViwwfPNkqPPegMJTIrzA" hash="dsMSxg">Recently, a quorum president, in sending in a contribution, closed his letter by saying, “We are thrilled with the progress reports we receive and hope we can be a part of an increased effort in sharing the gospel.”</p>

What greater work is there than this? I love the gospel and couldn’t live without it. I am so excited about the family fellowshipping missionary program. The Lord is leading me to families and also to single people—in fact, this Sunday several of them are coming to church with me.”</p>

It is recommended that each new convert be given a position in the Church, and many of these new converts would make excellent stake missionaries.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p18" pid="bJI2twNNLkuuTjgVf0k2fg" hash="I2qhWg">With the reorganization of the First Quorum of the Seventy by President Kimball last October, renewed emphasis has been placed on stake missionary work. The First Quorum of the Seventy has the responsibility to strengthen the quorums of seventies in the stakes and to promote the work of the stake missions. We are emphasizing the importance of these stake missionaries coordinating their missionary efforts with those of the full-time missionaries.</p>

It may surprise you to know there are some 20,000 members of the Church in the military service. These men and women can be, and many are, real missionaries. As they live their religion, they are respected and admired by their associates. This group can be instrumental in bringing untold numbers of converts into the Church and developing thousands of referrals each year for the missionaries.</p>

As these suggestions I have made and others are utilized, Church members can find the people for the missionaries to teach; and as they are being taught, the members can fellowship them before and after their baptism. And truly as the apostle Paul wrote to the Ephesians, “Ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/2.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 2:19</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1977/04/lengthening-your-stride-as-a-missionary.p23" pid="u5OFIwyAS0GEYh38JZ4G2g" hash="Js_RAw">My brothers and sisters, we are engaged in building the kingdom of God. I bear you my witness that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ did appear to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that God lives, and that Jesus is the Christ. The gospel in its fulness has been restored through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and it is our privilege and responsibility to share it with others. Joseph Smith was a great prophet, and we have a great prophet at the head of the Church today, our beloved President Spencer W. Kimball.</p>

Spencer Cornwall, commenting on this song, wrote: “To hear this loved song rendered by an assembly of devoted Latter-day Saints is a spiritual baptism.” (<span class="emphasis">Stories of Our Mormon Hymns,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1968, p. 108.) How true this is! This is one of our most popular hymns in which we express thanks for the atoning sacrifice of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>

W. Phelps’ inspiring hymns, is a magnificent tribute to the Prophet Joseph Smith. This beautiful hymn not only incorporates the elements of rejoicing and prophecy, but also contains basic doctrine, as is evidenced by the statement, “Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven.” The law of sacrifice is an important part of the gospel of Jesus Christ and contributes to the building of faith, love, and many other virtues.</p>

Millions shall know ‘brother Joseph’ again.” What a prophetic utterance! At the time Brother Phelps wrote the hymn, there was figuratively a handful of Church members. Now, millions <span class="emphasis">do</span> know that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God and millions more will undoubtedly obtain this testimony. I thrill every time I sing this tremendous hymn.</p>

The words to this hymn were written by William Fowler and published in 1863. This hymn basically acknowledges our thanks and gratitude to our Father in Heaven for restoring the gospel in its fulness and establishing His church with prophets to guide us in these latter days. This beautiful hymn is another of the most popular hymns as LDS congregations meet and sing in every part of the world.</p>

It is my understanding that this hymn has been sung at the dedicatory services of each of the LDS temples built since the Kirtland Temple dedication. It has, of course, been sung in many dedicatory services of ward and stake chapels.</p>

I would like to prove the impact and influence of one member on the spirit of the family. For one month, I would like each of you to be the peacemaker in your home. Don’t say anything about this to your family, but be thoughtful, kind, and considerate. Be an example.

The performance of these ordinances is possible because genealogical work and temple work are inseparably connected.

          <span class="strong">First, for the living:</span> For the living, such ordinances as baptism, the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, and the ordination to the priesthood may be performed in any proper place outside of a temple. However, through modern revelation we are told that certain ordinances such as the endowment, eternal marriage, sealing ordinances for both the living and the dead, and baptisms for the dead must be performed in a temple.</p>

This service is the source of eternal satisfaction. However, it is well to remember that vicarious service for the dead by the living does not affect the right of the dead to accept or reject such vicarious service.</p>

          <span class="strong">Third, as a retreat:</span> A temple is a retreat from the vicissitudes of life, a place of prayer and meditation providing an opportunity to receive inner peace, inspiration, guidance, and, frequently, solutions to the problems that vex our daily lives.</p>

It brings me a joy and satisfaction that is found in no other place. I feel a sense of accomplishment in doing something of eternal value. It’s a little like the work of the Savior, who did for mankind what they could not do for themselves. This work brings peace to my soul—yes, the peace that passeth understanding.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p1" pid="dPZihuj5pEKnPUQw9Gp0ZQ" hash="6LJTvQ">My dear brothers and sisters, as I have listened to the words of the Brethren this afternoon, much has been said about sacrifice. I couldn’t help but think of the words of that great hymn, “Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven” (“Praise to the Man,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 25).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p2" pid="PZu4JrAGjkSCb2UsFqxRJQ" hash="or_G3Q">I have always felt, however, that, really, it is impossible for us to sacrifice in building the kingdom of God. I would much rather consider it, instead of a sacrifice, a great opportunity to serve God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p3" pid="Atc7lZsJg0mXLxBhupE41Q" hash="o721ww">Sister Richards and I lived in Washington, D.C., for fifteen years. When we returned to Salt Lake City, we moved into the Mount Olympus area. Within a year or so, the East Millcreek Stake was divided, as I remember, and President Gordon B. Hinckley was called to be the president of the stake. I was called to be the stake mission president, and for three and a half years, I had the opportunity of serving under President Hinckley.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p4" pid="cQA0S9olpkmPseSQ6EcKGw" hash="SP-iVA">I was later called to be a full-time mission president, and then, twenty-seven years ago this conference, President N. Eldon Tanner, Elder Theodore M. Burton, and I were called to be General Authorities.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p5" pid="SRKwFqnorUuiZhVqo-u9fg" hash="PQIPng">My first assignment was supervising the nine missions on the East Coast from Canada to Florida for five years. That was a great experience. My next assignment was with President Spencer W. Kimball, who was then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, supervising South America.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p6" pid="X6FW0r96rUSIApp3bfFgTw" hash="NBlxPA">We organized the first stake in South America in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in May of 1966. As Elder Lynn A. Sorensen mentioned, the growth there has been tremendous. I remember that President Kimball said, “We’re not going to call any North Americans to the major leadership positions.” And there were many Latter-day Saints living in Sao Paulo at that time working in businesses associated with the United States. He said, “We’re going to call the local people.” And so our policy was to call local men and women to those positions and to be missionaries. At that time, in 1966, there were no stakes in South America, whereas now there are nearly two hundred stakes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p7" pid="ROmWHOrl3Uu0BZ8X-2ITgw" hash="v7xjuQ">I then had the opportunity to spend three years with Elder Delbert L. Stapley supervising the missions in Central America and Mexico. As I recall, there were two stakes in Mexico then, one in the Colonies and one in Mexico City. Now there are nearly a hundred stakes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p8" pid="FUtow1xIK0eYsXKCL8uFYQ" hash="_Y7e2g">The Church has grown and developed with their local leadership and local missionaries. If I had time, I could relate some tremendous experiences that I have had with young men and women and older men and women involved in missionary service there. I would just like to stress again what Elder M. Russell Ballard said about how important it is to make contributions to the General Missionary Fund of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p9" pid="zfvbaLVCWUOtpn5IqS0QWg" hash="l-hHzg">You know, every member is a missionary. I think President David O. McKay first emphasized that duty. I was up in Montana some time ago visiting a stake conference. After the morning session, I was wandering around outside. I saw this young boy standing there all dressed up in his Sunday clothes. I went over to him and said, “Son, you’re a fine-looking boy. What’s your name?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p10" pid="CdE4n1fEw0GdNcwpC3zDlQ" hash="zEVLoQ">He said, “Joseph Smith Curdy.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p11" pid="_tGXCwQv30ypxn8Ue6FzUw" hash="7tBmyQ">I said, “Joseph Smith Curdy! That’s a fine name. You’re going to be a great missionary.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p12" pid="7eWMvr7rKEK-lSDIpSSVCA" hash="NXQdCQ">He said, “I’m already a great missionary. Down the street a couple of blocks from where we live there’s a family with a couple of boys about my age, and over a period of three or four months, I have been bringing them to church with me. A month or so ago, I said to them, ‘How would you like to have the missionaries give you the discussions?’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p13" pid="rm6ZPCaosEaL9Rj_A-O0VQ" hash="bPpq3A">“They said, ‘Oh, we’d have to talk to our parents.’</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p14" pid="NoR1NDmz4Um84jMxX62Fmw" hash="tp6mhQ">“So we talked to the parents, and the parents said, ‘Well, if you will let us listen in, why we’ll be glad to have the missionaries teach them.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p15" pid="eNwPDqXMxkeAhf3QysREwg" hash="dz1glg">There wasn’t any problem with that, so the missionaries gave the family the discussions. Joseph Smith Curdy told me, “That whole family is going to be baptized next Saturday. I’m already a great missionary.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p16" pid="-Xoz35RP7EaVBchE73KjuA" hash="ki2tkg">I couldn’t help but agree with him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p17" pid="hNAuvfH-a0i1ra-6VZ_31A" hash="awBDOQ">Brothers and sisters, it is wonderful to have the opportunities we have in this Church, not only in the missionary program but also in the areas of temple work and genealogy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p18" pid="GNNTpFCM1k6JWQQllYK78g" hash="-twfiw">I’m grateful that I was reserved to be born at this particular time in the history of the world when the gospel has been restored in its fulness. I’m convinced that the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out upon the face of the earth more today than ever before in the history of the world through the restoration of the gospel in its fulness. Because of the Restoration, you and I can bear witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith was a great prophet of God. We’re told that Joseph Smith has done more for the salvation of mankind than any other man who has ever lived on the earth, save Jesus Christ himself. I bear that witness to you. The Church has been reestablished, the power to act in the name of God has been restored, and we have a great prophet standing at the head of this church today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/opportunities-to-serve.p19" pid="B2xn-nZXH0yV0ek3lbDxEQ" hash="0YwcxQ">May the Lord bless him. And may the choice blessings of our Father in Heaven go with you as you leave this conference, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
