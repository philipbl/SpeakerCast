      <link>http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/04/a-missionary-opportunity?lang=eng</link>
      <description>My brethren, I needn’t tell you how frightened I am. My heart is pounding, and I feel a need for the Spirit to support me as I bear you my testimony. As you can well imagine, I have been humbled by this call, and all of my deficiencies and weaknesses</description>

      <description>I want to take this opportunity to express my love and appreciation to the members of the First Council of the Seventy who were released yesterday. I’ve appreciated so much their leadership and support these past six months. I also sustain the new me</description>

      <link>http://www.lds.org/general-conference/1978/10/look-to-god-and-live?lang=eng</link>
      <description>I knew of a man who never looked up; consequently, he never lived—he just existed. Over a period of years this man became a slave to alcohol. Drink by drink he accumulated all the miserable habits and characteristics of a drunkard. He walked the stre</description>

      <description>I hold in my hand a test tube filled with salt. Salt, as you know, contains two elements—sodium and chlorine—and is known chemically as sodium chloride.</description>

      <description>Several years ago, I approached one of my daughters and said, “My dear, it’s time for an interview.” Her response was less than enthusiastic, and I determined within my own mind that I was boring her terribly. So instead of subjecting her to a formal</description>

      <description>Of all the holy agreements pertaining to the gospel of Jesus Christ, few, if any, would transcend in importance the oath and covenant of the priesthood. It is certainly one of the most sacred agreements, for it involves the sharing of heavenly powers</description>

      <description>I pray for the influence of the Holy Spirit as I discuss with you a most sacred subject—a subject that I hope will have special significance to those of you who may be investigating the Church. On July 20, 1969, astronauts landed on the moon, a plane</description>

      <description>A few years ago, I walked the halls of a care center. Most of the occupants were infirm individuals who were timeworn and anxious to go elsewhere. In passing one of the rooms, I heard a weak cry for help. The door was slightly ajar, so I entered with</description>
