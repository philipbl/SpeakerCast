      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p1" pid="nhdgBOsf3Uesr-wwd_XxHQ" hash="NiLHJA">Sisters, how wonderful it is to be with you this evening. You are such good women. You are faithful, righteous daughters of God, striving to do the best you can to keep the covenants you have made with our Heavenly Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p2" pid="CyimS30Jh0aP6kpF1OW20w" hash="VF8pug">I hope each of you has had an opportunity to see the poster we chose to represent our theme, “Here am I; send me.” The painting, entitled <span class="emphasis">Pioneers Arriving,</span> was done by Sister Minerva Teichert, a mother, wife, and honored artist. We love this painting. We love the look on the woman’s face as she walks with her family beside her. And we especially love her bag. Although we will never know what’s in that bag, it reminds me of other bags I see at church. I have carried them, and I’m sure you have too! Mine have carried, at various times, scriptures, lesson materials, bottles, quiet books, paper, and crayons.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p3" pid="WCTgZ7Q-e0iSFu10q3TznA" hash="VPq53Q">Sisters, just as we carry our bags with us at church, so do we, metaphorically, need to carry another bag with us wherever we go—and in this bag is our treasure of covenants—because we are covenant women. I want to visit with you about the way our covenants can strengthen righteous families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p4" pid="qmCZ7vO_uUauNPeAjvnMfw" hash="KVQLZg">It’s important for us to realize that there is no one way that a righteous family looks. Some righteous families have two parents; but sometimes, through death or divorce, there is only one. Some righteous families have many children, and other families, at least for the moment, have none. Most members are single for part of their lives, but Elder Marvin J. Ashton taught us that “God and one are a family.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> In some righteous families only the father works outside the home, and other times, both adults must work. So, though we may differ, what righteous families have in common are the covenants that they hold sacred.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p5" pid="HscLOdwdG0acAGuQtGYPbQ" hash="nazYAw">I think first of covenants relating to the laws of the gospel: tithing, church attendance, and the Word of Wisdom, for example. Sisters, I don’t need to tell you that if we keep these covenants, our families will be blessed. That’s not to say we’ll never suffer; but in the end, we know that there is a reward for keeping our promises.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p6" pid="0a093tCDME-8uvXte_-2Xw" hash="2EMpUQ">Other covenants commit us to moral behaviors: both our ethics toward one another and standards of conduct related to our bodies. We need to teach our children ethical behaviors: honesty, respect, integrity, kindness in word and actions. We send our children into a world where these behaviors are declining, but we must teach them through word and, more importantly, example, the actions of decency and goodness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p7" pid="xukBOxmmi0OS8Rn9N2KAKw" hash="WX9R3A">And what of the standard of conduct relative to our bodies? Sisters, we need to be examples to our children of what we expect in dress, in appearance, and in chastity. Two years ago, President Hinckley stood in this meeting and counseled us to “teach [our] children when they are very young and small, and never quit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> The standard for all of us is clear, but what we know is that the world’s ways are too often becoming our ways and our children’s ways.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p8" pid="nR15LDscNUazvsGITzZYmg" hash="PDYDTw">I once heard a mother say that with all of the evil influences facing her daughters, she had to choose which battles to fight. And so she had chosen not to fight their dress standards. But modesty is a battle worth fighting because it so often affects more serious moral issues. Now, this doesn’t mean that we have to demand that our daughters and sons are covered from neck to ankle, but it does mean that we help them dress in a way that shows they are children of God. Sisters, you are wise and amazing mothers. You don’t need a handbook outlining what is acceptable in dress. Follow the Spirit, and you and your children will know what is right.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p9" pid="VD9f2Q3aTk6MVj-rOBAg-Q" hash="Uh0v0w">We also need to make sure that our children understand the Lord’s expectations regarding sexual behavior. The standard relative to chastity has never changed—children should know where the line is. However, too often we are seeing our children justifying behaviors they know are incorrect and modeling the behaviors of the world. We need to set aside any embarrassment or discomfort we may feel, so that we can have frank discussions with our teenagers. They need to know specifically, not generally, what behaviors are acceptable for a man and a woman outside of marriage. If we don’t teach them the standards, then the world will, with disastrous results.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p10" pid="ZZsjglsj70KUgKY72JOozg" hash="upCp0g">The same holds true for the newest threat: technology. Sadly, the best filters made will not ensure that nothing profane will enter our homes. While the Internet is wonderful, we must be vigilant regarding it and other media influences in the home. Pornography is becoming all too prevalent and is seeping into the lives of Saints, turning their hearts away from the standards of God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p11" pid="F7Re0y0cLE-whoSHea2WCw" hash="4GOAJQ">The most important covenant pertaining to families is the covenant of eternal marriage. We know that “marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Our families are our highest responsibility as well as our greatest blessing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p12" pid="UM7fPpiekkWSBjsJKG4hPg" hash="Cd6FsA">The theme of this conference is “Here am I; send me.” The words are a promise to the Lord and an expression of our willingness to serve. If we keep our covenants, the promises we receive in return are great. President Boyd K. Packer has written:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p13" pid="yLOYBtgI4E-yuif7AY8v4w" hash="Yp_Mwg">“It is not uncommon for responsible parents to lose one of their children, for a time, to influences over which they have no control. They agonize over rebellious sons or daughters. They are puzzled over why they are so helpless when they have tried so hard to do what they should.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p14" pid="leWWNBDmwkSsur37kpzY1A" hash="BNPXqA">“It is my conviction that those wicked influences one day will be overruled. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p15" pid="bvfR17vKukq4qtjzA1c-Ew" hash="ZAADhQ">“We cannot overemphasize the value of temple marriage, the binding ties of the sealing ordinance, and the standards of worthiness required of them. When parents keep the covenants they have made at the altar of the temple, their children will be forever bound to them.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p16" pid="WHa1UOz_ukCx1opaQGK3FA" hash="stXn2A">Sisters, that promise gives me so much hope. Let’s make our trek with confidence, our bright bags clutched firmly in our arms, but let’s empty those bags of things we do not need. Extra weight will only slow us down. Let’s rid ourselves of the “what ifs” and the “if onlys” and “cast [our] burden upon the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> I need to do this with you. Let’s just do the best we can every day and allow the Lord to make up the difference for us. That is one of the promises He has made to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p17" pid="JjlLcFaQ8Em0ib3zdCOXHQ" hash="_d_U6Q">Finally, let me tell you about a woman I have never met but whom I love dearly because she was true to her covenants. My great-great-grandmother Charlotte Gailey Clark was one of the last 295 people to receive their covenants in the Nauvoo Temple prior to the beginning of the great exodus west. The temple had been closed since the Saints were being forced to leave, but all those who were worthy had not yet had an opportunity to receive their endowments. My great-great-grandmother and her husband would be leading their family west, and she wanted her covenants with her before she set out on that journey. I have thought about her so often these past few months. I someday want to say to her, “Grandma, thank you for keeping your covenants. I am so blessed to be your granddaughter. Your faithfulness has blessed me and my family—and will continue to bless all of us throughout the generations.” And sisters, our children and grandchildren will one day be able to say the same to us, and of us. One day they will thank us for keeping this “bag” of covenants with us and using them to bless the lives of our families.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2002/10/blessing-our-families-through-our-covenants.p18" pid="48ICv8PhC0CIL4wPEcEOyA" hash="O2N12Q">May our Heavenly Father bless us to keep our covenants that our families may be strengthened and blessed because of our righteous lives, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p1" pid="fypY7hIwLk2nroVgsZSTsg" hash="sw9fbA">Early in Christ’s ministry, He traveled from Jerusalem to His boyhood home of Nazareth, in Galilee. He passed through Samaria and, weary from His journey, stopped to rest at Jacob’s ancient well. As Jesus waited and His disciples sought food in a nearby town, a Samaritan woman approached the well. You know the story. When Jesus asked for a drink, she was surprised that a Jew would make such a request of her. For centuries Jews and Samaritans had considered themselves enemies. But Christ told her that if she understood whom it was she was talking to, she would ask <span class="emphasis">Him</span> for water—living water, water that would satisfy her thirst forever. She didn’t understand, of course, and so He explained:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p2" pid="76wRJUlTv0e2BduIIl0K8Q" hash="JwfOOg">“Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p3" pid="yPbTu16n_0-ZwEyxntXkiQ" hash="ptlH5w">“But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/4.13-14" class="scriptureRef">John 4:13–14</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p4" pid="JCfyjVDq0E25pvCHkxMkaQ" hash="kBfq3g">The Samaritan woman liked the idea of never having to drink again. Certainly, she wouldn’t miss the daily labor of carrying the heavy water jars from the well to her home. But when Christ testified to her that He was the Messiah and when the Spirit confirmed to her that it was true, she began to comprehend that Jesus was speaking of greater truths. She left the well water behind and hurried away to seek others who might come and listen. I doubt, however, at least at that point, that she fully understood—or whether we fully understand—what it means to have a wellspring of living water within us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p5" pid="iuwjtR6EX0qsRtI1k9x-hg" hash="LGOO0A1">Living water heals. It nourishes and sustains. It brings peace and joy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p6" pid="UFEqxMFY5Uq5QOnimAa4qw" hash="ZlxMWw">A woman I know was struggling with anger toward someone who had hurt her and her family. Though she told her children not to become embittered and resentful, she fought those feelings herself. After weeks of entreating her Father in Heaven, she finally felt a change. She related: “One day, in the midst of my nearly constant prayers, the healing came. I felt a physical sensation spread through my body. After, I felt a sense of security and peace. I knew that regardless of what happened, my family and I would be all right. The anger left me and so did my desire for retaliation.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p7" pid="biMepplXFEeNtUKOClI5CQ" hash="0rP5bw">The living water is the gospel of Jesus Christ; its communicator is the Holy Ghost. My friend knew what was right. She had said the appropriate words to her family. But only when she humbled herself enough to drink of the water—to feel the Holy Spirit—could she begin to heal.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p8" pid="A4UUBZ09406OjRABX-p2rQ" hash="sevyjg">As I have met with many women this last year—and their priesthood leaders—I have heard numerous accounts of Christ’s healing power. There is so much suffering in mortality, so many causes for pain. I know people who have sent loved ones into harm’s way and who daily pray for their safety in battle. I talk to parents who are frightened for their children, aware of the temptations they face. I have dear friends who are suffering from the ravaging effects of chemotherapy. I know single parents, abandoned by spouses, who are rearing children alone. I have dealt myself with the debilitating effects of depression. But I have learned from my own experience, and I learn from those I meet, that we are never left to our own resources. We are never abandoned. A wellspring of goodness, of strength and confidence is within us, and when we listen with a feeling of trust, we are raised up. We are healed. We not only survive, but we love life. We laugh; we enjoy; we go forward with faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p9" pid="i7Mrr9hl0kCmjvHEI-Bw2g" hash="bhjCQQ">The living water also nourishes. I testify to you that just as He promises, Christ comes to all who are heavy laden; He gives us rest (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:28</a>). He sustains us when we are weary. A wellspring is a flowing well, offering continual refreshment—if we drink of it. Pride can destroy its effects, as can mere inattention. But those who drink deeply not only become whole themselves, but they become a fountain to others, as one spirit nurtures and feeds another.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p10" pid="ldbzT2qihEyx32OVCH3fjQ" hash="MnY8NA">Last year a dear family friend passed away. Lucile was 89 years old and had been a widow for more than 20 years. She was not a rich woman, she was not famous, and most of the world knew nothing of her passing. But her family knew. Her neighbors knew. The members of her ward knew. For all who had experienced her love, her death had left the world a diminished place. During her years as a widow, Lucile had endured difficult challenges, including the death of a beloved grandson and infirmities brought on by age. But Lucile continued to nourish everyone she knew with her spirit; with her baked goods, her quilts and afghans; with her humor and goodwill. And she loved to work in the temple. One spring day in 1981, she wrote in her journal: “This morning at 3:30 <small>A.M.</small>, as I was walking up the path to the temple, I watched the flag gently blowing in the breeze and looked at the beautiful sky and thought how happy I was to be there. I felt sad for all the people who [were] sleeping and missing the awakening of a beautiful day.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p11" pid="BVfa0vQECUqfa1QQPh5CLQ" hash="K6YhFw">Most of us don’t think the world is “awakening” at 3:30 in the morning, and we’re perfectly happy to roll over in bed about then and allow Lucile to feel sorry for us. But what an attitude! Only a flow of goodness from within could explain it. Did she possess this purity of spirit at 15, at 25, or even 55? I don’t know. In most cases, it probably takes a lifetime of listening to the Holy Ghost before we know God’s voice so well and before we trust in the living waters enough to taste them throughout the entire day—especially a day that begins at 3:30 <small>A.M.</small> But I believe the living waters sustained Lucile during those long years when she might have given way to self-pity, and her life, her spirit, became nourishment to everyone she knew.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p12" pid="PvySrX-8x0aDFJPLMrixig" hash="faChdA">The living waters can bring peace and joy even when the wellspring within us seems to have dried. Recently I heard of a woman whose son, suffering from emotional illness, died unexpectedly. The family was devastated. The mother couldn’t imagine that she could ever know happiness again. But she was blessed by the service of a young woman, one of her former Laurel girls—now a young Relief Society sister and her visiting teacher—who said, “You helped me; now I’ll help you—and we’ll get through this together.” Peace, even joy, began to return to her life.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p13" pid="PLBk84PvBU-V-nqxm3FfHA" hash="ujnRxg">It may take a lifetime—and longer—to refine our spirits fully, but the living water is available to all, including the young. I’m inspired when I watch young women of the Church, after receiving spiritual training from childhood, enter the Relief Society and immediately bring added strength to more experienced women. I’m overjoyed when I watch those same young women realize how much they can learn from women older than themselves. Peace comes to us from the Lord, but we can help each other feel that peace as we share our burdens and our happiness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p14" pid="Ll3TaUuj9kCsr4JuevSVlg" hash="rfJAFA">Christ’s promise is simple and sublime: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>). Brothers and sisters, turmoil is raging all about us. Economies are in distress; families are struggling; we are living in, as President Hinckley has said, “perilous times” (“The Times in Which We Live,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2001, 72; <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Jan. 2002, 83). But the living waters still offer peace and joy. When we live righteously, when we have done all we can do, one of the gifts we receive is confidence. The Lord tells us, “Be still and know that I am God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:16</a>). In the midst of chaos, we must pause. We must listen for the Spirit that tells us, “All is well!” (“Come, Come, Ye Saints,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 30) just as the early Saints had to do. There is cause to be concerned, but there is greater reason to be at peace.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/blessed-by-living-water.p15" pid="F6_GwtA710iO_pbpFw1HpQ" hash="VOfvyQ">The Samaritan woman looked into the face of Christ, listened to His voice, and recognized Him at a time when most others rejected all He taught. We know Him too, or we can, if we allow His healing power, His nourishing strength, His peace and joy, to flow through us like “a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” That we may do so is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <title>In Covenant with Him</title>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p1" pid="YiJMtOnljEGlqtLGAjZX8Q" hash="8RxhxQ">My dear sisters, the year has passed quickly, and it’s wonderful to meet again as women of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Whatever our circumstance, we are blessed as women. We have made covenants with Heavenly Father to do His work—and we <span class="emphasis">are</span> doing that work! Like Mary and Martha, we have placed ourselves at the Master’s feet and have “chosen that good part.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> We have chosen Christ, and we have chosen Relief Society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p2" pid="yt8rh6vkJUOPL8vai4FMJw" hash="_szwtA">Yet I wonder whether we women have a full vision of what Relief Society is. When Joseph Smith read the first bylaws written by Eliza R. Snow, he said the document was the best he had ever seen, but he envisioned “something better.” He would “organize the women under the priesthood after the pattern of the priesthood.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> When the Prophet Joseph “turned the key”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> and established the “Female Relief Society of Nauvoo,” he said that the Church itself had not been fully organized until that moment.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Sisters, it’s important that we understand that statement. Relief Society was established by God, through a prophet, by the power of priesthood authority; its existence is a necessary part of the organization of the Church. Men and women stand together in priesthood and Relief Society as we strive to bring families to Christ. As women, we should never think that our role in the Church is a lesser role than that played by men. Just as we as righteous women honor the priesthood, we need to hold sacred our calling as women as well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p3" pid="qx5ld16DKkWjWxGOVa5ALQ" hash="MaG9LQ">As I have studied this painting of Martha and Mary with the Savior, I have come to think of these women as my predecessors. I have wondered if they were also women “full of good works and almsdeeds.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> It is pleasant to think that they, and other faithful women who were Christ’s disciples, might have met together to learn their part in building the kingdom. They were covenant women like us. They had determined to give the Savior all their hearts. So, too, when the Relief Society was organized, it grew out of our divine calling and our desire to serve, to love, and to care for each other. Just as the ordinances and direction of the priesthood are necessary in the Lord’s work, so is the service that we do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p4" pid="IC3qR-igyUOQE0c_opnFXA" hash="iOLbUw">To accomplish this important work, we choose to be covenant women: women who have made sacred promises to the Lord. For those of us who have received our temple blessings, we have promised that we will consecrate our time and talents to the building up of the Lord’s kingdom. Through this covenant we can serve the Church in many roles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p5" pid="oX6vgXczXUKwu_-pQO2OIg" hash="L_danA">Twenty years ago I was called to be Young Women president in my ward. My hair was brown, and my body was … well, let’s just say, a little more limber. Many years later I was called again to the same position, this time in a new ward. I was being recycled, and I found that exciting. It was my chance to renew my covenant to God that I would serve in whatever capacity He needed me. Now, however, my hair was naturally silver (or mostly so), and touching my toes had become a real strain. But I didn’t feel too old to be blessed again by the lives of remarkable young women who were faithful, bright, and full of fun. I would like to think that by then I had a little more wisdom to give them and a deeper testimony of the gospel, but once again I learned as much from them as they did from me. Our sisterhood includes all ages and backgrounds; we are connected by the covenants we have made.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p6" pid="QnZOKklSzUiN6P71HCBeVA" hash="AwXhzg">And remember, we don’t outgrow those covenants. We can serve each other in every era of our lives. I heard recently of a young mother whose husband, a member of a bishopric, was sitting on the stand while she struggled with her restless children. A much older woman took the toddler on her lap and helped to quiet her. Such simple acts are part of building God’s kingdom. It’s what we do. It’s who we are as sisters of Relief Society. Whether we are serving as president of the Relief Society or as a teacher in Primary or as the Young Women camp director, we are fulfilling our sacred responsibility as Relief Society sisters. When we call to check on an elderly neighbor or provide encouragement and help to a young mother or include another family in our prayers, we are keeping our covenants.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p7" pid="v7cXIIuVDkipVMj6MtOx5A" hash="rzYWrw">Recently our presidency was meeting with a Church leader. He commented that he wished Relief Society and priesthood meetings would be places where we would be able to say to one another, “Sisters, or brothers, I’m struggling right now. Will you help me?” I have been in Relief Society meetings like that. I will always remember the Sunday morning when testimonies were being borne and a single sister shared with us the loneliness of her life. She had experienced betrayal, a divorce, and subsequent financial hardships as she tried to work and raise her children on a small income. Now she knew the pain of loneliness as her grown children were gone from her home. The moment was sweet, the Spirit strong, and I saw sisters rallying around her, doing what we do best: love. The Relief Society room was a holy place that day. It was what every Relief Society room should be for each sister.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p8" pid="DbZnihUpD0md5oF4WaNYkg" hash="-it6Qw">It’s so important that we include every sister. Let’s not forget the women who are serving in Primary or Young Women. They need the care of faithful visiting teachers, and they need well-planned and accessible home, family, and personal enrichment meetings. There are also many in our circle who are growing older—like me! You sisters my age or older, please let yourselves be “recycled.” The Lord needs your service, and we need you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p9" pid="VP0Q65HrV0uPhdijnZCwmA" hash="T28cOg">I am aware of a young sister who is struggling to make the transition from Young Women into Relief Society. She is faithful and strong, yet right now she feels alone. How can this be? If we are truly sisters, we should know each other’s needs. This period of young adulthood should not be a transition but a natural step in an extended sisterhood. There are many of these young women in our wards. Please find them, love them, and bring them into the circle of sisterhood. But to you young sisters I would say, don’t assume you know what Relief Society is like until you have joined with the sisters and done <span class="emphasis">your</span> part to get to know <span class="emphasis">them.</span> Moving from Young Women to Relief Society is not a change from one class to another; it is your opportunity to take on a greater role in serving the Lord and doing His work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p10" pid="ZNWJ_7jueUCtHfqu87F-CA" hash="lKwtdQ">Sisters, we’re not a social club, though deep friendships form from our sisterhood. We are not, as I heard a young woman say, “the old women who meet on Sunday.” We have <span class="emphasis">power</span> when we use it: power given to us through God to accomplish His purposes. We are the world’s largest women’s organization. As we reach into our communities with the knowledge and inspiration the Lord has granted us, we can help lead a world that needs our guidance. It’s what the Prophet Joseph expected; it’s what President Hinckley expects of us today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p11" pid="iTeQWVQrDEus_J-Oi0Y-_g" hash="BsIuug">The scope of our work can seem daunting, but as my recently baptized grandson can quickly tell you, a covenant is a two-way promise. We all know the scriptural teaching that where “much is given much is required.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Remember, though, that where much is required, much is also given. When we covenant with God and keep those covenants, all things are made possible. He gives us what we need to do His work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/in-covenant-with-him.p12" pid="yhiWOzkst0-rsqiHR8csrw" hash="loFytg">Tonight, my dear sisters, I invite you to recommit yourselves as covenant women to Christ and to His organization for us, His daughters. Choose that good part. Choose to follow Christ. Choose Relief Society. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p1" pid="z4oM2p0gI0iIjKtQva1jTQ" hash="dTPTxA">The words of the grand anthem of the Restoration sung at the opening of our meeting have been in my mind and heart since we first chose the theme. “Let Zion in her beauty rise; Her light begins to shine. … A people to prepare to meet the Lord” (“Let Zion in Her Beauty Rise,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 41). It’s glorious to think of that promised time when the Lord will return, but it’s also sobering to contemplate the changes that may be necessary for us each to be prepared. Still, dear sisters, as I have met you and seen your commitment, I believe we are not, as a people, as wanting as we often feel. We have reason for confidence and hope as we prepare.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p2" pid="3R9TFs45PkGtdTzxOjVVKw" hash="fSqVFQ">September 1832 was a busy season of preparation for the early Saints. The Prophet was preparing to move to the John Johnson home southeast of Kirtland, Ohio; other brethren were preparing to leave for Missouri. In the midst of these preparations, Joseph Smith received the revelation that we now know as section 64 of the Doctrine and Covenants. After instructing the men going to Missouri, the Lord reminded them: “But all things must come to pass in their time. Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. <span class="emphasis">And out of small things proceedeth that which is great</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.32-33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:32–33</a>; emphasis added).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p3" pid="TS65QqCzME2pYx3ZL_mh0Q" hash="6tfo_g">These verses are a guide for us as we prepare ourselves and our families to live in “perilous times” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.1" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 3:1</a>). We must not become weary of doing good, and we must not become impatient; the changes we seek will come about “in their time.” Most important, the great work we wish to do will proceed from “small things.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p4" pid="acZrtYv9NkSh_GGe9uUvJQ" hash="1Wh4TQ">One of those small things, I have learned, is that I must find the time to fill my own spiritual reservoir each day. It’s tempting to make a massive list of my failings and then to work at them, as a friend of mine says, as though I am “killing snakes.” Self-improvement may seem a kind of work project, but it is—at heart—a change of heart. When we women struggle to keep up with life—raising children, providing necessities, attending school, dealing with issues of age or ill health—our own spirituality often ends up at the bottom of our long “to do” lists.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p5" pid="TXgOgUqK0k6N7QO4EQ6OoA" hash="iVhZbQ">Scripture study and prayer will bring change—but not automatically. If we read with one eye and pray with half a heart, we are engaging in a ritual, and while that time is not worthless, it isn’t fully productive either. We need, with the support of family, to clear enough time to study—not just read—to contemplate, feel, and wait for answers. The Lord has promised that He will strengthen us, fortify and refresh us, if we will take time for Him each day (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.63" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:63</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p6" pid="d1vxt7fQdUSCfAYT4BsM7Q" hash="WrwDkQ">Sisters, we must prepare if we wish to serve, and we must serve if we wish to prepare. When I was 16 I was called to teach the three-year-olds in what was then called Junior Sunday School. (You know there was such a thing in the olden days.) I taught some busy children. They climbed on and under the chairs and table and never seemed to stop moving. I was dreadfully inexperienced, and during the first few weeks I wondered if I had done the right thing in accepting the call.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p7" pid="nbZQxNy7oU6vto-UCepBXw" hash="89xZEA">But I persisted, and what I learned—quickly—was that I couldn’t just <span class="emphasis">pray</span> for help. I had to be prepared. That meant planning activities, stories, and lessons, and it meant having plan B ready, along with C through Z. Many years later, when I was called to lead a Junior Sunday School, I knew how to assist new teachers. I knew how to enjoy the children, and I knew the importance of being faithful in my calling.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p8" pid="j6qev_4-KUenuzH8ahFHIw" hash="qheAhg">I, like many of you, have had numerous callings in the Church. Some have been easier for me than others, but I have tried to magnify each one. But does the phrase “magnify your calling” ever make you nervous? It has worried me! Recently I read a talk in which President Thomas S. Monson said on the subject: “And how does one magnify a calling? Simply by performing the service that pertains to it” (“Priesthood Power,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Jan. 2000, 60; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1999, 51). Sisters, we can do that! I hear women say that their callings are wearing them out or that they don’t have time to serve. But magnifying our callings does not mean staying up all night preparing handouts and elaborate table decorations. It does not mean that each time we do our visiting teaching we have to take something to our sisters. Sometimes we are our own worst enemies. Let’s simplify. The message of a good lesson comes through <span class="emphasis">spiritual</span> preparation. Let’s put our focus on the principles of the gospel and on the material in our study guides. Let’s prepare to create an interesting exchange of ideas through discussion, not through extra, invented work that makes us so weary we come to resent the time we spend in fulfilling our callings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p9" pid="ZWDe68a1wkydaGsiyQSn2Q" hash="3Ar12A">When we are called to serve, we are not offered a release date. Our lives are our service. Lois Bonner, a woman in my stake who is 92 years old, began serving as a visiting teacher when she married over 65 years ago. She still faithfully serves. The Nelsons from Canada and the Ellsworths from Utah, as missionaries, taught, mentored, and loved those of us who were in a small, growing ward in Missouri. We learned, through them, the joy of service and benefited from the wisdom of their experiences. I can think of no better way to thank our Father for all He gives us than to serve His children in every age of our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p10" pid="pjIKDApuNUqfKAyWDfClIA" hash="YU2gxA">Finally, I’m coming to understand the meaning and importance of our offerings—specifically, our tithes and fast offerings. Throughout the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord admonishes us to care for each other and to give of our temporal resources to build the kingdom of God. In fact, our willingness to do this is one of the prerequisites for the Lord’s returning to the earth (see Daniel H. Ludlow, <span class="emphasis">A Companion to Your Study of the Doctrine and Covenants,</span> 2 vols. [1978], 2:46). Though each of our circumstances may differ, it is important for us to give all that we can. The Lord has seldom required individuals to give all, but it is important for Him to know that we <span class="emphasis">would</span> and <span class="emphasis">could</span> do it, if asked (see Bruce R. McConkie, “Obedience, Consecration, and Sacrifice,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1975, 50). In one stake where my husband and I lived, our stake president challenged members to double their fast offerings and prepare for the blessings that would come. I can now bear personal testimony that the Lord will bless us in unfathomable ways if we are true and faithful in giving generously.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p11" pid="IdE4dd2fq0CZtN8JZlMbew" hash="qE92nQ">Spirituality through prayer and study. Service to others. Generous tithes and offerings. These are not new principles. These are some of the “small things” that are prerequisites to that which is great. In the verse that follows, we learn what the Lord <span class="emphasis">requires</span> of us. He requires <span class="emphasis">“the heart and a willing mind”</span> (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:34</a>; emphasis added). It is our hearts and our minds that must be made new. We each have our failings, our weaknesses, our less-than-perfect attitudes. The Lord asks us to open ourselves to Him, holding nothing back. He says to us, seek not “thine own life”; seek “my will, and to keep my commandments” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/10.4" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 10:4</a>). The newness of heart comes when we do and give all we can, then offer our heart and will to the Father. As we do this, our Father promises us that our lives now and in eternity will be abundant. We need not fear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p12" pid="V8yy7yndcEGSiAxXpEhCKw" hash="paO91g">Sisters, don’t become weary in doing good. If we are patient, we can experience the change of heart we seek. For most of us this will require only a slight change of course, sending us toward true north. The adjustments we must make are in those “small things,” but that does not mean they are easy. Too many forces are confusing our compass. But the pull to the polar star is one we recognize. It is the direction toward home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/out-of-small-things.p13" pid="PP2NhZ3u_U6egURpfAwN-w" hash="k67xgw">I bear witness to you of the reality of the promises of the Father to us, His beloved daughters. I testify that as we attune our lives to emulate the life shown us by the Savior, we will know that the light of Zion <span class="emphasis">is</span> arising, that we <span class="emphasis">are</span> becoming a people prepared for His return. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

As we entered, we were greeted by a temple worker, a dear friend from our ward. That greeting began a remarkable experience for us. We were met and served, more than any time I remember, by many people we knew: friends from previous wards, friends from the community, men and women we had served with in various callings. The last person I encountered was a young woman I didn’t recognize. She was lovely, and when she began to speak, I immediately remembered: Robin, one of the young women in my Laurel class when I was first a Young Women president. As we visited and exchanged memories and life updates, she told me how much that time had meant to her. I felt the same way.</p>

While there, my father took us on a day trip into the mountains in the northern part of the state. In the afternoon, we encountered a car stranded on the roadside with a flat tire. The driver told my father that his spare was also flat and he needed a ride to the nearest town to get the tire fixed. My father, seeing the man’s family inside the car, said to him, “You’ll never be able to get to town and back before dark. But listen, you have the same size wheel as mine. Take my spare, and the next time you come to Albuquerque, bring it back to me.”</p>

He goes out with his chain saw helping the Rotary club with their annual cleanup efforts. As I think of Daddy’s life and actions, I’m reminded of President Boyd K. Packer’s thought: he’s “active in the gospel” (“The Golden Years,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 2003, 82). His life, as the hymn suggests, touches lives for good, and in the touching, all are enriched (see “Each Life That Touches Ours for Good,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 293).

But perhaps they would feel more of His love if they looked for His hand in the actions of those who care for them. It may be a member of their branch or ward, a neighbor, or even a stranger who blesses them and manifests Christ’s love. Elder Henry B. Eyring instructed us: “You are called to represent the Savior. Your voice to testify becomes the same as His voice, your hands to lift the same as His hands” (“Rise to Your Call,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona</span> and <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 2002, 76). If we can lift others in Christ’s name, surely we can also be lifted.</p>

More than just visit, however, each fall he winterized the sister’s air conditioner and checked the filter on her furnace. Was that God’s love or the love of the home teacher? The answer, of course, is both.</p>

Their faith and commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ, their service, their wise and gentle instruction have enriched our lives. Some of my friends are very different from me. We disagree about things, and we can even irritate each other. But friendship allows for differences—in fact, it embraces them. I love to visit stakes made up of people from a variety of backgrounds, ages, and ethnic origins.</p>

These are <span class="emphasis">good</span> women. Oh, how I love them. After three years together, my dear sisters in the presidency know me well. They know my faith and testimony, but they also know my insecurities and worries. They know that when I’m tired after a long training trip, I’m not my best self. But I feel their love and patience, and I know they still think the best of me. Their testimonies and prayers bolster me. Their laughter brightens my day. In every sense, we are sisters.</p>

One of my younger sisters has been struggling with cancer the past few months. We don’t live close, but phone calls bring her near. We have shared love, prayers, memories, and tender testimonies as she has gone through this difficult ordeal. My sisters are treasured friends. So are my brothers, my dear husband, my children, and my grandchildren (no matter how noisy those grandchildren are).</p>

Zion was both a place and purpose—a spirit. We no longer gather in the same way. Our branches and wards are now our Zion. But they take on the spirit of Zion only when members care for one another. Sadly, we sometimes hear of women and men who have had their feelings hurt and become alienated by other Church members. If you are on either side of this dilemma—the offender or the one who has been offended—seek forgiveness; see your own part in the fault. Remember Christ’s admonition to us: “I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:27</a>).</p>

She was clearly skeptical about his calling and mission. As I spoke to her, the words of the Lord to Oliver Cowdery came to me: “Stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:18</a>). I hope that on that day, and at every moment in my life, it can be said of me, “She stood by Joseph.” I want to be his friend.</p>

He learned one day that a brother’s house had been burned by enemies. When Church members said they felt sorry for him, the Prophet took some money from his pocket and said, “I feel sorry for this brother to the amount of five dollars. How much do you … feel sorry [for him]?” (in Hyrum L. Andrus and Helen Mae Andrus, comps., <span class="emphasis">They Knew the Prophet</span> [1974], 150).</p>

Do we turn our good feelings into practical assistance? God knows the needs of His children, and He often works through us, prompting us to help one another. When we act on such promptings, we tread on holy ground, for we are allowed the opportunity to serve as an agent of God in answering a prayer.</p>

Do we live lives that proclaim “devotion to the Savior’s name”? (see <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 293). Joseph Smith did, and in this year, as we honor the man who ushered in the dispensation of the fulness of times, we should remember not only his friendship to humanity, but his friendship and dedication to the Lord. The Prophet said: “I will try to be contented with my lot, knowing that God is my friend. In Him I shall find comfort” (<span class="emphasis">The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith,</span> comp.

The Savior has affectionately said to us, “I will call you friends, for you are my friends” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:45</a>). His greatest desire for us, His brothers and sisters, is to bring us back to our Father. And the way for us is clear: develop in our lives, to the degree that we can, the qualities and attributes of Christ. Obey His commandments and do His work and His will.</p>

You look wonderful. As we meet, I cannot help but think of that first Relief Society meeting. I imagine in my mind’s eye the Prophet Joseph speaking to the sisters and preparing them for their part in building the kingdom of God. I hear the prayers of the women’s hearts: “I have made covenants to do Thy work, but help me, Lord, to now become an instrument in Thy hands.” Their prayer is our prayer.</p>

I want you to remember, she is a woman who had been a powerhouse—a great leader. She was very much the kind of woman I see in Relief Society today. But that day she said, “We must cherish one another, watch over one another, comfort one another and gain instruction that we may all sit down in heaven together.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

How does it happen? One kindness, one expression of love, one thoughtful gesture, one willing hand at a time. But my message is not to those who receive such acts of charity but to all of us who must practice such holiness every day. To become like Jesus Christ, the Prophet Joseph taught, “you must enlarge your souls toward others.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

We get angry, we become frustrated, we berate ourselves and others—and when we do, we cannot be the conduit of love we need to be if we are to become an instrument in Heavenly Father’s hands. Being willing to forgive ourselves and others becomes an integral part of our ability to have the love of the Lord in our lives and to do His work.</p>

And I wrote a talk. But, sisters, when you choose to write about charity, you need to feel charitable. And I didn’t. And so, after many prayers and tears, there came a realization to my mind that I had to ask forgiveness of those who, unbeknownst to them, were the cause of my uncharitable thoughts. It was hard. But it was healing. And I testify to you that the Lord’s Spirit returned.</p>

Let me tell you the story of a young woman I met recently. Alicia, as a teenager, had drifted far from the Church, but later she felt stirrings to return. She often visited her grandfather in a retirement home on Sundays. On one of those days she decided to attend the Latter-day Saint meetings there. She opened the door and found a Relief Society meeting, but no empty seats. As she was about to leave, a woman motioned to her and scooted over to make room for her on her chair. Alicia said: “I wondered what the woman would think of me. I was covered with body piercings, and I smelled of smoke. But she didn’t seem to mind; she simply made a place for me at her side.”</p>

She has served a mission and is now sharing that same kind of love with other women. The elderly sister who shared her chair understood that there is a place for every woman in Relief Society. Sisters, we gather for strength, but we bring with us all our weaknesses and imperfections.</p>

She said: “I only do one thing for myself when I go to church: I take the sacrament for me. The rest of the time I watch for others who need me, and I try to help and nurture them.”</p>

Like Alicia, we need to turn to those around us and watch for ways we can nurture and assist. We must think about those at the door looking in and draw them to us—that we may all sit down in heaven together. Not all of us may think there is room for another person on our chair, but there are always chairs to be found if we have love in our hearts.</p>

They were crossing the American plains with the Willie handcart company when they and many others were stranded on the trail by an early October storm. Sister Deborah Christensen, a great-granddaughter of Julia Hill, experienced this touching dream about them. She said:</p>

They had no heavy clothing to keep them warm. Julia was sitting in the snow, shaking. She could not carry on. Emily, who was freezing as well, knew that if she did not help Julia stand up, Julia would die. As Emily wrapped her arms around her sister to help her up, Julia began to cry—but no tears came, only soft whimpering sounds. Together they walked slowly to their handcart. Thirteen died that terrible night. Julia and Emily survived.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

In addition, they helped others survive this devastating portion of the journey, including a young mother and her children. It was Emily Hill Woodmansee who later wrote the beautiful words to the song “As Sisters in Zion.” The verse “We’ll comfort the weary and strengthen the weak”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> takes on new meaning when you imagine her experience on the snow-packed plains.</p>

And just as true: in helping others we keep our own spirits alive.</p>

They had the truths of the gospel to guide their lives; they had a living prophet; they had a Father in Heaven who listened and answered their prayers. Sisters, so do we. At baptism we took the name of Jesus Christ upon us. We carry that name with us each day, and the Spirit prompts us to live in concert with the Savior’s teachings. As we do, we become instruments in the hands of God. And the Spirit lifts us to higher levels of goodness.</p>

Our diligent seeking for this gift requires that we not only are willing to receive it but are willing to share it as well. As we share this love with others, we emerge as “instruments in the hands of God to do this great work.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> We will be prepared to sit down with our sisters in heaven—together.</p>

He knows what we can become—in spite of our imperfections now. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Christ in a Red Robe, </span>by Minerva Teichert, seemed the perfect painting to depict the scripture that we chose for this evening: “I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.15" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 1:15</a>). Christ looks so welcoming with His arms outstretched toward us. Just as He invited the Nephites to “arise and come forth unto me” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.15" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 11:15</a>), so He invites each of us to come, one by one, to Him, that we too may know that He is “the God of … the whole earth, and [has] been slain for the sins of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.14" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 11:14</a>). We learn how it feels to be encircled in His love when we accept that invitation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p2" pid="KoUTeB2zTkqo6n1ZO5nb0g" hash="FtE9wQ">I’m certain that each of you has felt, at one time or another, encircled in Christ’s arms. But if you are like me, there are times when you are fearful, when the stress and busyness of life seem to overwhelm you, when you feel adrift from the Spirit. Perhaps you even feel as though you have been abandoned. When I encounter those feelings, the best antidote is my <span class="emphasis">memory</span> of the moments when Christ’s peace has come to strengthen me. So tonight I invite you to <span class="emphasis">remember</span> with me what it is to feel the Lord’s love in your life and to feel encircled in His arms.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p3" pid="LuqsrtNRBkWNQ2PjegHtFw" hash="yrFLCg">My mother died when I was a young mother. I still needed her counsel and advice. After her cancer was diagnosed, she lived only six weeks. Initially, my concern was for my father. I felt grateful that Mom had not suffered long and that her death had been a sweet experience for us. But a few weeks later Mother’s Day and her birthday were coming, and I began to miss her terribly. I wanted her arms around me, and I wanted to know that she was all right. I wanted to tell her that I loved her and missed her.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p4" pid="OJWGIoWJdE6UUwR4JqZdkg" hash="fnOwVA">One night as I was praying and crying (which I did often then), I felt comfort fill my body—suddenly and powerfully. The feeling restored me; it gave me peace. It did not last long physically, yet it was immensely comforting. I knew what it was—the Lord’s love encircling me and granting me peace and strength. But just as important, that moment has remained in my memory as a sweet gift to unwrap and <span class="emphasis">remember</span> when life is difficult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p5" pid="k-1A4y3fP0KuxQJsyJ231Q" hash="oahrKA">Sometimes, too, the moments of love and the resultant peace have come unexpectedly and when there has been no need—no particular problem or issue I have been facing. One lovely autumn Sabbath I was sitting in my scripture-reading chair, watching the yellow leaves fall from our neighbor’s apricot tree. I looked up from my scriptures and without warning felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over me. The moment was fleeting, yet the memory of the love I felt has been lasting. It is a gift of memory to recall when life and times are difficult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p6" pid="WQpeobM7-Eqimxp_P4hmuw" hash="P7mAaQ">But every day, when I <span class="emphasis">seek</span> it, I experience the Lord’s love in my life and feel His arms encircle me. I see evidences of the Lord’s love in my morning walks when the air is clear and the first hint of light is in the east. I feel His love when a verse of scripture springs to mind and speaks to me in a new way. I recognize His love when I am taught by good women in Relief Society or by visiting teachers who care for me. I sense His presence when my heart responds to beautiful music or a memorable talk. Sisters, the Lord is everywhere when we open our eyes and hearts to His love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p7" pid="ETGcM17yd0yYoIkxnYPFcQ" hash="i6oDLQ">But there are women among you, I’m sure, who are thinking now, “When do I have time for a morning walk? When was the last time I had 10 minutes of peace to read my scriptures?” Or, “When was the last time I had a day without pain? or worry? or heartache?” And I recognize how true it is that life often feels like a great pile of obligations, frustrations, and disappointments. But the Lord is there, always the same, His arms still outstretched. When we feel overwhelmed, we have to <span class="emphasis">remember</span> the peace He has spoken to us on pre-vious occasions. <span class="emphasis">His</span> peace brings <span class="pageBreak" page-number="112"></span>comfort and strength; the world cannot give that to us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p8" pid="fn8G35BZoUq8jr2EW4_agw" hash="Mm-jnA">As faithful women of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have been blessed with the Holy Ghost. As we invite the Savior into our lives, the Holy Ghost will bear witness to us of the love which the Father and His Son, our Savior, have for each of us. But feeling Their love is dependent not only on our desire but upon our actions as well. And the actions we need to take are known to us: genuine prayer that is specific and humble, followed by quiet listening for the Lord’s answers; regular scripture study and time to ponder what we read; and, finally, a willingness to be introspective about ourselves and to trust in the Lord’s promise that He will “make weak things become strong unto [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:27</a>). As we study and ponder, we are entitled to the promptings of the Spirit, and as we grow more attentive to these promptings, we come to recognize each day the workings of the Lord in our lives. We will find Him, as Elder Neal A. Maxwell stated, “in the details of our lives” (“Becoming a Disciple,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> June 1996, 19). And when that recognition comes, we feel His peace and recognize that we are truly encircled in the arms of His love.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p9" pid="Zno3ca-QU0qnHy-LqgHxNA" hash="uggXBQ">In the January 2004 worldwide leadership training meeting, President Gordon B. Hinckley admonished the women of the Church to “stand strong and immovable” against the evil that is growing in the world (“Standing Strong and Immovable,” <span class="emphasis">Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting,</span> Jan. 10, 2004, 20). Sisters, this is why we must seek to know and feel the Lord’s love in our lives. It is why we must remember and treasure up our own experiences with His peace and the strength it brings. And it is why we must relate our own experiences of faith and testimony to our children and to those who are without parents or loved ones.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p10" pid="4F0mkuJBgE2_PxCsjcbPqA" hash="2YO02w">Our families need the peace of God in their lives, and if we can’t or won’t invite the Lord into our lives, then our families become a reflection of our own turmoil. Women are asked to be nurturers to their families, but we must also be firm; we must be the hard rock footings on which our homes can stand. Our families need us to speak peace to them, just as the Lord speaks peace to us. Our homes need to be places where our families and friends want to be, where all who enter our homes can draw strength and courage to face the challenges of living in an increasingly wicked world. Our children need to hear us “talk of Christ, … rejoice in Christ, [and] preach of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 25:26</a>) so that they may know to what source they can look for the peace that “passeth all understanding” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.7" class="scriptureRef">Philippians 4:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p11" pid="AOGK8JD-u06S556RUtmSGQ" hash="Gc4KWQ">Remember, sisters, the Savior’s invitation is clear and direct, and importantly for us, it is constant: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden. … Take my yoke upon you, … for … my burden is light” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 11:28–30</a>). This is the Lord’s promise to me and to you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p12" pid="GivQUkL7w0asgXltUbegOA" hash="tuZqtA">My prayer for each of us is that we will remember when the Lord has spoken His peace to us and has encircled us in the arms of His love. And just as important, will you, if you haven’t felt that love for a while, seek to see it and feel it as you go about the ordinary tasks of your life. As you do this, over the days and months and years of your life, the memories of those interactions with the Lord will become sweet gifts to open a second time—or many times—to bolster you when life is difficult.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/remembering-the-lords-love.p13" pid="rp-_uUclk0yTMb2NF7kdFw" hash="Djmtjg">“Peace I give unto you,” the Lord promises, “not as the world giveth, give I unto you” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>). Peace. Strength. It is what we long for and what is possible. We only need to turn toward His reaching arms. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
