(See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:22</a>.) On behalf of these six who have just been called, I would like to express to the First Presidency our confidence, our faith, and our prayers. We love the First Presidency, and we appreciate the confidence they have in us. I would also like to thank those of you who have expressed your confidence to us. It’s the only possible way we can do this work. We have felt a rich outpouring of your love, and that has been an outstanding experience.</p>

And especially on behalf of myself, I feel the love of my fellow California Saints, who are here in such great number, and of those great Saints in Idaho—and if I could be allowed a point of personal privilege, of those great missionaries of the Idaho Boise Mission. I feel their strength. Of course, our families are the essential cornerstone of that sustaining love. It’s tremendous to belong to this great church.</p>

The Seventy are called to preach the gospel and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and all the world. As I have searched my heart, I think the only qualification I can think of—and I believe I speak on behalf of my brethren—is that we have an especially strong witness of this work.</p>

One is that there is a real Jesus the Christ. He has a personal interest in each one of us. And secondly, if we seek him, he brings to us the peace which passeth all understanding.</p>

I was near a little town called Fairfield, Idaho, and I was reviewing the scriptures. I was reviewing the account of the First Vision, which I had asked all of our missionaries to memorize, found in the Pearl of Great Price. And as I reviewed that beautiful account from memory, I had a singular experience.</p>

In a sense, I experienced, as it were, the First Vision myself. And I became a witness to it, a personal witness, through the power of the Holy Ghost. I bear you that witness that the Father and the Son did appear to Joseph Smith the Prophet. I imagine that my experience was very similar to that which many of you have had.</p>

I’d like to have you take the first flight out tomorrow morning and meet me in my office.” Then he added, “Don’t worry about this.” That was a big, big help.</p>

Lewis—I believe he was quoting George MacDonald—who said that we are like a house. When Christ comes in, it hurts abominably. We knew the roof and the gutters needed fixing, Lewis said, but all of a sudden we find that he starts putting up a new story here, and he shoots out a new wing there. We knew that the cottage needed fixing and those things needed doing, but this? (See <span class="emphasis">Mere Christianity,</span> New York: MacMillan Publishing Co., 1943, p. 174.)</p>

What is he trying to do with us? In his best-seller, <span class="emphasis">The Road Less Traveled</span> (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1978), Dr. M. Scott Peck said that no matter how much we may pussyfoot around it, all who ask the question “What is God’s love leading to?” come to a single terrifying conclusion: God wants us to become like himself. We are being prepared for godhood, and it hurts; it hurts abominably, but there is peace.</p>

In other words, as you try it you can know it is true. This requires the faith to try, but it yields spiritual evidence. To the disciple who tries the experiment will come conviction, knowledge, and light. As the disciple continues, he receives “more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:24</a>.)</p>

Intellectual pursuits, financial success, positions of power, and other achievements, in and of themselves neither morally bad nor good, sometimes lead to pride and away from humble dependence on the Lord. Jacob cautioned that “to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.” (2 Ne. 9:29.) Financial and political power can also be seductive and corrupting influences.</p>

The sinner sometimes blames someone else, rejects the gospel, and flees. A plant growing in rocky soil withers quickly. Serious transgression, then, is the second danger to our testimonies. The road back includes removing the rocks, turning over and enriching the soil, overcoming the sin, and resisting further temptations. Increasing numbers are returning to the Church by repenting of their sins. They seldom completely lose their testimonies.</p>

Some fine and capable people become so committed to science, philosophy, history, art, music, athletics, professional pursuits, intellectual hobbies, or recreation that these interests replace the simple core values, covenants, and doctrines of the gospel. These pursuits become a substitute religion and the governing force in their lives.</p>

One evening the electric power failed. Fortunately two small candles and matches were provided. But instead of about four hundred watts of electric power to light our rooms, our candles yielded only two candlepower, not enough light to allow us to continue our work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/faith-yields-priesthood-power.p3" pid="FntrVL_QZkKH5lZcg4XSmQ" hash="D-monQ">The priesthood of God is potentially a greater source of power than electricity. Collectively, priesthood brethren perform well, but we fall far short of our potential. Why? Could our problem be that we fail to tap our greatest source of power in exercising our priesthood? Do we trade electricity for candles?</p>

By failing to put faith first in our callings, we reduce the priesthood’s light and power. Other obstacles also block its beneficial rays.</p>

How? They all did it with faith. They had no computers or fax machines. Their power depended on faith. Jesus often answered pleas for his miraculous intervention, “According to your faith be it unto you.” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/9.29" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 9:29</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/15.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt 15:28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/faith-yields-priesthood-power.p7" pid="pY00qE9KvUyvnUCUsQsrTQ" hash="b-Ufiw">Rather than relying on faith, we are tempted to stay with the comfortable and tangible tools of our temporal lives to accomplish priesthood callings. The Church has also provided some tools. These tools are useful. They have helped us achieve success, power, and control over our time. They include our natural intelligence; education and training; preparation, with manuals, handbooks, agendas, and budgets.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/faith-yields-priesthood-power.p8" pid="kevCzV5zD0KNWY7BXbPGxw" hash="tzDcRw">We operate with diligent, purposeful effort using management concepts and systems we have learned. I wouldn’t say a word against these tools. They serve us well. Often they have come themselves through a process of faith and inspiration, trial and error, and intelligent effort. After all, the Lord said, “Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.119" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:119</a>.)</p>

Two candles suddenly burst into four hundred watts of light. More to the point, we tap into the Lord’s power source, and our actions move in rhythm with His. The Lord compensates for our deficiencies. Vast, unseen reservoirs of dynamic power supply our needs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/faith-yields-priesthood-power.p10" pid="KIXAxo2nu0Oaif-ceKAudA" hash="q21wyA">The Lord commanded His Apostles to believe in Him, saying, “He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.11-12" class="scriptureRef">John 14:11–12</a>.) Clearly the power to do great works comes from faith in Christ.</p>

Nephi and his brethren received an assignment from the Lord. The assignment was, Go and obtain the brass plates from Laban. They tried wisdom, charm, persuasion—tools they were comfortable using. They even offered to trade precious things from their family, from their treasure, in exchange for the plates. Nothing worked. In fact, they fled for their lives, accused of robbery.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/faith-yields-priesthood-power.p12" pid="k6IReAsgY0SI3JlocSLCFg" hash="BJ-rog">Only then did Nephi turn to pure faith. Here’s how it worked. He convinced himself that the Lord had assigned him to get the plates. Next he conceived the mental energy and trust to try again. “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:7</a>.) Without knowing what he would do, Nephi began moving forward while his brothers skulked outside the city walls. “I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.6" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 4:6</a>.) Now he was moving by faith—confidence in the unknown, hope in things unseen. You know the rest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/faith-yields-priesthood-power.p13" pid="uWm--IPhAE-UP2uTAYmvCg" hash="ZAFwTA">Notice that faith and trust in the Lord came first. Then came action. He had no plan except confidence in the Lord. It was really a “ready, fire, aim” approach, the opposite of conventional wisdom. Laman and Lemuel thought it foolhardy. Then the Lord’s plan unfolded with Nephi being guided by unseen hands.</p>

I was assigned, for example, to escort Elder and Sister Bateman and Elder and Sister Steadman to their missionary assignments as English teachers in Hanoi, Vietnam. We planned and organized, but we had more questions than answers. After completing our planned agenda, we still had one full day unplanned. More remained to be done, but what and where?</p>

Events swept us through an amazing day of welcoming ceremonies at the Hanoi Children’s Palace, dinner in our honor with Operation Smile Vietnam, and other activities planned by our hosts. Our hosts had been too busy to communicate their plans to us, but the Lord knew them and moved us into place like pawns on a chessboard.</p>

We answer—we understand that when a man works by faith he works by mental exertion instead of physical force. It is by words, instead of exerting his physical powers, with which every being works when he works by faith.” (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1985, p. 72.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/faith-yields-priesthood-power.p17" pid="rKKbXM4TjkCcKJUxvbuh4w" hash="3L4Bew">A brief but profound phrase in the book of Abraham describes the complete power of God’s faith. “There is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but what he will do it.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:17</a>.) With faith we can get the right things to do into our hearts and the words and mental exertion to do them. It may require leaving unstructured time in our planning and on our agenda. Then faith would have some air to breathe.</p>

Faith taps into divine sources and is a manifestation of unity and partnership with the Lord. Even the ideas and words formulated by faith come by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and the power to accomplish the words formed by faith comes from God.</p>

Maybe to some of you it sounds too general and simplistic. Well, in a way it is easy, but there are serious obstacles to overcome before we can add the power source of faith in our service. The hardest step may be to decide that faith comes first. Then we must overcome the obstacles. Our greatest obstacle is often unworthiness. To really have faith, we must cleanse the instruments of faith—our minds, our bodies, and spirits.</p>

Evil spirits had vexed her daughter, and she sought in faith to have Jesus cast the evil spirits out. Jesus, probably testing her faith, explained that He was only sent to minister to those of Israel. She simply would not be denied. “Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.” Jesus exclaimed, “O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/15.27-28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 15:27–28</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1993/04/faith-yields-priesthood-power.p31" pid="vGf-kojb3EKpA4HdqfuddA" hash="y6cc-Q">Brethren, we can learn much about faith from such sisters as the woman of Canaan, from our friends of other faiths such as the Roman centurion, and especially from our children. No matter how we learn to use the power of faith, we need to have it to accomplish the awesome tasks assigned to us.</p>

These gifts are available to us today. Even the ultimate power—to raise the dead—is occasionally exercised by those of great faith. The sick are healed, the blind see, the lame walk, and evil spirits are cast out—all through faith and priesthood power in combination. I feel we do not enjoy enough spiritual gifts in our priesthood callings.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p1" pid="jmOkK4wRTkaCuNWi1OkDIQ" hash="CYjS-w">Seventeen years ago today, during the Sunday afternoon session of general conference, I responded to President Hinckley’s assignment that I represent the six newly called Seventy in accepting our calls. As I awaited my turn at the midpoint of the session, I stood between two great Apostles: Elders Marvin J. Ashton and Bruce R. McConkie. I felt their love and support as I gazed with no little trepidation at the congregation of Saints gathered in the Tabernacle. Incidentally, we’re four times greater today. Elder Ashton, sensing my feelings, whispered, “I know it’s an awesome sight, but they’re all your friends.” As I stood that first time to speak, I felt the love of the Saints washing over me. Since then, in all the places to which worldwide assignments have taken us, Shirley and I have felt that same love and tried to return it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p2" pid="pKAFF5bDM0C0FxOwStvTdg" hash="xlCR2w">The unity of the Saints is unique and powerful. I have seen and felt it on virtually every continent and in the islands of the sea. That unity is a major reason the Church is progressing. Without it we would falter. As Jesus explained, “Every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Division and fault lines abound in the world, but “we are not divided; all one body we.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> We have that unity under the spiritual direction of our prophet. Our wealth, social status, or skin color doesn’t matter. The feast of the gospel is freely available to all that desire to partake of its delicacies. Jesus told His disciples “that many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> The Church is quietly moving forward in crescendo, as a great symphony orchestra moving toward a climax, strengthening communities as it grows.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p3" pid="_hHyfFaJXE6jDM4r8ehhGw" hash="hpYg-Q">We enjoy that unity through love. We can neither purchase nor force it. Our method is to “persuade, … and bless with wisdom, love, and light, … but never force the human mind.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> To the extent we operate in other ways, we diminish our right to be recognized as disciples of Christ. “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p4" pid="NwyUipx4CEKIXreDUXf47w" hash="hPLSZQ">That unifying love is coupled with our individual testimonies. Almost every member could and would respond if called upon to bear their own testimonies in this conference. Yes, we are united in love and testimony.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p5" pid="BqGVtU7ULkalyvmhxcq23g" hash="oaShQA">My testimony is built on the firm convictions that the Book of Mormon is true and Jesus is our Savior. This spiritual foundation has helped me weather the storms of challenge and doubt. I started reading the Book of Mormon in my youth and have continued, learning and drinking its spirit with every study.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p6" pid="0_H4fbF1h0isYHPMDs3UVA" hash="nLc_QQ">As one in the last large group of missionaries called before demands of the Korean War diverted our young men into military service, I participated in about five days of training in the Salt Lake Mission Home on State Street. One of our trainers was Bryant S. Hinckley, a Church leader of stature and a stimulating teacher. He invited those missionaries assembled to share reasons they believed the Book of Mormon to be true. I was impressed with the variety of reasons shared by the missionaries. On that occasion, I suggested that in addition to the witness of the Holy Ghost, the number of new names identifying people, places, animals, and things in the Book of Mormon had impressed me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p7" pid="QFQZZY2dz02T_6RGLOpu_Q" hash="0W4w2w">Now, 50 years later, I am still impressed by these new names. When researchers reported that they have discovered stones in the southern Arabian Desert with the name <span class="emphasis">Nahom</span> inscribed on them, I paid attention. These inscriptions appear to be dated about 700 <small>B.C.</small> Ishmael, we read, was buried in a place called Nahom. Nahom is one of those names that impressed me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p8" pid="U6JLs3L1CUyizAUCxa4nxA" hash="GNtnsA">Evidence of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon continues to mount. During his mission in Germany, Jack Welch found verses in the Book of Mosiah that clearly form a chiasmus, or an X-shaped configuration. That finding evidenced ancient rather than modern authorship. Scholars continue to find and publish new insights into what the book says and how it says it. A distinguished literature professor has published a recent book containing his lifetime study of the Book of Mormon, detailing its astonishing variety of literary forms.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Statisticians have found evidence of multiple authors within the covers of the book. Although these evidences have added to my testimony, the original powerful witness of the Holy Ghost has remained unshaken and unaltered. It has also recurred many times.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p9" pid="d92BbfNdh02yVNJETHfPlQ" hash="gl0Mxg">I also wonder if we fully appreciate the value and strength of the witnesses’ testimonies published in each copy of the Book of Mormon. Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris saw the plates and the angel. And Joseph also showed the gold plates to eight other men who saw and, using their word, “hefted” them.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> These witnesses did not recant their testimonies, nor have their published testimonies ever been otherwise impeached. Those eight additional witnesses, in effect, testified: “Yes, we saw and lifted those plates. Joseph had them.” The witnesses have been important to me. The Lord told Joseph that the declarations of these witnesses prove “to the world that the holy scriptures are true, and that God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p10" pid="Gksnwp2Mb0WaKUY0NS3WVg" hash="lEU_Ag">Having discovered that the book is true, we must then ask, “What is its message?” Alma—and incidentally, Professor Welch says that they’ve discovered recently ancient usage of the word <span class="emphasis">Alma</span>—Alma, in speaking to the people of Gideon, put his finger on the central message of the book. He said, “There be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all—for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> Yes, of course, Alma—Jesus’ coming and His Atonement, worked out in Gethsemane and on the cross, are surely more important than all other knowledge a person can gain. And the Book of Mormon is “Another Testament of Jesus Christ,” as its subtitle proclaims.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2001/04/united-in-love-and-testimony.p11" pid="5R4UABqeQUWCDmCEDfsFug" hash="bYjh6A">Before ever reading the Book of Mormon, I had a child’s testimony of Jesus. My first awareness of Jesus was when my Grandmother Carmack, an artist of some minor acclaim, pointed out to me the beauty of the Arizona sunset and then asked, “John Kay, who made this beautiful world?” Answering her own question, she explained, “Jesus made this world. Yes, He did.” Grandmother was right, of course. Jesus, the Son of God, did create the worlds under the Father’s direction.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Incidentally, grandparents should not underestimate their influence in the lives of their grandchildren.</p>

These familiar words capture my feelings about that important aspect of Jesus’ influence and ministry:</p>

His succor brings us peace. Did He not say, “In the world ye shall have tribulation,” but “in me ye might have peace”?<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Oh, how I have needed that peace!
