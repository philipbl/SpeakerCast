        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="95"></span>Recently Sister Oswald and I decided to teach our five-year-old twin granddaughters how to jump the rope. Jumping the rope is a children’s game in which participants jump over a rope as it passes under their feet and then over their heads. After receiving some simple instructions, both girls tried but failed on several attempts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p2" pid="OdlH37oZ8kqKE1gsKW6adA" hash="UCCxjg">Just as we were ready to give up, two older neighbor children walked by, and we enlisted their help. Both of the neighbor girls were experienced rope jumpers and were able to show our granddaughters how to jump the rope. As they jumped the rope, I noticed that the neighbor girls sang a song that helped them jump to the rhythm of the swinging rope.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p3" pid="nNhqpMu_80W-O91TBUnVKA" hash="pshWbA">Once our granddaughters understood the principles of rope jumping and were shown how to jump the rope, the rest of the lesson was easy. With a little practice, both of the twins were well on their way to mastering the fundamentals of rope jumping.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p4" pid="0gtVjQsFL0CKL8WOEFImQg" hash="86_tEg">During the rope-jumping lesson, another granddaughter, only three years old, was sitting quietly on the lawn observing. When someone asked her if she wanted to try to jump the rope, she nodded, came forward, and stood next to the rope. As we turned the rope, to our great surprise she jumped just as she had seen her sisters do. She jumped once, then twice, and then again and again, repeating aloud the same song the older children had sung.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p5" pid="edX0jaNPPEyat4FgX9bTzQ" hash="eSGRew">All three granddaughters had observed that there was an art to jumping the rope. It was a simple thing that all of them could do after learning a few basic principles and being shown how. So it is with gospel <span class="pageBreak" page-number="96"></span>teaching. When we learn a few fundamental principles about teaching and are shown how to teach, all of us can do it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p6" pid="XvKk97okOU6Rk2LpPP3N6Q" hash="_x_WOQ">President Boyd K. Packer often reminds us that “all of us—leaders, teachers, missionaries, and parents—have a lifelong challenge from the Lord to both teach and learn the doctrines of the gospel as they have been revealed to us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> As simply stated by Elder L. Tom Perry, “Every position in the Church requires an effective teacher.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

There are many principles of teaching and learning, and it is not enough for us just to read about them. First, we need to <span class="emphasis">understand</span> these basic principles, and second, we need to be <span class="emphasis">shown </span>how they are used by successful teachers. This can be done by carefully watching able teachers in our wards and branches and reviewing the worldwide leadership training meeting on teaching and learning found on the Church Web site or in Church magazines.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

His disciples called Him “Rabboni; which is to say, Master” or “Teacher.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> He was and is the Master Teacher.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p10" pid="iaSoTt8RU0OWtlj10GUveQ" hash="XAegWg">Jesus differed from other teachers of His day in that He taught “as one having authority.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> This authority to teach and minister came from His Heavenly Father, for “God anointed Jesus … with the Holy Ghost and with power … ; for God was with him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Jesus said, “I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> “The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do. … For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

From the Book of Mormon, for example, Nephi,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Alma,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> and the sons of Mosiah<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> readily come to mind. Notice the personal preparation of the sons of Mosiah as they prepared to teach the gospel:</p>

Joseph has given us a brief but detailed description of what Moroni said and did when he taught Joseph.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p16" pid="_VS8LWO3W0eBhIbWqUyLvw" hash="9upqEg">The first time Moroni appeared to Joseph Smith, Joseph was a teenage boy of 17 with little formal education. Joseph described himself as “an obscure boy … of no consequence in the world,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> and a friend later called <span class="pageBreak" page-number="97"></span>him “untutored” and “untaught.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> In the hands of a patient and caring teacher like Moroni—and other heaven-sent messengers who instructed him—this young man would become the central figure in what the Lord referred to as “a marvelous work and a wonder.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p17" pid="YsxPI0AYuEmAiDQekCJWpQ" hash="lpmn3Q">What are some of the principles of teaching and learning we might identify by observing the way Moroni taught Joseph Smith? There are a number of important principles we could discuss, but let us focus on three basic principles essential to good teaching.</p>
      <div class="topic" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.t2">
        <h3 class="title" pid="2E44VRmnD0CiLzRDBbr9fg" hash="aAyTwQ">Principle 1: Show Love to Those You Teach and Call Them by Name</h3>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p18" pid="Wkqs0jxX9katJbIbWJMfcg" hash="8BX4iQ">Joseph Smith said that when the angel Moroni first appeared to him, Joseph “was afraid; but the fear soon left” him. What was it that Moroni did to help dispel this fear? Joseph said, “He called me by name.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> Teachers who love their students and call them by name are following a heavenly pattern.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p19" pid="rZroas-ozUSltTpBgxC4Kg" hash="QQ9YEw">In a recent meeting with President Thomas S. Monson, I noticed that he greeted each of us by name. He spoke to us about his boyhood Sunday School teacher Lucy Gertsch, noting that she was a teacher who knew the names of each student in her class. President Monson has said of her: “She unfailingly called on those who missed a Sunday or who just didn’t come. We knew she cared about us. None of us has ever forgotten her or the lessons she taught.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p20" pid="80pqAvAkjUuaRTAmJYRrJw" hash="Wfp5hA">Another teaching principle practiced by Moroni is that he knew and taught from the scriptures. Joseph Smith said that at their very first meeting, Moroni “commenced quoting the prophecies of the Old Testament. … He quoted many other passages of scripture, and offered many explanations.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span> From the many scriptures quoted by Moroni, Joseph learned about his prophetic role in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the Restoration of the true gospel again to the earth.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span></p>

      <div class="topic" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.t4">
        <h3 class="title" pid="TUIFVwjZ0k2HTGuILFu5zA" hash="PULstw">Principle 3: Encourage the Pondering of Gospel Truths</h3>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p21" pid="OCXLTvH9r0W0h7XDnjtqtQ" hash="sNU4xw">A third principle employed by Moroni in teaching Joseph Smith was to cause him to ponder on what he had been taught. Joseph states that after his third meeting with Moroni, he “was again left to ponder on … what [he] had just experienced.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span> Effective teachers will want to follow the pattern of the resurrected Christ among the Nephites when He asked the multitude to return to their “homes, and ponder upon the things” He had taught them so that they might “understand.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span></p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p22" pid="iWlaeTEhOUS7I2caYwWK5Q" hash="-LvWaA">Nephi reminds us that the act of pondering involves using not only our heads but also our hearts. He said, “My heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_27">27</span> The act of pondering on the scriptures and the things we have seen and heard invites personal revelation to come into our lives.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/gospel-teaching-our-most-important-calling.p23" pid="6t2ZdACILESro-QevNAowA" hash="DQ_tGg">I testify that teaching the gospel <span class="pageBreak" page-number="98"></span>is a sacred and holy calling. When you love your students and call them by name, when you open the scriptures and teach from them, and when you encourage your students to ponder the truths of the restored gospel and apply them, then your influence for good will be magnified and the lives of your students will be blessed more abundantly. In that glorious day, they will say to you as it was said of Jesus of Nazareth, “We know that thou art a teacher come from God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
