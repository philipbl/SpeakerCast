The President’s greatness is the kind which is not conscious of itself. He truly desires not our adulation but our affirmation by how we live.</p>

This reality was summarized well by the wit that was also wisdom of Richard L. Evans; who, one day on the way to another plane and another weekend of conferences, said gently, “Have you ever gotten homesick on the way to the airport?”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p1" pid="_S79X4aqB0eSsTAslAdv1g" hash="ZtSKLQ">My brothers and sisters, I should like to speak of and to a particular group of important individuals. These are they who fully intend, someday, to begin to believe and/or to be active in the Church. But not yet! These are not bad individuals, but good individuals who simply do not know how much better they could be. Such individuals often stay proximate to—but do not participate fully in—the Church. They will not come inside the chapel, but neither do they leave its porch. These are they who need and are needed by the Church, but who, in part, “live without God in the world.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p2" pid="wUYPsYLUBUWcuwro0zAtKw" hash="-9Y4uA">To such individuals, in the brief, imploring invitation which follows, be assured there is a real craving for your companionship and a genuine need for your unique strengths.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p3" pid="gpUszxzTDUuEUL2oNAhfaQ" hash="sTR3zA">There are reasons for your commitment to be made now, for as the rush of hours, days, and months grows stronger, the will to commit grows weaker. Events to transpire soon on this planet will dry up the options for the lukewarm, for the issues raised by Jesus are irrepressible issues!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p4" pid="K-dn9lmdZkuo10rvzIglsg" hash="MHIm9g">If, however, you really do not wish to commit <span class="emphasis">now,</span> then let me warn of the following:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p5" pid="EcP40X2u80KRF3BIzcc3Ew" hash="hfE6-A">Do not look too deeply into the eyes of the pleasure-seekers about you, for if you do, you will see a certain sadness in sensuality, and you will hear artificiality in the laughter of licentiousness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p6" pid="QjzJ1ERBAEqqQD-Hb7XlEw" hash="uJRbjA">Do not look too deeply, either, into the motives of those who deny God, for you may notice their doubts of doubt.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p7" pid="WdKjx_T1VUe0wcFeJFjpZQ" hash="gBBORQ">Do not risk thinking the unthinkable, lest you find yourself drawn with a deep and powerful pull toward the reality that God does exist, that he loves <span class="emphasis">you,</span> and that finally there is no escaping him or his love!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p8" pid="UEytNHolbEGnLubPZo8k8Q" hash="fPemmg">Do not think too much about what you are teaching your family, for what in you is merely casualness about Christianity may, in your children, become hostility; for what you have not defended, your children may reject angrily.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p9" pid="LVie02g9aEaE05EKcLXsGQ" hash="JgcY8g">Do not reflect on the practicality of gospel standards such as abstaining from alcohol; for if you do, a surf of statistics will wash over you, confirming that abstinence is ultimately the only cure for alcoholism that is both preventive and redemptive. You will also see that the living of one protective principle of the gospel is better than a thousand compensatory governmental programs—which programs are, so often, like “straightening deck chairs on the Titanic.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p10" pid="39GMmvti70WuQnkXtJF9tw" hash="UOZY7A">Do not think too much, either, about other doctrines, such as the importance of love at home; because if you think about them very long—in a world full of orphans with parents—you will be grasped by a reality that will make your teeth chatter.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p11" pid="_T7aYiRjDkeg518-ZUwyTQ" hash="7Jxdug">Do not think, either, about the doctrine that you are a child of God, for if you do, it will be the beginning of belonging.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p12" pid="71zeWRaPfk6vWJHfqXUz4Q" hash="O_WP6g">Do not dare to read the Book of Mormon seriously, or you may suddenly realize that it is inlaid with incredibly important insights from a millennium of sacred history.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p13" pid="Dyrs4GMVaE6ChKe3v_oKAA" hash="MaIJ5Q">Do not overpack the luggage you plan to take with you when you leave this world, for we simply cannot get most mortal things by celestial customs; only the eternal things are portable.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p14" pid="qpsG6XtrA0exp6wNskE_Xg" hash="HmfVCg">Do not pray, for you will get answers from a listening and loving Father.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p15" pid="Aq58g4n95kW6r6CMi9_8Og" hash="9B1rUQ">Do not think too much, either, about the possibility that there are living prophets in the world today. Think instead about how those who are so sustained seem quite ordinary in many ways. Forget that other prophets were fishermen and tentmakers—ordinary enough to scarcely be noticed—<span class="emphasis">except</span> for what they said and what they did! For the winds of tribulation, which blow out some men’s candles of commitment, only fan the fires of faith of these special men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p16" pid="kqxXcvmLZUOoXvVAlZHVTw" hash="tvzpxQ">Do not let yourself reflect too much on the social, political, and economic indicators that suggest the gathering storm, lest you realize that there is an inseparable connection between the keeping of the commandments and the well-being of society.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p17" pid="mIsexrZPT0eld496iTHJJw" hash="QGvQ3Q">Do not read what the holiest inhabitant ever to live on this planet said about the necessity of certain ordinances, or you will see that he allowed for no exceptions, including himself.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p18" pid="eD90siymJUeH4GPtaZ8CdQ" hash="1tmzEA">Do not search the scriptures to see if good people still need the Church, for the best being who ever lived organized the Church—because random, individual goodness is not enough in the fight against evil.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p19" pid="jj6s1rHjUEaxAv4eaTpvWw" hash="p4uqmQ">Do not, if you have been offended, recall that while you may have been bumped by an ecclesiastical elbow, the chip was on your shoulder long before the elbow appeared.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p20" pid="7BdnuEggjkmedUSwSDHwPg" hash="5KTTJg">Do not be fully honest about the hypocrisy of those in the Church who may pretend to be better than they are, or you will soon realize that there is also another form of hypocrisy—appearing to be <span class="emphasis">less</span> committed than one really is!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p21" pid="pCy9F01WcU2GzEdIvqk1lg" hash="FmS2FA">Yes, brothers and sisters, it is best to avoid all such things as these <span class="emphasis">if</span> you wish to continue to delay deciding about Christ and his church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p22" pid="-WYdh_k8fEWxmQyjyZkRBw" hash="8w01lw">However, Joshua didn’t say choose you next year whom you will serve; he spoke of “this day,” while there is still daylight and before the darkness becomes more and more normal. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/24.15" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 24:15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p23" pid="rO-Oxic8M06DK5ZH3IGbAQ" hash="K-BwAA">When Jesus called his first disciples, the scriptures record that they left their ships and nets “straightway.” They didn’t ask to join Jesus <span class="emphasis">after</span> the fishing season; they didn’t even delay their response in order to make just one more catch. They left “straightway”! (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/4.20" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 4:20</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p24" pid="M2IkPAyYJU2loyqZPBL7Jg" hash="GfZgCQ">Act, my brothers and sisters, for once the soul is tilted toward belief, and once there is even a desire to believe, then marvelous things begin to happen! Once one leaves the porch and comes inside the Church, then one not only hears the music more clearly—he becomes a part of it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p25" pid="uFEkJxeR0EGIUpJywnZuDQ" hash="dPQqSg">Act now, so that a thousand years from now, when you look back at this moment, you can say this was a moment that mattered—this was a day of determination.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p26" pid="tPOyNJ1xfEWX2mJHvBe9Lw" hash="jgdhxw">Never mind, therefore, that you have made an investment of self and time in inactivity. Never mind that there is an accumulation of pride that will make it difficult to acknowledge that you have been wrong, for it will never be easier to do than it is now.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p27" pid="-pfpMQ-3ZE-wqKJ0OXDOvA" hash="lxtXaA">All must know that feeling which is associated with a broken heart and a contrite spirit—by which we are cleansed by the hot, holy fire of a special shame, so that we might, thereafter, have a more pure love and a greater capacity to serve both God and man. Hearts “set so much upon the things of this world” are hearts <span class="emphasis">so set</span> they must first be broken.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p28" pid="86_D2iqe2EiMIkRzV_Wdwg" hash="YIrvsw">Indeed, one of the most cruel games anyone can play with self is the “not yet” game—hoping to sin just a bit more before ceasing; to enjoy the praise of the world a little longer before turning away from the applause; to win just once more in the wearying sweepstakes of materialism; to be chaste, but not yet; to be good neighbors, but not now. One can play upon the harpstrings of hesitations and reservations just so long, and then one faces that special moment—a moment when what has been sensed, mutely, suddenly finds voice and cries out with tears, “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/9.24" class="scriptureRef">Mark 9:24</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p29" pid="cdtQs6n4TU-UxuNeADV6qw" hash="iKH8Xg">The truth is that “not yet” usually means “never.” Trying to run away from the responsibility to decide about Christ is childish. Pilate sought to refuse responsibility for deciding about Christ, but Pilate’s hands were never dirtier than just after he had washed them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p30" pid="Ildrd_GNAUyP3Y6w03OnSw" hash="GP6OLQ">The past of each of us is now inflexible. We need to concentrate on what has been called “the holy present,” for now is sacred; we never really live in the future. The holy gift of life always takes the form of now. Besides, God asks us now to give up only those things which, if clung to, will destroy us!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p31" pid="Uvys_HwIo0-LOHs3-h_sFA" hash="nY18zw">And when we tear ourselves free from the entanglements of the world, are we promised a religion of repose or an Eden of ease? No! We are promised tears and trials and toil! But we are also promised final triumph, the mere contemplation of which tingles one’s soul.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p32" pid="KRcWSjm8-k6qABSbyhU6SA" hash="6cFaCg">My friends, there are footprints to follow where we must go—made not by a leader who said, safely from the sidelines, “Go thither,” but by a leader who said, “Come, follow me.” And our mortal leader is a prophet who is showing us how to lengthen our stride.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p33" pid="3RL6Ga4KrU6EgMc5HATpPg" hash="a_LKrw">Yes, for those in the Church’s courtyard or on its porch, ask not “for whom the [Church] bell tolls; It tolls for thee.” (John Donne, <span class="emphasis">Devotions upon Emergent Occasions,</span> Meditation XVII.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p34" pid="ETWWKDsss0CmoSEHSSJlYw" hash="W525kQ">And, if you sense that one day every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord, why not do so now? For in the coming of that collective confession, it will mean much less to kneel down when it is no longer possible to stand up!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1974/10/why-not-now.p35" pid="0sJZ-7ImD0q16lvFD0x6AQ" hash="e1e-ag">Meanwhile, may we be different in order to make a difference in the world. And may God hasten that time for all our sakes, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Those already in the household of faith may be pardoned a tremble or two as they read the graphic description of the challenging journey facing the serious disciple—whom Helaman called, “the man of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.29" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 3:29</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p2" pid="hGHnVVTr_U6tXpnTwuEfvA" hash="mjGgRg">This is a brief attempt to describe just a few of the things the men and women of Christ will feel and see in the course of that adventurous journey.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p3" pid="lsbFK2_Vb0aajlghn6zF_g" hash="82N-yA">Regarding events in the world, “the man of Christ” sees trends around him “about which it is difficult to speak, but impossible to remain silent.” Because he sees with “an eye of faith,” he knows more than he can tell; but he need not always be fully articulate, for real Christianity is contagious.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p4" pid="aMrXOQYat0GyPhKfO9xoPQ" hash="feNDIw">He believes deeply in the Beatitudes, but also in those doctrines which tell him “who” Jesus is. He does not divorce the Sermon on the Mount from the sermon at Capernaum with its hard teachings which caused many to walk “no more with” Jesus. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.66" class="scriptureRef">John 6:66</a>.) These latter doctrines are likewise a part of the bracing breeze of the scriptures which must be played upon the fevered brow of mankind.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p5" pid="gmFzxEZITEiCoBnPU-jwPw" hash="h1cPww">He knows that “the gate of heaven is open unto all,” but that the Man of Galilee will finally judge each of us on the basis of a rigorous celestial theology, instead of the popular “no-fault theology” of this telestial world—for Jesus is the gatekeeper “and he employeth no servant there.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.41" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:41</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p6" pid="D4wHvem0SkGDdZ96Te9pfg" hash="gPkDow">“The man of Christ” knows that a loving, living, and revealing God did not, as some imply, suddenly lose interest in mankind about <small>A.D.</small> 100, grow bored, and wander off into space. The disciple worships an unchanging God, and proclaims that the good tidings are brought anew; for the gospel is not merely a gospel for one age, for one people, or for one place—it is a gospel for the galaxies!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p7" pid="tcyBClB8tEuNNk2cp3qo6g" hash="gRTbMg">He sees that only the gospel can really help us avoid the painful excesses in the tug-of-war between the need for liberty and the need for order. He knows, for instance, that true law enforcement depends on the policing of one’s self. If the sentry of self fails, there are simply not enough other policemen to restrain those who will not restrain themselves, and beating the system will become the system.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p8" pid="dw18QMg1zk-49_l7D4Qqkg" hash="l11Wfg">He sees that those who worship at the altar of appetite are very intense. To be fully effective against their enveloping evil, there must exist a sin-resistant strain of souls for whom narcotics, prostitution, gambling, and alcohol hold no allure, for we bind the adversary and his mortal minions only as we bind our appetites.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p10" pid="muFG6LoLskiHvVmz9vdbGA" hash="fOPQeA">He sees prevention, especially through good families, as a superior life-style. Parents, therefore, should stay at their posts. If those at the front lines are persuaded to leave their posts to help the reserves build “promising” fall-back fortifications, such parents simply guarantee that both the front lines, and all other lines of defense, will be savagely overrun. Parents, like a symphony conductor, lead those who actually produce the music; we would be dismayed, however, if an anxious conductor deserted his podium in mid-passage to become a flutist.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p11" pid="1URGnBiFFUerx_-_hzwYpg" hash="dyQyeQ">He sees that those who do too much <span class="emphasis">for</span> their children will soon find they can do nothing <span class="emphasis">with</span> their children.

He knows he cannot enjoy the quietude of one age and the technology of another; he will not, therefore, as some do, demand to have “the Victorian age, but with penicillin.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p18" pid="SitIEZKBfUS6GVSKvjhiqg" hash="PwP6bA">As “the man of Christ” looks realistically at life in the Church, he sees and feels still other things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/the-man-of-christ.p19" pid="DWsdMLCAOUyantWS8fhP7Q" hash="JOvwfQ">He marvels not that the gospel net “gather[eth] of every kind” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.47" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 13:47</a>); he knows that while the Church’s doctrines are constant and perfect, its people are not, so he seeks to learn from mistakes rather than brooding over them, and he will help others to do the same.</p>

He understands that faith, hope, and charity qualify one for the work, not a craving for clout.

When he sings, “I’ll go where you want me to go, dear Lord” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 75), it is not only a promise to go to a Nineveh, but it is also a pledge to stay at his present post.</p>

Some seek to substitute Caesars for Christ. Others are blinded because they are “looking beyond the mark” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.14" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:14</a>) when the mark is Christ. Many sects—without the reinforcing rods of revelation—have been badly shaken by theological tremors; the resulting ecclesiastical erosion has been so rapid it is measured in months, not centuries. Some crusaders without a cross have actually removed the divinity of Jesus Christ from the center of their doctrines—only to see all the other doctrinal dominoes tumble, too.</p>

He helped to prepare this planet for us and led—not pushed—us from our premortal post. I thank him for the untold things he did, across the ages of that first estate, to prepare perfectly for his unique role—while I was doing so very much less. I thank him, further, for not deserting those of us who are slow or stragglers.</p>

I thank him for encapsulating that exquisite mind in both perfect love and perfect humility. His brilliance is not the “catch-me-if-you-can” kind, but a pleading and patient, “Come, follow me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/18.22" class="scriptureRef">Luke 18:22</a>.)</p>

I thank him for combining his long view of our needs with a short step forward to volunteer his services. Never has anyone offered so much to so many in so few words as when Jesus said, “Here am I, send me.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.27" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:27</a>.)</p>

His grasp is galactic, yet he noticed the widow casting in her mite. I am stunned at his perfect, unconditional love of all. Indeed, “I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me.” (“I Stand All Amazed,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 80.)</p>

I thank him for declining this specious offer since all eternity would have been shaken, for Jesus’ grip on himself was also mankind’s hold on the future.</p>

He who did not need to die himself was willing to be bound by the chains of death so he could break them for all mankind. I testify that he is thereby our advocate with the flawless Father. I thank him for letting us decide how we will regard him, our Rescuer. I thank him for his discerning way of knowing us without controlling us, for never letting the needs of now crowd out the considerations of eternity.</p>

I thank him for likewise not interceding on our behalf, even when we pray in faith and reasonable righteousness, for that which would not be right for us. Our glimpse of Gethsemane should teach us that all prayers are petitions!</p>

I thank him for helping me, even forgiving me, when I fall short, when I testify of things known but which are beyond the border of my behavior, and for helping me to advance that border, bit by bit. His relentless redemptiveness exceeds my recurring wrongs.</p>

To them, to Elder Richards and the members of the First Quorum of the Seventy I pledge that my little footnote on the page of the quorum’s history will read clearly that I wore out my life in helping to spread Jesus’ gospel and helping to regulate his church. To worthy predecessor presidents, my admiration. Thirty years ago President Dilworth Young ordained me a seventy, but only after extracting a promise that I would preach the gospel the rest of my life. His stern demeanor was such that I felt I’d been asked to jump off a tall building. I went over the side saluting. Now I salute that same selfless, sweet seventy, President Young, once again.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p2" pid="a1ZXUyvqEE-xSyczl3JDfQ" hash="2UyFDw">Now may I speak, not to the slackers in the Kingdom, but to those who carry their own load and more; not to those lulled into false security, but to those buffeted by false insecurity, who, though laboring devotedly in the Kingdom, have recurring feelings of falling forever short.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p3" pid="LeD21_5MhESBKnN5OAi7hg" hash="YB5UtA">Earlier disciples who heard Jesus preach some exacting doctrines were also anxious and said, “Who then can be saved?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.26" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:26</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p4" pid="3QcwBSoWBkWfkMrWcEfooQ" hash="_5iQLA">The first thing to be said of this feeling of inadequacy is that it is normal. There is no way the Church can honestly describe where we must yet go and what we must yet do without creating a sense of immense distance. Following celestial road signs while in telestial traffic jams is not easy, especially when we are not just moving next door—or even across town.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p5" pid="KdOh6flloEOq07jWoK6EFw" hash="d6hfYA">In a Kingdom where perfection is an eventual expectation, each other’s needs for improvement have a way of being noticed. Perceptive Jethro had plenty of data to back up the crisp counsel he gave his son-in-law Moses. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/18.title" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 18</a>.) Even prophets notice their weaknesses. Nephi persisted in a major task “notwithstanding my weakness.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 33:11</a>.) Another Nephite prophet, Jacob, wrote candidly of his “over anxiety” for those with whom he was not certain he could communicate adequately. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.18" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:18</a>.) Our present prophet has met those telling moments when he has felt as if he could not meet a challenge. Yet he did.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p6" pid="nZf2zFdBB0Kr6XW4fvbPbA" hash="IwlggQ">Thus the feelings of inadequacy are common. So are the feelings of fatigue; hence, the needed warning about our becoming weary of well-doing. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:33</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p7" pid="Kczqey9sKEKwxiBrbXmAYQ" hash="WjQD7Q">The scriptural advice, “Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 10:4</a>) suggests paced progress, much as God used seven creative periods in preparing man and this earth. There is a difference, therefore, between being “anxiously engaged” and being over-anxious and thus underengaged.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p8" pid="fiK-gcAbGESCx8bFlCZVGg" hash="3DHZcA">Some of us who would not chastise a neighbor for his frailties have a field day with our own. Some of us stand before no more harsh a judge than ourselves, a judge who stubbornly refuses to admit much happy evidence and who cares nothing for due process. Fortunately, the Lord loves us more than we love ourselves. A constructive critic truly cares for that which he criticizes, including himself, whereas self-pity is the most condescending form of pity; it soon cannibalizes all other concerns.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p9" pid="l4KkcTU4RUC9k78AiqfTMw" hash="v12BXA">Brothers and sisters, the scriptures are like a developmental display window through which we can see gradual growth—along with this vital lesson: it is direction first, <span class="emphasis">then</span> velocity! Enoch’s unique people were improved “in process of time.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.21" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:21</a>.) Jesus “received not of the fulness at first, but received grace for grace” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:12</a>) and even He grew and “increased in wisdom and stature” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.52" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:52</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p10" pid="bISosrfuoUqCUcFw6fR2Tg" hash="3kmCvw">In the scriptural display window we see Lehi struggling as an anxious and “trembling parent.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.14" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 1:14</a>.) We see sibling rivalries but also deep friendships like that of David and Jonathan. We see that all conflict is not catastrophe. We view misunderstandings even in rich relationships like that of Paul and Barnabas. We see a prophet candidly reminding King Saul that there was a time when “thou wast little in thine own sight.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/15.17" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 15:17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p11" pid="e3DtivrQbUWxGufuxsBdvw" hash="Zu33QA">We see our near-perfect parents, Adam and Eve, coping with challenges in the first family, for their children, too, came trailing traits from their formative first estate.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.title" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 13</a>.) We see a jailed John the Baptist—and there had been “no greater prophet” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.11" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:11</a>)—needing reassurance (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.2-4" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:2–4</a>). We see Peter walking briefly on water but requiring rescue from Jesus’ outstretched hand (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/14.25-31" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 14:25–31</a>); later we see Peter stretching his strong hand to Tabitha after helping to restore her to life (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/9.36-46" class="scriptureRef">Acts 9:36–46</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness.p13" pid="5q2boSdccUemq7prHd900Q" hash="bW5CJQ">Moroni was not the first underinformed leader to conclude that another leader was not doing enough. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/60.title" class="scriptureRef">Alma 60</a>.) Nor was Pahoran’s sweet, generous response to his “beloved brother” Moroni the last such that will be needed.

The cares and pleasures of the world, temptation, persecution, tribulation—all take their toll; so do being wronged, being ignored, and seeing hypocrisy in others. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.21" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 13:21</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.10" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:10</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/8.13-14" class="scriptureRef">Luke 8:13–14</a>.)</p>

Unlike those who have never heard the gospel, these individuals have known some light and so have some accountability—hence the urgency!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/a-brother-offended.p3" pid="xbombxFeL0C_plXiYfA8hw" hash="lckpVA">This work of reactivation often involves group study and socials, but, essentially, it is done a soul at a time, quietly and with dignity. It is done less “by the numbers” and more “by the Spirit.” It is less technique than genuine caring, more extending a helping hand than writing new handbooks.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/a-brother-offended.p4" pid="iUh9UbyAxECIJSQC8F7G9A" hash="xLqkxg">There are no slick tricks, and quickie campaigns usually fail, for “a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/18.19" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 18:19</a>.) Further, while we must stand on higher ground in order to lift another, there must be no condescension or suggestion that our concern is statistical rather than spiritual. Nor are souls to be dropped soon after they have been painstakingly lifted. How many times are we supposed to find the elect anyway?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/a-brother-offended.p5" pid="ahbfG6hYDUifvN9WxOwxnA" hash="hS1DzQ">A <span class="emphasis">first</span> step is to recognize, where known, the causes of inactivity in these men. This often suggests how to customize our expressions of concern. However, never underestimate the power of privately extending a simple, loving, but direct challenge. Though it may not be reciprocated, such love is never wasted.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Second,</span> recognize that this work takes time; it does interrupt our regular routine. The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us that. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/10.29-37" class="scriptureRef">Luke 10:29–37</a>.) Some wounds require more than a quick Band-Aid.</p>

Organized love is better than generalized concern. Yet this redemptive labor should not be so institutionalized that friends and neighbors feel released from their responsibilities. An inspired effort is needed, for in the work of reactivation the <span class="emphasis">best</span> approach may be the <span class="emphasis">only</span> approach! Fasting and praying may be necessary to know when the timing is right to make an approach to a certain brother.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Fourth,</span> provide such individuals with a fresh opportunity to serve, because they are genuinely needed. Moses learned this principle while recruiting Hobab as a guide. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/num/10.29-32" class="scriptureRef">Num. 10:29–32</a>.) Remember, while their condition cries out for unconditional love, they usually desire a modest chance to express their own love and talents. For instance, elders quorum presidencies should organize several appropriate committees, each chaired by an active elder, who is to report regularly to the quorum presidency, with two or three active brethren to help. Each committee may be given the names of the inactive brethren most likely to respond when invited to serve on that committee, such as an athletic or welfare committee. These inactive men are less likely to respond to a general invitation to start coming to church than to a request to serve on a specific committee which takes account of their interests. One inactive brother started serving as a greeter and is now a bishop.</p>

Quorum instruction and Gospel Essentials classes must be of a high quality. Attendees must feel the Spirit as they are taught. These individuals need the bread of life, not crumbs from the table. After all, the father of the prodigal son prepared a feast for the returnee—he did not merely warm up some leftovers!</p>

Of the remainder, experience shows that eight out of ten, properly approached, will permit priesthood leaders to go into their homes to teach them.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/04/a-brother-offended.p13" pid="eHU7d3nZbUa5hiROiu5vTA" hash="JLkwLw">These encouraging statistics suggest how important it is not to stand by and wring our hands but to do something! The reason, frankly, brethren, that so little is happening is that so little is being tried. An experienced woodcarver was asked how one begins to be a woodcarver. He said bluntly, “Start making some chips.” Brethren, let’s start making some chips!</p>

He can bring about those circumstances in which such souls are “in a preparation to hear the word.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:6</a>.) His Spirit can prod the prodigals—some of whom will come to their senses.

        <span class="emphasis">Seventh,</span> prevention is always better than rehabilitation. Sometimes, ironically, prevention requires no more than a few extra minutes of loving conversation or an expression of empathy. Being given the priesthood and a church assignment soon after baptism not only helps to anchor new converts, but assists other Church workers who are busy and whose hands hang down and whose knees are feeble.

Things looked really ominous for the flock. They were understandably fearful as the establishment closed in on them. The danger to the disciples was real; hence Jesus encouraged them to leave. Then their Savior submitted to arrest, trial, and even crucifixion! The disciples felt keenly the deprivation and the humiliation of those circumstances, which—though warned of—they still had not fully expected. Yet, very soon, just as foreordained, these faithful undershepherds rallied and went on with the Savior’s glorious work.</p>

For instance, he told the original Twelve to be of good cheer when, on the surface, there was nothing to be cheerful about. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.33" class="scriptureRef">John 16:33</a>.) The indescribable agonies of Gethsemane were imminent. Judas’s betrayal lay immediately ahead. Likewise, Jesus’ arrest and arraignment. The Twelve would be scattered like sheep. Jesus’ unjust and mocking trial and His terrible scourging were but hours away. The shrill and disappointing cry of the mob—to release Barabbas instead of Jesus—would soon echo in the air. Then would come the final, awful moments on Calvary!</p>

Death would be irrevocably defeated! Satan would have failed to stop the unfolding plan of salvation! All mankind would be given—through the grace of God—immortality! Additionally, for those who would earn it, there would be the richness of eternal life! These were among the resplendent realities and the fundamental facts which justified the Twelve’s being of good cheer—not their grim, temporary circumstances!

(<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/23.11" class="scriptureRef">Acts 23:11</a>.) Once again, the circumstances of the moment included Paul’s having been struck publicly on the mouth by order of Ananias. Forty individuals were plotting his death. He faced a trial for sedition. Why, therefore, should he be of good cheer? Because, Jesus announced, though in bad circumstances, Paul would soon take the good news of the gospel to Rome!</p>

They, too, were told by the Lord to be of good cheer. Why? Because, said Jesus, “On the morrow come I into the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.13" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 1:13</a>.) With His birth, the mortal ministry of the Messiah would, at last, be launched!</p>

In the fall of 1842, rumors were rife of armed mobs on their way to Nauvoo. His beloved Emma was often ill, and there were concerns she would not recover. Joseph was hunted in the City of Joseph. In this same period, of Joseph’s circumstance we learn that upon his return home on one occasion he found “Emma sick … delivered of a son, which did not survive its birth.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:209.)</p>

He found himself disapproving of much of what he saw in the world and wondering if he had a work yet to do. His loving brother, Phineas, gave Brigham prescient counsel: “Hang on, for I know the Lord is agoing to do some thing for us.” (Sermon of Heber C. Kimball in minutes, 8 Jan. 1845, Brigham Young Papers, Historical Department, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.) What then happened is Moses-like history!</p>

If, for instance, our attitude towards life depends upon the praise of men, the level of interest rates, the outcome of a particular election or athletic contest—we are too much at the mercy of men and circumstance. Nor should our gratitude for the gift of mortal life depend upon the manner in which we die, for surely none of us will rush eagerly forward to tell Jesus how we died!</p>

The coming decades will be times of despair. Why? Because, as Moroni said, despair comes of iniquity. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.22" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:22</a>.) The more iniquity, the more despair. And unless there is widespread repentance, despair will both deepen and spread—except among those who have gospel gladness.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:35</a>.) War has been the almost continuing experience of modern man. There have been 141 wars, large and small, just since the end of World War II in 1945. As the American Civil War was about to begin, the Lord declared there would be a succession of wars poured out upon all nations, resulting in the “death and misery of many souls.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 87:1</a>.)</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/6.11" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 6:11</a>.) And in the midst of such affliction, if we are righteous and we die, we die unto Him; and if we live, we live unto Him.

By developing our individual capacities, wisely exercising our agency, and trusting God—including when we feel forsaken and alone—then we can, said President Young, learn to be “righteous in the dark.” (Secretary’s Journal, 28 Jan. 1857.)

It is unlikely, for instance, on that night so long ago in Bethlehem, that Joseph and Mary looked at the newly born Christ child’s feet with the realization that those feet would, one day, walk the length and breadth of the Holy Land.

Godfrey, <span class="emphasis">Women’s Voices,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1982, p. 147.)

A few will stumble because, in their preoccupation with the cares of the world, they do not have oil in their lamps. And, again and again, those who refuse to eat their spiritual spinach will come off second when they wrestle with the world. Some, because of the scorn of the world, will grow ashamed and let go of the iron rod. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.28" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:28</a>.)

Granted, the human scene also includes many individuals who go happily about life’s labors untouched by these feelings.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1983/10/joseph-the-seer.p2" pid="dLpJ0vYCukSH7ViDhJtkTQ" hash="ZJM2qg">Young Joseph was told that his name would be “both good and evil spoken of” throughout the world. (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.33" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:33</a>.) Except from a divine source, how audacious a statement! Yet his contemporary religious leaders, then much better known than Joseph, have faded into the footnotes of history, while the work of Joseph Smith grows constantly and globally.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:11–12</a>.) Joseph did not have the skilled, formal tutoring young Saul had at the feet of Gamaliel.

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.5,8,15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:5, 8, 15</a>.) However designated, it represents what Amulek called the “great plan of the Eternal God” without which mankind would unavoidably perish. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.9" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-great-plan-of-the-eternal-god.p3" pid="K776LbEP2UGWpkJABCAlVA" hash="DHR3SA">The plan is a most stunning example of the precious perspective of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, full faith in the Lord Jesus Christ includes and requires full faith in His Father’s plan of salvation.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-great-plan-of-the-eternal-god.p5" pid="pQ5FT-2W_EuQNPU_4XQEwA" hash="0HS6XQ">So vital is this framework that if one stays or strays outside it, he risks provinciality and misery. In fact, most human misery represents ignorance of or noncompliance with the plan. A cessation of such mortal suffering will not come without compliance to it. Hence, the Lord, who has freely shared this vital knowledge with us, has urged us to teach the fundamentals of this plan “freely.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.58" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:58</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-great-plan-of-the-eternal-god.p6" pid="jNKGJscW502VqUTG6P-YbQ" hash="33d7sA">At the center of the Father’s plan is Jesus Christ, mankind’s Redeemer. Yet, as foreseen, many judge Jesus “to be a thing of naught” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 19:9</a>), or “consider him” merely “a man.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:9</a>.) Whether others deny or delimit Jesus, for us He is our Lord and Savior! Comparatively, brothers and sisters, it matters very little what people think of us, but it matters very much what we think of Him. It matters very little, too, who others say we are; what matters is who we say Jesus is. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.13-17" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:13–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/04/the-great-plan-of-the-eternal-god.p7" pid="Akx5A04_00OU6qZqCaGx2g" hash="BAfC-Q">For instance, we appreciate not only the towering divinity of Jesus Christ, but His breathtaking mobility and the scope of His shepherding. The resurrected Jesus revisited the Middle East scene of His mortal messiahship. Then some souls in the Americas. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.title" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne 11</a>.) And then His other lost sheep. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.4" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 17:4</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.24" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:24</a>.) He labors, lovingly and constantly, as Moses and Jeremiah declared, “for our good always.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/6.24" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 6:24</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/32.title" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 32: 38–40</a>.) In His grand design, His “work” and “glory” are “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>.) Thus, even when we truly learn to love God, we must humbly acknowledge that He loved us first. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 4:19</a>.)</p>

Fittingly, one appreciative prophet declared, “O how great the plan of our God!” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:13</a>.) Enoch wept when he saw the sweep of history and the unnecessary human misery. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.41" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:41</a>.) But he also saw the triumph of God’s plan. Another prophet exclaimed: “God … made these things known unto us that we might not perish … because he loveth our souls … ; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation might be made known unto us.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 24:14</a>.)</p>

Then he remembered his father’s prophecies “concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.17" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:17</a>.) In a moment of deep intellectual humility, his “mind caught hold upon this thought.” Out came Alma’s great soul cry: “O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me”! (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:18</a>.)</p>

For a meek Moses struggling with people, fatigued and with all the burdens of leadership. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/num/11.11,14,29" class="scriptureRef">Num. 11:11, 14, 29</a>.) For a Jonah seeking to substitute Tarshish, but still reaching Nineveh and, thereby, receiving a great lesson in compassion. For erring Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, and Thomas B. Marsh to recover their spiritual poise and vote with their feet by traveling westward to rejoin, in reconciliation, and to sustain the plan and its enunciating latter-day prophets.</p>

Or resent the reality that we are to walk by faith during this mortal experience. Yet, as practical and spiritual President Brigham Young said, “There is no saving faith merely upon … acknowledging a fact.” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Brigham Young,</span> sel. John A.

Some easy. Some hard. Some sudden. Others lingering. Therefore, we cannot presume, even by faith, to block all these exits, all the time, and for all people. Nor, if possessed of full, eternal perspective, would we desire so to do.</p>

But God does. Meanwhile, we are in what might be called “the murky middle.” Therein, however, we can still truly know that God loves us, individually and perfectly, even though we cannot always explain the meaning of all things happening to us or around us.

Its truths are crucial to how we see ourselves, others, life, the Lord, and even the universe. Or how we view a baby. Or death. Or the praise and honors of the world.

If we are prepared, we shall neither fear nor fail in our particular time. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:30</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/out-of-obscurity.p" pid="AWMlHrXJBkq3eltRLbcs-w" hash="P4fnnw">Among other things, the past obscurity of the Church is giving way to visibility. Obscurity denotes that which is “generally unknown” and “withdrawn from the centers of activity”: hence, the obscure is often misunderstood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/out-of-obscurity.p" pid="ywcfe34xzkiEgTXUurXvTA" hash="tJEujw">The Lord described how He will bring His latter-day work “forth out of obscurity and out of darkness.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.30" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:30</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 22:12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.23" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 1:23</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.29" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 27:29</a>.) Thus, as foreseen, Christ and His work are becoming a light which can no longer be hidden. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:9</a>.) This emerging reality brings with it its own set of challenges and opportunities. For instance, though the gospel light is small, the adversary knows what it signifies, hence his disproportionate efforts to dim it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1984/10/out-of-obscurity.p" pid="6isjMVRSXk-bVK88_Psa5w" hash="BJsfpQ">Furthermore, God has chosen to work through those whom the world regards as weak and foolish.

With heightened visibility, this fact, too, then creates its own set of challenges. Nevertheless, “God hath chosen the foolish … to confound the wise; … the weak … to confound the … mighty.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1.27" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 1:27</a>.)</p>

Thus, the lesson taught ancient Israel is still relevant: only three hundred warriors were used by Gideon to triumph over Israel’s enemies, “lest Israel vaunt themselves.” (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/judg/7.2" class="scriptureRef">Judg. 7:2</a>.)</p>

Yet these, and all other peoples, will be indelibly and irrevocably blessed by Jesus and His atonement. They, no less than we, are children of an Almighty God and are fully included in His redemptive plans.</p>

In 1910–11 a young Home Secretary defended, in Parliament, the proselyting rights of LDS missionaries in Britain. Amid parliamentary pressures, Winston Churchill held fast for religious tolerance.

I refer to our hesitancy and our holding back in submitting fully to the Lord and His purposes for us.</p>

Such was the case with the righteous young man who knelt sincerely at Jesus’ feet. Lacking one thing, he went away sorrowing and unsubmissive when a particularized challenge was given. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.21-22" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:21–22</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/18.22-23" class="scriptureRef">Luke 18:22–23</a>.) Whether it is walking away without looking back from “great possessions” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.22" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:22</a>), or from a statusful place in the secular synagogue (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/12.42-43" class="scriptureRef">John 12:42–43</a>), or from proud but erroneous attitudes accrued over the years, or merely “straightway” from fishing nets (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/1.18" class="scriptureRef">Mark 1:18</a>), the test is always the same.</p>

Alas, insofar as we “mind the things of the flesh” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.5" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:5</a>), we simply cannot have the “mind of Christ.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.16" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/willing-to-submit.p7" pid="rykjkf6jXkKpKKpptUq5Jg" hash="-XN7DA">Jesus laid down this sobering requirement: “Except ye … become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.3" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/willing-to-submit.p8" pid="AECnC8e-vUS_nSrjTP1e8A" hash="Imcb3w">One of Jesus’ prophets delineated—with submissiveness thrice stipulated—how a disciple can become “as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/willing-to-submit.p9" pid="gD1CAo0k302RAFMlqxccKQ" hash="7FQFxQ">Three other clusters of scriptures stress these towering qualities. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:23</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 13:28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41-42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:41–42</a>.) Stunningly parallel, they form an almost seamless litany of attributes to be developed, with submissiveness at their catalytic center. This repeated clustering is too striking to be random.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/willing-to-submit.p10" pid="LV8hEzUHT0KpBxLRMD7xjQ" hash="C9H4ow">Moreover, the descriptive simplicity of this quality is matched by its developmental difficulty. It is so easy to be halfhearted, but this only produces half the growth, half the blessings, and just half a life, really, with more bud than blossom.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/willing-to-submit.p11" pid="eW_dq7qMck2PLzuMwgQhjQ" hash="R23MAQ">A superficial view of this life, therefore, will not do, lest we mistakenly speak of this mortal experience only as coming here to get a body, as if we were merely picking up a suit at the cleaners. Or, lest we casually recite how we have come here to be proved, as if a few brisk push-ups and deep knee bends would do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/willing-to-submit.p12" pid="z0OXfI1MLEGCoZD45U5JLw" hash="rRG7IA">Just how much submissiveness to circumstance there should be is not treated in these brief remarks. Suffice it to say, God “allotteth unto men” certain things with which we are to be content. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.4" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:4</a>, <a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/4.11" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 4:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/6.8" class="scriptureRef">1 Tim. 6:8</a>.) A missing parent or limb is to be lived without. Yet temper and lust are to be tamed. One’s race is fixed, but one’s genetic endowment offers opportunity to be a careful steward. The submissive soul will be led aright, enduring some things well while being anxiously engaged in setting other things right—all the time discerning the difference.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/willing-to-submit.p13" pid="IBXSJXW_u0KfJR-0giGUWQ" hash="4Ijcsg">Required, in particular, is meekness of mind which recognizes God’s perfect love of us and His omniscience. By acknowledging these reassuring realities and accepting that God desires our full development and true happiness, we are readied even as the learning experiences come. Such meekness requires genuine intellectual honesty, owning up to the learning experiences of the past and listening to the Holy Ghost as he preaches to us from the pulpit of memory.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/willing-to-submit.p14" pid="fOYTVXp_OkmeximyobxxWA" hash="3CxC4A">As the Lord communicates with the meek and submissive, fewer decibels are required, and more nuances are received. Even the most meek, like Moses (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/num/12.3" class="scriptureRef">Num. 12:3</a>), learn overwhelming things they “never had supposed.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:10</a>.) But it is only the meek mind which can be so shown and so stretched—not those, as Isaiah wrote, who “are wise in their own eyes.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/5.21" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 5:21</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.29" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:29</a> and <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/15.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 15:21</a>.)</p>

Hence the lonely crowd in hell.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/willing-to-submit.p16" pid="_TBICxyM4UWjyApKqpon1w" hash="cQWSbw">Spiritual submissiveness means, instead, community and communion as the mind and the heart become settled.

Only then are we beginning to be fully useful to God! How can we sincerely pray to be an instrument in His hands if the instrument seeks to do the instructing?</p>

Likewise, brisk challenges to basic beliefs, and some afflictions, will aid in the development of even greater convictions concerning these basic beliefs. Though it will be the key doctrines which are assailed, after the dust of this dispensation has settled it will be the key doctrines which will have prevailed.</p>

This occurred through Joseph Smith, the “choice seer.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.6" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 3:6</a>.) As when dinner guests arrive nearly all at once, Joseph, as host, received, welcomed, and duly noted each truth. Only later was there time and matured perceptivity to see their relationships and the antiquity of their credentials.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/premortality-a-glorious-reality.p3" pid="VQ117UmxYUy8uPnT0fuNJw" hash="OcNOzA">Among these plain and precious truths was the doctrine of the premortal existence of mankind. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.39,40" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 13:39, 40</a>.) Early on, Joseph received much concerning this truth, but just as the revelations concerning it came incrementally, so did Joseph’s understanding.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/1.5" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 1:5</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.4-5" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 1:4–5</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 1:9</a>.) It was briefly extant after the original Apostles. Alas, however, just as Paul foresaw, the time soon came when Church members did not “endure sound doctrine,” including this one. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 4:3</a>.)</p>

The doctrine does not abuse logic, for “truth is reason,” especially “truth eternal”, but is more than logic alone can fully support. (See <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 292.) It could only come from restoration by modern revelation. It was certainly not abroad in the land of America until Joseph Smith’s articulations.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.12" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 3:12</a>.)

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.3-5" class="scriptureRef">Alma 13:3–5</a>.) By themselves, however, these verses would not have been adequate. Elder Orson Pratt said: “This same doctrine [premortal existence] is inculcated in some small degree in the Book of Mormon.

These startling writings inform us, among many important things, how the Lord tutored Moses, told him of other worlds, and then in regal response told Moses why God created and peopled this planet. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.4-6,8,10,30,37-39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:4–6, 8, 10, 30, 37–39</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/45.18" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 45:18</a>.) These writings indicate that Abraham and others were chosen in premortal councils, just like Jeremiah, long before they were born. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.23" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:23</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/1.5" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 1:5</a>.) Among this distinguished group was the thirteenth President-to-be of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, President Ezra Taft Benson. In fact, we learn that all faithful men of the priesthood were “called and prepared from the foundation of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 13:3</a>), even though, by secular criteria, such are “the weak things of the earth.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.59" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 133:59</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/called-and-prepared-from-the-foundation-of-the-world.p2" pid="x91-ELwKPUaHv_lUuRzVWQ" hash="mIkY_Q">This new information about Enoch is eighteen times that which is in the Bible. Further, we learn from it that a human utopia was once actually achieved, as we receive a portrait of a special people, the City of Enoch. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.17-19" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:17–19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/called-and-prepared-from-the-foundation-of-the-world.p3" pid="2Yz2HRv1EUmXWeGDwgh2Mg" hash="iVUuPA">These tremendous discoveries likewise show us that the gospel of Jesus Christ was taught and its ordinances administered in Adam’s time, in the dawn of human history. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.58-59" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:58–59</a>.) Furthermore, Adam gathered his righteous posterity together three years before his death. He instructed them, blessed them, and prophesied concerning the future. The Lord even appeared at this very special family gathering. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.53-57" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:53–57</a>.)</p>

Would there not be a stir much, much larger than that which has accompanied the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient writings? The secular world, of course, would pay only passing heed and would quickly return to the pressing cares of the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/called-and-prepared-from-the-foundation-of-the-world.p5" pid="SKJcBtgetEeUH389XCGXWQ" hash="vMkfBA">As you already know, these “finds” are but a portion of the abundant Restoration, reflecting the remarkable ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith, through whom there was such an outpouring. Traversing these truths requires more than a casual stroll up sloping foothills; they take us instead up the breathtaking ridges of reality to an Everest of understanding. On a clear day, we can see forever!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/called-and-prepared-from-the-foundation-of-the-world.p6" pid="WYk8bp8WDEy8A22_uH8CnQ" hash="xMlrUw">The Bible, in our present format, totals just under sixteen hundred printed pages from multiple authors. To these have been added nearly nine hundred other printed pages of scripture through the Prophet Joseph Smith—more than from all the writings of Moses, Paul, Luke, and Mormon combined, as these are available today—illustrating the quantitative significance of what has come to us through the Restoration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/called-and-prepared-from-the-foundation-of-the-world.p7" pid="pEh1aQW150WTbRK9DTmbog" hash="hnxGOA">Cited in these brief remarks are only a few verses, the equivalent of only three or four printed pages in our current scriptures. But what enormous, qualitative significance is represented!</p>

Prior to meeting Joseph Smith, Brigham Young said he would have crawled around the earth on his hands and knees to meet someone like Moses who could tell him anything “about God and heaven.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>8:228.) Through Joseph Smith we have additional pages from Moses about God and heaven. We have only to reach to the bookshelf or go to priesthood meeting. Perhaps the way is almost too easy and too simple; we might be more appreciative if on hands and knees. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.41" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:41</a>.) Only by searching the scriptures, not using them occasionally as quote books, can we begin to understand the implications as well as the declarations of the gospel.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.3-5" class="scriptureRef">Alma 13:3–5</a>.) In 1833, further confirmation came. Not only was Jesus “in the beginning with God,” but “man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.29" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:29</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.23-24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:23–24</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.3" class="scriptureRef">John 1:3</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/1.2" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 1:2</a>.)</p>

How can there be real identity without real history? How can one understand his tiny, individual plot without knowing, even a little, about Father’s grand, galactic plans?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/called-and-prepared-from-the-foundation-of-the-world.p13" pid="wCIGxHQum0G540shGgc4fQ" hash="klFxAQ">In 1833, information also came indicating that Jesus grew from “grace to grace” until He received a fulness. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:13</a>.) This is so helpful, especially in view of how the Father and the Son have encouraged us, afresh, to become more like them by developing the requisite qualities in our lives. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:48</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:48</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>.) What Jesus taught in His Sermon on the Mount about striving for this grand goal was said in earnest. Moreover, having been advised that we are to become childlike, we are firmly told of the specific attributes needed. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.3" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:3</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.23" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:23</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 13:28</a>.)</p>

He will be a true patriarch, having the authority of example as well as the authority of the holy priesthood.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/called-and-prepared-from-the-foundation-of-the-world.p15" pid="MKHz6TTMh0WBRywBBghyrA" hash="2T6vmQ">We learn from terse verses that we are not helpless and hapless victims of “original sin.” We are responsible for our own actual and individual sins, not Adam’s, whom the Lord forgave long, long ago. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.53-54" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:53–54</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:38</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.2" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:2</a>.) In fact, “because that Adam fell, we are” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.48" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:48</a>), and “men are, that they might have joy.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.25" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:25</a>.)</p>

Nevertheless, these would be “had again” among the children of men in the last days. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.40-41" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:40–41</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/called-and-prepared-from-the-foundation-of-the-world.p17" pid="FF7EB7HIvUGmasxL4G7BPw" hash="yxxsrQ">My brethren, these truths are “had again.” We possess these precious truths! Now they must come to possess us! We are to search them, to ponder them, to feel them, and to live by them!</p>

We need to ponder their implications as well as believe in their declarations regarding daily and eternal life.</p>

Instead, by laying aside “every weight” of the world and the sins which so “easily beset us,” by looking unto Jesus and by feasting upon His words, we will be able to move forward with intellectual and spiritual vigor. Otherwise, as Paul said, we can become wearied and faint in our minds. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.1-3" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:1–3</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>.) When we understand what was revealed to Adam—“[my] plan of salvation unto all men” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.62" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:62</a>)—then these doctrines are keenly relevant for tomorrow’s trial, Tuesday’s temptation, or next month’s surge of self-pity. After all, chastening, the trial of our faith, and patience are part of the plan. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23.21" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 23:21</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1986/04/called-and-prepared-from-the-foundation-of-the-world.p20" pid="73PNFlSWxUe5Gs1FA0quwg" hash="QAl5dg">It is all so wondrously Christ-centered. Whether in the structure of the atom or of the galaxies, or in the truths about temples and families, for those who have eyes to see, all things “from the beginning of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.4" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 11:4</a>) “bear record of [God].” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.63" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:63</a>.) They are designed to point us to Christ, typifying Him, so that we might follow Him, have faith in Him, and keep His commandments.</p>

It is a place of happy countenances, where justice and mercy as well as righteousness and truth are constant companions. Herein gentleness and generosity prevail, “without compulsory means.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:46</a>.) Coarseness and selfishness are unknown, belonging to a previous and primitive place. Here envy would be a sure embarrassment. Neighbors are esteemed as self. This city, where all the residents keep the first and second great commandments, is a community of striking individuals of one heart and of one mind.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/ot/job/38.4-7" class="scriptureRef">Job 38:4–7</a>.) What we sang then was doubtless an anthem of praise far greater than the “Hallelujah Chorus,” more glorious than Moses’ and Israel’s song after crossing the Red Sea.

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/7.17" class="scriptureRef">John 7:17</a>.) Therefore, do not be surprised when nondoers scoff. Do not be surprised, either, if these doctrines unsettle some. Such was the case when the ancient Apostles filled Jerusalem with their doctrines. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/5.28" class="scriptureRef">Acts 5:28</a>.) And when Jesus focused His hearers on doctrines, “they were astonished at his doctrine.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/22.33" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 22:33</a>.) The only cure for the doctrinal illiteracy of those who murmur will be to learn doctrine. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.24" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:24</a>.)</p>

And when man’s connection with scripture is severed, mortals are tragically deprived of an awareness of spiritual history, blinding the eyes of faith. Thereby shorn of true identity, mortals keep their legs intact, but each walks in his own way. Their arms are acquisitive, but do not reach out in an understanding embrace of life. Their ears function, but they no longer hear the word of the Lord. Though created in God’s image, those thus severed soon forget their Maker. Yet it is not surprising, “For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:13</a>).</p>

In fact, our ninth article of faith declares that God “will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.” [<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.9" class="scriptureRef">A of F 1:9</a>] Thus nourished by a menu blending antiquity and futurity, Church members need never “faint in [their] minds” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.3" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:3</a>). Instead, we can be intellectually vibrant.</p>

Over twenty of these are mentioned in the existing scriptures. Perhaps most startling and voluminous will be the records of the lost tribes of Israel (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 29:13</a>). We would not even know of the impending third witness for Christ except through the precious Book of Mormon, the second witness for Christ! This third set of sacred records will thus complete a triad of truth. Then, just as the Perfect Shepherd has said, “My word also shall be gathered in one” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.14" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 29:14</a>). There will be “one fold and one shepherd” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22.25" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 22:25</a>) in a welding together of all the Christian dispensations of human history (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 128:18</a>).</p>

Moreover, “and the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 27:11</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30.16,18" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 30:16, 18</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/4.7" class="scriptureRef">Ether 4:7</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:32</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:28</a>).</p>

An untaught “rising generation” comes not to “believe … concerning the resurrection, … neither … the coming of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26.1-3" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 26:1–3</a>). Belief in Deity and in the resurrection are usually the first to go: “they had brought no records with them; and they denied the being of their Creator” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/omni/1.17" class="scriptureRef">Omni 1:17</a>).</p>

Several times in the closing period of his life, Joseph Smith noted the fourteen years of particularly intensive revelation which he had experienced, including angelic visitations (see <span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> pp. 349, 360; <span class="emphasis">The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith,</span> comp.

The Restoration has provided sweeping sermons about God’s plan with its rescuing Redeemer, such as from Moses, Abinadi, Ether, Alma, Ammon, and Aaron (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.33-35" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 13:33–35</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/13.2-14" class="scriptureRef">Ether 13:2–14</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.30-33" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:30–33</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/18.36-39" class="scriptureRef">Alma 18:36–39</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.12-14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:12–14</a>). These answer the rhetorical question of one prophet who said: “Why not speak of the atonement of Christ?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.12" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:12</a>).

If some see not, it will be “because they sought it not by faith” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/9.32" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 9:32</a>), but instead stared uncomprehendingly with slit-eyed skepticism.

Through Moses, God described His purpose: “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:39</a>). Furthermore, by viewing the heavens and the galaxies, those who have eyes to see will see “God moving in his majesty and power” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.47" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:47</a>).</p>

Then, on that essentially unchanging mortal stage, we can see things for what they really are, such as the demanding cadence called for by the cares of the world. Like birds and animals performing some inborn ritual, amusing to everyone but the participants, these maneuverings of materialism would be comedy if they were not tragedy. So would the posturings as to power and the thirsty seeking of the praise of the world. The ploys are so transparent when seen in the gospel’s light.</p>

God’s ultimate power is safe, precisely because He possesses ultimate love, justice, mercy, and knowledge. We cannot share in His power without sharing in His attributes.</p>

Jesus said to His disciples, “settle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command you” (JST, Luke 14:28). If not so settled, the turbulence will be severe. If settled, we will not be “tossed to and fro,” whether by rumors, false doctrines, or by the behavioral and intellectual fashions of the world. Nor will we get caught up in the “talk show” mentality, spending our time like ancient Athenians “in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/17.21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 17:21</a>). Why be concerned with the passing preferences of the world anyway? “For the fashion of this world passeth away” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/7.31" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 7:31</a>).</p>

If Jesus were only a man, albeit a very good man, His counsel is merely that of a meridian moralist. It is quite another thing, however, for the Creator of multiple worlds, whose central concern is our individual happiness, to command, “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” Our task, therefore, is to “reconcile [ourselves] to the will of God, and not to the will of … the flesh” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.24" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 10:24</a>).</p>

More mortals die in ignorance of God’s true character than die in actual defiance of Him. Belief in the goodness and power of God is greatly facilitated by understanding His plan of salvation with its crucial allowance for mankind’s moral agency, real moral agency—with real mistakes and with real consequences!

Taking the restored gospel “for a witness” to all the nations of the world involves generations (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.14" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:14</a>), but a “desolating scourge” can cover the land quickly (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/5.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 5:19</a>).

The choking cares and pleasures of this life led to the general rejection of Noah’s prophetic message. Two especially interesting words are used in the Bible to describe Noah’s time: <span class="emphasis">violence</span> and <span class="emphasis">corruption</span> (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/6.11" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 6:11</a>).

Before modern times, global perplexity simply was not possible. Now, there is a quick transmission of some crises and problems from one nation to others—the consequences of debt-ridden economies, the spreading of diseases, the abuse of narcotics, and, perhaps most of all, a shared sense of near-helplessness in the face of such perplexities.

Disciples, instead, walk and “overcome by faith” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.53" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:53</a>), accepting gratefully the evidence of things not seen which are true (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:1</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.21" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:21</a>) and using quietly God’s spiritual gifts.</p>

        <span class="strong">What desirest thou of me?</span> the resurrected Jesus inquired one by one of the Nephite Twelve. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.1" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 28:1</a>.) He knows our individual bearing capacities. He will lead us along, not herd us. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:18</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.40" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:40</a>.)

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/answer-me.p18" pid="Nnghr38pu0iIEb3isRLrrw" hash="lTUALQ">As for what God gives differentially to others, we need not be concerned. Peter, inquiring about John’s future role, was asked by Jesus, “What is that to thee? follow thou me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.22" class="scriptureRef">John 21:22</a>.) Sometimes, brothers and sisters, we do too much comparing and too little following. Sometimes also a few resent God’s having chosen someone else; perceiving themselves as passed over, they then go under spiritually.</p>

However the world ignores or responds to it, this is the reverberating and the great question! (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:5–6</a>.) Can we answer with both our lives and our tongues, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God”? (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.16" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 16:16</a>.) Until we can, whatever else we say and do will, in the end, make little difference.</p>

        <span class="strong">“Will ye also go away?”</span> (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.67" class="scriptureRef">John 6:67</a>), the Master asked His disciples after many of his fair-weather followers went back, and “walked no more with him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.66" class="scriptureRef">John 6:66</a>.) The very process of daily living makes and breaks followers. Life’s stern seasons and storms overturn those not grounded and rooted. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 3:17</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/col/1.23" class="scriptureRef">Col. 1:23</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/5.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 5:10</a>.) However, those who “believe and are sure” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.69" class="scriptureRef">John 6:69</a>) about Jesus’ divinity do not panic, for instance, at the arrival of a new volley of fiery darts; they merely hold aloft the quenching shield of faith.</p>

Some are addressed to all, and some to members as we follow the counsel of an ancient prophet to “consider [our] ways.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/hag/1.7" class="scriptureRef">Hag. 1:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/answer-me.p23" pid="GyYvt5OxJEKOKPL3hbuCJQ" hash="VhxufA">Why is our life-style sometimes blurred and out of focus when we have been told clearly what “manner of men” and women we ought to be? (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/3.11" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 3:11</a>.) Of course, as individuals, we are free to choose! But wrong choices will make us less free. Furthermore, erosive error gradually makes one less and less of an individual. God and His prophets would spare us that shrinkage.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/answer-me.p24" pid="DbqwoWk9XE6NZaVeW8Pv2Q" hash="H5ekUA">Why are a few members, who somewhat resemble the ancient Athenians, so eager to hear some new doubt or criticism? (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/17.21" class="scriptureRef">Acts 17:21</a>.) Just as some weak members slip across a state line to gamble, a few go out of their way to have their doubts titillated. Instead of nourishing their faith, they are gambling “offshore” with their fragile faith. To the question “Will ye also go away?” these few would reply, “Oh, no, we merely want a weekend pass in order to go to a casino for critics or a clubhouse for cloakholders.” Such easily diverted members are not disciples but fair-weather followers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/answer-me.p25" pid="DyCJxw0FHUWCY8IvLx3nfw" hash="mIe_pA">Instead, true disciples are rightly described as steadfast and immovable, pressing forward with “a perfect brightness of hope.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49.23" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 49:23</a>.)</p>

By declaring, “I will walk in my own way and do that which is right in my own eyes,” we reject the curriculum of the mortal school in which we are irrevocably enrolled. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/judg/21.25" class="scriptureRef">Judg. 21:25</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>.) There is only one exit gate leading unto eternal life. Unhappily, only a few find it—but not because God is exclusionary, but because they exclude God from their lives. Even God cannot bring to pass a reconciliation involving only one party.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/answer-me.p27" pid="IVXChbEfBkObI7oqnaPukA" hash="Y7TjRg">Why do some think adultery and similar sins are permissible as long as anything else they do is commendable? The Lord’s focus is not on the one thing we do which is good, but, instead, on the one or more things we still lack in order to have eternal life. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.21" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:21</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.9" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 1:9</a>.) To compose a symphony, to win a battle, or to save a company—each can be a commendable and worthy entry in the book of life, but these do not fully compensate for breaking the seventh commandment. In the arithmetic of heaven, several commendables do not cancel out one inexcusable! The clear command from Jesus is to deny ourselves immorality and “to take up [the] cross daily,” not to indulge ourselves and to take up the cross occasionally! (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/9.23" class="scriptureRef">Luke 9:23</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.30" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:30</a>.) The Old Testament advises, “He that ruleth” himself is better “than he that taketh a city.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/16.32" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 16:32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/answer-me.p28" pid="1VwB25PU0U6fnrhS7fqTFw" hash="vYW46w">Why do some of our youth risk engaging in ritual prodigalism, intending to spend a season rebelling and acting out in Babylon and succumbing to that devilishly democratic “everybody does it”? Crowds cannot make right what God has declared to be wrong. Though planning to return later, many such stragglers find that alcohol, drugs, and pornography will not let go easily. Babylon does not give exit permits gladly. It is an ironic implementation of that ancient boast, “One soul shall not be lost.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.1" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:1</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/answer-me.p29" pid="59wbW6js9UO4wNWRGDVfIg" hash="uzmQWg">The philosophy of ritual prodigalism is “eat, drink, and be merry, … [and] God will beat us with a few stripes.” This is a cynical and shallow view of God, of self, and of life. God never can justify us “in committing a little sin.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.8" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:8</a>.) He is the God of the universe, not some night-court judge with whom we can haggle and plea bargain!</p>

He also knows what good we might have done while AWOL. In any case, what others do is no excuse for the disciple from whom much is required. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/39.4" class="scriptureRef">Alma 39:4</a>.) Besides, on the straight and narrow path, there are simply no corners to be cut. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:3</a>.)</p>

Unable to sustain lasting relationships, shouting, in effect, “I am my own, I am in charge!” they retreat like cowards from their real responsibilities. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.35" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:35</a>.) In such pathetic men or women, so strong is the competition between self-pity and self-indulgence that these urges both come in second! Furthermore, just as gender was of no saving significance in the self-destructive dash of the Gadarene swine to the sea, neither is it today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/answer-me.p32" pid="_WUynaDxCUWOB0xDEifW0g" hash="N8gkXA">God’s work is one of finding, helping, reconciling—not of leaving, betraying, and deserting. Betrayed Uriah, deserted in the fray, represents many. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/2-sam/11.15" class="scriptureRef">2 Sam. 11:15</a>.)</p>

Yet, to aid just one blind man—with clay formed from spittle, “He from thick films [purged] the visual ray, / And on the sightless eyeball [poured] the day.” (Alexander Pope, in Frederic W. Farrar, <span class="emphasis">The Life of Christ,</span> New York: E. P. Dutton and Co., 1893, p. 394; see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/9.6" class="scriptureRef">John 9:6</a>.)</p>

His doctrines are like glistening diamonds with many dimensions, displaying their verity and beauty, facet by facet, depending on the faith and preparation of the beholder.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/answer-me.p37" pid="cBrIRj371kaWlqV0OlIUyQ" hash="30kEfw">Jesus had access to immense power but never used it improperly. He refused to put on a show for sign-seeking Herod. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.8" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:8</a>.) Legions of protective angels waited Christ’s command, a command which never came. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/27.42" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 27:42</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1988/10/answer-me.p38" pid="mN0hvWJYG0ei4AVDjAd_Ig" hash="kqYL2g">Jesus was often misunderstood and rejected. But He felt most forsaken and alone on Calvary—just as the final act of the Atonement was enveloping mankind in His eternal love. Ironically, during the moments when in agony He was benefiting billions upon billions of mortals, He was attended by only a faithful few.</p>

Hence the appropriate symbolism of His bleeding at each and every pore—not just some—in order that “as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:22</a>.)</p>

Irony can try both our faith and our patience. Irony can be a particularly bitter form of such chastening because it involves disturbing incongruity. It involves outcomes in violation of our expectations. We see the best laid plans laid waste.</p>

An intellectual stand is proudly and stubbornly defended even in the face of tutoring truth or correcting counsel. Yet occasionally, as we all know, backing off is really going forward. Sometimes it takes irony to induce that painful but progressive posture.</p>

We feel we deserved better, and yet we fared worse. We had other plans, even commendable plans. Did they not count? A physician, laboriously trained to help the sick, now, because of his own illness, cannot do so.

(<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:19</a>.) This should not surprise us.

They were exemplary at the time of their calls; they are even more so today. They are portable sermons for us all. My sermon was essentially prepared in June. It is for myself as well as for the members of the Church.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p2" pid="a-EC0cgbbEqWRWbmLPSjng" hash="UhHWww">Murmuring is defined as a half-suppressed resentment or muttered complaint. We all remember, in <span class="emphasis">Fiddler on the Roof,</span> Tevye’s verbal asides to God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p3" pid="57doagCJAkWOI8sXo5kWFQ" hash="J7KbrQ">However, just as “a yawn [can be] a silent shout,” <span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> so murmuring can be much more than muted muttering. The real “Addressee” of some of our murmuring is clearly the Lord, as when the people complained against Moses. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/16.8" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 16:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.20" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 16:20</a>.) At least Tevye honestly acknowledged whom he addressed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p4" pid="vEW_6ikN8U2lhxKrTfHYtg" hash="lMRgFg">Murmuring seems to come so naturally to the natural man. It crosses the scriptural spectrum of recorded complaints. We need bread. We need water. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/num/21.5" class="scriptureRef">Num. 21:5</a>.) The needed military reinforcements did not arrive. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/60.title" class="scriptureRef">Alma 60</a>.) “Why did we ever leave Egypt?” (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/num/11.20" class="scriptureRef">Num. 11:20</a>.) “Why did we ever leave Jerusalem?” (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 2:11</a>.) Some, perhaps understandably, murmured over persecution by unbelievers, and others even murmured over what the name of Christ’s church should be. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.1" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 27:1</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.3-4" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:3–4</a>.) Most ironically, the coming forth of more scripture from God was to cause murmuring. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.8" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 29:8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p5" pid="90pzWTgPokOv4eqY1_3DGQ" hash="9qiedg">An early scriptural instance of murmuring involved Cain’s offering to the Lord, illustrating how our intentions are at least as important as our deeds. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.20-21" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:20–21</a>). Cain was “wroth” that Abel’s offering was acceptable but not his. Sometimes, brothers and sisters, we, too, worry if someone else seems to be more favored than we. Worse still, we want to be accepted of the Lord—but on our terms, not His!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p6" pid="dM8zrHGkQ0iJgMe6DvsgCw" hash="h1VuIA">A basic cause of murmuring is that too many of us seem to expect that life will flow ever smoothly, featuring an unbroken chain of green lights with empty parking places just in front of our destinations!</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/20.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 20:11–12</a>.) We beggars are so concerned with our entitlements.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p11" pid="tLqAz6TbqUi-DMzBwseYvg" hash="xdqvDw">Laman and Lemuel murmured against father Lehi for leading them into the wilderness because of the “foolish imaginations of his heart.” (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.11" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 2:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.31" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:31</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.4" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 4:4</a>.)

Lehi noted: “That which ye call anger was the truth.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 1:26</a>.) How often you and I, brothers and sisters, can make that same mistake! Cutting truth does hurt, but its lancing can drain off pride.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p13" pid="v-ULwek1KUuGbJ8uWonX9w" hash="myYJhA">There was murmuring, too, because Nephi broke his steel bow and couldn’t build a ship (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.17" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:17</a>) and because he was seen as trying to “rule over us” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.3" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 5:3</a>). Those same murmurers, however, soon surfeited themselves on the meat brought back by Nephi’s new bow, and they sailed in the ship that Nephi built. How handy inspired but imperfect leaders in the Church are as focal points for our frustrations, especially if circumstances require them to suffer in silence! Having confidence in leaders who keep confidences is part of sustaining them.</p>

Emma Smith was likewise told to “murmur not” when certain things were withheld from her. (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 25:4</a>.)</p>

If the complaint concerns a peer, the murmurer seldom follows Jesus’ counsel, “Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.15" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:15</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p18" pid="dver-44_40SJBeDBwO5hhQ" hash="Ic6uyg">Third, while a murmurer insists on venting his own feelings, he regards any response thereto as hostile. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 1:26</a>.) Furthermore, murmurers seldom take into account the bearing capacity of their audiences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p19" pid="X9YVI4IDnkWFkqHL3nvDlw" hash="KbYkpw">Fourth, murmurers have short memories. Israel arrived in Sinai, then journeyed on to the Holy Land though they were sometimes hungry and thirsty. But the Lord rescued them, whether by the miraculous appearance by quail or by water struck from a rock. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/num/11.31" class="scriptureRef">Num. 11:31</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/17.6" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 17:6</a>.) Strange, isn’t it, brothers and sisters, how those with the shortest memories have the longest lists of demands! However, with no remembrance of past blessings, there is no perspective about what is really going on.</p>

It shouldn’t surprise us, therefore, that Satan, we are told, does not know the mind of God. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p23" pid="GbKlfgenqEmWwhQ71ZXj_A" hash="KtYlBg">Perhaps when we murmur we are unconsciously complaining over not being able to cut a special deal with the Lord. We want full blessings but without full obedience to the laws upon which those blessings are predicated. For instance, some murmurers seem to hope to reshape the Church to their liking by virtue of their murmuring. But why would one want to belong to a church that he could remake in his own image, when it is the Lord’s image that we should come to have in our countenances? (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.19" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:19</a>.)</p>

I talked with Brother Brigham Young and Brother Heber C. Kimball, and I wanted them to be mad like myself; and I saw they were not mad, and I got madder still because they were not.

This is not the murmuring of a superficial follower who is quick to complain and who is slow to endure. Reassurance and further instruction followed with Joseph being told: “My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:7</a>.)</p>

Even faithful father Lehi, for one brief moment, got caught up in the contagion of murmuring. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.20" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 16:20</a>.) Similarly, when Moses lapsed, very briefly, it was under exasperating pressure from rebels. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/num/20.7-12" class="scriptureRef">Num. 20:7–12</a>.) No one knows how to work a crowd better than the adversary.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p37" pid="tOtxQoKyK0C4RLkxDG9ghw" hash="47P3wQ">Instead of murmuring, therefore, being of good cheer is what is needed, and being of good cheer is equally contagious. We have clear obligations to so strengthen each other by doing things “with cheerful hearts and countenances.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:15</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/81.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 81:5</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p38" pid="3dKzk0LWkkOkKx63YVHbcA" hash="tag8LQ">Basic things over which the scriptures say we are to be of good cheer include the transcending blessing that our sins can be forgiven and that Jesus has overcome the world! These are marvelous blessings. Additionally, we are assured that the Lord is in our midst. He will lead us along. He will stand by us. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/16.33" class="scriptureRef">John 16:33</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/9.2" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 9:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61.36" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 61:36</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:18</a>.) By knowing that these everlasting things are firmly in place, can we not, then, better endure irritations, such as a dislocated travel schedule? Besides, brothers and sisters, how can it rain on the just and the unjust alike without occasionally raining on our personal parade? (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.45" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:45</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p39" pid="8Y5T2IlKwkS-6dSnXDrl8g" hash="2NThcA">Of course there are ways provided—formal and informal—for expressing legitimate concerns and complaints, and for doing so productively. These avenues often go unused, especially if one’s real desire is to parade his discontent. Letting off steam always produces more heat than light. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/18.15" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 18:15</a>.) True, we may merely gripe or grumble in a passing way. We may even do it cleverly. Still, even mild murmuring can be more pointed than we may care to admit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p40" pid="ySdHQYvP7UqrmZQ5lJtFfQ" hash="HuBLVg">Some actually question God’s capacity, this in the face of His assurance to us: “I am able to do my own work.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.20,21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 27:20, 21</a>.) Therefore, murmuring can be another form of mocking God’s plan of salvation. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/29.6" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 29:6</a>.) Yes, such individuals say, God has an overall general plan, but we don’t care for His specific timing. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 27:21</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.16" class="scriptureRef">Enos 1:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.24,27" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:24, 27</a>.) Yet the scriptures specifically advise us that “all things must come to pass in their time.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:32</a>; see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 24:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p41" pid="kYn6NKQmbU-AQ3OuXtDLWQ" hash="cBZJsQ">Yes, such individuals may acknowledge God, but they criticize His ways. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.8" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/56.14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 56:14</a>.) We want things to be done in our ways, even though our ways are much lower ways. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/55.8-9" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 55:8–9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p42" pid="-EXk9Fn_H0qaPCEifiWAKg" hash="epYp5w">Furthermore, since God has told us He intends to try our faith and our patience, are not situations of stress the very settings from which such murmuring would emerge? (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23.21" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 23:21</a>.) Of course—unless we are careful.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p43" pid="WzMPLxC4TkCmB2dl7hRsTQ" hash="_lRDrw">God accomplishes things, brothers and sisters, “in process of time.” This calls for our patience. Moreover, doing things in process of time is often His way of either preserving our agency or of providing us with needed opportunity. In fact, certain experiences, over which we might understandably murmur, can actually be for our good. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 105:10</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:7</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/30.27" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 30:27</a>.) Thus you and I may think God is merely marking time, when He is actually marking openings for us, openings which are sorely needed. Even then, we are so slow to use those openings in order to escape from the familiar cell of selfishness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p44" pid="XSUX30d5NkmcPU88YwKaqw" hash="61BUZg">Murmuring can also be noisy enough that it drowns out the various spiritual signals to us, signals which tell us in some cases to quit soaking ourselves indulgently in the hot tubs of self-pity! Murmuring over the weight of our crosses not only takes energy otherwise needed to carry them but might cause another to put down his cross altogether. Besides, brothers and sisters, if we were not carrying so much else, our crosses would be much lighter. The heaviest load we feel is often from the weight of our unkept promises and our unresolved sins, which press down relentlessly upon us. In any genuine surrendering to God, one says, “I will give away all my sins to know thee.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:18</a>.) To Whom shall we give our sins? Only Jesus is both willing and able to take them!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p45" pid="6hQ5HjGLAkqS1kqSi899kg" hash="gIqlRA">Finally, nonmurmurers are permitted to see so much more. Ancient Israel was once compassed about with “a great host” of hostile horses and chariots. Elisha counseled his anxious young servant, “Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.” The prophet then prayed that the Lord would “open” the young man’s eyes, “and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha”! (<a href="/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/6.14-17" class="scriptureRef">2 Kgs. 6:14–17</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1989/10/murmur-not.p46" pid="prFU94ccYkiyBtxruy9QKQ" hash="IEYkYA">Elisha’s counsel can help Church members today to silence our murmuring. Regardless of how things seem, or come to seem, in troubled times, “They that be with us are more than they that be with them.” My brothers and sisters, if our lips are closed to murmuring, then our eyes can be opened. I so pray for us all in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Brothers and sisters, he has certainly kept His promise. He has carried out His divine intent, hasn’t He? Thus, even our fiery trials, said Peter, should not be thought of as “some strange thing.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/4.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 4:12</a>.) Hence, enduring is vital, and those who so last will be first spiritually!</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.29" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:29</a>.) Even though our experiences are micro compared to His, the process is the same.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/endure-it-well.p5" pid="LBXzcBfvrkGGyOAgYDt72A" hash="WhtIHw">There are so many things to be endured: illness, injustice, insensitivity, poverty, aloneness, unresponsiveness, being misrepresented and misunderstood, and, sometimes, even enemies. Paul reminds us that meek and lowly Jesus, though the Lord of the universe, “endured contradiction of sinners against himself.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.3" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:3</a>.) Smaller variations of these contradictions or hostilities will be felt by His disciples.</p>

Such “peaceable fruit” comes only in the appointed season thereof, after the blossoms and the buds.</p>

Put another way, too many anxious openings of the oven door, and the cake falls instead of rising. Moreover, enforced change usually does not last, while productive enduring can ingrain permanent change. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.13-16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:13–16</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.3,6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:3, 6</a>.)</p>

To endure in faith and doeth God’s will. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.20" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 63:20</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:35</a>) therefore involves much more than putting up with a circumstance.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/endure-it-well.p14" pid="kY_U4WPKXEGOmx--l8qo5A" hash="CNCGwg">Patient endurance permits us to cling to our faith in the Lord and our faith in His timing when we are being tossed about by the surf of circumstance. Even when a seeming undertow grasps us, somehow, in the tumbling, we are being carried forward, though battered and bruised.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/endure-it-well.p15" pid="nFAUiU9EPkmcJ7NkmfmQ_Q" hash="XPOrxA">Enduring temptation is one of the greatest challenges. Jesus endured temptation but yielded not. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.5" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 15:5</a>.) Christ withstood because He gave “no heed” to temptations. (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.22" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:22</a>.) You and I tend to dally over and dabble in temptations, entertaining them for a while, even if we later evict them. However, to give temptations any heed can set the stage for later succumbing.</p>

When, for the moment, we ourselves are not being stretched on a particular cross, we ought to be at the foot of someone else’s—full of empathy and proffering spiritual refreshment. On the straight, narrow path, which leads to our little Calvarys, one does not hear a serious traveler exclaiming, “Look, no hands!” (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 10:13</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>.) Hence, one prophet was especially commended by the Lord for his unwearyingness.

How many times have good individuals done the right thing initially only to break under subsequent stress? Sustaining correct conduct for a difficult moment under extraordinary stress is very commendable, but so is coping with sustained stress subtly present in seeming routineness. Either way, however, we are to “run with patience the race that is set before us” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.1" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:1</a>), and it is a marathon, not a dash.</p>

Yet, like the prodigal son, we often need the “process of time” in order to come to our spiritual senses. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.17" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:17</a>.) The touching reunion of Jacob and Esau in the desert, so many years after their sibling rivalry, is a classic example. Generosity can replace animosity. Reflection can bring perception. But reflection and introspection require time. So many spiritual outcomes require saving truths to be mixed with time, forming the elixir of experience, that sovereign remedy for so many things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1990/04/endure-it-well.p23" pid="FjbVyPLGx0KrkGtt4LKUgw" hash="t2JaWQ">We find that experience can produce a high spiritual yield. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:7</a>.) Laban, for instance, was reluctant for Jacob to leave his employ, “for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/30.27" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 30:27</a>.) The modern Church even today is instructed to “wait for a little season” to build up central Zion. Why? So that we “may be prepared … and have experience.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.9-10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 105:9–10</a>.) We gain knowledge through particular experiences, but only incrementally, “in that thing.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.34" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:34</a>.) Hence the ongoingness of it all, and perhaps we can be forgiven for wondering, “Is there no other way?” Personal, spiritual symmetry emerges only from the shaping of prolonged obedience. Twigs are bent, not snapped, into shape.</p>

The knob must be firmly grasped and deliberately turned with faith. The harrowing of the soul can be like the harrowing of the soil to increase the yield with things being turned upside down. Moses experienced such topsy-turvy change. A lesser individual couldn’t have forsaken Egypt’s treasures and privileged status only to be hunted and later resented as a prophetic presence in the royal courts which he had doubtless known earlier, but as an insider.

The distance between constant self-pleasing and self-worship is shorter than we think. Stubborn selfishness is actually rebellion against God, because, warned Samuel, “stubbornness is as … idolatry.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-sam/15.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Sam. 15:23</a>.)</p>

It is the detonator in the breaking of the Ten Commandments.</p>

It is easier to ignore one’s parents instead of honoring them. It is easier to steal, because what one wants prevails. It is easier to covet, since the selfish conclude that nothing should be denied them.</p>

The Sabbath day is easily neglected, since one day soon becomes just like another. If selfish, it is easier to lie, because the truth is conveniently subordinated.</p>

Corruption and violence—sound familiar? Both of these awful conditions crest because of surging individual selfishness. When thus engulfed, no wonder men’s hearts in our day will fail them because of fear. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/21.26" class="scriptureRef">Luke 21:26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:26</a>.)

Jane Austen’s character Elizabeth mused, “I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.” (<span class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice,</span> New York: Airmont Books, 1962, p. 58.) The selfish individual has a passion for the vertical pronoun <span class="emphasis">I.</span> Significantly, the vertical pronoun <span class="emphasis">I</span> has no knees to bend, while the first letter in the pronoun <span class="emphasis">we</span> does.</p>

All things are thus viewed selfishly—what are their implications for “me,” much like the mattress on the highway which delayed traffic. When frustrated motorists finally got around the mattress, none stopped to remove it because now there was nothing in it for him.</p>

Having a “mind hardened in pride” often afflicts the brightest who could also be the best. (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/5.20" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 5:20</a>.) “One thing” the brightest often lack: meekness! Instead of having “a willing mind” which seeks to emulate the “mind of Christ,” a “mind hardened in pride” is impervious to counsel and often seeks ascendancy. (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-chr/28.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Chr. 28:9</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.16" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:34</a>.)

Both before and after His astonishing atonement, He declared, “Glory be to the Father.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:2</a>.) Jesus, stunningly brilliant, nevertheless allowed His will to be “swallowed up in the will of the Father.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.7" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 15:7</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.38" class="scriptureRef">John 6:38</a>.)

All this results from what the Lord calls coveting “the drop,” while neglecting the “more weighty matters.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/117.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 117:8</a>.) Myopic selfishness magnifies a mess of pottage and makes thirty pieces of silver look like a treasure trove. In our intense acquisitiveness, we forget Him who once said, “What is property unto me?” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/117.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 117:4</a>.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>.) So much of our fatigue, brothers and sisters, in fact, comes from carrying that needless load. This heaviness of the natural man prevents us from doing our Christian calisthenics; so we end up too swollen with selfishness to pass through the narrow needle’s eye.</p>

What a rest that will be! The most exhausting thing in life, I have discovered,” she said, “is being insincere. That is why so much of social life is exhausting.” (<span class="emphasis">Gift from the Sea,</span> New York: Vintage Books, 1978, p. 32.)</p>

Any tender sprouts from these virtues are sheared off by sharp selfishness. Contrariwise, brothers and sisters, I cannot think of a single gospel covenant the keeping of which does not shear off selfishness from us!</p>

We are all afflicted in different degrees. The question is, “How goes the battle?” Is our selfishness being put off—even if only gradually? Or is the natural man like “the man who came to dinner”? Divine tutoring is given largely in order to help us shed our selfishness, “for what son [or daughter] is [there] whom the father chasteneth not?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.7" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:7</a>.)</p>

We can have real and justified hope for the future—enough hope to develop the faith necessary to both put off the natural man and to strive to become more saintly.</p>

God is surely able to do His own work! (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.20-21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 27:20–21</a>.) In His plans for the human family, long ago God made ample provision for all mortal mistakes. His purposes will all triumph and without abrogating man’s moral agency. Moreover, all His purposes will come to pass in their time. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.32" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:32</a>.)</p>

Take away an acknowledgment of divine design and then watch the selfish scurrying to redesign political and economic systems to make life pain-free and pleasure-filled. Misguided governments mean to live, even if they live beyond their means, thereby mortgaging future generations.</p>

Its theology focuses on “self.” Its hereafter is “now.” Its chief ritual is “sensation”—though, ironically, it finally desensitizes its obsessed adherents, who become “past feeling.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.20" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 9:20</a>.)</p>

Sensations are then desperately sought precisely in order to verify that one really exists. A variation occurs when one is full of self-pity over affectional deprivation. He ends up in transgression.</p>

Many assert their needs—but where have we lodged the corresponding obligations? So many have become demanders, but where are all the providers? There are many more people with things to say than there are listeners. There are more neglected and aging parents than there are attentive sons and daughters—though, numerically, clearly it should not be so!</p>

Of course we are free to choose and are personally accountable. Yes, we have individuality. But those who have chosen to “come unto Christ” soon realize that they do not “own” themselves. Instead, they belong to Him. We are to become consecrated along with our gifts, our appointed days, and our very selves. Hence, there is a stark difference between stubbornly “owning” oneself and submissively belonging to God. Clinging to the old self is not a mark of independence, but of indulgence!</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.3" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p2" pid="gtSq4Q3xzUGaK0OJ1p6oCw" hash="Pi4cvA">A few of these few have had their faith scorched, such as by the circumstances of wrenching or unrelieved sickness, grinding economic pressures, loss of a loved one, or deep disappointment with a spouse or friend. Adversity can increase faith or instead can cause the troubling roots of bitterness to spring up. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.15" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:15</a>.) A few have been overcome by the preoccupying cares of the world, those wearying, surface things of life. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.6-7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 13:6–7</a>.) Emerson’s plea is surely appropriate: “Give me truths: for I am weary of the surfaces.” (“Blight,” in <span class="emphasis">The Complete Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson,</span> New York: Wm. H. Wise &amp; Co., 1929, p. 874.) A few are fatigued by unconfessed sins. A few tire from milling about haltingly in the “valley of decision.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/joel/3.14" class="scriptureRef">Joel 3:14</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18.21" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 18:21</a>.) A few, foolishly focusing on something other than Jesus, the Sure and True Foundation, are drained by disappointment. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p3" pid="moSXSXAMGE-msiDvupKJBA" hash="BshoHg">Whatever the preceding causes, any fainting in our minds brings a loss of spiritual consciousness and, with this, the inclination to charge God foolishly. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/job/1.22" class="scriptureRef">Job 1:22</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p4" pid="mAlLlWEqI0iU3ZqKr5-atw" hash="CU7eYQ">The urgings for us not to weary in well-doing contain prescriptions to avoid such weariness. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 6:9</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-thes/3.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Thes. 3:13</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.34" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:34</a>.) We are to work steadily, but realistically, and only expect to reap “in due season.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/6.9" class="scriptureRef">Gal. 6:9</a>.) We are to serve while being “meek and lowly” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.34" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:34</a>), avoiding thereby the wearying burdens of self-pity and hypocrisy. We are to pray always so that we will not faint, so that our performance will actually be for the welfare of our souls, which is so much more than just going through the motions. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.5,9" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 32:5, 9</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/75.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 75:11</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.126" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:126</a>.)</p>

President Wilford Woodruff counseled us all about the mercy that is inherent in some adversity: “The chastisements we have had from time to time have been for our good, and are essential to learn wisdom, and carry us through a school of experience we never could have passed through without.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 2:198.)</p>

Keep from me, Lord, all those experiences which made Thee what Thou art! Then let me come and dwell with Thee and fully share Thy joy!”</p>

If we cease nurturing our faith in any of these four specific ways, we are vulnerable.</p>

Inspired words do matter, for “when a man works by faith he works by … words.” (<span class="emphasis">Lectures on Faith,</span> 7:3.) In a hardening world, the Lord can pierce our consciousness by using “the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/6.17" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 6:17</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1.12" class="scriptureRef">Jarom 1:12</a>.) However, hearing must be “mixed with faith” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 4:2</a>) and with Christian service, as we have heard again and again in this conference.</p>

Unlike others we might carry, the natural man is heavy, and he is not our brother!</p>

The Apostles pled, “Lord, Increase our faith.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/17.5" class="scriptureRef">Luke 17:5</a>.) No wonder, brothers and sisters, because we are to “walk by faith, not by sight.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/5.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 5:7</a>.) Life is so designed that we are to “overcome by faith” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.53" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:53</a>), not by intellectual acuity or wealth or political prowess.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p15" pid="PDdIEqaMwUacX4BWQQ_0Zw" hash="3ay5YA">Nevertheless, seekers after the rewards of faith are often disappointed when they are told to study, serve, pray, and worship. As with leprous Naaman, they apparently expect some great thing which requires no obedience to counsel. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Kgs. 5:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p16" pid="8J9x4V78fkexJWfhaRAB6w" hash="nRh81g">Faith brings with it the expanding “evidence of things not seen.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:1</a>.) Some mortals dismiss this real, spiritual evidence because “the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him … because they are spiritually discerned.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.14" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:14</a>.) But this provincialism on the part of others should not deprive the rest of us of energizing evidence.</p>

These beginnings require at least a “desire to believe” and then comes the exercising of a “particle of faith.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:27</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p18" pid="9Exn4g1TO0ijja-k7Dhxzw" hash="CiVMQQ">As we “give place” and plant the seed of faith, it grows discernibly. We are invigorated as it enlightens and swells. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28-30" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:28–30</a>.) We become our own internal auditors, confirming this increase in our faith. It is better to so nourish our faith in what seems to be an ordinary process than to experience extraordinary things only to stumble later over life’s ordinary challenges.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p19" pid="hgH66YeFDkeVRawuMhB9hw" hash="HWi1nw">However, in this process of personal experimentation and verification, the several, sacred steps cannot be skipped over: “For ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.6" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:6</a>.)</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.34" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:34</a>.) It was so with the brother of Jared: “He had faith no longer, for he knew.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:19</a>.) Brigham Young assured that “every principle God has revealed carries its own convictions of its truth to the human mind.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 9:149.) Jesus clearly declared that “if any man will do his will, he shall know.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/7.17" class="scriptureRef">John 7:17</a>.) However, Jesus described the steady process as being one of “line upon line, precept upon precept.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 98:12</a>.)</p>

Hence “to some it is given … to know. … To others it is given to believe on their words.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.13-14" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 46:13–14</a>.)</p>

Otherwise, one’s small data base of personal experience permits so few useful generalizations! But by searching the holy scriptures, we access a vast, divine data bank, a reservoir of remembrance. In this way, the scriptures can, as the Book of Mormon says, enlarge the memory. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.8" class="scriptureRef">Alma 37:8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p25" pid="dhv2wpMxEUqcspdM9eIO8Q" hash="HmADIA">Fully formed faith has several, distinct facets. Faith in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ includes not only faith in Their existence but also in Their redemptive capacities. The Lord has assured us, “I will show unto the children of men that I am able to do mine own work.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 27:21</a>.) Is He ever able! Indeed, “in him all things hold together.” (Revised Standard Version, <a href="/scriptures/nt/col/1.17" class="scriptureRef">Col. 1:17</a>.) Nevertheless, some doubt that God’s announced purposes will actually triumph.</p>

Ironically, some who acknowledge God are tried by His timing, globally and personally!</p>

Still, some of us have trouble when God’s tutoring is applied to us! We plead for exemption more than we do for sanctification, don’t we, brothers and sisters?</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:27</a>.) Frankly, some find discipleship constraining and the world appealing. These individuals are merely going through the motions without real intent.</p>

In view of these tutorials, God cannot, brothers and sisters, respond affirmatively to all of our petitions with an unbroken chain of “yeses.” This would assume that all of our petitions are for that “which is right” and are spiritually “expedient.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.20" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 18:20</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.18" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:18</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.64-65" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:64–65</a>.)

How else shall we see what we lack? Spiritual refinement is not only to make the gross more pure but to further refine the already fine! Hence, said Peter, we should not think a “fiery trial” to be “some strange thing.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/4.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 4:12</a>.)</p>

As things unfold, sometimes in full view, let us be merciful with each other. We certainly do not criticize hospital patients amid intensive care for looking pale and preoccupied. Why then those recovering from surgery on their souls? No need for us to stare; those stitches will finally come out. And in this hospital, too, it is important for everyone to remember that the hospital chart is not the patient. Extending our mercy to someone need not wait upon our full understanding of their challenges! Empathy may not be appreciated or reciprocated, but empathy is never wasted.</p>

Brothers and sisters, how can we really feel forgiven until we first feel responsible? How can we learn from our own experiences unless these lessons are owned up to?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p38" pid="_fBpWaCBpUOabKmXTIOa7A" hash="gqDiJg">In the trial of faith, we may sometimes feel God has deserted us. The reality is that our behavior has isolated us from Him. It is when we first feel the consequences of our mistakes and are just turning away from these, but have not yet turned fully to God, that we may have these feelings of being forsaken.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p39" pid="LkaTL0Kon0G2HXiYaagBag" hash="J6vHKA">No part of walking by faith is more difficult than walking the road of repentance. However, with “faith unto repentance” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:16</a>), we can push the roadblock of pride away and beg God for mercy. One simply surrenders, worrying only about what God thinks, not about what “they” think.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/04/lest-ye-be-wearied-and-faint-in-your-minds.p40" pid="-EVNOU6sT0qFg9dhPgLvWg" hash="Lt-foQ">Growing out of our faith in the Lord is our sustaining of His anointed leaders, as we have done at this April conference. Faithful Church members have what Peter called an “unfeigned love of the brethren.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 1:22</a>.) Collectively but not perfectly, those sustained do the work to which God has called them. As with Joseph Smith, so it is for his succeeding Brethren. The operative promise persists: namely, the people of the Church will never be turned away “by the testimony of traitors.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:3</a>.) But the faithful know something about divine determination. They know that the Lord’s purposes will finally triumph, for “there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but what he will do it.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:17</a>.) Of that divine determination and divine love I gladly and publicly testify in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p2" pid="rsIGwEWq7UqolaiE1aUI6g" hash="KqWcMQ">For some months, I’ve tried to emphasize repentance, one of the most vital and merciful doctrines of the kingdom. It is too little understood, too little applied by us all, as if it were merely a word on a bumper sticker. Since we have been told clearly by Jesus what manner of men and women we ought to become—even as He is (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>)—how can we do so, except each of us employs repentance as the regular means of personal progression? Personal repentance is part of taking up the cross daily. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/9.23" class="scriptureRef">Luke 9:23</a>.) Without it, clearly there could be no “perfecting of the Saints.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.12" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p3" pid="SO8hP7zXFEGpptIuRB2S3Q" hash="xWlMUw">Besides, there is more individuality in those who are more holy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p4" pid="nba2WCN5d0CWwMZC9lIXRg" hash="YBTrKg">Sin, on the other hand, brings sameness; it shrinks us to addictive appetites and insubordinate impulses. For a brief surging, selfish moment, sin may create the illusion of individuality, but only as in the grunting, galloping Gadarene swine! (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/8.28-32" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 8:28–32</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p5" pid="BZtH5xq6s0Gp168-mCc_Xg" hash="WyXhpA">Repentance is a rescuing, not a dour doctrine. It is available to the gross sinner as well as to the already-good individual striving for incremental improvement.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p6" pid="LgdA2GjpZEi5ZMyNHqq-GQ" hash="A8c-Jg">Repentance requires both turning away from evil and turning to God. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/4.30" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 4:30</a>; see also Bible Dictionary, s.v. “Repentance.”) When “a mighty change” is required, full repentance involves a <span class="emphasis">180-degree turn,</span> and without looking back! (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.12-13" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:12–13</a>.) Initially, this turning reflects progress from telestial to terrestrial behavior, and later on to celestial behavior. As the sins of the telestial world are left behind, the focus falls ever more steadily upon the sins of omission, which often keep us from full consecration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p7" pid="-wyATYd7eEyDqsj28M2fvw" hash="hAIoBg">Real repentance involves not a mechanical checklist, but a checkreining of the natural self. Often overlapping and mutually reinforcing, each portion of the process of repentance is essential. This process rests on inner resolve but is much aided by external support.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p8" pid="EJUhsTOpkEm2oOuh9EDhTg" hash="RAQRIQ">There can be no repentance without <span class="emphasis">recognition</span> of wrong. Whether by provocation, introspection, or wrenching remembrance, denial must be dissolved. As with the prodigal son who finally “came to himself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.17" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:17</a>), the first rays of recognition help us begin to see “things as they really are” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:13</a>), including distinguishing between the motes and beams. Recognition is a sacred moment, often accompanied by the hot blush of shame.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p9" pid="hVxiRZbX-U6Xz0wTzMrfDQ" hash="kkwEnQ">After recognition, real <span class="emphasis">remorse</span> floods the soul. This is a “godly sorrow,” not merely the “sorrow of the world” nor the “sorrowing of the damned,” when we can no longer “take happiness in sin.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/7.10" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 7:10</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/2.13" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 2:13</a>.) False remorse instead is like “fondling our failings.” In ritual regret, we mourn our mistakes but without mending them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p10" pid="SSJZjH3dBEyjG8P-EmvsUQ" hash="xRgztA">There can be no real repentance without personal suffering and the passage of sufficient time for the needed cleansing and turning. This is much more than merely waiting until feelings of remorse subside. Misery, like adversity, can have its special uses. No wonder chastening is often needed until the turning is really under way! (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:27</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.3" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 12:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p11" pid="UvpU54ZUZ0-z2OWjXDSZlQ" hash="tUe4lA">Real remorse quickly brings forth positive indicators, “fruits meet for repentance.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/3.8" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 3:8</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/26.20" class="scriptureRef">Acts 26:20</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.54" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:54</a>.) “In process of time,” these fruits bud, blossom, and ripen.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p12" pid="5ovRNXymI0OGIbc2aoDytw" hash="XXF62A">True repentance also includes <span class="emphasis">confession:</span> “Now therefore make confession unto the Lord God of your fathers.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ezra/10.11" class="scriptureRef">Ezra 10:11</a>.) One with a broken heart will not hold back. As confession lets the sickening sin empty out, then the Spirit which withdrew returns to renew.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p13" pid="8gLwDcZiSEmJZZozw7RQpA" hash="WeA5tg">Support from others is especially crucial now. Hence, we are directed to be part of a caring community in which we all “lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/81.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 81:5</a>.) Did not the citizens of the unequaled City of Enoch so improve together “in process of time?” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.21" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:21</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.68-69" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:68–69</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p14" pid="X1MSChDdbEmMfz3Zzs-WEw" hash="ZMwI7w">All sins are to be confessed to the Lord, some to a Church official, some to others, and some to all of these. A few may require public confession. Confessing aids forsaking. We cannot expect to sin publicly and extensively and then expect to be rescued privately and quickly, being beaten “with only a few stripes.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.88-93" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:88–93</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p15" pid="ghZkzXq71UyM8gEZ3Y7HmQ" hash="TPM-OQ">In real repentance, there is the actual <span class="emphasis">forsaking</span> of sinning. “Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ezek/18.30" class="scriptureRef">Ezek. 18:30</a>.) A suffering Korihor confessed, “I always knew that there was a God,” but his turning was still incomplete (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.52" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:52</a>); hence, “Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.55" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:55</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p16" pid="0bn78KRlqkudd1Rh3LgXMw" hash="VrYnDw">Thus, when “a man repenteth of his sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.43" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:43</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p17" pid="j_G9u_F9pU-wmt5OQKk56Q" hash="t1KmlA">Genuine support and love from others—not isolation—are needed to sustain this painful forsaking and turning!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p18" pid="sCTTJs9aKk-4pK4I9lfapA" hash="5GwHRw">
        <span class="emphasis">Restitution</span> is required, too.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p19" pid="kJv8hSehKUiNXyp4UxoNDw" hash="2y2Ypw">“Because he hath sinned, … he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/lev/6.4" class="scriptureRef">Lev. 6:4</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p20" pid="7YbqHtUpDkGsAfJLfyKKDA" hash="u5f4UA">Sometimes, however, restitution is not possible in real terms, such as when one contributed to another’s loss of faith or virtue. Instead, a subsequent example of righteousness provides a compensatory form of restitution.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p21" pid="_DODWFukEU-32_fA7-Bggg" hash="B9lx6A">In this rigorous process, so much clearly depends upon meekness. Pride keeps repentance from even starting or continuing. Some fail because they are more concerned with the preservation of their public image than with having Christ’s image in their countenances! (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>.) Pride prefers cheap repentance, paid for with shallow sorrow. Unsurprisingly, seekers after cheap repentance also search for superficial forgiveness instead of real reconciliation. Thus, real repentance goes far beyond simply saying, “I’m sorry.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p22" pid="txbsorPO-k24rMeYgOJEGQ" hash="6hhcww">In the anguishing process of repentance, we may sometimes feel God has deserted us. The reality is that our behavior has isolated us from Him. Thus, while we are turning away from evil but have not yet turned fully to God, we are especially vulnerable. Yet we must not give up, but, instead, reach out to God’s awaiting arm of mercy, which is outstretched “all the day long.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.47" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 5:47</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6.4" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 6:4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.32" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:32</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/5.11" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 5:11</a>.) Unlike us, God has no restrictive office hours.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p23" pid="mRsfo1d4g0ikOatuXXsTFA" hash="Q6HXog">No part of walking by faith is more difficult than walking the road of repentance. However, with “faith unto repentance,” we can push roadblocks out of the way, moving forward to beg God for mercy. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:16</a>.) True contrition brings full capitulation. One simply surrenders, caring only about what God thinks, not what “they” think, while meekly offering, “O God, … make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:18</a>.) Giving away all our sins is the only way we can come to know God.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p24" pid="cu-wvBynU0iMyegPkOChaw" hash="0A59Wg">In contrast, those who hold back some of their sins will be held back. So will those who refuse to work humbly and honestly with the Lord’s appointed. Partial disclosure to appointed leaders brings full accountability. The Prophet Joseph said, “We ought to … keep nothing back.” (<span class="emphasis">The Words of Joseph Smith,</span> ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980, p. 7.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p25" pid="y5OJI5WLwEGm1Jh-YhA19A" hash="ofvCHg">Reflective of our total progression, repentance is not solely for renouncing transgression. For instance, Moses was a righteous and remarkable man. Nevertheless, he needed to change his leadership style for his welfare as well as the people’s. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/18.17-19" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 18:17–19</a>.) Moses succeeded because he was the most meek man upon the face of the earth. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/num/12.3" class="scriptureRef">Num. 12:3</a>.) Blessed are the meek, for they are neither easily offended by counsel nor aggravated by admonition. If we were more meek, brothers and sisters, repentance would be much more regular and less stared at.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p26" pid="dwOp4gh7lE-q3qnsMsqNHA" hash="tG0L0A">Our deficiencies of style usually reflect an underdeveloped Christian attribute, as when a chronically poor listener exhibits a lack of love or meekness. You and I are too quick to forgive ourselves in matters of style.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p27" pid="UgeQQp_15kq-clWuRG917w" hash="QRwUOg">Even when free of major transgression, we can develop self-contentment instead of seeking self-improvement. This was once true of Amulek, who later acknowledged, “I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/10.4-6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 10:4–6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p28" pid="LJOjmlCfLkG4Mo9JnqxzWw" hash="6Hh1UA">Given the relevancy of repentance as a principle of progress for all, no wonder the Lord has said to His servants multiple times that the thing of greatest worth would be to cry repentance to this generation! (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:9</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/15.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 15:6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p29" pid="Z4uh5sOF1UOM1RN4uiCtsg" hash="DCCWWA">Still other things stubbornly impede repentance, such as our not being reproved early on, when we might have been less proud and more able to recognize our need to change. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.43" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:43</a>.) In such situations, truly “no man cared for my soul.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/142.4" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 142:4</a>.)</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1991/10/repentance.p31" pid="UPnKQjkmEE-ujmA-Z9cvZA" hash="BvAPRw">Or we can be too preoccupied with “pleasing … the carnal mind” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.53" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:53</a>), which always insistently asks, “What have you done for me lately?” We can also be too unforgiving, refusing to reclassify others. Yet “he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:9</a>.) We cannot repent for someone else. But we can forgive someone else, refusing to hold hostage those whom the Lord seeks to set free!</p>

One future day, he said, Jesus’ covenant people, “scattered upon all the face of the earth,” will be “armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14.14" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 14:14</a>.)

What followed Joseph Smith’s prayer in the spring of 1820 irrevocably illuminated our view of God, ourselves, others, life, even the universe! A young boy in a small grove of trees began receiving answers to mankind’s oldest and largest questions! But young Joseph certainly did not go into the Sacred Grove seeking the restoration of the holy priesthood and the holy endowment, the sealing power, and all the keys thereof. He did not even know of their existence! He merely wanted to know which of several churches to join. His prayer was for personal and tactical guidance. The response, however, was of global and eternal significance!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p2" pid="FIW3_GKB_UyrdYpAMHHbUA" hash="MlYAFw">Would Joseph have gone into the grove, brethren, if he had known beforehand the unceasing persecution which would soon engulf him and finally cause his martyrdom?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p3" pid="hNC62V2vN06SxEIyuXRzbQ" hash="zL5Hdg">Courage is one of Joseph Smith’s special qualities. Without it, he would have shrunk from carrying out his remarkable role. At about age seven, he had a gravely infected leg. Amputation seemed inevitable. He refused alcoholic anesthetics when his leg bones were surgically and painfully treated in a new technique. By the way, that thoughtful little boy asked his mother to leave the room so she wouldn’t have to witness his suffering.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p4" pid="ioo3rpoIeUCNoG89-75uIw" hash="aOLj7Q">For Joseph’s ailment, the best medical help available in America was surprisingly just a few miles away: Dr. Nathan Smith, founder of Dartmouth’s medical school and the experienced pioneer of this advanced technique (see Le Roy S. Wirthlin, “Joseph Smith’s Boyhood Operation: An 1813 Surgical Success,” <span class="emphasis">Brigham Young University Studies, </span> vol. 21, Spring 1981, no. 2, pp. 131–54; see also <span class="emphasis">Ensign, </span>Mar. 1978, pp. 59–60.) He led the team who saved Joseph’s leg, including for the grueling march of Zion’s Camp.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p5" pid="2Wuc80iWRE-tzWcUm2sEvQ" hash="NpzufA">Joseph often displayed courage, as one beneficiary later reported: “Sickness and fright had robbed me of strength. Joseph had to decide w[he]ther to leave me to be captured by the mob or endanger himself by rendering aid. Choosing the latter course, he lifted me upon his own broad shoulders and bore me with occasional rests through the swamp and darkness. Several hours later we emerged upon the lonely road and soon reached safety. Joseph’s … strength permitted him to … [save] my life.” (<span class="emphasis">New Era, </span>Dec. 1973, p. 19.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p6" pid="mqLifJuoWEimTOtWPn-rFA" hash="47cdoA">Joseph’s courage was matched by his willingness to be tutored. The Restoration, which occurred “in process of time,” so required. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.21" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:21</a>.) After a glorious visitation, there would be laborious implementation. For instance, the bestowal of the golden plates, history’s most stunning “find” in the field of religion, was followed by painstaking translation. The keys of the holy apostleship were dramatically restored, but well before the sifting march of Zion’s Camp and the subsequent calling of the Twelve. Elijah’s very significant visit came well before either the people or temples were prepared to enjoy the restored sealing power.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p7" pid="AYujLzNZp0qdvPpSvG8k1g" hash="aYIZPA">Yes, Joseph received remarkable manifestations, along with constant vexations. True, for instance, there were periodic arrivals of heavenly messengers, but these were punctuated by the periodic arrivals of earthly mobs.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p8" pid="PlGdELsjCkKELHDWQplzuw" hash="SO2tVw">While Joseph was befriended by heavenly notables, he was also betrayed by some of his earthly friends. Receiving keys and gifts was real, but so was the painful loss of six of the eleven children born to him and Emma. Granted, Joseph had revealed to him glimpses of far horizons—the first and third estates. But these periodic glories occurred amid Joseph’s arduous, daily life in the second estate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p9" pid="mTACwKUl802rdlMeePCm5A" hash="1UjDjw">Consecrated Joseph gave so much, yet often so little was returned. President Brigham Young lamented, “There was confidence due from his brethren to Joseph which he did not receive. In his death they learned a profitable lesson, and afterwards felt that if he could only be restored to them how obedient they would be to his counsels.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>10:222.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p10" pid="bC8W8N_AhUOgnLBFNm-cUA" hash="LajXZA">I recall reading years ago that, during severe apostasy in Kirtland, Joseph shook someone’s hand for what seemed to be a long time. Discerningly, the Prophet then said he was glad to know that individual was his friend because he had so few of them in those days.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p11" pid="N8IAsRldEkCZcPDLX85AZQ" hash="PyrKaw">Joseph was a seer. He had the gift to translate ancient records (see <span class="emphasis">History of the Church, </span>1:238), and a “seer is greater than a prophet” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8.15" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 8:15</a>; see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8.13-17" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 8:13–17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p12" pid="YioMuWBlIkWM9Bg0W77_HQ" hash="tFgaUA">The process of translation was truly “a marvellous work and a wonder,” or, as rendered in Hebrew, “a miraculous miracle.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.14" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 29:14</a>.) Depending upon his sequence of translation, scholars estimate Joseph in 1829 was translating at a rapid daily equivalent of from eight to thirteen of today’s printed pages. (See John W. Welch and Tim Rathbone, “The Translation of the Book of Mormon: Basic Historical Information,” Preliminary Report, F.A.R.M.S., Provo, Utah, 1986, pp. 38–39.) An able, professional translator recently told me he considers one page a day productive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p13" pid="uQKltr6shE2j1so6xrNlKQ" hash="4Q0Uvw">From Joseph the translator—untrained in theology—more printed pages of scripture have come down to us than from any other mortal, as Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has calculated!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p14" pid="wwUolhgVG0Gl__dBw6Z2yQ" hash="K7m7aw">Joseph, the revelator. He also became an articulator. President Young said the Prophet Joseph had the “happy faculty” of communicating things “often in a single sentence throwing … light into the gloom of [the] ages … in one blending flood of heavenly intelligence.” (Brigham Young, in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>9:310.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p15" pid="XyRVcaShgEK3SvHRY-TsnA" hash="LmqEvg">Joseph Smith lit up life’s landscape, brethren, so that we can see “things as they really are, and … really will be.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:13</a>.) The revelations about the dispensations in salvational history tell us that Adam had the fulness of Christ’s gospel and all its ordinances. (See <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.58-59" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:58–59</a>.) Hence, Christianity did not begin with Jesus’ mortal Messiahship in the meridian of time in Jerusalem! The diffusion which followed Adam naturally resulted in some similarities in various religions. Therefore, as President Joseph F. Smith declared, we find “relics of Christianity” which “date back … beyond the flood, independent of … the Bible.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>15:325.) Latter-day Saints are therefore unsurprised but instead are enriched whenever discoveries are made which show how the Lord grants “unto all nations” to teach a portion of “his word.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.8" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:8</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p16" pid="U4evj3fjA0K9nh2bZCxLxw" hash="Vk1_bw">In 1834, all the priesthood in the Kirtland area met, not in a tabernacle, but in a small log cabin. There, Joseph prophesied that the Church would eventually grow to fill North and South America and even the world. (See Wilford Woodruff, <span class="emphasis">Millennial Star, </span>19 Sept. 1892, p. 605; see also Conference Report, Apr. 1898, p. 57.) Think of it, brethren—tonight we have live audiences in over three thousand separate congregations involving 162,000 men and young men! Later, videos will reach tens of thousands more in 47 countries and 17 languages!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p17" pid="IVrLF_Tl2Eml3E3bvsysbw" hash="u2tZXg">Even so, young men listening tonight, including several of my grandsons, will aid in the further fulfillment of Joseph’s bold prophecy, for “the ends of the earth shall inquire after [Joseph’s] name.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:1</a>.) And young men listening tonight will answer those inquiries in the years ahead and in places with strange-sounding names.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p18" pid="IsOh6n5WikW23ko9tRwzkg" hash="WnrGWw">Another remarkable prophecy, given nearly thirty years before the tragedy of the American Civil War, foretold not only where it would begin, but, more importantly, that it would end “in the death and misery of many souls.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 87:1</a>.) By far, that war still ranks as America’s bloodiest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p19" pid="B6REcxMl_kuldPIkbjz9bg" hash="PrttTA">Other prophecies await. Some are grim, such as “a desolating sickness shall cover the land.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.31" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:31</a>.) How its awful fulfillment will occur, we do not know.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p20" pid="wZEVxJ_D90O9lH7ZKocj_Q" hash="Nd0cyw">When they first met, Joseph also prophesied that Brigham Young would one day preside over the Church. (See <span class="emphasis">Millennial Star, </span>25:139.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p21" pid="lwKhLPafhEOQ1dllQ8rozg" hash="9bJ9Hg">Brigham Young was not easily impressed by anybody, yet he said he felt like shouting “Hallelujah!” all the time that he ever knew Joseph Smith! (See <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>3:51.) And dying Brigham’s last words were, “Joseph! Joseph! Joseph!” He was about to be with his beloved Joseph once again! (Leonard J. Arrington, <span class="emphasis">Brigham Young: American Moses, </span>New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1985, p. 399.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p22" pid="tWt7j4yHzkOncSxZrtrR5A" hash="RXy02g">Joseph could not have accomplished what he did if he had not become consecrated and spiritually submissive. Elder Erastus Snow warned the rest of us that when we are “inclined to be stiff and refractory, … the Spirit of the Lord is held at a distance from us” because we are too busy gratifying our own wills, and thus we “interpose a barrier” between us and God. (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>7:352.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p23" pid="dPQEF3-ve0Gt3FfBQLtOdA" hash="KyJ9vA">Near the end, in multiple meetings, Joseph transferred the keys, authority, and ordinances to the Twelve. On one such occasion, President Wilford Woodruff said the revelator’s “face was as clear as amber and he was covered with a power [I have] never seen in [an instant] in the flesh before.” (Wilford Woodruff, “Journal History,” 12 Mar. 1897.) President Young said that those who knew Joseph could tell when “the Spirit of revelation was upon him, … for at such times there was a peculiar clearness and transparency in his face.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>9:89.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p24" pid="1cavquV6OUShyAWOlCEaeA" hash="2BEcCQ">Even with all he revealed, however, the Prophet Joseph knew much more than he could tell. President John Taylor observed that Joseph “felt fettered and bound.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>10:147–48.) Heber C. Kimball confirmed that Joseph sometimes felt “as though he were enclosed … , there was no room for him to expand, … no room in the hearts of the people to receive.” (In <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses, </span>10:233.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p25" pid="dYKHHyotJUa_iwogbRP52g" hash="KWB_Jg">The Prophet Joseph was a very good man. We need not suppose him “guilty of any great or malignant sins,” for such, he said, “was never in my nature.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.28" class="scriptureRef">JS—H 1:28</a>.) Near the end of his life, he meekly said, “I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, </span>p. 368.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p26" pid="Sc9B4WU0TE-cgz6kc4hJQw" hash="tA60Vg">Unsurprisingly, the Prophet was closely linked with previous prophets! Just as on the Mount of Transfiguration Peter, James, and John were given priesthood keys by Elias, the Prophet Joseph likewise received priesthood keys from Elias and also from Peter, James, and John and so many others! In a December 1834 blessing, Father Smith confirmed to his son that ancient Joseph in Egypt “looked after his posterity in the last days … [and] sought diligently to know … who should bring forth the word of the Lord [to them] and his eyes beheld thee, my son [Joseph Smith, Jr.]: [and] his heart rejoiced and his soul was satisfied.” (<span class="emphasis">Patriarchal Blessings, </span>1:3.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p27" pid="XIihDYn4NECiqpKtpHcbFQ" hash="srHv6g">Concerning his personal suffering, Joseph was promised, “Thy heart shall be enlarged.” An enlarged Joseph wrote from Liberty Jail, “It seems to me that my heart will always be more tender after this than ever it was before. … I think I never could have felt as I now do if I had not suffered.” (<span class="emphasis">The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith, </span>ed. Dean C. Jessee, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1984, pp. 387.) Was Joseph not told, “All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good”? (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p28" pid="UBmsDLNCekqOAf9cbdEgjw" hash="kRwvkg">Most significantly, through the Prophet Joseph came translations and revelations which confirmed and described, as never before, the reality of the glorious Atonement, in which, alas, so few really believe today. It is the central act of all human history! Very few words have come directly from Jesus about His specific and personal suffering during that agonizing but emancipating atonement. Almost all of these precious few words come to us through the Prophet Joseph! Jesus truly did bleed at every pore. He trembled because of pain. He suffered both body and spirit. He pled that He might not shrink, or pull back, from performing the Atonement. He finally finished His preparations unto the children of men. Meek Jesus let His will be “swallowed up in the will of the Father”! (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.7" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 15:7</a>.) Even in the midst of His astonishing, personal triumph, Jesus, true to His premortal promise, still gave all the glory to the Father. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.18-19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:18–19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Moses 4:2</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p29" pid="amfE7jsoiUW7mher2Bzlgw" hash="ubrNdw">The Prophet’s life was thus one of high achievement amid deep disappointment. Brethren, how will we endure our own peaks and valleys? Will we so submit individually, or will we be “stiff and refractory”?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p30" pid="UGsNAmzNrU6JcMa8YMcweQ" hash="21ukWg">Joseph became fully consecrated and grew in a “spiritual crescendo.” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 6:317.) Will we do the same, brethren, by witnessing to our families, friends, and flocks—not only through our verbal testimonies but also by our developmental examples? We can do this by becoming ever more visibly the men of Christ!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p31" pid="wBStun3qSUaFhagIhBdQyw" hash="PLaHgA">Or will we be like those who were decent but who lacked the courage to declare openly for Jesus and who were afraid of losing their places in the synagogue? (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/12.42-43" class="scriptureRef">John 12:42–43</a>.) There are so many equivalent situations today, and some Church members are reluctant to risk losing their places! Each day we decide the degree of our discipleship. Each day we answer the question, “Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/04/my-servant-joseph.p32" pid="86vtOyYxIEuQYcuoLnTi6w" hash="LkFWKQ">Now, my brethren, “these are [your] days” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/7.9" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 7:9</a>) in the history of the Church. Mark well what kind of days they will be, days when, with special visibility, the Lord will “make bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 133:3</a>.) God will also “hasten” His work. (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.73" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:73</a>.) He will also “shorten” the last days “for the elect’s sake”; hence, there will be a compression of events. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.22" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:22</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1.20" class="scriptureRef">JS—M 1:20</a>.) Furthermore, “all things shall be in commotion.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.91" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:91</a>.) Only those in the process of becoming the men and women of Christ will be able to keep their spiritual balance. Brethren, may we “walk by faith,” and, if necessary, even on our knees! In the name of the Lord of the universe, even Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

(See <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1974, pp. 12–13.) Today my plea is to those members already inside but whose discipleship is casual, individuals whom we love, whose gifts and talents are much needed in building the kingdom!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p3" pid="CuTsQGf4tUqG3jQUX7tUgw" hash="goAsLg">Any call for greater consecration is, of course, really a call to all of us. But these remarks are not primarily for those who are steadily striving and who genuinely seek to keep God’s commandments and yet sometimes fall short. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 46:9</a>.) Nor is this primarily for those few in deliberate noncompliance, including some who cast off on intellectual and behavioral bungee cords in search of new sensations, only to be jerked about by the old heresies and the old sins.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p4" pid="AOVLn-VH9U6sXOW9tlYAjA" hash="8qpZZg">Instead, these comments are for the essentially “honorable” members who are skimming over the surface instead of deepening their discipleship and who are casually engaged rather than “anxiously engaged.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.75" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:75</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27</a>.) Though nominal in their participation, their reservations and hesitations inevitably show through. They may even pass through our holy temples, but, alas, they do not let the holy temples pass through them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p5" pid="RB_7mTC2J02HzqSnKTvGoA" hash="poDkWQ">Such members accept callings but not all of the accompanying responsibilities; hence, their Church chores must often be done by those already “anxiously engaged.” Some regard themselves as merely “resting” in between Church callings. But we are never in between as to this soaring call from Jesus: “What manner of men [and women] ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>; see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:48</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:48</a>.) It is never safe to rest regarding that calling! In fact, being “valiant” in one’s testimony of Jesus includes striving to become more like Him in mind, heart, and attributes. (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.79" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:79</a>.) Becoming this manner of men and women is the ultimate expression of orthodoxy!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p6" pid="dy3yEh9_9Ei9mFCY6SNdpA" hash="vEtQww">All are free to choose, of course, and we would not have it otherwise. Unfortunately, however, when some choose slackness, they are choosing not only for themselves, but for the next generation and the next. Small equivocations in parents can produce large deviations in their children! Earlier generations in a family may have reflected dedication, while some in the current generation evidence equivocation. Sadly, in the next, some may choose dissension as erosion takes its toll.</p>

They know the doctrines of the kingdom, but more as a matter of recitation than of real comprehension.</p>

Called many times, he would not hear. He really knew concerning the truths of the gospel, but Amulek would not acknowledge that he knew. (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/10.4-6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 10:4–6</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p10" pid="rsZru1rJ_kuOIUPJAnp4ng" hash="QsxEwQ">One common characteristic of the honorable but slack is their disdain for the seemingly unexciting duties of discipleship, such as daily prayer, regular reading of the scriptures, attendance at sacrament meeting, paying a full tithe, and participating in the holy temples. Such disdain is especially dangerous in today’s world of raging relativism and of belching sensualism, a world in which, if many utter the name of Deity at all, it is only as verbal punctuation or as an expression of exclamation, not adoration!</p>

They avoid obscenity, keep the law of chastity, pay their tithes, and love and serve their spouses and children. As good neighbors, they “bear one another’s burdens,” “mourn with those that mourn,” “comfort those … in need of comfort,” and valiantly “stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:8–9</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p12" pid="3v_BoyX_P0Kn3VuamjIoHQ" hash="kjtWpA">When the determination is first made to begin to be more spiritually settled, there is an initial vulnerability: it is hard to break with the past. But once we begin, we see how friends who would hold us back spiritually are not true friends at all. Any chiding from them reflects either resentment or unconscious worry that somehow they are being deserted. In any attempt to explain to them, our tongue is able to speak only “the smallest part.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:16</a>.) We continue to care for them, but we care for our duty to God more. Brigham Young counseled candidly: “Some do not understand duties which do not coincide with their natural feelings and affections. … There are duties which are above affection.” (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 7:65.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p13" pid="D93A5zOM80auqVB2GSDL5A" hash="VTc7gA">Likewise it is only fair to warn that any determination to seek greater consecration will soon expose what we yet lack, a painful but necessary thing. Remember the rich, righteous young man who was told by Jesus, “One thing thou lackest”? (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.21" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:21</a>.) Ananias and Sapphira, otherwise good members of the Church, “kept back” a portion instead of consecrating their all. (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/5.1-11" class="scriptureRef">Acts 5:1–11</a>.) Some would never <span class="emphasis">sell</span> Jesus for thirty pieces, but they would not <span class="emphasis">give</span> Him their all either!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p14" pid="7cvEKvUkwkOis5R5U900PA" hash="3nQa3A">Unfortunately, we tend to think of consecration only in terms of property and money. But there are so many ways of keeping back part. One might be giving of money and time and yet hold back a significant portion of himself. One might share talents publicly yet privately retain a particular pride. One might hold back from kneeling before God’s throne and yet bow to a particular gallery of peers. One might accept a Church calling but have his heart more set on maintaining a certain role in the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p15" pid="P0HNUMtCrkWzpBysaSFeJg" hash="dvbRcw">Still others find it easier to bend their knees than their minds. Exciting exploration is preferred to plodding implementation; speculation seems more fun than consecration, and so is trying to soften the hard doctrines instead of submitting to them. Worse still, by not obeying, these few members lack real knowing. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/7.17" class="scriptureRef">John 7:17</a>.) Lacking real knowing, they cannot defend their faith and may become critics instead of defenders!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p16" pid="blUmwKZt4EaNamBwrG9dww" hash="vz3L8A">A few of the latter end up in the self-reinforcing and self-congratulating Hyde Park corner of the Church, which they provincially mistake for the whole of the Church, as if London’s real Hyde Park corner were Parliament, Whitehall, Buckingham Palace, and all of England combined!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p17" pid="DZxXnjTYdEyS3SvgVjP59Q" hash="xqA6bw">Only greater consecration will cure ambivalence and casualness in any of us! As already noted, the tutoring challenges arising from increased consecration may be severe but reflect the divine mercy necessary to induce further consecration. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.3" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 12:3</a>.) If we have grown soft, hard times may be necessary. Deprivation may prepare us for further consecration, though we shudder at the thought. If we are too easily contented, God may administer a dose of divine discontent. His long-suffering thus becomes very necessary to maximize our agency and development. But He is not an indulgent Father.</p>

It brings release from the raucous, overpopulated cell block of selfishness and emancipation from the dark prison of pride. Yet instead of striving for greater consecration, it is so easy to go on performing casually in halfhearted compliance as if hoping to “ride to paradise on a golf cart.” (Henry Fairlie, <span class="emphasis">The Seven Deadly Sins, </span> Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1979, p. 125.)</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.7" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 15:7</a>.) No! Heavenly Father is only asking us to lose the old self in order to find the new and the real self. It is not a question of losing our identity but of finding our true identity!</p>

As we come to know to Whom we belong, the other forms of belonging cease to mean very much. Likewise, as Jesus begins to have a real place in our lives, we are much less concerned with losing our places in the world. When our minds really catch hold of the significance of Jesus’ atonement, the world’s hold on us loosens. (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 36:18</a>.)</p>

Unorthodoxy in behavior and intellect is just the opposite. A little pornography may lead not only to child and spouse abuse, but it slowly sucks out the marrow of self-esteem. A little tendency to gossip can lead not only to bearing serious false witness, but more often to malicious whispers which, unfortunately, “memory will warehouse as a shout.” (C. S. Lewis, <span class="emphasis">The Quotable Lewis,</span> ed. Owen Barfield and Jerry Root, Wheaton, Ill.: Tindale Publications, 1989, p. 425.) A little criticism of the Brethren, which seems harmless enough, may not only damage other members but can even lead to one’s setting himself up as a substitute “light unto the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.29" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:29</a>.)

Getting thus settled precedes consecration. The Prophet Joseph Smith said gospel knowledge “does away with darkness, suspense, and doubt” and how “there is no pain so awful as that of suspense.” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> p. 288.) Being settled keeps us from responding to every little ripple of dissent as if it were a tidal wave. We are to be disciples, not oscillators, like a “reed shaken with the wind.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.7" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:7</a>.) More members need the immense relief and peace which can come from being “settled” without which those individuals will be like “the troubled sea, when it cannot rest.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/57.20" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 57:20</a>.)</p>

My aim, therefore, is internal instruction, not external persuasion, since we fully understand that certain of our beliefs are not shared by others and vice versa. But goodwill can still prevail. In fact, with you, brothers and sisters, I rejoice in the good works and the voices of faith of many in other religions. For instance, recent papal pronouncements on chastity are both appropriate and courageous, and I applaud them. So many honorable individuals in the world do so much without what we, as members, call gospel fulness, while some of us, unfortunately, do so little with so much!</p>

Hence, if the body constitutes a “dark jail” from which we should seek to escape, why desire a resurrection? (see ibid., p. 30, note 1). This view contrasts so sharply with modern revelation, which declares that only when the resurrected body and the individual spirit are inseparably connected can there be a “fulness of joy” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:33</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.15-16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:15–16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.17" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 138:17</a>).

Provincially, we focus on our own little sectors and their little pieces of gospel tile—without seeing the breathtaking mosaic of the Restoration! For instance, revealed truths tell of the stunning vastness of God’s work with its plurality of “worlds without number”! (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.33" class="scriptureRef">Moses 1:33</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:24</a>).

By so living, ours will not then be a mere appreciation of Jesus, nor a modest admiration of Him. Rather, ours will be an adoration of Jesus expressed by our emulation of Him!</p>

If there were no eternal truths, to what principles would mortals look for guidance? If not accountable to God, to whom are we ultimately accountable? Furthermore, if nothing is ever really wrong, then no one is ever really responsible. If there are no fixed boundaries, then there cannot be any excesses. Why should we be surprised, then, at so many disturbing outcomes, including the lack of community, when every man does that which is “right in his own eyes” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/judg/17.6" class="scriptureRef">Judg. 17:6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/judg/21.25" class="scriptureRef">Judg. 21:25</a>) and seeks not the righteousness of the Lord but instead walks “in his own way”?

Some of this decline represents the bitter harvest of ethical relativism, the philosophy of choice of many, reflecting no fixed, divine truths but merely the mores of the moment. No wonder Ortega y Gasset wisely warned, “If truth does not exist, relativism cannot take itself seriously.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

Nostalgically, many wish for the family life of yesteryear; they regard family decline as regrettable but not reversible. Others, genuinely worried over the spilling social consequences, are busy placing sandbags downstream, even when the frenzied use of sandbags often destroys what little is left of family gardens. A few regard the family as an institution to be drastically redefined or even to be rid of.</p>

How can a nation nurture family values without consistently valuing and protecting the family in its public policies? How can we value the family without valuing parenting? And how can we value parenting if we do not value marriage? How can there be “love at home” without love in a marriage?

For Latter-day Saints, though it is to be done in the Lord’s own way, every year should be the Year of the Family. However, as Latter-day Saints, we need to do better in our families—much better!

He is a meek and special man. And, as we’ve heard the testimonies from two new Apostles whom we sustained this morning, I raise my sustaining voice this afternoon. I rejoice in two outstanding new Seventies and in new special sister leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p2" pid="VkpfOZ31lki10pZ2TCEtjw" hash="25piLg">For some years, brothers and sisters, there has been an increasing and profound sense of existential despair in the world. This mortal hopelessness both reflects and affects much of mankind. Whether tribal or national, wars constitute “the continued experience of twentieth-century man” (Paul Fussell, <span class="emphasis">The Great War and Modern Memory,</span> London: Oxford University Press, 1975, p. 74). A grumpy cynicism pervades politics in so many places on this planet. Holocausts, famine, pestilence, and tides of refugees have taken a terrible toll on human hope, with much of that toll coming from man-made, avoidable disasters. Causality can be assigned to one or another form of iniquity. No wonder, as the scriptures say, despair comes of iniquity! (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.22" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:22</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p3" pid="OsgTK6i5ukigOsAvmQxlMA" hash="Bwe_Ow">Of course, many disagree over what constitutes sin, but surely they do not welcome the deepening of human despair! Some moderns do not lament the loss of traditional faith either, but surely they lament the further loss of hope and charity, ever in such short supply anyway.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p4" pid="5Qh2bdvrC0-wWnbEuPCEiw" hash="ViIVlw">Does hope really matter, or is it merely an antique virtue?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p5" pid="-B8-h2h3GEKGPXJWhEBamw" hash="N3ONeg">Without hope, what is the future of lubricating forgiveness among the human family? Without hope, why forgo now in order to preserve precious resources for future generations? Without hope, what will keep the remaining idealism from also souring into cynicism and thereby laying waste to governments and families—institutions already in such serious jeopardy?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p6" pid="X0op9XtwpEqwUGHNjdDcHA" hash="HVgn3g">A coalition of consequences is emerging. As prophesied, the love of many waxes cold (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.12" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:12</a>). Even those affectionally secure themselves can sense the chill in the air. The loss of hope sends selfishness surging, as many turn, even more intensively, to pleasing themselves. The diminished sense of sin diminishes shame, that hot, sharp spur needed for repentance. Shame is often replaced by the arrogance of those morally adrift, including strutting celebrities whose outer boldness camouflages their inner emptiness. Henry David Thoreau correctly observed that “unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusement of mankind” (<span class="emphasis">Walden,</span> New York: Harper and Row, 1965, p. 7). No wonder so much hollow laughter emanates from the “lonely crowd.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p7" pid="onGBL9OGI06g_rWeCdFLFQ" hash="7Jex-g">As societies trivialize traditional values, we witness a flow of immense suffering. We anguish, for instance, over what happens to the unborn, who cannot vote, and to children at risk. We weep over children having children and children shooting children. Often secular remedies to these challenges are not based on spiritual principles. To borrow a metaphor—secular remedies resemble an alarmed passenger traveling on the wrong train who tries to compensate by running up the aisle in the opposite direction!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p8" pid="Gc2SsY23I0eAM8xX94_zoQ" hash="xnN8EA">Only the acceptance of the revelations of God can bring both direction and correction and, in turn, bring a “brightness of hope” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>). Real hope does not automatically “spring eternal” unless it is connected with eternal things!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p9" pid="MxhO2rqAK0uqZXdlDOYTyQ" hash="MStEuw">“What is it that ye shall hope for?” Moroni wrote. “Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.41" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:41</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/27.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 27:28</a>). From this triumphal act, resulting in the eventual resurrection of all mankind, so many lesser hopes derive their significance!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p10" pid="7lEPvp4Au0-_aiRWrBNiXw" hash="mI7GdQ">Prophets have always had and taught ultimate hope in Christ. Jacob wrote, “We knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming; and … also all the holy prophets which were before us” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.4" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:4</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p11" pid="RD6h8uVQ90KP-we42vYmBQ" hash="d68Wgw">You and I can be repeatedly reassured concerning this grand hope by the Comforter, who teaches us the truth about “things as they really are, and … really will be” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:13</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.26" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 8:26</a>). Such hope constitutes the “anchor of the soul” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/6.19" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 6:19</a>). Such hope is retained through faith in Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/25.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 25:16</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.9" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:9</a>). In contrast, a resurrection-less view of life produces only proximate hope (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:19</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p12" pid="lX9nce7ePUysRRHAtaOziQ" hash="dUHBWQ">Having ultimate hope does not mean we will always be rescued from proximate problems, but we will be rescued from everlasting death! Meanwhile, ultimate hope makes it possible to say the same three words used centuries ago by three valiant men. They knew God could rescue them from the fiery furnace, if He chose. “But if not,” they said, nevertheless, they would still serve Him! (<a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/3.18" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 3:18</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p13" pid="Thx14HDbUkuRDzLAxWCraA" hash="J6v3yA">Unsurprisingly the triad of faith, hope, and charity, which brings us to Christ, has strong and converging linkage: faith is in the Lord Jesus Christ, hope is in His atonement, and charity is the “pure love of Christ”! (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.28" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:28</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:47</a>.) Each of these attributes qualifies us for the celestial kingdom (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.20-21" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:20–21</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.34" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:34</a>). Each, first of all, requires us to be meek and lowly (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.39,43" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 7:39, 43</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p14" pid="aQq06_pQr02PM-HbaDGgBg" hash="Uaa1hA">Faith and hope are constantly interactive, and may not always be precisely distinguished or sequenced. Though not perfect knowledge either, hope’s enlivened expectations are “with surety” true (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.4" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:4</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.24" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:24</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:1</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.21" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:21</a>). In the geometry of restored theology, hope has a greater circumference than faith. If faith increases, the perimeter of hope stretches correspondingly.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p15" pid="FIIFI_qctEivoklIzrTsOA" hash="EaL1nQ">Just as doubt, despair, and desensitization go together, so do faith, hope, and charity. The latter, however, must be carefully and constantly nurtured, whereas despair, like dandelions, needs so little encouragement to sprout and spread. Despair comes so naturally to the natural man!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p16" pid="SH58eMk5eUOHkZ7i59XWrg" hash="jeAFkg">Souls can be roused and rallied by hope’s “reveille” as by no other music. Even if comrades slumber or desert, “lively hope” performs like a reconnoitering scout out in advance of God’s columns; “there is hope smiling brightly before us” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.3" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 1:3</a>; <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 19). Hope caused disciples to go quickly and expectantly to an empty garden tomb (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/16.1-8" class="scriptureRef">Mark 16:1–8</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/24.8-12" class="scriptureRef">Luke 24:8–12</a>). Hope helped a prophet to see rescuing rain in a distant cloud which appeared to be no larger than a man’s hand (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18.41-46" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 18:41–46</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p17" pid="PdMEKMS1u0WZHqWmCaXPug" hash="31LtLA">Significantly, those who look forward to a next and better world are usually “anxiously engaged” in improving this one, for they “always abound in good works” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.24" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:24</a>). Thus, real hope is much more than wishful musing. It stiffens, not slackens, the spiritual spine. It is composed, not giddy, eager without being naive, and pleasantly steady without being smug. Hope is realistic anticipation taking the form of determination—a determination not merely to survive but to “endure … well” to the end (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:8</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p18" pid="Z_jaOLIrGUecZRXEnJ2ErA" hash="31xC0w">While weak hope leaves us at the mercy of our moods and events, “brightness of hope” produces illuminated individuals. Their luminosity is seen, and things are also seen by it! Such hope permits us to “press forward” even when dark clouds oppress (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.16,20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:16, 20</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/6.19" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 6:19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.4" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/col/1.23" class="scriptureRef">Col. 1:23</a>). Sometimes in the deepest darkness there is no external light—only an inner light to guide and to reassure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p19" pid="rxh8eSeECEexw0bXTIuk-g" hash="dW22eg">Though “anchored” in grand and ultimate hope, some of our tactical hopes are another matter. We may hope for a pay raise, a special date, an electoral victory, or for a bigger house—things which may or may not be realized. Faith in Father’s plan gives us endurance even amid the wreckage of such proximate hopes. Hope keeps us “anxiously engaged” in good causes even when these appear to be losing causes (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:27</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p20" pid="KlMeC03UkkKD3LD8lvXE0w" hash="sJE_XA">Hope helps us to walk by faith, not by sight. This can actually be safer. When unaided spiritually, natural sight often shrinks from the odds (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/5.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 5:7</a>). It is immobilized by improbabilities. Mauled by his moods and intimidated by his fears, the natural man overreacts to, while hope overrides, the disappointments of the day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p21" pid="wsx-Y6nGSk6nfApZnZr5fQ" hash="PhN7vw">Hope is particularly needed in the hand-to-hand combat required to put off the natural man (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>). Giving up on God and on oneself constitutes simultaneous surrender to the natural man.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p22" pid="ND2ILstFQECHafcPOomgFA" hash="KMfXMQ">Daily hope is vital, since the “Winter Quarters” of our lives are not immediately adjacent to our promised land either. An arduous trek still awaits, but hope spurs weary disciples on.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p23" pid="oNQTX9doykirvBecyrdugQ" hash="LSKrWA">Those with true hope often see their personal circumstances shaken, like kaleidoscopes, again and again. Yet with the “eye of faith,” they still see divine pattern and purpose (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.15" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:15</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p24" pid="If3pHDRYoEibeTeW1DXK-w" hash="WdNN9Q">By pressing forward, we can stand on what was yesterday’s horizon, thereby drawing hope from our own experiences. Hence Paul described how “tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/5.3-4" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 5:3–4</a>). Therefore we sing, “We’ve proved him in days that are past” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 19).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p25" pid="HYbkUOdBAEanQAOgxJwF8w" hash="0bcLqA">Hope feasts on the words of Christ, “written for our learning,” so that “having all these witnesses” through the “comfort of the scriptures [we] might have hope” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/15.4" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 15:4</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.6" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:6</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>). We sing, too, of how “more holiness” involves having “more hope in his word” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 131).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p26" pid="AM8ML_okLkyjrQAihC9WSA" hash="Ve17iA">Genuine hope is urgently needed in order to be more loving even as the love of many waxes cold; more merciful, even when misunderstood or misrepresented; more holy, even as the world ripens in iniquity; more courteous and patient in a coarsening and curt world; and more full of heartfelt hope, even when other men’s hearts fail them. Whatever our particular furrow, we are to “plow in hope,” without looking back or letting yesterday hold tomorrow hostage (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/9.10" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 9:10</a>).</p>

If, said Brother Brigham, we do not impart knowledge to others and do good, then we “will become … contracted” in our views and feelings (<span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 2:267). Despair is contraction at the end of its journey.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1994/10/brightness-of-hope.p28" pid="yo0lWSc3BEKViCgO-28llA" hash="8_u2fw">Genuine hope gives spiritual spunk, including to deserving parents drenched in honest sweat from being “anxiously engaged.” Just as the leaning Tower of Pisa is a persistent rebuke to architectural pessimism, so parental hope—by refusing to topple merely because of the gravity of the current family situation—is a repudiation of despair. Giving parents never give up hope!</p>

Our tears are just as wet, but not because of despair. Rather, they are tears of appreciation evoked by poignant separation. They will change, erelong, to tears of glorious anticipation. Yet the emptiness is so real and so restless it initiates a retroactive inventory of what is now so painfully missing, doing so, however, while forecasting fulness and resplendent reunion!</p>

Eyring to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who are so ably presided over by President Boyd K. Packer. Elder Eyring is a special blend of brightness and sweetness. I am delighted to sustain President James E. Faust, my seatmate of fourteen years and for over thirty years a companion in various civic chores and Church assignments. I have been blessed with five wonderful sisters but no brothers. President Faust has been that kind of brother to me for many years.</p>

Hinckley, was asked to visit with the First Presidency because of his special work in the British Isles. His fifteen-minute appointment soon stretched to nearly an hour and a half. Impressed, the First Presidency requested him to help with missionary work, and he has scarcely left the Church Administration Building since then. Only now, he sits, humbly, in the center chair in the First Presidency Council Room to which he came humbly sixty years ago!</p>

When we rightly describe him as having good judgment, good humor, goodwill, and as being a good listener, the common adjective is <span class="emphasis">good.</span> Goodness is thus the key to so much of what makes up President Hinckley, whom I am delighted to sustain as our President, prophet, seer, and revelator, the high calling which has come after such unusual preparation of this exceptional disciple of Christ.</p>

Elsewhere, Moroni declared the need for us to deny ourselves “all ungodliness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:32</a>), thus including both large and small sins. While boulders surely block our way, loose gravel slows discipleship, too. Even a small stone can become a stumbling block.</p>

Thus, putting off the views and appetites of the natural man is such a large part of denying oneself, a process sometimes accompanied by scalding shame and the reflux of regret (see JST, Luke 14:28).</p>

As one writer noted, this mantra has its own incessant “beat,” and it goes “Me … Me … Me … Me!” (Daivd Frum, <span class="emphasis">Dead Right,</span> New York: BasicBooks, 1994, p. 203, quoting Tom Wolfe, “The Me Decade and the Third Great Awakening,” in <span class="emphasis">Purple Decades,</span> New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 1982, p. 293).</p>

It is naive to say that hedonists merely march to the beat of a different drummer. So did the Gadarene swine!</p>

Some thought Lukacs was overstating it, but consider the subsequent and sobering tragedy of children having children, of unwed mothers, of children without parents, of hundreds of thousands of fatherless children, and of rampant spousal infidelity. These and related consequences threaten to abort society’s future even before the future arrives! Yet carnalists are unwilling to deny themselves, even though all of society suffers from an awful avalanche of consequences!</p>

This same commentator has written, “Fatherlessness is the engine driving our most urgent social problems, from crime to adolescent pregnancy to domestic violence” (ibid., p. 7). Such outcomes, brothers and sisters, unfortunately, constitute America’s grossest national product, produced in the slums of the spirit created by spreading secularism!</p>

Once darkened, a society loses its capacity to distinguish between right and wrong and the will to declare that some things are wrong <span class="emphasis">per se.</span> Without the lamp, our world finds itself desperately building temporary defenses, drawing new lines, forever falling back, unwilling to confront. A society which permits anything will eventually lose everything!</p>

Yet today there is so much hedonism and shouted justification with so little quiet shame. Bad deeds are viewed as nobody’s fault and everything as excusable on one basis or another.</p>

Likewise, in place of real confessions there are fluid variations of “I hope I can forgive myself.” In contrast, the inquiring Apostles knew the direction in which they faced; all anxiously asked Jesus of the impending betrayal, “Lord, is it I?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.22" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:22</a>.)</p>

But the smaller sins breed there, too, like insects in the mud, including the coarsening of language. But why should we expect those who “mind the things of the flesh” to mind their tongues? (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.5" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:5</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/deny-yourselves-of-all-ungodliness.p17" pid="PNWeWwWqMUmkViSCMiFhwg" hash="2tjSeg">For some, their god “is their belly,” as are other forms of anatomical allegiance! (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 3:19</a>.) A few hedonists actually glory in their shame, and there is even a “greediness” in their “uncleanness” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.18-19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:18–19</a>). Sadly, too, a few envy the wicked. Still others complain that the wicked seem to get away with it! (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/23.17" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 23:17</a>; <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.14-15" class="scriptureRef">Mal. 3:14–15</a>.)</p>

People who wrongly celebrate their capacity to feel finally reach a point where they lose much of their capacity to feel! In the words of three different prophets, such individuals become “past feeling” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.45" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:45</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.20" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 9:20</a>).</p>

Such individuals do not experience real joy, such as being quietly and deeply grateful to a generous God, or of helping to restore those who “droop in sin” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.28" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 4:28</a>), or of gladly forgoing praise and recognition so that it might flow, instead, to parched souls.</p>

But some worry only about holes in the ozone layer, while the fabric of many families who lack the lamp resembles Swiss cheese.</p>

Some levees and sandbags must be placed downstream. But the real problem lies at the family fountainhead. Many things will not get better until we have better families, but this will require much more self-denial, not less. Most major social and political problems simply cannot be solved without large doses of self-denial; ironically, this is a quality best developed in loving families where the lamp is lit.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1995/04/deny-yourselves-of-all-ungodliness.p22" pid="dUsxeldwyU6fCpEK3EjXAg" hash="A2amRA">Meanwhile, mortals remain free to choose between the things of the moment and the things of eternity (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>). Given the choices made by some, we all end up with more protected pornography than protected children. Of course better self-restraint than censorship, but urging self-restraint on hedonists is like discouraging Dracula from hanging around the blood bank!</p>

To lie, steal, murder, envy, to be sexually immoral, neglect parents, break the Sabbath, and to bear false witness—all occur because one mistakenly seeks to please himself for the moment regardless of divine standards or human consequences. As prophesied, ethical relativism is now in steep crescendo: “Every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 1:16</a>).</p>

I remember reading that one Nazi leader used to listen to Haydn’s music while watching Jewish people being gassed. He was probably proud of his music appreciation.</p>

But David’s act of earlier bravery cannot compensate for his later adultery with the wife of Uriah. All things considered, brothers and sisters, to whom did David deal the greater blow, Goliath or Uriah? Or himself?</p>

Yet it is not enough to be free of racism if one is simultaneously enslaved by other appetites. Jesus emphasized the need for proportion, saying there are “weightier matters” even among good things (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/23.23" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 23:23</a>). To the commandment-keeping young man, Jesus responded, “One thing thou lackest,” referring to an errant attachment to material possessions (<a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/10.21" class="scriptureRef">Mark 10:21</a>). Most of us lack more than just one thing. As we come closer to the Lord, He has promised to “show unto [us our] weakness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:27</a>). Hence, general goodness is no excuse for failing to work on those things which we yet lack.</p>

Meanwhile, the absence of gross sins in our lives can lull us into slackness concerning seemingly small sins. The failure to visit and care for parents is a failure to honor one’s father and mother. In its lesser form, the lack of self-restraint causes unkind comments to a spouse, but in the extreme it can bring domestic abuse and even murder. The tendency to strike back whenever we are offended makes us brusque and rude, as if others were functions, not as brothers and sisters. Thus, excess of ego is like a spreading, toxic spill from which flow all the deadly sins (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/6.16-19" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 6:16–19</a>). Young parents know how a mere half cup of spilled milk seems to cover half a kitchen floor. Small sins spread like that, too.</p>

Jesus’ perfect character is thus not only holy, but wholly complete and finished. Without Jesus’ supernal character, He could not have accomplished the astonishing atonement! And He has asked us to become much more like Him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:48</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:48</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>). Though heavy, discipleship’s burden can be made light (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.30" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:30</a>). The Lord can “ease the burdens,” and/or our shoulders can be made strong enough that we “may be able to bear it” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.14" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 24:14</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 10:13</a>).</p>

Instead, it is a willingness to put the animal in us upon the altar and letting it be consumed! Such is the “sacrifice unto the Lord … of a broken heart and a contrite spirit,” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:8</a>), a prerequisite to taking up the cross, while giving “away all [our] sins” in order to “know God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:18</a>) for the denial of self precedes the full acceptance of Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Ironically, if the Master is a stranger to us, then we will merely end up serving other masters. The sovereignty of these other masters is real, even if it sometimes is subtle, for they do call their cadence.

Once the telestial sins are left behind and henceforth avoided, the focus falls ever more on the sins of omission. These omissions signify a lack of qualifying fully for the celestial kingdom. Only greater consecration can correct these omissions, which have consequences just as real as do the sins of commission. Many of us thus have sufficient faith to avoid the major sins of commission, but not enough faith to sacrifice our distracting obsessions or to focus on our omissions.</p>

These shape our thought patterns. Our desires thus precede our deeds and lie at the very cores of our souls, tilting us toward or away from God (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:3</a>). God can “educate our desires” (see Joseph F. Smith, <span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 297). Others seek to manipulate our desires. But it is we who form the desires, the “thoughts and intents of [our] hearts” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.13" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:13</a>).</p>

Anything less results in a lesser portion (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.10-11" class="scriptureRef">Alma 12:10–11</a>). The Lord will work with us even if, at first, we “can no more than desire” but are willing to “give place for a portion of [His] words” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:27</a>). A small foothold is all He needs! But we must desire and provide it.</p>

What we are really worried about, of course, is not giving up self, but selfish things—like our roles, our time, our preeminence, and our possessions. No wonder we are instructed by the Savior to lose ourselves (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/9.24" class="scriptureRef">Luke 9:24</a>). He is only asking us to lose the old self in order to find the new self. It is not a question of one’s losing identity but of finding his true identity! Ironically, so many people already lose themselves anyway in their consuming hobbies and preoccupations but with far, far lesser things.</p>

In the trying and very defining Isaac episode, faithful Abraham “staggered not … through unbelief” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/4.20" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 4:20</a>). Of that episode John Taylor observed that “nothing but the spirit of revelation could have given him this confidence, and … sustained him under these peculiar circumstances” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 14:361). Will we too trust the Lord amid a perplexing trial for which we have no easy explanation? Do we understand—really comprehend—that Jesus knows and understands when we are stressed and perplexed? The complete consecration which effected the Atonement ensured Jesus’ perfect empathy; He felt our very pains and afflictions before we did and knows how to succor us (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:21</a>). Since the Most Innocent suffered the most, our own cries of “Why?” cannot match His. But we can utter the same submissive word “nevertheless …” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:39</a>).</p>

Rather, it is a deliberate expanding outward, making us more honest when we sing, “More used would I be” (“More Holiness Give Me,”<span class="emphasis"> 1985, Hymns,</span> no. 131). Consecration, likewise, is not shoulder-shrugging acceptance, but, instead, shoulder-squaring to better bear the yoke.</p>

Jesus pressed forward sublimely. He did not shrink, such as by going only 60 percent of the distance toward the full atonement. Instead, He “finished [His] preparations” for all mankind, bringing a universal resurrection—not one in which 40 percent of us would have been left out (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.18-19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 19:18–19</a>).</p>

For example, we can tell much by what we have already willingly discarded along the pathway of discipleship. It is the only pathway where littering is permissible, even encouraged. In the early stages, the debris left behind includes the grosser sins of commission. Later debris differs; things begin to be discarded which have caused the misuse or underuse of our time and talent.</p>

If we have grown soft, hard times may be necessary. If we are too contented, a dose of divine discontent may come. A relevant insight may be contained in reproof. A new calling beckons us away from comfortable routines wherein the needed competencies have already been developed. One may be stripped of accustomed luxury so that the malignant mole of materialism may be removed. One may be scorched by humiliation so pride can be melted away. Whatever we lack will get attention, one way or another.</p>

President Young further counseled us “to submit to the hand of the Lord, … and acknowledge his hand in all things, … then you will be exactly right; and until you come to that point, you cannot be entirely right. That is what we have to come to” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 5:352).</p>

Sometimes He clearly directs; other times it seems He merely permits some things to happen. Therefore, we will not always understand the role of God’s hand, but we know enough of his heart and mind to be submissive. Thus when we are perplexed and stressed, explanatory help is not always immediately forthcoming, but compensatory help will be. Thus our process of cognition gives way to our personal submission, as we experience those moments when we learn to “be still, and know that I am God” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/46.10" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 46:10</a>).</p>

God’s blessings, including those associated with consecration, come by unforced obedience to the laws upon which they are predicated (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.20-21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:20–21</a>). Thus our deepest desires determine our degree of “obedience to the unenforceable.” God seeks to have us become more consecrated by giving everything. Then, when we come home to Him, He will generously give us “all that [He] hath” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:38</a>).</p>

The many other things we “give,” brothers and sisters, are actually the things He has already given or loaned to us.

S. Lewis’s metaphor about those who run around with fire extinguishers in times of flood. For instance, there are increasing numbers of victims of violence and crime, yet special attention is paid to the rights of criminals. Accompanying an ever increasing addiction to pornography are loud alarms against censorship. Rising illegitimacy destroys families and threatens the funding capacities of governments; nevertheless, chastity and fidelity are mocked. These and other consequences produce a harsh cacophony. When Nero fiddled as Rome burned, at least he made a little music! I have no hesitancy, brothers and sisters, in stating that unless checked, permissiveness, by the end of its journey, will cause humanity to stare in mute disbelief at its awful consequences.</p>

This, too, is part of being sedated by secularism! Needless abortion, for instance, is a “reproductive health procedure,” which is an even more “spongy expression” than “termination of pregnancy” (George McKenna, “On Abortion: A Lincolnian Position,” <span class="emphasis">Atlantic Monthly,</span> Sept. 1995, 52, 54). “Illegitimacy” gives way to the wholly sanitized words “nonmarital birth” or “alternative parenting” (Ben J.

Some real tares even masquerade as wheat, including the few eager individuals who lecture the rest of us about Church doctrines in which they no longer believe. They criticize the use of Church resources to which they no longer contribute. They condescendingly seek to counsel the Brethren whom they no longer sustain. Confrontive, except of themselves, of course, they leave the Church, but they cannot leave the Church alone (<span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1980, 14). Like the throng on the ramparts of the “great and spacious building,” they are intensely and busily preoccupied, pointing fingers of scorn at the steadfast iron-rodders (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.26-28,33" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:26–28, 33</a>). Considering their ceaseless preoccupation, one wonders, Is there no diversionary activity available to them, especially in such a large building—like a bowling alley? Perhaps in their mockings and beneath the stir are repressed doubts of their doubts. In any case, given the perils of popularity, Brigham Young advised that this “people must be kept where the finger of scorn can be pointed at them” (<span class="emphasis">Discourses of Brigham Young,</span> sel. John A. Widtsoe [1941], 434).</p>

Likewise, the arrogance of critics must be met by the meekness and articulateness of believers. If sometimes ringed by resentment, we must still reach out, especially for those whose hands hang down (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/81.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 81:5</a>). If our shortcomings as a people are occasionally highlighted, then let us strive to do better.</p>

Hence, while journeying through our Sinai, we are nourished in the Bountiful-like oases of the Restoration. Of these oases some of our first impressions may prove to be more childish than definitive. Brushing against such lush and verdant vegetation, its fragrance is inevitably upon us. Our pockets are stuffed with varied and lush fruits, and we are filled with glee. There is no way to describe it all. In our appreciation, little wonder some of us mistake a particular tree for the whole of an oasis, or a particularly refreshing pool for the entirety of the Restoration’s gushing and living waters. Hence, in our early exclamations there may even be some unintended exaggerations. We have seen, and partaken of, far too much; hence we “cannot [speak] the smallest part which [we] feel” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.16" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:16</a>).</p>

Each of these is given to strengthen, edify, instruct, comfort, and inspire us while we are “knit together in love” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/col/2.2" class="scriptureRef">Col. 2:2</a>).

With no intervening communication, last month in Curitiba, Brazil, Valentim Goncalves stood by me again, not on a tennis court but instead in a regional conference to translate for me. Thanks to his innate goodness and the good work of others, ophthalmologist Valentim is not only a member, but is a stake president in Curitiba. Valentim and his special wife, sealed in the temple, have been blessed with three lovely children. This remarkable rendezvous added to my already appreciative wonder over the workings of the hand of the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.21" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 59:21</a>).</p>

He has been such a blessing to them and many others. Also spiritually precocious, Benjamin is a constant source of love and reassurance. Having had 17 surgeries, resilient Benjamin knows all about hospitals and doctors. Once, when an overwhelmed attendant became vocally upset—not at Benjamin, but over stressful circumstances—little three-year-old Benjamin exemplified the words of another Benjamin about our need to be childlike and “full of love” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>). Little Benjamin reached out, tenderly patted the irritated attendant, and said, “I love you anyway.” A similar episode occurred recently in an Israeli hospital, where little Benjamin, going through a necessary but very painful procedure, used the same loving words to reassure a physician. No wonder, brothers and sisters, in certain moments we feel children are our spiritual superiors.</p>

Five years ago, Joseph was stricken suddenly and, in effect, became a hospitalized quadriplegic. There, supine Joseph’s sons would often be cradled in his arms. Joseph would always smile even when he could not speak audibly. In the eyes of the world, his was a catastrophic illness. Nevertheless, Joseph, his saintly wife, their two boys, and with strong support from parents and families, coped remarkably for five years. Because they trusted God as to what was really going on, like Job, they did not charge “God foolishly” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/1.22" class="scriptureRef">Job 1:22</a>).</p>

Radiant Joseph died recently. The very day after his death, prescient, nine-year-old Jacob, who knew firsthand of his father’s loving and outreaching nature, said, “Mom, I’ll bet Dad already has a lot of friends in heaven!” A few days later, seven-year-old Andrew struggled with a computer assignment at school but later reported to his mother, “I just thought of Dad, and he helped me.”</p>

His names—Jared Ammon—tell you much about his parents and family. Accompanied by a thoughtful mission and stake president, there was scarcely room for the four of us to stand beside the bed in the tiny room where Jared Ammon’s faithful 14-year-old sister held him in her arms. His stomach was so severely swollen. When the stake president lifted the oxygen mask to ask if he would like a blessing, Jared said, “Yes, please.” It was a privilege to bless him and to call him to serve beyond the veil. Tears flowed, for the Spirit was strong. The oxygen mask was then lifted again, and Jared Ammon was asked if there was anything else we could do for him. Jared meekly requested that we sing for him “I Am a Child of God” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 301). Weepingly, we responded to a submissive Jared Ammon’s last request, and two hours later he was released from this life.</p>

Whether in their conception or expression, our desires profoundly affect the use of our moral agency.

        <span class="emphasis">Desire</span> denotes a real longing or craving. Hence righteous desires are much more than passive preferences or fleeting feelings. Of course our genes, circumstances, and environments matter very much, and they shape us significantly. Yet there remains an inner zone in which we are sovereign, unless we abdicate. In this zone lies the essence of our individuality and our personal accountability.</p>

Moreover, we live in an age when many simply refuse to feel responsible for themselves. Thus, a crystal-clear understanding of the doctrines pertaining to desire is so vital because of the spreading effluent oozing out of so many unjustified excuses by so many. This is like a sludge which is sweeping society along toward “the gulf of misery and endless wo” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 5:12</a>). Feeding that same flow is the selfish philosophy of “no fault,” which is replacing the meek and apologetic “my fault.” We listen with eager ear to hear genuine pleas for forgiveness instead of the ritualistic “Sorry. I hope I can forgive myself.”</p>

William R. May explained such sloth: “The soul in this state is beyond mere sadness and melancholy. It has removed itself from the rise and fall of feelings; the very root of its feelings in desire is dead. … To be a man is to desire. The good man desires God and other things in God. The sinful man desires things in the place of God, but he is still recognizably human, inasmuch as he has known desire.

President Brigham Young confirmed, saying, “It is evident that many who understand the truth do not govern themselves by it; consequently, no matter how true and beautiful truth is, you have to take the passions of the people and mould them to the law of God” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 7:55).</p>

No, they will not” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 7:55). Thus knowing gospel truths and doctrines is profoundly important, but we must also come to love them. When we love them, they will move us and help our desires and outward works to become more holy.</p>

Like Newton’s Second Law, there is a transmitting of acceleration as well as a contagiousness associated with even the small acts of goodness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/according-to-the-desire-of-our-hearts.p22" pid="VpYUhUTrC0CbFZf_UQ23Fw" hash="Y_GEZQ">Fortunately for us, our loving Lord will work with us, “even if [we] can [do] no more than desire to believe,” providing we will “let this desire work in [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:27</a>). Therefore, declared President Joseph F. Smith, “the education then of our desires is one of far-reaching importance to our happiness in life” (<span class="emphasis">Gospel Doctrine,</span> 5th ed. [1939], 297). Such education can lead to sanctification until, said President Brigham Young, “holy desires produce corresponding outward works” (in <span class="emphasis">Journal of Discourses,</span> 6:170). Only by educating and training our desires can they become our allies instead of our enemies!</p>

For instance, the biblical counsel “let not thine heart envy sinners” is directed squarely at those with a sad unsettlement of soul (<a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/23.17" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 23:17</a>). Once again, we must be honest with ourselves about the consequences of our desires, which follow as the night, the day. Similarly faced with life’s so-called “bad breaks,” the natural man desires to wallow in self-pity; therefore this desire must go too.</p>

For instance, what is now only a weak desire to be a better spouse, father, or mother needs to become a stronger desire, just as Abraham experienced divine discontent and desired greater happiness and knowledge (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/1.2" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 1:2</a>).</p>

His “arm is lengthened out all the day long” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.32" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:32</a>), and even if His arm goes ungrasped, it was unarguably there! In the same redemptive reaching out, our desiring to improve our human relationships usually requires some long-suffering. Sometimes reaching out is like trying to pat a porcupine. Even so, the accumulated quill marks are evidence that our hands of fellowship have been stretched out, too!</p>

Therein lies life’s greatest and most persistent challenge. Thus when people are described as “having lost their desire for sin,” it is they, and they only, who deliberately decided to lose those wrong desires by being willing to “give away all [their] sins” in order to know God (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:18</a>).</p>

Even so, given our responsibilities for our own desires, we should not be surprised that Adam and Eve, such superb parents who conscientiously taught all things to their children, still lost some of them! Lehi and Sariah made the same effort, doing so “with all the feeling of a tender parent” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.37" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:37</a>). Yet they experienced the same thing with Laman and Lemuel, who “understood not the dealings of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/10.14" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 10:14</a>). Fixing responsibility for such recalcitrance where it should be, the Prophet Joseph Smith observed: “Men who have no principle of … truth, do not understand the word of truth when they hear it. The devil taketh away the word of truth out of their hearts, because there is no desire for righteousness in them” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> sel.

My love and thanks to all of you!</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/from-whom-all-blessings-flow.p5" pid="HMxpewigskmLhivbgKT1dA" hash="y2BuVg">Uncertainty as to our longevity is one of life’s basic realities for all of us. Hence, you and I should importune in faith for the blessings we deeply desire, but then be “content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.3" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:3</a>). Clearly our individual exit routes from this life vary; so does the timing.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/from-whom-all-blessings-flow.p6" pid="_gAwTnYfmkaLaeMg6msbxg" hash="D-W-sg">There are many who suffer so much more than the rest of us: some go agonizingly; some go quickly; some are healed; some are given more time; some seem to linger. There are variations in our trials but no immunities. Thus, the scriptures cite the fiery furnace and fiery trials (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/3.6-26" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 3:6–26</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/4.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 4:12</a>). Those who emerge successfully from their varied and fiery furnaces have experienced the grace of the Lord, which He says is sufficient (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:27</a>). Even so, brothers and sisters, such emerging individuals do not rush to line up in front of another fiery furnace in order to get an extra turn! However, since the mortal school is of such short duration, our tutoring Lord can be the Schoolmaster of the compressed curriculum.</p>

It is the supernal truth which, along with His plan of happiness, reigns preeminent and imperial over all other realities. Other truths, by comparison, are merely fleeting factoids about which we may be “ever learning” without coming to a knowledge of the grand truths (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.7" class="scriptureRef">2 Tim. 3:7</a>).</p>

Whether illness or aloneness, injustice or rejection, etc., our comparatively small-scale sufferings, if we are meek, will sink into the very marrow of the soul. We then better appreciate not only Jesus’ sufferings for us, but also His matchless character, moving us to greater adoration and even emulation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/04/from-whom-all-blessings-flow.p10" pid="nwRiCwNDj0umEbElUGMbfw" hash="5uwpEA">Alma revealed that Jesus knows how to succor us in the midst of our griefs and sicknesses precisely because Jesus has already borne our griefs and sicknesses (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–12</a>). He knows them firsthand; thus His empathy is earned. Of course, we do not comprehend it fully any more than we understand how He bore all mortal sins, but His Atonement remains the rescuing and reassuring reality.</p>

Ah, the arrogant arm of flesh, like the quarterback whose arm was so strong it was boasted that he could throw a football through a car wash and it would come out dry on the other side! Such naïveté, such triviality symbolize not only the arm, but also the mind of flesh, which misses “things as they really are, and … things as they really will be” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:13</a>).</p>

I have thereby learned, however, that there is another side to the “Why me?” question, since some are not granted any “delay en route” at all. Whichever side of that question, what is needed is mortal submission, even when there is no immediate divine explanation. Thus we are to press forward, whatever the length of the near horizon, while rejoicing in what awaits us on the far horizon.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/apply-the-atoning-blood-of-christ.p3" pid="bUs5-ld4-0iICVYi4ASF3g" hash="fnxF5w">In bringing to pass the beneficent Atonement, certain things were utterly unique to Jesus. These cannot be replicated by us, the beneficiaries of the glorious Atonement with its gift of universal resurrection but also its proffer of eternal life (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.57-62" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:57–62</a>). Obviously, unlike our precious Savior, we surely cannot atone for the sins of mankind! Moreover, we certainly cannot bear all mortal sicknesses, infirmities, and griefs (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–12</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/apply-the-atoning-blood-of-christ.p4" pid="Zmu0do_lFkePw1uQMqUxbA" hash="GEnuJQ">However, on our smaller scale, just as Jesus has invited, we can indeed strive to become “even as [He is]” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>). This process of developmental repentance occurs when we truly take His yoke upon us, thus finally qualifying for God’s greatest gift—eternal life (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.29" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:29</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:13</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 14:7</a>). It is this latter dimension of the Atonement—now more appreciated by me—on which my brief focus will fall.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/apply-the-atoning-blood-of-christ.p5" pid="K99dTzGYPUiKTyle7vBx4w" hash="soSFJg">Mortality presents us with numerous opportunities to become more Christlike: first, by coping successfully with those of life’s challenges which are “common to man[kind]” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 10:13</a>). In addition, there are also our customized trials such as experiencing illness, aloneness, persecution, betrayal, irony, poverty, false witness, unreciprocated love, et cetera. If endured well now, “all these things” can be for our good and can “greatly enlarge the soul,” including an enlarged capacity for joy (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:7</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:42</a>). Meek suffering often does the excavating necessary for that enlarging! My admiration goes to my many spiritual superiors who so exemplify for us all. In the world to come, to these, the most faithful, our generous Father will give “all that [He] hath” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.38" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:38</a>). Brothers and sisters, there isn’t any more!</p>

We too, brothers and sisters, came “into the world” to pass through our particularized portions of the mortal experience. Even though our experiences do not even begin to approach our Master’s, nevertheless, to undergo this mortal experience is why we too are here! Purposefully pursuing this “cause” brings ultimate meaning to our mortal lives. And we are greatly helped if we enter with faith that pavilion of perspective—the plan of salvation. Then the search for meaning is ended, even though further and resplendent discoveries await us. Alas, as Church members we sometimes behave like hurried tourists, scarcely venturing beyond the entry point.</p>

Not shrinking is much more important than surviving! Moreover, partaking of a bitter cup without becoming bitter is likewise part of the emulation of Jesus.</p>

These moments are nothing compared to what Jesus experienced. Nevertheless, since our prayers may occasionally contain some “whys,” we too may experience God’s initial silence (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/27.46" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 27:46</a>).</p>

Other “whys” imply that the trial might be all right later on but not now, as if faith in the Lord excluded faith in His timing. Some “why me” questions, asked amid stress, would be much better as “what” questions, such as, “What is required of me now?” or, to paraphrase Moroni’s words, “If I am sufficiently humble, which personal weakness could now become a strength?” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:27</a>).</p>

Thereby Jesus’ personal triumph was complete and His empathy perfected. Having “descended below all things,” He comprehends, perfectly and personally, the full range of human suffering! (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:6</a>; see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:8</a>). A spiritual sung in yesteryear has an especially moving and insightful line: “Nobody knows the troubles I’ve seen, nobody knows but Jesus” (see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–12</a>). Truly, Jesus was exquisitely “acquainted with grief,” as no one else (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/53.3" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 53:3</a>).</p>

We can also further develop our submissiveness to God’s will, so that amid our lesser but genuinely vexing moments we too can say, “Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.42" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:42</a>). When heartfelt, this expression of obedience constitutes real petition followed by real submission. It is much more than polite deference. Rather, it is a deep yielding in which one’s momentary uncertainty gives way to the certainty of Father’s rescuing love and mercy, attributes which drench His plan of salvation.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/apply-the-atoning-blood-of-christ.p13" pid="E9m-td5LaUGgnEmIRxULbA" hash="rr5MtA">We too can learn greater meekness by giving more “glory … to the Father” in lieu of our attention-getting behavior or any arrogant views of personal accomplishment, such as, “My power and the might of mine [own] hand hath gotten me this wealth” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/deut/8.17" class="scriptureRef">Deut. 8:17</a>). Jesus, who accomplished the most by far, was also the most glad to give all the glory to the Father. Alas, even when you and I do place something on the altar, we sometimes hang around as if waiting for a receipt.</p>

By so doing, we too can become “completed” and “finished,” having finally attained our varied individual potentials (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.48" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 5:48</a>, footnote <span class="emphasis">b</span>).</p>

Whatever the grim physical agonies of Jesus’ Crucifixion, surely His utterly unique sufferings in spirit were absolutely enormous, as He bore our sins to atone for them and our sicknesses to understand them “according to the flesh” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–12</a>). Intensification can be part of tutoring. Otherwise we may be like superficial students comfortably coasting and merely auditing a course. Then comes the intensifying moment: we suddenly find ourselves enrolled for credit, and it’s pass or fail!</p>

Jesus met irony constantly as He was taunted by circumstances. For instance, this earth is Jesus’ footstool, but at Bethlehem there was “no room … in the inn” and “no crib for his bed,” as “foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.7" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:7</a>; <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 206; <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/9.58" class="scriptureRef">Luke 9:58</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/7.49-50" class="scriptureRef">Acts 7:49–50</a>). The Most Innocent suffered the most when some of His subjects did unto Him “as they listed” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 49:6</a>). Bearer of the only salvational name, yet the Lord of the Universe lived modestly as a person “of no reputation” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/2.7" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 2:7</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/4.12" class="scriptureRef">Acts 4:12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:20</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.27" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:27</a>). Christ “constructed” the universe, yet in little Galilee He was known merely as “the carpenter’s son” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/13.55" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 13:55</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/apply-the-atoning-blood-of-christ.p17" pid="xoXrx7F32EeW9ODj4nO9Iw" hash="lfW2ug">You and I, when impacted by lesser irony, are so much more brittle, often forgetting that some tests by their very nature are unfair, especially when crusty irony is present.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/apply-the-atoning-blood-of-christ.p18" pid="rddzq6mEjUqHIBzdfgAfng" hash="nyt3Rg">Thus, brothers and sisters, along with the great and free gift of the universal and personal resurrection there is also the personal possibility of meriting eternal life. Though stretched by our challenges, by living righteously and enduring well we can eventually become sufficiently more like Jesus in our traits and attributes, that one day we can dwell in the Father’s presence forever and ever. By so living now, our confidence will “wax strong in the presence of God” then (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>). Confirmingly, the Prophet Joseph declared, “If you wish to go where God is, you must be like God, or possess the principles which God possesses” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> comp. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 216).</p>

His perfected attributes exemplify what can be much further developed by each of us. There is certainly no shortage of relevant clinical experiences, is there? Strange as it seems, we sometimes respond better to larger challenges than to the incessant small ones. For example, impatience with a spouse may occur while a more public challenge is managed quite well. One can be sincerely grateful for his major blessings but regularly murmur over minor irritations. One can have humility that is hierarchical: being humble up, but not humble down. Enduring large tests while failing the seemingly small quizzes just won’t do. Such shortcomings must be addressed if we are really serious about becoming more like Jesus.</p>

Hence the avoidance of discouragement is so vital. So where is the oft and much needed resilience to be found? Once again, in the glorious Atonement! Thereby we can know the lifting tide flowing from forgiveness.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/apply-the-atoning-blood-of-christ.p21" pid="-HQ5CD6YYUaUOU4tsuEOog" hash="2cBPmA">Furthermore, by applying the Atonement we can continue to access the other nurturing gifts of the Holy Ghost, each with its own rich resilience. The Holy Ghost will often preach sermons to us from the pulpit of memory. He will comfort us and reassure us. The burdens not lifted from us, He will help us to bear, thus enabling, even after we err, to continue with joy the soul-stretching journey of discipleship. After all, while the adversary clearly desires our lasting misery, the Father and the Son truly and constantly desire our everlasting happiness (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:27</a>).</p>

Will we not apply His Atonement in order to pay the much smaller price required for personal progress? (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:2</a>). Being valiant in our testimony of Jesus, therefore, includes being valiant in our efforts to live more as He lived (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.79" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 76:79</a>). We certainly cannot enter His kingdom without receiving the restored ordinances and keeping their associated covenants, but neither can we enter His kingdom without having significantly developed our charity and the other cardinal attributes (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.34" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:34</a>). Yes, we need the essential ordinances, but we also need the essential attributes. Yes, we need to keep our covenants, but we also need to develop our character. Do we not sing, “More holiness give me,” pleading that we can be “more, Savior, like thee”? (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 131).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1997/10/apply-the-atoning-blood-of-christ.p23" pid="Avok_3JF80ilamaJh4JApw" hash="uAaRZA">During this special process, how can you and I better insure that the precious blessings given by God are fully received by us? For my part, I desire that my blessings, including the recent “delay en route,” bring about my needed and greater spiritual refinement in addition to my grateful acknowledgment. Yes, you and I should count our blessings, but we should also make them count! Furthermore, since the focus in extremity falls on the things of eternity, such should be our focus in whatever remains of mortal brevity. This is my earnest prayer for me and for you in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Way back then, by means of a 4-H Club project involving purebred Duroc pigs, I became familiar with work! As proof that what follows is not merely swollen memory, may I, with Elder Nelson’s help, display very briefly this blanket of nearly 100 ribbons won by my prize pigs at various fairs over several years.</p>

It was the very first ribbon I ever won. I think the judge had a tender eye, and the pig wasn’t really so choice, but he knew I needed encouragement and hence the fourth prize. The purple ribbons were for champions that were exhibited later on!</p>

Careful records of profits and losses were kept with the help of my bookkeeper father. As in all things, my parents, so supportive, even ended up doing some of the perspiring themselves, including a special mother born 95 years ago today. She showed me how to work, and she loved me enough to correct me.</p>

Additionally, if present at the right time at a local dairy, I could get about 70 gallons of skim milk <span class="emphasis">free!</span> Now I pay $2.50 a gallon—an amusing irony. By saving in these ways, I could buy the needed grain for the pigs with the little hard cash that I had.</p>

The resultant weariness of attending to all that, and more, was real. Yet through it all, there was a sense of some accomplishment, including contributing to our family menus. Most young men my age did similar work. Back then, brethren, we were all poor together, and we didn’t know it. Work was a given. Today, for some, receiving is a given.</p>

Already shy, I remember vividly the principal of the junior high school coming into my class once and saying aloud in front of everybody: “Neal, your mother just called. Your pigs are out!” I felt like crawling under my desk but instead ran home to help round up the pigs.</p>

He noted that while I worked hard, my work was often not carefully done. I was a stranger to excellence. One summer day I determined to please Dad by putting in a number of needed fence posts, firmly implanted and fully aligned. I worked hard all that day and then scanned the lane expectantly down which my father would walk home. When he arrived, I watched anxiously as he carefully inspected the fence posts, even checking them with a level bar before pronouncing them to be fully satisfactory. Then came his praise. My sweat of the brow had earned Dad’s commendation which, in turn, melted my heart.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/04/put-your-shoulder-to-the-wheel.p9" pid="dxnOhai5rk-Tf_YuXL0fvQ" hash="pYztHQ">Please forgive this brief autobiographical note, which I have used to express my deep appreciation for learning to work at an early age. Even so, brethren, I certainly did not always put my shoulder to the wheel with a “heart full of song,” but I did learn about shoulders and wheels, which helped later in life, when the wheels grew larger. Some of today’s otherwise good young men mistakenly think that putting their shoulders to the wheel is the same thing as putting their hands on a steering wheel!</p>

Consider the significance of the Lord’s use of the word <span class="emphasis">work.</span> What He is doing so lovingly and redemptively is, nevertheless, work—even for Him! We, likewise, speak of “working out our salvation,” of the “law of the harvest,” and of the “sweat of the brow” (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.1" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:1</a>; see also Inspired Version, <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/4.1" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 4:1</a>). These are not idle phrases. Instead, they underscore the importance of work. In fact, brethren, work is always a spiritual necessity even if, for some, work is not an economic necessity.</p>

It is tied to Jesus and the blessings of the great Atonement, blessings resulting in the universal Resurrection and the precious opportunity provided thereby for us to practice emancipating repentance, making possible what the scriptures call “a perfect brightness of hope” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:20</a>).</p>

Nevertheless, ultimate hope’s expectations are “with surety” true (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.4" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:4</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/8.24" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 8:24</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/11.1" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 11:1</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.21" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:21</a>). Yet in the geometry of the restored theology, hope corresponds to faith but sometimes has a greater circumference. Faith, in turn, constitutes “the assurance of things hoped for” and the proof of “things not seen” (JST, Heb. 11:1; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.6" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:6</a>). Thus hope sometimes reconnoiters beyond the present boundaries of faith, but it always radiates from Jesus.</p>

Hope helped a prophet to see rescuing rain in a distant cloud which appeared to be no larger than a man’s hand (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18.41-46" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 18:41–46</a>).</p>

In contrast, viewing life without the prospect of immortality can diminish not only hope but also the sense of personal accountability (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:18</a>).</p>

Cold secularism causes some of that shivering, as many have given in to what Senator Patrick Moynihan called “defining deviancy down” (“Defining Deviancy Down,” <span class="emphasis">The American Scholar,</span> winter 1993, 17). Much despair truly comes of iniquity—but as <span class="emphasis">God</span> defines iniquity (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.22" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:22</a>).</p>

Likewise, real hope is much more than wishful musing. It stiffens, not slackens, the spiritual spine. Hope is serene, not giddy, eager without being naive, and pleasantly steady without being smug. Hope is realistic anticipation which takes the form of a determination—not only to survive adversity but, moreover, to “endure … well” to the end (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.8" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:8</a>).</p>

Eyring has wisely observed, “If you want praise more than instruction, you may get neither” (“To Choose and Keep a Mentor,” <span class="emphasis">Addresses Delivered at the 1993 Annual University Conference, Brigham Young University</span> [1993], 42).</p>

Hence Paul described how “tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/5.3-4" class="scriptureRef">Rom. 5:3–4</a>). Therefore, we rightly sing of God, “We’ve proved him in days that are past” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 19).</p>

Tolkien reminds us: “It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till.

Our opportunities for helping others who have lost hope may be no further away than in our own extended families, a discouraged neighbor next door, or someone just around the corner. By helping a child learn to read, visiting a lonely patient in a nursing home, or by simply running an errand for a busy but overwhelmed parent, so much can be imparted to others. Likewise, a simple gospel conversation can impart hope. Meanwhile, never mind that the world will become more bipolar as between those who are secular and permissive and those who hold to spiritual values.</p>

Since it is so common, why worry about selfishness anyway? Because selfishness is really self-destruction in slow motion. No wonder the Prophet Joseph Smith urged, “Let every selfish feeling be not only buried, but annihilated” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 178). Hence annihilation—not moderation—is the destination!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/repent-of-our-selfishness-d-c-56-8.p2" pid="2EixLZm_JEaC1nYwC0H-8Q" hash="A-ppBQ">Surging selfishness, for example, has shrunken some people into ciphers; they seek to erase their emptiness by sensations. But in the arithmetic of appetite, anything multiplied by zero still totals zero! Each spasm of selfishness narrows one’s universe that much more by reducing his awareness of or concern with others. In spite of its outward, worldly swagger, such indulgent individualism is actually provincial, like goldfish in a bowl congratulating themselves on their self-sufficiency, never mind the food pellets or changes of water.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/repent-of-our-selfishness-d-c-56-8.p3" pid="KdRcvOGN20S_Nw8LK9Uqjg" hash="_JJUcA">Long ago it took a Copernicus to tell a provincial world that this planet was not the center of the universe. Some selfish moderns need a Copernican reminder that they are not the center of the universe either!</p>

No wonder it is so easy for governments to pander to the appetites of the natural man, especially if the trains continue to run on time, reassuring him all the while that his permissiveness is somehow permissible.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/repent-of-our-selfishness-d-c-56-8.p6" pid="872wsEgkJ0iJkl-V69gQIg" hash="QygKWQ">Selfishness likewise causes us to be discourteous, disdainful, and self-centered while withholding from others needed goods, praise, and recognition as we selfishly pass them by and notice them not (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.39" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:39</a>). Later on come rudeness, brusqueness, and the further flexing of elbows.</p>

There will be no spouse or child abuse when there is unselfish love at home. Furthermore, unselfishness is best grown in the family garden, and, likewise, diligently performing seemingly ordinary Church duties can further help us to overcome selfishness. The unselfish are also more free. As G. K. Chesterton said, if we can be interested in others, even if they are not interested in us, we will find ourselves “under a freer sky, [and] in a street full of splendid strangers” (<span class="emphasis">Orthodoxy</span> [1959], 21).</p>

Meekness is the real cure, for it does not merely mask selfishness but dissolves it! Smaller steps could include asking ourselves inwardly before undertaking an important action, <span class="emphasis">Whose needs am I really trying to meet?</span> Or in significant moments of self-expression, we can first count to 10. Such thoughtful filtering can multiply our offering by 10 as a mesh of reflective meekness filters out destructive and effusive ego.</p>

Then societies can eventually become without order, without mercy, without love, perverted, and past feeling (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.title" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 9</a>). Society thereby reflects a grim, cumulative tally which signals a major cultural decline. This happened anciently when a people actually became “weak, because of their transgression” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.26" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 4:26</a>). Speaking behaviorally, when what was once the lesser voice of the people becomes more dominant, then the judgments of God and the consequences of foolish selfishness follow (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29.26-27" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 29:26–27</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/repent-of-our-selfishness-d-c-56-8.p11" pid="fqNkQuOEX026Y6mRoux1SA" hash="y4au9g">Cultural decline is accelerated when single-interest segments of society become indifferent to general values once widely shared. This drift is facilitated by the indifferent or the indulgent as society is led carefully down to hell (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:21</a>). Some may not join in this drift, but instead they step aside, whereas once they might have constrained, as is their representative right. Of such circumstances Yeats lamented, “The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity” (W. B. Yeats, “The Second Coming”).</p>

While incremental iniquity may not cause a huge decline all at once, the same somber direction is nevertheless continued, subtly and carefully, with no arousing jolts or jars (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 28:21</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/repent-of-our-selfishness-d-c-56-8.p13" pid="aDTTe_7_-06ARQnwGC6N5Q" hash="uTkkfA">Such are some of the <span class="emphasis">proximate</span> consequences of selfishness, yet some of its consequences are <span class="emphasis">ultimate</span>—impacting us salvationally.</p>

It is the hammer for the breaking of the Ten Commandments, whether by neglecting parents, the Sabbath, or by inducing false witness, murder, and envy. No wonder the selfish individual is often willing to break a covenant in order to fix an appetite. No wonder those who will later comprise the telestial kingdom, after they have paid a price, were once unrepentant adulterers, whoremongers, and those who both loved and made lies.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/repent-of-our-selfishness-d-c-56-8.p15" pid="dJN4UIjnZUOgKhSesPZOaw" hash="aApOOA">Some of the selfish wrongly believe that there is no divine law anyway, so there is no sin (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:13</a>). Situational ethics are thus made to order for the selfish. So in the management of self, one can conquer by his genius and strength, because there really is no crime whatsoever (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.17" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:17</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/repent-of-our-selfishness-d-c-56-8.p16" pid="5YHQmFO-VkSPhB2H2bsgVw" hash="gimJ9g">Unsurprisingly therefore, selfishness leads to terrible perceptual and behavioral blunders. For instance, Cain, corrupted by his seeking of power, said after slaying Abel, “I am free” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.33" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:33</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.15" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:15</a>).</p>

Today there are, for example, those who strain over various gnats but swallow the practice of partial-birth abortions. Small wonder, therefore, that selfishness magnifies a mess of pottage into a banquet and makes 30 pieces of silver look like a treasure trove.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/04/repent-of-our-selfishness-d-c-56-8.p18" pid="1Gaxu2Z3Jk6Iwr7JUqCTGQ" hash="iYWaWA">Developmentally, what transpires is like what happened to an ancient group of children “who did grow up … , that they became for themselves”—hardened and errant (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.29" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 1:29</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.30" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 1:30</a>). Devastating cultural change can and does happen “in the space of not many years,” including replacing the much-needed spirit of community with a diversified alliance of dalliance (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.26" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 4:26</a>).</p>

Let the Uriahs of the world beware! (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/2-sam/11.3-17" class="scriptureRef">2 Sam. 11:3–17</a>). Centuries before Christ, the prophet Jacob warned unchaste men, “Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.35" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:35</a>). When love waxes cold, let the poor and the needy beware too, for they will be neglected, as happened in ancient Sodom (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.12" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:12</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/ot/ezek/16.49" class="scriptureRef">Ezek. 16:49</a>). Strange as it seems, when severely selfish people are no longer little in their own sight, everybody else shrinks!

Historically, of course, it is easy to criticize bad leaders, but we should not give followers a free pass. Otherwise, in their rationalization of their degeneration they may say they were just following orders, while the leader was just ordering followers! However, much more is required of followers in a democratic society wherein individual character matters so much in both leaders and followers.</p>

He prayed for them, but confided that his prayers were without faith because of the people’s wickedness (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/3.12" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 3:12</a>). Other times a visionary leader, like Joseph in Egypt, lifts people out of the endangered routine they’re in by preparing them for the specific challenges of the future (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/gen/41.46-57" class="scriptureRef">Gen. 41:46–57</a>). A few, like Lincoln, though in a political role, provide spiritual leadership as well. Lincoln, by the way, warned of how individuals of ambition and talents would continue to arise and that such an individual “thirsts and burns for distinction, and if possible … will have it, <span class="emphasis">whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen</span>” (cited in John Wesley Hill, <span class="emphasis">Abraham Lincoln—Man of God</span> [1927], 74; emphasis in original).</p>

Hence we are urged to <span class="emphasis">search, feast,</span> and <span class="emphasis">ponder</span> (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.39" class="scriptureRef">John 5:39</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/14.1" class="scriptureRef">Alma 14:1</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/33.2" class="scriptureRef">Alma 33:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:3</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.51" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 9:51</a>). Especially, however, we should also do more of what Nephi did, namely “liken all scriptures unto [ourselves]” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 19:23</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p3" pid="p8vpnX5SfEG7LBjmjjtcyQ" hash="gqvDdg">Illustratively, words which we should so “liken” occur twice with regard to Laman and Lemuel, mistakenly regarded by some as merely “stick figures.” Consider, therefore, how the applications of these next words go far beyond those two: “And thus Laman and Lemuel, … did murmur … because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 2:12</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/10.14" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 10:14</a>).</p>

Murmuring is but one of the symptoms, and not the only consequence either; in fact, brothers and sisters, this failure affects everything else!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p5" pid="4tvkG9i-m0qfEB4lq4GN3A" hash="9_h1LQ">To misread something so crucial constitutes a failure to know God, who then ends up being wrongly seen as unreachable, uninvolved, uncaring, and unable—a disabled and diminished Deity, really—about whose seeming limitations, ironically, some then quickly complain.</p>

Lemuel was not only Laman’s dutiful satellite, but he was also his enabler by allowing himself to be “stirred up” by Laman (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.37-38" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 16:37–38</a>). If, instead, Laman had been fully isolated, certain outcomes could have been very different. We have enablers in our society too. They allow themselves to be stirred up against that which is good. They are not entitled to a free pass any more than Lemuel. Like him, their comparative visibility is low, but their hypocrisy is high!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p7" pid="txlM7qKqq0aHAvDu9gRLNw" hash="7l96Tw">Exhortations given to Laman and Lemuel “were hard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they ought” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.3" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 15:3</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p8" pid="0cNa8omBdU6kkDGZHEMG5g" hash="XaVFSQ">This failure to believe in a revealing God was especially basic. Some moderns who wish to distance themselves from God try placing His pavilion firmly in the past. By believing in such a disabled God, people can do pretty much as they please. It is then not many steps further to saying there is no God, therefore no law and no sin! (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.13" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 2:13</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:28</a>).</p>

Actually, God has the past, present, and future ever before Him, constituting an “eternal ‘now’” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 220; see also <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 130:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p10" pid="3GB0iJCys0CZCj32BkC8Tg" hash="9n-ycQ">In short, Laman and Lemuel’s own lack of character kept them from understanding the perfect character of God! No wonder the Prophet Joseph Smith said, “If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings,</span> 343).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p11" pid="ERiYCdLayEGhZaYNGWeKiA" hash="Wn-kuw">Laman and Lemuel did not realize either that a loving God will inevitably be a tutoring Father, who wants His children to be truly happy and to come home. Not understanding God’s “dealings” sufficiently, Laman and Lemuel missed the most important attribute of God’s character—His love! Thus their murmuring was a symptom of a pathetic pathology.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p12" pid="HfSdZAhz0U-M0rlC5Mn6jw" hash="o0aCVQ">Laman and Lemuel likewise didn’t understand that the “dealings” of God included using prophets to warn people. The Lord had so called Lehi, but Laman and Lemuel were apparently embarrassed by their father’s unpopular role and by his stern challenge to Jerusalem’s then prevailing mentality.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p13" pid="AuJlpnToqECq_PjpFeGyNg" hash="lJFgRg">Spiritually numbed, Laman and Lemuel felt that the people of Jerusalem were undeserving of prophetic criticisms leveled (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 2:13</a>). Yet a pervasive spiritual decline was actually under way, occurring, as often happens, “in the space of not many years” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.26" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 4:26</a>). A parallel and trampling decline is being missed by so many today, too. Ironically, those engaged in such a lemming-like march to the sea are often proud of their own individualism! Advice is seen as an insult, and counsel as a contraction of their agency.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p14" pid="KpGnxLz9m0aW7y-NEIYq8w" hash="R4tZRA">Fundamental, too, was Laman and Lemuel’s not understanding that a tutoring God may require difficult things of His children. The role of adversity is noted in this stern but inspired insight: “Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23.21" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 23:21</a>). Their sad expectation of ease was evident in their bristling over getting the plates from Laban, enduring the harsh wilderness, building a ship, and crossing a vast ocean (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.title" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3–4</a>). Dulled and desensitized, Laman and Lemuel simply didn’t share Nephi’s confidence that the Lord would never command His children to do difficult things, except the Lord first prepares the way (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:7</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p15" pid="08c0hpFA5k-mLNHCNCRO9Q" hash="UAfJRw">Their enormous errors led to almost comical inconsistencies, such as Laman and Lemuel’s believing that God could handle mighty Pharaoh and great Egypt’s army at the Red Sea all right, but not a local Laban! How many in our time inconsistently subordinate themselves to, and curry favor with, mortal intimidators?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p16" pid="Dgwb5g6k2EGHZVN0vDZrXg" hash="bb9qQA">In the final division as between the Lamanites and the Nephites, note the spiritual boundary which preceded the geographical boundary: “I, Nephi, did take my family, … and all those who would go with me … who believed in the warnings and the revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my words” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.6" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 5:6</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p17" pid="bz1BXAnvbEedggaY8zjDvA" hash="e2HHRQ">Laman and Lemuel did not partake of the tree of life, which is the love of God (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.25" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11:25</a>). The love of God for His children is most profoundly expressed in His gift of Jesus as our Redeemer: “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.16" class="scriptureRef">John 3:16</a>). To partake of the love of God is to partake of Jesus’ Atonement and the emancipations and joys which it can bring. Clearly, however, Laman and Lemuel did not have such faith—especially in a Christ yet to come! (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1.11" class="scriptureRef">Jarom 1:11</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p18" pid="T4DIIWW_BEqzyzppxncWIw" hash="_ROiaw">In contrast, Nephi, “had a great knowledge of the goodness … of God,” hence Nephi’s firm declaration: “I know that [God] loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.1" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 1:1</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.17" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11:17</a>). If we have a love of God and know His goodness, we will trust Him, even when we are puzzled or perplexed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p19" pid="Hv78c9uVyU2vtG48651phA" hash="Q_4XQA">Thus Laman and Lemuel did not understand the relationship of mortals with God, and, worse still, they did not really want to understand. They sought to keep their distance from God. Furthermore, being intellectually lazy, they did not count their blessings, when gratitude could have lessened the distance. But it was never inventory time for Laman and Lemuel.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p20" pid="ctJS3ZyqMU-lwUMbhdplvQ" hash="cDdtCw">Laman and Lemuel also displayed little lasting spiritual curiosity. Once, true, they asked straightforward questions about the meaning of a vision of the tree, the river, and the rod of iron. Yet their questions were really more like trying to connect doctrinal dots rather than connecting themselves with God and His purposes for them. They certainly did not “liken” the answers to themselves (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 19:23</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p21" pid="Mokl5eMbZka-N1lmou5Xxw" hash="huRHAA">Their contrition never lasted very long, such as in the interval between the appearance of an angel and when Laman and Lemuel resumed murmuring (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.31" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 3:31</a>). Under duress, once they even superficially acknowledged that they “knew the Lord is with thee [Nephi]” but they soon became exceedingly “rude” in their behavior on the ship (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.55" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:55</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.8,9" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 18:8, 9</a>). Their periodic violence indicated their resentments weren’t merely abstract, intellectual differences.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p22" pid="6lj6ETwcjk6FbnIHnnVm5Q" hash="5EoAug">Laman and Lemuel were intimidated by Laban’s power, but their fear of power merely showed the power of fear. Since “perfect love casteth out all fear,” their limited capacity to love was thereby very evident (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.16" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 8:16</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.18" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 4:18</a>). Though unprincipled, most sadly, they were unloving!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p23" pid="yei9JSUZuUCNvEdu6kdXIA" hash="S-7QOw">Hence, encrusted Laman and Lemuel seldom responded to the tenderness of others. They were strangers to empathy, that eternal attribute. When Lehi exhorted them with all the feeling of a tender or trembling parent, the effects were usually more resentment, evoking cruel responses to parents and siblings (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.37" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:37</a>). When Nephi displayed sorrow over their behavior, Laman and Lemuel were “glad” that he was sorry (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:19</a>). Admonitions were bad enough, but to have them come from Nephi!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p24" pid="ZVwnFzTt-U-O2MHN-90ukw" hash="lZGvKQ">Easily riled and quick to complain, they could scarcely remember their last rescue long enough to meet their next difficulty. Instead, lacking gospel perspective, the situational cares of the day, like worry over a broken bow, of all things, dominated the things of eternity. Ours, too, is a day of every-man-for-himself situational ethics, as if the Ten Commandments came from a focus group!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p25" pid="y_CQO30IUEarnQpokbHg-A" hash="Z0JXKw">Upon arriving at both lands of Bountiful, did Laman and Lemuel really think that such good navigating was mere happenstance? Perhaps Nephi had merely “guessed right” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/16.16" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 16:16</a>). Their ingratitude for the Liahona raises the question: What did Laman and Lemuel really think of that remarkable instrument? Was it just a convenient gadget or merely standard equipment on every ship?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p26" pid="qexOn6E7Rk-gvdH6i0P3-A" hash="wlR4nw">Ironically, many like Laman and Lemuel who are the first to demand signs are then the first to discount them. Some demand more miracles even while consuming a daily menu of manna and forgetting its remarkable Source.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p27" pid="Fq8S_dLMXkCNNIkD0jRSrQ" hash="3CT0mA">Therefore, brothers and sisters, preferred to periodic miracles is having the Holy Ghost as a “constant companion” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:46</a>). Ever to be remembered, however, is that the Holy Ghost, while a Comforter, is not an intruder!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p28" pid="PCADUrNlPkuBOLyDlPF5lA" hash="ulZ5sQ">Laman and Lemuel’s rejection of the prophets and the scriptures meant there could be no useful likening or rehearsals of remembrance and no freshening of personal revelation to them for their time. They simply did not understand that God’s ways are higher than man’s ways (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/55.9" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 55:9</a>). They enjoyed intellectual “slumming” in their portable equivalent of the prideful “great and spacious building” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.26,31" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:26, 31</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p29" pid="Zl1pl3VKEES8ehg-JQxotg" hash="B2Wh1w">Hence Laman and Lemuel became rebels instead of leaders, resentful instead of righteous—all because of their failure to understand either the character or the purposes of God and His dealings with His children.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p30" pid="i0oCepOXSE6Ejkju18fEOQ" hash="EzjDig">As to their spiritual significance, Laman and Lemuel were sad ciphers. True, we could know more facts about them, but it would not change the “bottom line.” If, in some respects, they seem to be undeveloped characters, it is because theirs was a haunting emptiness, which could have been filled by the “love of God.” In vision, there was the forlorn scene when Lehi cast his eyes anxiously about, searching for Laman and Lemuel that “perhaps [he] might see them.” Finally, Lehi saw them, “but they would not … partake of the fruit” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.17-18" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:17–18</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.25" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11:25</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.35" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:35</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 5:20</a>). Of all self-inflicted punishments, this eight-word epitaph describes the most awful and consequential!</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel.p31" pid="gb1YaxZpr0ypVSYbholsUg" hash="uDI2Rg">Mercifully, brothers and sisters, the rich Restoration gives us added ways to understand the dealings of God with His children, including with each of us personally. We can partake of His love by applying Jesus’ glorious Atonement in order to become more like Him. By likening precious scriptures to ourselves we will hasten that precious process! May we so do, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen!</p>

However, just prior, Alma urgently desired to be the “trump of God” so that he might “shake the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.1" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:1</a>). But not because of ego; in fact, Alma wanted to declare repentance and the plan of redemption to all mankind so that there might be no more human sorrow (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.2" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:2</a>). Yet Alma’s contentment rested on the reality that God finally allots to us according to our wills (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.4" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:4</a>). What could be more fair?</p>

A significant spiritual journey is thus reflected in but nine soliloquy-like verses.</p>

For instance, some have allotments including physical, mental, or geographic constraints. There are those who are unmarried, through no fault of their own, or yearning but childless couples. Still others face persistent and unreconciled relationships within their circles of loved ones, including offspring who have “[become] for themselves,” resistant to parental counsel (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1.29" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 1:29</a>).

Otherwise we may feel underused, underwhelmed, and underappreciated—while, ironically, within our givens are unused opportunities for service all about us. Neither should we pine away, therefore, for certain things outside God’s givens, such as for the powerful voice of an angel, because there is so much to do within what has been allotted to us (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.3-4" class="scriptureRef">Alma 29:3–4</a>).

The wind was boisterous and frightening! Even so, compare the size of those Galilean swells and the length of that storm with what Nephi and party had to endure on the vast ocean! (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.13-21" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 18:13–21</a>). Yet both episodes provided the needed learning experiences.

Yet he soon discerned that theirs was not actually the sorrowing unto repentance but the “sorrowing of the damned,” stranding them in a “no-man’s-land.” Compare that episode to the prodigal son’s solitary working through of his own repentance; since his sorrow was real, he truly “came to himself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.17" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:17</a>).

All this when many are already tuned out of spiritual things, saying, “I am rich, … increased with goods, and have need of nothing “ (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 3:17</a>).</p>

When he was humbled and corrected, not only did Naaman’s flesh become like that of a little child, but his heart also (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.14-15" class="scriptureRef">2 Kgs. 5:14–15</a>).

Since the “infinite atonement” required infinite suffering, the risk of recoil was there!

Indeed, He has “suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.11" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:11</a>), keenly observing His Father all the while: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/5.19" class="scriptureRef">John 5:19</a>).

As sovereigns, choosing to yield to the Highest Sovereign is our highest act of choice. It is the only surrender which is also a victory! The <span class="emphasis">putting off</span> of the natural man makes possible the <span class="emphasis">putting on</span> of the whole armor of God, which would not fully fit before! (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/6.11,13" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 6:11, 13</a>).</p>

Others can and should encourage, commend, pray, and comfort, but the lifting and carrying of our individual crosses remains ours to do. Given the “fierceness” Christ endured for us, we cannot expect a discipleship of unruffled easiness. As we seek forgiveness, for example, repentance can be a rough-hewn regimen to bear. By the way, let us not, as some do, mistake the chips we have placed on our own shoulders for crosses!</p>

How deep that descent into despair and abysmal agony must have been! He did it to rescue us and in order to comprehend human suffering. Therefore, let us not resent those tutoring experiences which can develop our own empathy further (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 7:11–12</a>). A slothful heart will not do, and neither will a resentful heart. So being admitted fully to “the fellowship of his sufferings” requires the full dues of discipleship (<a href="/scriptures/nt/philip/3.10" class="scriptureRef">Philip. 3:10</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1.9" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 1:9</a>).</p>

Hence, He knows personally all that we pass through and how to extend His perfect mercy—as well as how to succor us. His agony was all the more astonishing in that He trod “the wine-press alone” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133.50" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 133:50</a>).</p>

Otherwise, we may walk with Jesus up to a point, but then walk no more with Him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/6.66" class="scriptureRef">John 6:66</a>).

In fact, there is no other way to learn deeply! (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 19:23</a>). The infinite Atonement is so vast and universal, but finally, it is so very personal!

Anxious because his audience had feelings “exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate,” Jacob did not wish to “enlarge the wounds of those who [were] already wounded, instead of consoling and healing their wounds” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.7,9" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:7, 9</a>). Nevertheless, Jacob’s words about the harsh consequences of immorality are diagnostic as well as poetic: “Many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.35" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 2:35</a>).

Likewise, husbands and wives can deliberately avoid drifting apart by refusing to relax their loyalties and by not being caught in the strong currents leading to the waterfalls. Equally to be avoided is the stagnant swamp of self-pity. Therein, individuals can easily rationalize any remaining sense of accountability by pushing aside the restraints of both conscience and covenants, seeking to “justify [themselves] before men” for that which is an “abomination [before] God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/16.15" class="scriptureRef">Luke 16:15</a>).</p>

When Ananias and Sapphira sold their possessions, they “kept back part of the price” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/5.1-11" class="scriptureRef">Acts 5:1–11</a>). So many of us cling tenaciously to a particular “part,” even treating our obsessions like possessions. Thus, whatever else we may have already given, the last portion is the hardest to yield. Granted, partial surrender is still commendable, but it resembles, more than faintly, the excuse, “I gave at the office” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.7-8" class="scriptureRef">James 1:7–8</a>).</p>

John the Baptist is a model, however, saying of Jesus’ growing flock, “He must increase, but I must decrease” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.30" class="scriptureRef">John 3:30</a>). Mistakenly regarding our present assignments as the only indicator of how much God loves us only adds to our reluctance to let go.

Yet, sadly, brothers and sisters, in the subtle interplay of agency and identity, there is so much hesitation.

In such circumstances, the “weightier matters” are often omitted (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/23.23" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 23:23</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.16" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 2:16</a>).

The doctrines and revelations can likewise lift us—even amid “wars and rumours of wars” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/24.6" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 24:6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/mark/13.7" class="scriptureRef">Mark 13:7</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12.2" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 12:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.30" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 8:30</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.26" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 45:26</a>).

These calisthenics are designed to increase our capacity for happiness and service. Yet the faithful will not be totally immune from the events on this planet. Thus the courageous attitudes of imperiled Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego are worthy of emulation. They knew that God could rescue them. “But if not,” they vowed, they would still serve God anyway (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/dan/3.16-18" class="scriptureRef">Dan. 3:16–18</a>). Similarly, keeping the unfashionable but imperative first and seventh commandments can reflect the courage which three young women displayed anciently; they said no with their lives (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/1.11" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 1:11</a>).</p>

Whatever our anxious involvements with outward events, this inner struggle proceeds in both tranquil and turbulent times. Whether understood or recognized, this is the unchanging mortal agendum from generation to generation.</p>

Then, even on bad days, we will still “keep our own soul” regardless of external conditions (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/prov/19.16" class="scriptureRef">Prov. 19:16</a>). Granted, some inward decisions to “care … for” and “keep” our souls occur in otherwise uneventful times, as with the prodigal son. He had fed the swine day by day, finally experiencing a special day when he “came to himself” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.17" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:17</a>). Whatever else happened on that particular day in that “far country” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.13" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:13</a>), the prodigal son had “thought on [his] ways” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/119.59" class="scriptureRef">Ps. 119:59</a>) and firmly concluded that “I will arise and go to my father” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.18" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:18</a>). Transformation followed introspection. Even so, one homeward-bound swineherd would scarcely have been noticed by the passersby, though things of eternal significance had happened to him.</p>

Pilate was dealing with a seemingly local disturbance surrounding one Jesus of Nazareth. His new accord with Herod—with whom Pilate had been “at enmity” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.12" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:12</a>)—was doubtless political news among those in the know. Though ambivalent, he yielded to a conditioned crowd, amnestying Barabbas instead of Jesus. With washed but dirty hands, Pilate apparently returned to Caesarea. Christ, however, went on to Gethsemane and Calvary, performing the agonizing but emancipating universal Atonement whereby billions and billions would be resurrected.</p>

Just as the whitecaps do not disclose the deep sea changes underway, so in the case of the Atonement, things global and eternal in their significance were happening in a small garden and upon an obscure hill.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/04/care-for-the-life-of-the-soul.p5" pid="QXTU2Jf0w0KFUWEJqfgFoA" hash="CLkyKA">The unfolding of God’s work often proceeds quietly. For example, whatever the immediate economic reasons the Joseph Smith Sr. family had for moving from New England to upstate New York, they were being led—unawares—to sacred plates, buried in Cumorah’s Hill, waiting to become “another testament of Christ” for “as long as the earth shall stand” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.22" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 25:22</a>).</p>

Though events set up the defining moments which can evoke profiles in righteousness, outward commotions cannot excuse any failure of inward resolve, even if some seem to unravel so easily. If hostilities break out here and there, we still need not break our covenants! For example, adultery cannot be rationalized merely because there is a war on and some wives and husbands are separated. There is no footnote to the seventh commandment reading “Thou shalt not commit adultery except in times of war” (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.14" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:14</a>).</p>

His divine determinations are guaranteed, since whatever He takes in His heart to do, He will surely do it (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.17" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 3:17</a>). He knows the end from the beginning! (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/2.8" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 2:8</a>). God is fully “able to do [His] … work” and to bring all His purposes to pass, something untrue of the best-laid plans of man since we so often use our agency amiss!

Such sharing amid real deprivation and poverty is always touching. Earlier in his life, a wonderful bishop of my youth, M. Thirl Marsh, repeatedly tried to be hired at the mines during the Depression. Being underage but large of stature, he persisted and was hired, but several friends were not. Apparently, on more than one occasion after his hard day’s work, generous young Thirl shared his earnings equally with these friends until they, too, were hired.

This swirl needlessly preoccupies a few who seem to prefer chewing on old bones in the outer courtyard instead of coming inside to the resplendent, revelatory banquet, thus diverting them from giving due attention to Joseph’s mission as “a choice seer” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3.6-7" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 3:6–7</a>).</p>

In the grove and subsequently, there came sunbursts of serendipity!

God’s plans for the development of souls have not changed.

They have now been joined by those living lives of noisy, slurping indulgence, wrongly celebrating their capacity to feel so that they finally lose their capacity to feel and become “past feeling” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.20" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 9:20</a>; <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/4.19" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 4:19</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.45" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 17:45</a>). Hence they lick their particular platters in a desperate search for more sensations. Such individuals, however, are still not a majority but a “lesser part” of the people (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29.26-27" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 29:26–27</a>).</p>

He cannot. Jesus will triumph majestically, and the adversary’s clever constructs, “pleasing to the carnal mind,” will also collapse, and “the fall thereof will be exceedingly great” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.53" class="scriptureRef">Alma 30:53</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.36" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 11:36</a>). Even now, one can see in the lives of those prodigals who come to themselves the devil’s doctrines dripping in early meltdown (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.17" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:17</a>). Many, having experienced the utter emptiness of the lower ways, are “in a preparation to hear the word” and now await being informed of the rescuing revelations and translations (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.6" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:6</a>).</p>

We dare not hold back the reassuring revelations and truth-telling translations about “things as they really are, and … things as they really will be.” These are so needed by those whose weary hands hang down because they suffer from doctrinal anemia, which can best be treated by the red blood cells of the Restoration (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.13" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:13</a>). To hold back would be to restrain repentance and to obscure the beckoning spiritual alternative, which will become “fair as the sun, and clear as the moon” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.31" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 105:31</a>).</p>

Others will see us as quaint or misled. Let us bear the pointing fingers which, ironically, belong to those finally who, being bored, find the “great and spacious building” to be a stale and cramped third-class hotel (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.31-33" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 8:31–33</a>). Let us revile not the revilers and heed them not (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/31.9" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 31:9</a>). Instead, let us use our energy to hold up the shield of faith to quench the incoming fiery darts—aided perhaps by a touch of spiritual Teflon (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.24" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 15:24</a>).</p>

Hopefully this will be done in a relaxed, almost conversational way by citing a few remembrances, a few of life’s little lessons—nothing spectacular. There will also be several one-liners whose durability reflects their brevity. The focus of these remembrances is upon being stretched by a merciful Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:3</a>).</p>

The minutes of the Wandamere Ward of the Grant Stake for June 4, 1944, indicate the sacrament was administered by my friends Ward Jackson, Arthur Hicks, and me to a congregation of 141. Then it was off to war. In May of 1945, I was blessing the sacrament again—but in a foxhole on Okinawa for a congregation of only one, myself!</p>

In my Primary days, we sang “‘Give,’ Said the Little Stream” (<span class="emphasis">Children’s Songbook,</span> 236)—certainly sweet and motivating but not exactly theologically drenched. Today’s children, as you know, sing the more spiritually focused “I’m Trying to Be like Jesus” (<span class="emphasis">Children’s Songbook,</span> 78–79).</p>

Back then, in family, neighborhood, ward, and school life, we were all poor together, but we didn’t know it. We made room for each other to grow, to make dumb mistakes, to repent, and to begin to develop at least some spiritual reflexes. Today, some anxious parents seem to insist on constantly pulling up the daisies to see how the roots are doing.</p>

When loved ones exemplify, it is especially memorable. My sister Lois, legally blind from birth, not only coped but served well as a public schoolteacher for 33 years. She had that same reflex possessed by those pioneer souls who quietly picked up their handcarts and headed west, a reflex we all need. So if various trials are allotted to you, partake of life’s bitter cups, but without becoming bitter.</p>

Soon after arriving home from World War II, I had “promises to keep” (Robert Frost, “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” in <span class="emphasis">The Poetry of Robert Frost,</span> ed. Edward Connery Lathem [1969], 225)—meaning going on a mission <span class="emphasis">now.</span> I grew tired of waiting for the bishop. And in some early ark-steadying, I went to the bishop’s home and said I had saved the money and wanted to go, so let’s “get this show on the road.” The good bishop hesitated, and then said he’d been meaning to ask me about going.</p>

Hearing this, I chastised myself for having been too judgmental. (See Bruce C. Hafen, <span class="emphasis">A Disciple’s Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell</span> [2002], 129–30.)</p>

When I was such, I had just received a phone call telling me of a friend’s death in an accident. I was sitting in the living room with tears streaking down my cheeks. Our young son, Cory, saw the tears as he passed in the hallway. I learned that he had anxiously assumed the tears were because he had disappointed me in some way. He didn’t know about the phone call. Brethren, we underestimate how genuinely and frequently our children want to please us.</p>

Having virtually no quantitative skills, I was seldom if ever able to help our children with math and scientific subjects. One day our high school daughter Nancy asked me for “a little help” regarding a Supreme Court case, <span class="emphasis">Fletcher v. Peck.</span> I was so eager to help after so many times of not being able to help. At last a chance to unload! Out came what I knew about <span class="emphasis">Fletcher v. Peck.</span> Finally my frustrated daughter said, “Dad, I need only a <span class="emphasis">little</span> help!” I was meeting my own needs rather than giving her “a little help.”</p>

In later years, I saw a few leave the Church who could then never leave it alone. They used often their intellectual reservations to cover their behavioral lapses (see Neal A. Maxwell, <span class="emphasis">All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</span> [1979], 110). You will see some of that. By the way, do not expect the world’s solutions to the world’s problems to be very effective. Such solutions often resemble what C. S. Lewis wrote about those who go dashing back and forth with fire extinguishers in times of flood (see <span class="emphasis">The Screwtape Letters </span>[1959], 117–18). Only the gospel is constantly relevant, and the substitute things won’t work.</p>

Once when traveling with Elder and Sister Russell M. Nelson, we left our hotel in Bombay, India, to catch a plane for Karachi, Pakistan, and then on to Islamabad. When we got to the chaotic airport, our flight had been canceled. Impatiently, I said to the man at the airline counter, “What do you expect us to do, just give up and go back to the hotel?” He said with great dignity, “Sir, you never go back to the hotel.” We rummaged about the airport, found a flight, kept the appointment in Islamabad, and even had a night’s sleep. Sometimes life is like that: we are left to press forward and endure frustrated expectations—refusing to “go back to the hotel”! Otherwise, such “give-up-itis” will affect all seasons of life. Besides, the Lord knows how many miles we have to go “before [we] sleep”! (“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening”).</p>

In 1956, after returning home from several years in Washington, D.C., and having declined several attractive offers there, I received an offer to work at the University of Utah. My wife said I should take it. She said presciently, “I feel if you go there, maybe you will have some influence on students.” I replied impatiently, “I’ll be typing news releases, not working with students.” The subsequent opportunities included being a bishop of a student ward, dean of students, and teaching hundreds of fine students in political science. It wasn’t status that mattered, of course, but being stretched and being given opportunities to serve.</p>

It’s interesting, too, how we create, cumulatively, expectations in the lives of our grandchildren even when we are not aware of it. Some years ago, when our grandson Robbie was about five, we dropped by to see his family in Orem. He was asleep upstairs, and his mother called, “Robbie, Grandpa Neal is here!” A tired little voice floated downstairs saying, “Shall I bring my scriptures?”</p>
