Indeed, that is the very purpose of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—to invite, encourage, and assist all of God’s children, both living and dead, to come to Christ and “lay hold upon every good gift” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.30" class="scriptureRef">Moro. 10:30</a>), that “ye may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that ye may be numbered with my people who are of the house of Israel” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/30.2" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 30:2</a>).</p>

That divine purpose explains why the risen Savior proclaimed to his chosen Apostles that they, after receiving the Holy Ghost, should be witnesses unto him “both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/1.8" class="scriptureRef">Acts 1:8</a>).</p>

Ashton of the Council of the Twelve to a great, green land I dearly love—the continent of Africa. Under authority of the holy Apostleship, Elder Ashton dedicated two west African countries—Liberia and Ivory Coast—and one in central Africa—Zaire—to the work of the Lord and the preaching of the fulness of the gospel of Christ. Those countries join others in so-called “Black Africa,” where the great work of bringing souls to Christ has already commenced. The time of harvest has come. We are witnessing the dawning of a new day, the beginning of a new era in Africa.</p>

The light of the fulness of the gospel of Christ, like a beam of transcendent clarity and effulgent beauty, is bursting majestic upon those ancient lands and peoples. It dispels the spiritual gloom and drives away the shadows of error and superstition which long have lain over the “dark continent.” It falls on a prepared people—a people prepared by the Spirit of God. The words of Alma, uttered in a different context, come to mind:</p>

If the price of spirituality be suffering and affliction, travail and sorrow, our humble African brothers and sisters are well prepared to receive and obey the fulness of the gospel of Christ. The vast majority are very poor; famine and pestilence dog their steps and visit their homes regularly. Opportunities for education and employment are extremely limited.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-dawning-of-a-new-day-in-africa.p9" pid="HtqmlTsW9Uqs2-1yWPDoJg" hash="KIngjA">But through it all they are a happy people, generous and loving, anxious to learn and eager to obey the commandments of Christ. Among them, there is a great understanding of the importance of families. If one works, a dozen eat. Many in more technologically advanced societies have forgotten what the simplest of African peasants well knows: families are the fundamental building blocks upon which any society must be erected, if it is long to endure.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/the-dawning-of-a-new-day-in-africa.p10" pid="1aUN7F5m80C26tZpYEW5fA" hash="I8vlqg">We Latter-day Saints take justifiable pride in our great pioneer heritage—in those hearty, courageous pioneers who, under conditions of great hardship and sacrifice, laid the foundation for further growth of the Church. How fortunate we are that the pioneering spirit lives on today! In every corner of Africa, there are faithful expatriate members of the Church, non-Africans who live and work there and are believing and behaving Latter-day Saints. They hail from many lands.</p>

As part of God’s great and grand design for growth, they have been placed on the frontiers of the Church by divine providence, to serve as “nursing fathers” and “nursing mothers” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21.23" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 21:23</a>)—foci of strength around which the Church can grow. They are the right people at the right place and at the right time in history. Theirs is a mission of love and service.</p>

The need for additional missionary couples to work in Africa is great, the rewards of such service sublime and eternal.</p>

In the words of the Nephite prophet Ammon, He is “mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.37" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:37</a>).</p>

In the words of the Prophet Joseph, it will go forward “boldly, nobly, and independent, till … [the truth of God has] swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 4:540). Of that I humbly testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Just as one who is weakened by malnutrition soon may fall prey to infectious disease, so, too will we, if spiritually weakened, be ready prey for the adversary and his legions of dupes and devils.</p>

Where can it be found? Jesus, as always, had the answer. To the Samaritan woman at Jacob’s well, He proclaimed, “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/4.14" class="scriptureRef">John 4:14</a>.)</p>

The scriptures provide the guidelines within which faithful servants carry out sacred tasks.</p>

He is the very personification of truth and light, of life and love, of beauty and goodness. All that He did was done out of love. In Nephi’s words, “He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.24" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:24</a>.)</p>

In a remarkable revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith on April 26, 1832, Jesus pointed out the supernal power of sacred and solemn agreements between man and God. “I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 82:10</a>.)</p>

God loves us one by one. How eloquently the Savior taught that lesson in the masterful parable of the lost sheep found in Luke 15. The parable tells of a shepherd who was prepared to leave the main flock of sheep—the ninety and nine—and go out into the wilderness in search of the one straggler which was lost.</p>

It must have been at best a nuisance, and most likely dangerous, for the shepherd to leave the ninety and nine and go out into the wilderness to find the lost sheep. For one thing, wildernesses tend to be dangerous and lonely places, where unwary travelers can get into a great deal of trouble. And what about the worries the shepherd must have had as he thought about the flock left behind without a shepherd’s care to safeguard its members from predators, accidents, acts of nature, and so on? After all, anyone who knows anything about sheep understands just how prone they are to get into trouble spontaneously, without anyone having to help them. I learned as a farm boy many years ago that sheep and trouble go together! Come to think of it, so, too, do people and trouble often go together!</p>

Oh, how He rejoices when a lost soul is found by a faithful undershepherd and then is tenderly and lovingly brought home again! “The worth of souls is great in the sight of God.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:10</a>.)</p>

They know that service solves the seeming paradox of the scriptures: one has to <span class="emphasis">lose </span>his or her life to <span class="emphasis">find </span>it. Service, wise undershepherds understand, is the golden key which unlocks the doors to celestial halls. For many, Christ is found through serving Him. With King Benjamin, inspired undershepherds proclaim, “When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:17</a>.) Armed with that understanding, they are “willing to mourn with those that mourn … and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and … stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:9</a>.)</p>

They seek only “to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with [their] God.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/micah/6.8" class="scriptureRef">Micah 6:8</a>.) They become as little children, “submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [them], even as a child doth submit to his father.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>.)</p>

Jesus displayed none of the cringing servility or false bravado characteristic of those who pled for their lives before the power of imperial Rome. He stood quietly before the proud Roman, unbowed, majestic, His demeanor mild yet regal. “Art thou a king then?” Pilate inquired (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/18.37" class="scriptureRef">John 18:37</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/for-this-cause-came-i-into-the-world.p2" pid="RVqUe0-CfkmEU1J0qH27Vw" hash="iJFaIQ">Jesus, the King of Kings, whose Father would have provided for the asking “more than twelve legions of angels” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.53" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:53</a>), whose glory and majesty transcended anything Pilate—or indeed any mortal man—could even comprehend, answered simply: “Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/18.37" class="scriptureRef">John 18:37</a>). Pilate, a weak and vacillating man, devoid of integrity and not overly burdened by principles, retorted cynically, “What is truth?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/18.38" class="scriptureRef">John 18:38</a>). Then, though he found no fault in Jesus and knew of a certainty that He was no political firebrand nor threat to Roman power and authority, Pilate yielded to the bloodlust of the crowd and delivered Christ to His crucifiers.</p>

Why did Jesus, the Lord God Omnipotent who sits at the right hand of the Father, creator of worlds without number, lawgiver and judge, condescend to come to earth to be born in a manger, live out most of His mortal existence in obscurity, trudge the dusty roads of Judea proclaiming a message which was violently opposed by many, and finally, betrayed by one of His closest associates, die between two malefactors on Golgotha’s somber hill? Nephi, who gloried “in … Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.6" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 33:6</a>), understood Christ’s motivation: “He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.24" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:24</a>). It was love for all of God’s children that led Jesus, unique in His sinless perfection, to offer Himself as ransom for the sins of others. In the words of the beloved hymn, “Jesus died on Calvary, That all thru him might ransomed be” (“ ’Tis Sweet to Sing the Matchless Love,” <span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 176). This, then, was the consummate cause which brought Jesus to earth to “suffer, bleed, and die for man.” He came as “a lamb without blemish and without spot” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.19" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 1:19</a>) to atone for our sins, that He, being raised on the cross, might draw all men unto Him (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.14" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:14</a>). In Paul’s felicitous phrase, “as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.22" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 15:22</a>).</p>

He whom “God raised up the third day” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.40" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:40</a>) loosed the “bands of … temporal death, that <span class="emphasis">all</span> shall be raised” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.42" class="scriptureRef">Alma 11:42</a>; emphasis added) and “gained the victory over the grave” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/morm/7.5" class="scriptureRef">Morm. 7:5</a>).

Though Christ’s Atonement provides a universal resurrection to all, regardless of merit, the gift of eternal life—life with the Father and Son, in Their perfected presence—is reserved for the faithful, for those who show their love for Christ by their willingness to follow His commandments and to make and keep holy covenants. “He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them,” Jesus reminded us, “he it is that loveth me” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.21" class="scriptureRef">John 14:21</a>). As the prophets throughout the ages have declared, it is only as we make and keep holy covenants—those sacred celestial agreements between God and man—that we may become “partakers of the divine nature” and escape “the corruption that is in the world” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.4" class="scriptureRef">2 Pet. 1:4</a>).</p>

Yet He came for another cause as well—to serve as the example to all of man’s divine potential, the standard against whom all must measure their lives. He who proclaimed His divinity to the Samaritan woman at Jacob’s well (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/4.title" class="scriptureRef">John 4</a>) calls us to become “even as I am” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 27:27</a>), to become perfect “even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.48" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 12:48</a>). From the depths of that ineffable perfection He calls upon us to care for the sick, the poor, the afflicted; to pray for and show compassion towards all of God’s children, for “God is no respecter of persons” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/10.34" class="scriptureRef">Acts 10:34</a>). With Him there are no barriers of race or gender or language. As Nephi explained, “He denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:33</a>).</p>

One such lesson deals with the need to be generous in our giving—to give with the spirit of sacrifice and devout intent to bless those less fortunate than ourselves. Luke records that as Jesus sat in the temple He observed those who cast their contributions into the treasure chests therein. Some deposited their gifts with devoutness and sincerity of purpose, but others, though they gave great sums of silver and gold, did so ostentatiously, primarily to be seen of men.</p>

Taken together they amounted to less than half a cent in American money. Noting the disparity between what she gave and the much greater contributions of some others, Jesus proclaimed, “Of a truth … , this poor widow hath cast in more than they all.” Though the rich had given from their abundance, “she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/21.1-4" class="scriptureRef">Luke 21:1–4</a>). Jesus knew it is not the amount we give that matters. In the arithmetic of heaven, value is determined not by quantity but by quality. It is the intent of the willing heart and mind that is acceptable to God (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/2-cor/8.12" class="scriptureRef">2 Cor. 8:12</a>).</p>

King Benjamin, the great Nephite prophet, explained what it means to become as a little child: “submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>).</p>

He reminded us that inasmuch as we provide acts of charity to others, even unto those considered by some to be “the least,” “ye have done it unto me” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.35-45" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:35–45</a>). He taught not only of our obligations to help each other temporally but also of the powerful, eternal, spiritual implications of doing so. Indeed, all of His commandments, in the final analysis, are spiritual and not temporal only. Thus, the scriptures advise that “for the sake of retaining a remission of [our] sins from day to day, that [we] may walk guiltless before God, … [we] should impart of [our] substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.26" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:26</a>).</p>

The symbol of Jesus and His place in our hearts must be a life given fully to His service, to loving and caring; to an unstinting commitment to Christ and His cause; to a spiritual rebirth that produces a “mighty change” in our hearts and prepares us to receive “his image in [our] countenances” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.13-14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:13–14</a>). To take His name upon us means a willingness to do whatever He requires of us. Someone has said that the price of a Christian life is the same today as always: it is simply to give all that we have, holding back nothing, to “give away all [our] sins to know [Him]” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:18</a>). When we fall short of that standard, by reason of sloth, indifference, or wickedness; when we are evil or envious, selfish, sensual or shallow; we, in a sense at least, crucify Him afresh. And when we try consistently to be our very best, when we care for and serve others, when we overcome selfishness with love, when we place the welfare of others above our own, when we bear each other’s burdens and “mourn with those that mourn,” when we “comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and … stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 18:8–9</a>), then we honor Him and draw from His power and become more and more like Him, growing “brighter and brighter,” if we persist, “until the perfect day” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:24</a>).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/come-and-see.p1" pid="SCRWzZ9cdE2rPYJBEzxKUg" hash="9PQZaQ">Very early in His ministry, two disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Master, … where dwellest thou?” Jesus’ brief yet profound reply, “Come and see,” provides the basis for my few poor remarks today (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.38-39" class="scriptureRef">John 1:38–39</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/come-and-see.p2" pid="1NgfarWrqkWrB8aD_kUNxA" hash="P4PrmA">“Come and see,” come seeking to know Him, and I promise you will find Him and see Him in His true character as the risen, redeeming Savior of the world. “Come and see,” and you will recognize Him as the Christ of the empty sepulchre, the conqueror of Calvary, who broke the bands of death and rose triumphant from the tomb, to bring immortality to all and eternal life to the faithful. He is the “lamb without blemish and without spot,” foreordained in His messianic role “before the foundation of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.19-20" class="scriptureRef">1 Pet. 1:19–20</a>). “He was wounded for our transgressions [and] bruised for our iniquities: … with his stripes we are healed” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/53.5" class="scriptureRef">Isa. 53:5</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/come-and-see.p3" pid="YXp_rk3WwEyImDsVBsy4Vg" hash="bWdgpQ">“Come and see,” and in your coming lay your burdens at His feet. Give away all your sins that you might see and know Him (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:18</a>). “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,” He said, “and I will give you rest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/come-and-see.p4" pid="fXOhBfavUUiXSCROEPoYwg" hash="59yB9w">“Take my yoke upon you and learn of me … and ye shall find rest unto your souls” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-29" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 11:28–29</a>). Come unto Him, and He will take away your sins and heal your soul, though it be sick with sin. He will replace hatred with love and selfishness with service. He will strengthen your shoulders to better bear your burdens and give you new courage and hope for the journey ahead.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/come-and-see.p5" pid="9dH5hR-k1USphYHN471Gpw" hash="OJelRQ">“Come and see,” and as you do so your eyes will be opened and you will <span class="emphasis">really</span> see, perhaps for the first time, who <span class="emphasis">you</span> are, and who <span class="emphasis">He</span> is. You will come to see yourself as a child of God, of divine parentage, possessed of infinite capacities to grow spiritually and become more like Him. You will come to understand that God “hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/17.26" class="scriptureRef">Acts 17:26</a>) and you will see all men everywhere as your brothers and all women as your sisters, with all that implies in terms of sibling responsibility. You will see that “he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; … and all are alike unto God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 26:33</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/come-and-see.p6" pid="lX4-YL_VCkal-mBn0m13-A" hash="BUyh7w">“Come and see,” and as you do so you will find His Church—The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is a church directed on earth by living prophets, seers, and revelators, but its head is no mortal man, but Jesus, the Lord God Omnipotent Himself. As you “come and see,” you will find a happy people—an optimistic and joyful people—who, while struggling to overcome the usual faults and foibles of humanity, yet strive to be better, to do good to all men, to build the city of God wherein all may dwell together in righteousness. As you “come and see,” you will find a people with a deep and abiding concern for the poor and the needy, a people who reach out a helping hand to aid the widow and orphan, the sick and afflicted, the poor and oppressed. “Come and see” the fruits of gospel living. Taste them for yourself, and you will find them sweet and delicious. As you come to know “that when ye are in the service of your fellow [men] ye are only in the service of your God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:17</a>), you will seek to wear out your life in the service of the Master.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/come-and-see.p7" pid="JKqjfdj96kumXZ9NmscGaA" hash="skSa3Q">I finish where I began: Jesus’ statement “Come and see” provides both an invitation and a promise to all people everywhere. Come to Him; see Him as King of Kings and Lord of Lords; recognize in Him the great Messiah who will come again with healing in His wings, to set His people free. He will wrap you about in the cloak of His redeeming love, and your life will be changed forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2000/10/come-and-see.p8" pid="cC3lwIefd0OQogv5L3zGGg" hash="fE9gxg">Of that I testify, as one of His servants, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
