I pray for and invite the companionship of the Holy Ghost for me and for you as I speak with you briefly this Sabbath morning.</p>

This morning I take great comfort in knowing that I am one of the truly weak things of the world.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p7" pid="mB4_UWHAH0q4adA6OvUXVw" hash="mHigXQ">Brothers and sisters, please pay particular attention to the word <span class="emphasis">grace</span> as it is used in the verse I just read. In the Bible Dictionary we learn that the word <span class="emphasis">grace</span> frequently is used in the scriptures to connote a strengthening or enabling power:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p8" pid="zMokbDoj40qQbLtJ2ZbQ7w" hash="iOly1Q">“The main idea of the word is divine means of help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.</p>

This grace is an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts” (p. 697).</p>

I testify and witness that the enabling power of the Savior’s Atonement is real. Without that strengthening power of the Atonement, I could not stand before you this morning.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p11" pid="Wwegx9P3MEGBqPyxZ-L6ZA" hash="T9GSoA">Can we sense the grace and strengthening power of Christ in the testimony of Ammon? “Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 26:12</a>). Truly, brothers and sisters, in the strength of the Lord we can do and endure and overcome all things.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p13" pid="9DXXbnozp0OHfnwjKbYmIg" hash="vOtjIA">“And when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed himself to the earth, before the Lord, and spake before the Lord, saying: Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?</p>

Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance, for all flesh is in my hands, and I will do as seemeth me good” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.31-32" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:31–32</a>).</p>

The promise was true in Enoch’s day, and it is true today.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p16" pid="PbwfcJX63E6MYnWEyE4y5w" hash="IJ9YLg">On the night of June 20, 2000, several colleagues and I were working late in the executive offices of then Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho. We were making final preparations for an unexpected and historic assembly on our campus the next morning and the announcement by President Hinckley that Ricks College would become a baccalaureate-degree-granting institution and take on the name of Brigham Young University–Idaho. As an administrative team we were just beginning to realize the monumental nature of the responsibility and challenges that were before us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p17" pid="JrVbH4pR5kOXkwxduW6zyA" hash="yPaR9w">As we walked out of the building that night, one of my colleagues asked, “President, are you scared?” As best as I can recall, I answered something like this: “If I thought we had to execute this transition relying exclusively upon our own experience and our own judgment, then I would be terrified. But we will have help from heaven. Because we know who is in charge and that we are not alone, then no, I am not scared.” And we who serve at BYU–Idaho unitedly testify that there has been help from heaven, miracles have occurred, revelations have been received, doors have been opened, and we have been greatly blessed as individuals and as an institution.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p18" pid="vDrQnikFREa_scTwfqFlzQ" hash="Fums5w">Please permit me now to express gratitude and appreciation. I am thankful for my progenitors—for those faithful and steady men and women whom I respect and honor and to whom I owe everything. I love and appreciate my mother and father and my wife’s mother and father. I am grateful for their love and support and teaching and strength.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p19" pid="3EfxQA6cQEGr5-ptiHzFZA" hash="Yj9dyg">My wife, Susan, is a virtuous woman and a righteous mother. You will quickly see that purity and goodness are evident in her countenance. I love her and appreciate her more than words can express. I thank her for the woman she is, for the lessons she has taught me, and for the love we share.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p20" pid="cpv-XRAqHE-B6lIV1cxpVg" hash="2vuc3Q">Susan and I have been blessed with three stalwart sons. I love and thank them. And our growing little family now includes two righteous daughters-in-law and three brilliant and beautiful and charming granddaughters. As we have opportunities to be together, we are blessed to see just a glimpse of the family unit in eternity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p21" pid="RbQIBsPfY0WhRH9j1jdVFg" hash="PMhTCw">My dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful for you. As I see you assembled here in the Conference Center and envision you in meetinghouses all over the earth, I am blessed by your faithfulness and devotion to the Savior. As your arms were raised to the square on Saturday, I felt a sustaining influence flow into my soul that was most remarkable. Few of you know who I am, yet you know from whom the call has come, and you are so willing to sustain and support. I express my thanks to you and pledge my whole soul and all of my energy to this sacred work.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p22" pid="Iu1SmWmOmk2GIYGboYOpnw" hash="QvBnLA">I will go where the Lord and the leaders of His Church want me to go, I will do what they want me to do, I will teach what they want me to teach, and I will strive to become what I should and must become. In the strength of the Lord and through His grace, I know that you and I can be blessed to accomplish all things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/in-the-strength-of-the-lord.p23" pid="6J40K05FcEyKeew2aNliCA" hash="z1O80A">As one of the weakest of the weak, I testify that God lives. I testify and witness that Jesus is the Christ. He is our Redeemer and our Savior, and He lives. And I testify that the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and His true Church have been restored to the earth in these latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Priesthood keys and authority and saving ordinances are again found on the earth. By the power of that priesthood, families truly can be together forever. The Book of Mormon is the word of God and the keystone of our religion. And, brothers and sisters, the heavens are not closed. God speaks—to us individually and to the leaders of His latter-day kingdom on earth. President Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord’s prophet on the earth today. Of these things I testify and declare my witness in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Both then and even more so now, I have felt and feel the weight of the call to serve and of the responsibility to teach with clarity and to testify with authority. I pray for and invite the assistance of the Holy Ghost as I now speak with you.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p2" pid="wTulak9PR0C5M_cYTPY9ug" hash="BPMCFg">This afternoon I want to describe and discuss a spiritual impression I received a few moments before I stepped to this pulpit during the Sunday morning session of general conference last October. Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf had just finished speaking and had declared his powerful witness of the Savior. Then we all stood together to sing the intermediate hymn that previously had been announced by President Gordon B. Hinckley. The intermediate hymn that morning was “Redeemer of Israel” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> no. 6).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p3" pid="Wc38FlibDUCP0VyZ1JAmHQ" hash="QIFcag">Now, the music for the various conference sessions had been determined many weeks before—and obviously long before my new call to serve. If, however, I had been invited to suggest an intermediate hymn for that particular session of the conference—a hymn that would have been both edifying and spiritually soothing for me and for the congregation before my first address in this Conference Center—I would have selected my favorite hymn, “Redeemer of Israel.” Tears filled my eyes as I stood with you to sing that stirring hymn of the Restoration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p4" pid="QkxgNVdu40-PiU2g1RD1_Q" hash="9_IMdA">Near the conclusion of the singing, to my mind came this verse from the Book of Mormon: “But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.20" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 1:20</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p5" pid="DWUzVnFlOU2RWV7L4SHNqg" hash="-FmXVw">My mind was drawn immediately to Nephi’s phrase “the tender mercies of the Lord,” and I knew in that very moment I was experiencing just such a tender mercy. A loving Savior was sending me a most personal and timely message of comfort and reassurance through a hymn selected weeks previously. Some may count this experience as simply a nice coincidence, but I testify that the tender mercies of the Lord are real and that they do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence. Often, the Lord’s timing of His tender mercies helps us to both discern and acknowledge them.</p>

        <h3 class="title" pid="vUYmd94yf06nXmYAcx0bPQ" hash="eayPQQ">What Are the Tender Mercies of the Lord?</h3>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p6" pid="CIBH6PGW60aoFxMNYvYfdQ" hash="Pp4Zxg">Since last October I have reflected repeatedly upon the phrase “the tender mercies of the Lord.” Through personal study, observation, pondering, and prayer, I believe I have come to better understand that the Lord’s tender mercies are the very personal and individualized blessings, strength, protection, assurances, guidance, loving-kindnesses, consolation, support, and spiritual gifts which we receive from and because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ. Truly, the Lord suits “his mercies according to the conditions of the children of men” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 46:15</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p7" pid="Dq8h9CdG50GLVAO7otd7gA" hash="7-r0zw">Recall how the Savior instructed His Apostles that He would not leave them comfortless. Not only would He send “another Comforter” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.16" class="scriptureRef">John 14:16</a>), even the Holy Ghost, but the Savior said that He would come to them (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.18" class="scriptureRef">John 14:18</a>). Let me suggest that one of the ways whereby the Savior comes to each of us is through His abundant and tender mercies. For instance, as you and I face challenges and tests in our lives, the gift of faith and an appropriate sense of personal confidence that reaches beyond our own capacity are two examples of the tender mercies of the Lord. Repentance and forgiveness of sins and peace of conscience are examples of the tender mercies of the Lord. And the persistence and the fortitude that enable us to press forward with cheerfulness through physical limitations and spiritual difficulties are examples of the tender mercies of the Lord.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p8" pid="6yzEZu7RikSP15UuIbR2ww" hash="sMWwCw">In a recent stake conference, the tender mercies of the Lord were evident in the touching testimony of a young wife and mother of four whose husband was slain in Iraq in December of 2003. This stalwart sister recounted how, after being notified of her husband’s death, she received his Christmas card and message. In the midst of the abrupt reality of a dramatically altered life came to this good sister a timely and tender reminder that indeed families can be together forever. With permission I quote from that Christmas card:</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p9" pid="11tJuE44S06Az6aX-gYCTQ" hash="_d_LUw">“To the best family in the world! Have a great time together and remember the true meaning of Christmas! The Lord has made it possible for us to be together forever. So even when we are apart, we will still be together as a family.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p10" pid="BQGUtKCJEEmvK9fymaEiZg" hash="OC5q4w">“God bless and keep y’all safe and grant this Christmas to be our gift of love from us to Him above!!!</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p11" pid="AGTtgRi_XE6-7YyaP1SVUQ" hash="Bz8MwQ">“All my love, Daddy and your loving husband!”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p12" pid="FUS_dhWaXkWATVqfLGGQTw" hash="dKYGng">Clearly, the husband’s reference to being apart in his Christmas greeting referred to the separation caused by his military assignment. But to this sister, as a voice from the dust from a departed eternal companion and father, came a most needed spiritual reassurance and witness. As I indicated earlier, the Lord’s tender mercies do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence. Faithfulness, obedience, and humility invite tender mercies into our lives, and it is often the Lord’s timing that enables us to recognize and treasure these important blessings.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p13" pid="IVKjXUB6uUWh9Ag9DOvMtA" hash="5i9z3g">Some time ago I spoke with a priesthood leader who was prompted to memorize the names of all of the youth ages 13 to 21 in his stake. Using snapshots of the young men and women, he created flash cards that he reviewed while traveling on business and at other times. This priesthood leader quickly learned all of the names of the youth.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p14" pid="Q2ansesBEU-eJie_EyDTMw" hash="qXJQdA">One night the priesthood leader had a dream about one of the young men whom he knew only from a picture. In the dream he saw the young man dressed in a white shirt and wearing a missionary name tag. With a companion seated at his side, the young man was teaching a family. The young man held the Book of Mormon in his hand, and he looked as if he were testifying of the truthfulness of the book. The priesthood leader then awoke from his dream.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p15" pid="7OW-0gCHkkulNSk4ZsQenQ" hash="PnEM9w">At an ensuing priesthood gathering, the leader approached the young man he had seen in his dream and asked to talk with him for a few minutes. After a brief introduction, the leader called the young man by name and said: “I am not a dreamer. I have never had a dream about a single member of this stake, except for you. I am going to tell you about my dream, and then I would like you to help me understand what it means.”</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p16" pid="TcDMw1ewGEmiVhzZMj7IMA" hash="4owNSQ">The priesthood leader recounted the dream and asked the young man about its meaning. Choking with emotion, the young man simply replied, “It means God knows who I am.” The remainder of the conversation between this young man and his priesthood leader was most meaningful, and they agreed to meet and counsel together from time to time during the following months.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/the-tender-mercies-of-the-lord.p17" pid="mDOHOJ_bb0aKIbxIgqoTsA" hash="Il9mLw">That young man received the Lord’s tender mercies through an inspired priesthood leader. I repeat again, the Lord’s tender mercies do not occur randomly or merely by coincidence. Faithfulness and obedience enable us to receive these important gifts and, frequently, the Lord’s timing helps us to recognize them.</p>

The simpleness, the sweetness, and the constancy of the tender mercies of the Lord will do much to fortify and protect us in the troubled times in which we do now and will yet live. When words cannot provide the solace we need or express the joy we feel, when it is simply futile to attempt to explain that which is unexplainable, when logic and reason cannot yield adequate understanding about the injustices and inequities of life, when mortal experience and evaluation are insufficient to produce a desired outcome, and when it seems that perhaps we are so totally alone, truly we are blessed by the tender mercies of the Lord and made mighty even unto the power of deliverance (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.20" class="scriptureRef">1 Ne. 1:20</a>).</p>

Many of us have served as full-time missionaries, some of us presently are serving as full-time missionaries, and all of us now are serving and will continue to serve as lifelong missionaries. We are missionaries every day in our families, in our schools, in our places of employment, and in our communities. Regardless of our age, experience, or station in life, we are all missionaries.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/becoming-a-missionary.p2" pid="iawAIxxDyECLNXUuS2C5ag" hash="DVhcMA">Proclaiming the gospel is not an activity in which we periodically and temporarily engage. And our labors as missionaries certainly are not confined to the short period of time devoted to full-time missionary service in our youth or in our mature years. Rather, the obligation to proclaim the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is inherent in the oath and covenant of the priesthood into which we enter. Missionary work essentially is a priesthood responsibility, and all of us who hold the priesthood are the Lord’s authorized servants on the earth and are missionaries at all times and in all places—and we always will be. Our very identity as holders of the priesthood and the seed of Abraham is in large measure defined by the responsibility to proclaim the gospel.</p>

My specific purpose in this priesthood meeting, however, is to talk candidly with the young men of the Church who are preparing for the call to serve as missionaries. The principles I will discuss with you are both simple and spiritually significant, and they should cause us to ponder, to evaluate, and to improve. I pray for the companionship of the Holy Ghost for me and for you as we consider together this important subject.</p>

One of the questions I am asked most frequently by young men is this: “What can I do to prepare most effectively to serve as a full-time missionary?” Such a sincere question deserves a serious response.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/becoming-a-missionary.p5" pid="Usp-4UNSNEW_wJILlk27-Q" hash="EC1rhQ">My dear young brethren, the single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to <span class="emphasis">become</span> a missionary long before you go on a mission.

Let me be so bold as to suggest that our rather routine emphasis on <span class="emphasis">going</span> misses the mark.</p>

The issue is not going to or through the temple; rather, the issue is having in our hearts the spirit, the covenants, and the ordinances of the Lord’s house. The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. It is possible for a young man to <span class="emphasis">go</span> on a mission and not <span class="emphasis">become</span> a missionary, and this is not what the Lord requires or what the Church needs.</p>

This process requires far more than acquiring knowledge. It is not even enough for us to be <span class="emphasis">convinced</span> of the gospel; we must act and think so that we are <span class="emphasis">converted</span> by it. In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us to <span class="emphasis">know</span> something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to <span class="emphasis">become</span> something. …</p>

Obviously, the process of becoming a missionary does not require a young man to wear a white shirt and tie to school every day or to follow the missionary guidelines for going to bed and getting up, although most parents certainly would support that idea. But you can increase in your desire to serve God (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:3</a>), and you can begin to think as missionaries think, to read what missionaries read, to pray as missionaries pray, and to feel what missionaries feel. You can avoid the worldly influences that cause the Holy Ghost to withdraw, and you can grow in confidence in recognizing and responding to spiritual promptings. Line upon line and precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, you can gradually become the missionary you hope to be and the missionary the Savior expects.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/becoming-a-missionary.p13" pid="MKWbLP9Dz0CnOuBkO6Cxpg" hash="fIBhaA">You will not suddenly or magically be transformed into a prepared and obedient missionary on the day you walk through the front door of the Missionary Training Center. What you have become in the days and months and years prior to your missionary service is what you will be in the MTC. In fact, the nature of the transition through which you will pass in the MTC will be a strong indicator of your progress in becoming a missionary.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/becoming-a-missionary.p14" pid="aCznDF0naEW_wLHAZxiqPw" hash="HrYAGA">As you enter the MTC, you obviously will miss your family, and many aspects of your daily schedule will be new and challenging. But for a young man well on his way to becoming a missionary, the basic adjustment to the rigors of missionary work and lifestyle will not be overwhelming, burdensome, or constraining. Thus, a key element of raising the bar includes working to become a missionary before going on a mission.</p>

You and your wife are key in the process of his becoming a missionary. Priesthood and auxiliary leaders, do you recognize your responsibility to assist parents and to help every young man become a missionary before he goes on a mission? The bar also has been raised for parents and for all members of the Church. Prayerful pondering of the principle of becoming will invite inspiration tailored to the specific needs of your son or to the young men whom you serve.</p>

Brethren, you are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work. As holders of the priesthood, we are missionaries always. If you truly progress in the process of becoming a missionary, both before going on a mission and in the mission field, then when the day arrives for your honorable release as a full-time missionary, you will depart from your field of labor and return to your family—but you will never cease your missionary service. A priesthood holder is a missionary at all times and in all places. A missionary is who and what we are as bearers of the priesthood and as the seed of Abraham.</p>

You and I, today and always, are to bear witness of Jesus Christ and declare the message of the Restoration. You and I, today and always, are to invite all to receive the ordinances of salvation. Proclaiming the gospel is not a part-time priesthood obligation. It is not simply an activity in which we engage for a limited time or an assignment we must complete as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Rather, missionary work is a manifestation of our spiritual identity and heritage. We were foreordained in the premortal existence and born into mortality to fulfill the covenant and promise God made to Abraham. We are here upon the earth at this time to magnify the priesthood and to preach the gospel. That is who we are, and that is why we are here—today and always.</p>

As the Savior taught Nicodemus, “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.5" class="scriptureRef">John 3:5</a>). My message this afternoon focuses on the baptism of the Spirit and the blessings that flow from the companionship of the Holy Ghost.</p>

A covenant is an agreement between God and His children upon the earth, and it is important to understand that God determines the conditions of all gospel covenants. You and I do not decide the nature or elements of a covenant. Rather, exercising our moral agency, we accept the terms and requirements of a covenant as our Eternal Father has established them (see Bible Dictionary, “Covenant,” 651).</p>

The fundamental conditions of the covenant into which we entered in the waters of baptism are these: we witnessed that we were willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, that we would always remember Him, and that we would keep His commandments. The promised blessing for honoring this covenant is <span class="emphasis">that we may always have His Spirit to be with us</span> (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 20:77</a>). In other words, baptism by water leads to the authorized opportunity for the constant companionship of the third member of the Godhead.</p>

Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” (<span class="emphasis">History of the Church,</span> 5:499). We were baptized by immersion in water for the remission of sins. We must also be baptized by and immersed in the Spirit of the Lord, “and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.17" class="scriptureRef">2 Ne. 31:17</a>).</p>

Strong, dramatic spiritual impressions do not come to us frequently. Even as we strive to be faithful and obedient, there simply are times when the direction, assurance, and peace of the Spirit are not readily recognizable in our lives. In fact, the Book of Mormon describes faithful Lamanites who “were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 9:20</a>).</p>

Thus, the Spirit of the Lord usually communicates with us in ways that are quiet, delicate, and subtle.</p>

And such an approach is correct and useful. We should seek diligently to recognize and respond to promptings as they come to us. However, an important aspect of baptism by the Spirit may frequently be overlooked in our spiritual development.</p>

If something we think, see, hear, or do distances us from the Holy Ghost, then we should stop thinking, seeing, hearing, or doing that thing. If that which is intended to entertain, for example, alienates us from the Holy Spirit, then certainly that type of entertainment is not for us. Because the Spirit cannot abide that which is vulgar, crude, or immodest, then clearly such things are not for us. Because we estrange the Spirit of the Lord when we engage in activities we know we should shun, then such things definitely are not for us.</p>

However, the Holy Ghost can tarry with us much, if not most, of the time—and certainly the Spirit can be with us more than it is not with us. As we become ever more immersed in the Spirit of the Lord, we should strive to recognize impressions when they come and the influences or events that cause us to withdraw ourselves from the Holy Ghost.</p>

Sometimes as Latter-day Saints we talk and act as though recognizing the influence of the Holy Ghost in our lives is the rare or exceptional event. We should remember, however, that the covenant promise is <span class="emphasis">that we may always have His Spirit to be with us.</span> This supernal blessing applies to every single member of the Church who has been baptized, confirmed, and instructed to “receive the Holy Ghost.”</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="89"></span>This afternoon I pray that the Holy Ghost will assist me and you as we review together important gospel principles.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/and-nothing-shall-offend-them.p2" pid="d35O0VW8EUq1mb_yuUSTuQ" hash="Ct2vlw">One of my favorite activities as a priesthood leader is visiting members of the Church in their homes. I especially enjoy calling upon and talking with members who commonly are described as “less active.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/and-nothing-shall-offend-them.p3" pid="542KE1AWJkaJ6LXosOoofg" hash="HQrLag">During the years I served as a stake president, I often would contact one of the bishops and invite him to prayerfully identify individuals or families we could visit together. Before traveling to a home, the bishop and I would kneel and petition our Heavenly Father for guidance and inspiration, for us and for the members with whom we would meet.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/and-nothing-shall-offend-them.p4" pid="EZTRuVSGvUmkYJtqeOvPCg" hash="o4BLhw">Our visits were quite straightforward. We expressed love and appreciation for the opportunity to be in their home. We affirmed that we were servants of the Lord on His errand to their home. We indicated that we missed and needed them—and that they needed the blessings of the restored gospel. And at some point early in our conversation I often would ask a question like this: “Will you please help us understand why you are not actively participating in the blessings and programs of the Church?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/and-nothing-shall-offend-them.p5" pid="kDI2tsYUzUWH6OuduC-hGA" hash="Qh4C2w">I made hundreds and hundreds of such visits. Each individual, each family, each home, and each answer was different. Over the years, however, I detected a common theme in many of the answers to my questions. Frequently responses like these were given:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/and-nothing-shall-offend-them.p6" pid="ZjKyJXrxf0WlQXsB_IezVg" hash="enXIKw">“Several years ago a man said something in Sunday School that offended me, and I have not been back since.”</p>

But the recurring theme was: “I was offended by …”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/and-nothing-shall-offend-them.p10" pid="DcKm_OVFuUGg3yRnpMZ0NQ" hash="EpPdiw">The bishop and I would listen intently and sincerely. One of us might next ask about their conversion to and testimony of the restored gospel. As we talked, eyes often were moist with tears as these good people recalled the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost and described their prior spiritual experiences. Most of the “less-active” people I have ever visited had a discernible and tender testimony of the truthfulness of the restored gospel. However, they were not presently participating in Church activities and meetings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/and-nothing-shall-offend-them.p11" pid="-4GhcoU6ZEa_Es5GNYyUug" hash="6oxI7w">And then I would say something like this. “Let me make sure I understand what has happened to you. Because someone at church offended you, you have not been blessed by the ordinance of the sacrament. You have withdrawn yourself from the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. Because someone at church offended you, you have cut yourself off from priesthood ordinances and the holy temple. You have discontinued your opportunity to serve others and to learn and grow. And you are leaving barriers that will impede the spiritual progress of your children, your children’s children, and the generations that will follow.” Many times people would think for a moment and then respond: “I have never thought about it that way.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/and-nothing-shall-offend-them.p12" pid="YckAJONqLke3K4nwglZ2Yw" hash="t_pUJA">The bishop and I would then extend an invitation: “Dear friend, we are here today to counsel you that the time to stop being offended is now. Not only do we need you, but you need the blessings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Please come back—now.”</p>

          <span class="pageBreak" page-number="90"></span>When we believe or say we have been offended, we usually mean we feel insulted, mistreated, snubbed, or disrespected. And certainly clumsy, embarrassing, unprincipled, and mean-spirited things do occur in our interactions with other people that would allow us to take offense. However, it ultimately is impossible for another person to offend you or to offend me. Indeed, believing that another person offended us is fundamentally false. To be offended is a <span class="emphasis">choice</span> we make; it is not a <span class="emphasis">condition</span> inflicted or imposed upon us by someone or something else.</p>

As sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father, we have been blessed with the gift of moral agency, the capacity for independent action and choice. Endowed with agency, you and I are agents, and we primarily are to act and not just be acted upon. To believe that someone or something can <span class="emphasis">make</span> us feel offended, angry, hurt, or bitter diminishes our moral agency and transforms us into objects to be acted upon. As agents, however, you and I have the power to act and to choose how we will respond to an offensive or hurtful situation.</p>

Marsh, the first President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in this dispensation, elected to take offense over an issue as inconsequential as milk strippings (see <span class="emphasis">Deseret News,</span> Apr. 16, 1856, 44). Brigham Young, on the other hand, was severely and publicly rebuked by the Prophet Joseph Smith, but he chose not to take offense (see Truman G. Madsen, “Hugh B. Brown—Youthful Veteran,” <span class="emphasis">New Era,</span> Apr. 1976, 16).</p>

Thomas B. Marsh allowed himself to be acted upon, and the eventual results were apostasy and misery. Brigham Young was an agent who exercised his agency and acted in accordance with correct principles, and he became a mighty instrument in the hands of the Lord.</p>

A visiting teacher learns her duty as she serves and loves her Relief Society sisters. An inexperienced teacher learns valuable lessons as he teaches both supportive and inattentive learners and thereby becomes a more effective teacher. And a new bishop learns how to be a bishop through inspiration and by working with ward members who wholeheartedly sustain him, even while recognizing his human frailties.</p>

Pahoran might easily have resented Moroni and his message, but he chose not to take offense. Pahoran responded compassionately and described a rebellion against the government about which Moroni was not aware. And then he responded, “Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul. … And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/61.2,9" class="scriptureRef">Alma 61:2, 9</a>).</p>

Clearly, the rigorous requirements that lead to the perfecting of the Saints include assignments that test and challenge us. If a person says or does something that we consider offensive, our first obligation is to refuse to take offense and then communicate privately, honestly, and directly with that individual. Such an approach invites inspiration from the Holy Ghost and permits misperceptions to be clarified and true intent to be understood.</p>

The first steps in the process of changing a cucumber into a pickle are <span class="emphasis">preparing</span> and <span class="emphasis">cleaning.</span> I remember many hours spent on the back porch of my home removing stems from and scrubbing dirt off of the cucumbers we had picked. My mom was very particular about the preparing and cleaning of the cucumbers. She had high standards of cleanliness and always inspected my work to make sure this important task was properly completed.</p>

To prepare the brine, my mom always used a recipe she learned from her mother—a recipe with special ingredients and precise procedures. Cucumbers can only become pickles if they are totally and completely immersed in the brine for the prescribed time period. The curing process gradually alters the composition of the cucumber and produces the transparent appearance and distinctive taste of a pickle. An occasional sprinkle of or dip in the brine cannot produce the necessary transformation. Rather, steady, sustained, and complete immersion is required for the desired change to occur.</p>

The pickles are packed in canning jars, covered with boiling hot brine, and processed in a boiling-water-bath canner. All impurities must be removed from both the pickles and the bottles so the finished product can be protected and preserved. As this procedure is properly followed, the pickles can be stored and enjoyed for a long period of time.</p>

Please note that the conversion described in these verses is mighty, not minor—a spiritual rebirth and fundamental change of what we feel and desire, what we think and do, and what we are.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="80"></span>I have fond childhood memories of my mother reading Book of Mormon stories to me. She had a way of making the scriptural episodes come alive in my youthful imagination, and I did not doubt that my mother had a witness of the truthfulness of that sacred record. I especially remember her description of the Savior’s visit to the American continent following His Resurrection and of His teachings to the people in the land of Bountiful. Through the simple consistency of her example and testimony, my mother kindled in me the first flames of faith in the Savior and in His latter-day Church. I came to know for myself that the Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ and contains the fulness of His everlasting gospel (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27.5" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 27:5</a>).</p>

First was repentance, “a turning <span class="pageBreak" page-number="81"></span>of the heart and will to God, and a renunciation of sin” (Bible Dictionary, “Repentance,” 760). As we appropriately seek for and receive the spiritual gift of faith in the Redeemer, we then turn to and rely upon the merits, the mercy, and the grace of the Holy Messiah (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.8" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 2:8</a>). Repentance is the sweet fruit that comes from faith in the Savior and involves turning toward God and away from sin.</p>

The multitude gathered together at the temple was invited literally to come forth unto the Savior “one by one” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.15" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 11:15</a>) to feel the prints of the nails in the Master’s hands and feet and to thrust their hands into His side. Each individual who had this experience “did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.15" class="scriptureRef">v. 15</a>), even Jesus Christ, who had come.</p>

He emphasized the eternal importance of the ordinances of baptism (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.19-39" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 11:19–39</a>) and of receiving the Holy Ghost (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.35-36" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 11:35–36</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.6" class="scriptureRef">12:6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.36-38" class="scriptureRef">18:36–38</a>). In a similar manner, you and I are admonished to turn toward and learn from Christ and to come unto Him through the covenants and ordinances of His restored gospel. As we do so, we will eventually and ultimately come to know Him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.3" class="scriptureRef">John 17:3</a>), “in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.68" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:68</a>), as did the people in the land of Bountiful.</p>

The purpose of our mortal journey is not merely to see the sights on earth or to expend our allotment of time on self-centered pursuits; rather, we are to “walk in newness of life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/rom/6.4" class="scriptureRef">Romans 6:4</a>), to become sanctified by yielding our hearts unto God (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.35" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 3:35</a>), and to obtain “the mind of Christ” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.16" class="scriptureRef">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>).</p>

Repenting of our sins and seeking forgiveness are spiritually necessary, and we must always do so. But remission of sin is not the only or even the ultimate purpose of the gospel. To have our hearts changed by the Holy Spirit such that “we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>), as did King Benjamin’s people, is the covenant responsibility we have accepted. This mighty change is not simply the result of working harder or developing greater individual discipline. Rather, it is the consequence of a fundamental change in our desires, our motives, and our natures made possible through the Atonement of Christ the Lord. Our spiritual purpose is to overcome both sin and the desire to sin, both the taint and the tyranny of sin.</p>

Hearts are purified as we receive His strengthening power to do good and become better. All of our worthy desires and good works, as necessary as they are, can never produce clean hands and a pure heart. It is the Atonement of Jesus Christ that provides both a <span class="emphasis">cleansing and redeeming power</span> that helps us to overcome sin and a <span class="emphasis">sanctifying and strengthening power</span> that helps us to become better than we ever could by relying only upon our own strength.

I suspect those members of the ancient Church were ordinary men and women just like you and me. These individuals could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence, and they “were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/13.12" class="scriptureRef">v. 12</a>).

As we speak of prayer, I emphasize the word <span class="emphasis">meaningful.</span> Simply saying prayers is quite a different thing from engaging in meaningful prayer. I expect that all of us already know that prayer is essential for our spiritual development and protection. But what we know is not always reflected in what we do. And even though we recognize the importance of prayer, all of us can improve the consistency and efficacy of our personal and family prayers.</p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “faith [is] the first principle in revealed religion, and the foundation of all righteousness” and that it is also “the principle of action in all intelligent beings” (<span class="emphasis">Lectures on Faith</span> [1985], 1). Action alone is not faith in the Savior, but acting in accordance with correct principles is a central component of faith. Thus, “faith without works is dead” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/2.20" class="scriptureRef">James 2:20</a>).</p>

Thus, faith in Christ leads to righteous action, which increases our spiritual capacity and power. Understanding that faith is a principle of action and of power inspires us to exercise our moral agency in compliance with gospel truth, invites the redeeming and strengthening <span class="emphasis">powers</span> of the Savior’s Atonement into our lives, and enlarges the <span class="emphasis">power</span> within us whereby we are agents unto ourselves (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 58:28</a>).</p>

Blessings require some effort on our part before we can obtain them, and prayer, as “a form of work, … is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings” (Bible Dictionary, “Prayer,” 753). We press forward and persevere in the consecrated work of prayer, after we say “amen,” by acting upon the things we have expressed to Heavenly Father.</p>

And a common element in many of our prayers is a request that the missionaries will be led to individuals and families who are prepared to receive the message of the Restoration. But ultimately it is my responsibility and your responsibility to find people for the missionaries to teach. Missionaries are full-time teachers; you and I are full-time finders. And you and I as lifelong missionaries should not be praying for the full-time missionaries to do our work!</p>

A few years ago a family traveled to Europe from the United States. Shortly after arriving at their destination, a 13-year-old son became quite ill. The mother and father initially thought his upset stomach was caused by fatigue from the long flight, and the family routinely continued on its journey.</p>

She knew that merely waiting for the anticipated blessing would not be enough; they needed to continue to act. Explaining that the blessing he had received was still in effect, she suggested again petitioning in prayer, as did the ancient Apostles, “Lord, Increase our faith” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/17.5" class="scriptureRef">Luke 17:5</a>). The prayer included a profession of trust in priesthood power and a commitment to persevere in doing whatever might be required for the blessing to be honored—if that blessing at that time was in accordance with God’s will. Shortly after they offered this simple prayer, the son’s condition improved.</p>

Just as the prison holding Alma and Amulek did not tumble to the earth “until after their faith,” and just as Ammon and his missionary brethren did not witness mighty miracles in their ministries “until after their faith” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.12-15" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:12–15</a>), so the healing of this 13-year-old boy did not occur <span class="emphasis">until after their faith</span> and was accomplished “according to their faith in their prayers” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.47" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 10:47</a>).</p>

Several years ago there was a young father who had been active in the Church as a boy but had chosen a different path during his teenage years. After serving in the military, he married a lovely girl, and soon children blessed their home.</p>

In desperation and for the first time in many years, the father was found on his knees in prayer, asking that the life of his daughter be spared. Yet her condition worsened. Gradually, this father sensed that his little girl would not live, and slowly his prayers changed; he no longer prayed for healing but rather for understanding. “Let Thy will be done” was now the manner of his pleadings.</p>

Fortified with understanding, trust, and power beyond their own, the young parents prayed again, asking for the opportunity to hold her close once more while she was awake. The daughter’s eyes opened, and her frail arms reached out to her parents for one final embrace. And then she was gone. This father knew their prayers had been answered—a kind, compassionate Father in Heaven had comforted their hearts. God’s will had been done, and they had gained understanding. (Adapted from H. Burke Peterson, “Adversity and Prayer,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Jan. 1974, 18.)</p>

Humble, earnest, and persistent prayer enables us to recognize and align ourselves with the will of our Heavenly Father. And in this the Savior provided the perfect example as He prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, “saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. … And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.42,44" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:42, 44</a>).</p>

Every sincere prayer is heard and answered by our Heavenly Father, but the answers we receive may not be what we expect or come to us when we want or in the way we anticipate. This truth is evident in the three examples I have presented today.</p>

In a similar way, meaningful morning prayer is an important element in the spiritual creation of each day—and precedes the temporal creation or the actual execution of the day. Just as the temporal creation was linked to and a continuation of the spiritual creation, so meaningful morning and evening prayers are linked to and are a continuation of each other.</p>

As I invited my wife to offer the prayer, the member of the Twelve, unaware of the tragedy, graciously suggested that in the prayer Sister Bednar express only appreciation for blessings received and ask for nothing. His counsel was similar to Alma’s instruction to the members of the ancient Church “to pray without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26.39" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 26:39</a>).

Also, they do not multiply many words, for it is given unto them what they should pray, and they are filled with desire (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19.24" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 19:24</a>).

Consequently, Lehi rejoiced, and his whole heart was filled because of the things which the Lord had shown him (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1.15" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 1:15</a>). Please note that the vision came in response to a prayer for others and not as a result of a request for personal edification or guidance.</p>

If I were called today to serve as a stake president, my primary focus would be on worthiness to receive and honor temple covenants. I would strive to make temple preparation the center of all that we did. I would do a better job of shepherding the Saints to the house of the Lord.”</p>

We pledge to always remember the Savior and to keep His commandments as preparation to participate in the sacred ordinances of the temple and receive the highest blessings available through the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, in the ordinances of the holy temple we more completely and fully take upon us the name of Jesus Christ.</p>

Our testimony of gospel truth should be reflected both in our words and in our deeds. And our testimonies are proclaimed and lived most powerfully in our own homes.

And with active, rambunctious boys, family home evening lessons did not always produce high levels of edification.

The commandment “Thou shalt not bear false witness” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.16" class="scriptureRef">Exodus 20:16</a>) applies most pointedly to the hypocrite in each of us. We need to be and become more consistent. “But be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Timothy 4:12</a>).</p>

On the side of the road, an electronic sign displayed a timely warning: “Standing Water Ahead.” The surface on which I was driving appeared to be quite safe. But this vital information enabled me to prepare for a potential hazard I had not expected and could not yet see. As I continued toward my destination, I slowed down and watched carefully for additional signs of danger.</p>

For example, a fever can be a first symptom of sickness or disease. Various financial and labor market indicators are used to forecast future trends in local and national economies. And depending upon the area of the world in which we live, we may receive flood, avalanche, hurricane, tsunami, tornado, or winter storm warnings.</p>

This early warning system applies to children of all ages and contains three basic components: (1) reading and talking about the Book of Mormon with your children, (2) bearing testimony of gospel truths spontaneously with your children, and (3) inviting children as gospel learners to act and not merely be acted upon. Parents who do these things faithfully will be blessed to recognize early signals of spiritual growth in or challenges with their children and be better prepared to receive inspiration to strengthen and help those children.</p>

Nelson, “A Testimony of the Book of Mormon,” <span class="emphasis">Liahona,</span> Jan. 2000, 84; <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1999, 70). Indeed, the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion.</p>

Nephi declared, “My soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may learn” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.4" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 25:4</a>). The root word <span class="emphasis">plain</span> in this verse does not refer to things that are ordinary or simple; rather, it denotes instruction that is clear and easily understood.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/watching-with-all-perseverance.p11" pid="4CITJNSCwkC1fw-8XkDeUg" hash="HvFUUw">The Book of Mormon is the most correct of any book on earth because it centers upon the Truth (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.6" class="scriptureRef">John 14:6</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.40" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 13:40</a>), even Jesus Christ, and restores the plain and precious things that have been taken away from the true gospel (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.26,28-29,32,34-35,40" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 13:26, 28–29, 32, 34–35, 40</a>). The unique combination of these two factors—a focus on the Savior and the plainness of the teachings—powerfully invites the confirming witness of the third member of the Godhead, even the Holy Ghost. Consequently, the Book of Mormon speaks to the spirit and to the heart of the reader like no other volume of scripture.</p>

Regular reading of and talking about the Book of Mormon invite the power to resist temptation and to produce feelings of love within our families. And discussions about the doctrines and principles in the Book of Mormon provide opportunities for parents to observe their children, to listen to them, to learn from them, and to teach them.</p>

          <span class="pageBreak" page-number="42"></span>Youth of all ages, even infants, can and do respond to the distinctive spirit of the Book of Mormon. Children may not understand all of the words and stories, but they certainly can feel the “familiar spirit” described by Isaiah (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/29.4" class="scriptureRef">Isaiah 29:4</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.16" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 26:16</a>). And the questions a child asks, the observations a child shares, and the discussions that occur provide crucial spiritual early warning signals. Importantly, such conversations can help parents to discern what their children are learning, thinking, and feeling about the truths contained in this sacred volume of scripture, as well as the difficulties they may be facing.</p>

Seeking for and obtaining these blessings require a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 10:4</a>). A personal testimony also brings responsibility and accountability.</p>

Such occasions need not be programmed, scheduled, or scripted. In fact, the less regimented such testimony sharing is, the greater the likelihood for edification and lasting impact. “Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.85" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 84:85</a>).</p>

And a testimony need not always begin with the phrase “I bear you my testimony.” Our witness can be declared as simply as “I know I was blessed with inspiration at work today” or “The truth in this scripture always has been a powerful source of direction for me.” Similar opportunities to bear testimony also can arise while traveling together in a car or bus or in a multitude of other settings.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/watching-with-all-perseverance.p18" pid="VJbDET-AWEuowohNGlZlwQ" hash="-uURSA">The reactions of children to such impromptu testimony bearing and their eagerness or reluctance to participate are potent sources of spiritual early warning signals. A child’s expression about a lesson learned in family scripture study or a candid statement of concern about a gospel principle or practice can be most illuminating and help parents better understand a child’s specific question or needs. Such discussions—especially when parents are as eager to listen intently as they are to talk—can foster a supportive and secure environment in the home and encourage ongoing communication about difficult topics.</p>

        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2010/04/watching-with-all-perseverance.p20" pid="g4gHIf8iOk68WQ2lmj9Asw" hash="Siaoxw">As gospel learners, we should be “doers of the word, and not hearers only” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.22" class="scriptureRef">James 1:22</a>). Our hearts are opened to the influence of the Holy Ghost as we properly exercise agency and act in accordance with correct principles—and we thereby invite His teaching and testifying power. Parents have the sacred responsibility to help children to act and to seek learning by faith. And a child is never too young to take part in this pattern of learning.</p>

Teaching a man to fish feeds him for a lifetime. As parents and gospel instructors, you and I are not in the business of distributing fish; rather, our work is to help our children learn “to fish” and to become <span class="pageBreak" page-number="43"></span>spiritually steadfast. This vital objective is best accomplished as we encourage our children to act in accordance with correct principles—as we help them to learn by doing. “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/7.17" class="scriptureRef">John 7:17</a>). Such learning requires spiritual, mental, and physical exertion and not just passive reception.</p>

Imagine, for example, a family home evening in which children are invited and expected to come prepared to ask questions about what they are reading and learning in the Book of Mormon—or about an issue that recently was emphasized in a gospel discussion or spontaneous testimony in the home. And imagine further that the children ask questions the parents are not prepared adequately to answer. Some parents might be apprehensive about such an unstructured approach to home evening. But the best family home evenings are not necessarily the product of preprepared, purchased, or downloaded packets of outlines and visual aids. What a glorious opportunity for family members to search the scriptures together and to be tutored by the Holy Ghost. “For the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; … and they did all labor, every man according to his strength” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.26" class="scriptureRef">Alma 1:26</a>).</p>

Are we as parents primarily giving our children the equivalent of spiritual fish to eat, or are we consistently helping them to act, to learn for themselves, and to stand steadfast and immovable? Are we helping our children become anxiously engaged in asking, seeking, and knocking? (See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/14.7" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 14:7</a>.)</p>

The tuition of diligence and of learning by study and also by faith must be paid to obtain and personally “own” such knowledge. Only in this way can what is known in the mind also be felt in the heart. Only in this way can a child move beyond relying upon the spiritual knowledge and experiences of parents and adults and claim those blessings for himself or herself. Only in this way can our children be prepared spiritually for the challenges of mortality.</p>

Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.33" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:33</a>).</p>

I get the hint.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p3" pid="8bujwVh-ZkK1bVpEeBd-Nw" hash="0TQk9Q">The first experience occurred as we entered a dark room and turned on a light switch. Remember how in an instant a bright flood of illumination filled the room and caused the darkness to disappear. What previously had been unseen and uncertain became clear and recognizable. This experience was characterized by immediate and intense recognition of light.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p4" pid="5n7umST56kmLgWlwilMAOw" hash="qMJpeA">The second experience took place as we watched night turn into morning. Do you recall the slow and almost imperceptible increase in light on the horizon? In contrast to turning on a light in a dark room, the light from the rising sun did not immediately burst forth. Rather, gradually and steadily the intensity of the light increased, and the darkness of night was replaced by the radiance of morning. Eventually, the sun did dawn over the skyline. But the visual evidence of the sun’s impending arrival was apparent hours before the sun actually appeared over the horizon. This experience was characterized by subtle and gradual discernment of light.</p>

I pray the Holy Ghost will inspire and instruct us as we now focus upon the spirit of revelation and basic patterns whereby revelation is received.</p>

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “The Holy Ghost is a revelator,” and “no man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelations” (<span class="emphasis">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith </span>[2007], 132).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p7" pid="K97gAROAVE6PrRIbBaqecw" hash="GVTPyg">The spirit of revelation is available to every person who receives by proper priesthood authority the saving ordinances of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost—and who is acting in faith to fulfill the priesthood injunction to “receive the Holy Ghost.” This blessing is not restricted to the presiding authorities of the Church; rather, it belongs to and should be operative in the life of every man, woman, and child who reaches the age of accountability and enters into sacred covenants. Sincere desire and worthiness invite the spirit of revelation into our lives.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p8" pid="XAl322WU606ycWUXcxcF4w" hash="1ZZIPw">Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery gained valuable experience with the spirit of revelation as they translated the Book of Mormon. These brethren learned they could receive whatever knowledge was necessary to complete their work if they asked in faith, with an honest heart, believing they would receive. And over time they increasingly understood the spirit of revelation typically functions as thoughts and feelings that come into our minds and hearts by the power of the Holy Ghost. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.1-2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 8:1–2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/100.5-8" class="scriptureRef">100:5–8</a>.) As the Lord instructed them: “Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground. Therefore this is thy gift; apply unto it” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.3-4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 8:3–4</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p9" pid="9i7GyAgqPUaav6Vyuw528w" hash="-yaUvw">I emphasize the phrase “apply unto it” in relation to the spirit of revelation. In the scriptures, the influence of the Holy Ghost frequently is described as “a still small voice” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.12" class="scriptureRef">1 Kings 19:12</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.45" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 17:45</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.3" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 11:3</a>) and a “voice of perfect mildness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.30" class="scriptureRef">Helaman 5:30</a>). Because the Spirit whispers to us gently and delicately, it is easy to understand why we should shun inappropriate media, pornography, and harmful, addictive substances and behaviors. These tools of the adversary can impair and eventually destroy our capacity to recognize and respond to the subtle messages from God delivered by the power of His Spirit. Each of us should consider seriously and ponder prayerfully how we can reject the devil’s enticements and righteously “apply unto it,” even the spirit of revelation, in our personal lives and families.</p>

Some revelations are received immediately and intensely; some are recognized gradually and subtly. The two experiences with light I described help us to better understand these two basic patterns of revelation.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p11" pid="htzjF7iHfkG3FgNSiUS5bA" hash="vfxk2Q">A light turned on in a dark room is like receiving a message from God quickly, completely, and all at once. Many of us have experienced this pattern of revelation as we have been given answers to sincere prayers or been provided with needed direction or protection, according to God’s will and timing. Descriptions of such immediate and intense manifestations are found in the scriptures, recounted in Church history, and evidenced in our own lives. Indeed, these mighty miracles do occur. However, this pattern of revelation tends to be more rare than common.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p12" pid="C8hEevxbA0SeBk1vy2Vc_g" hash="6Bqocw">The gradual increase of light radiating from the rising sun is like receiving a message from God “line upon line, precept upon precept” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 28:30</a>). Most frequently, revelation comes in small increments over time and is granted according to our desire, worthiness, and preparation. Such communications from Heavenly Father gradually and gently “distil upon [our souls] as the dews from heaven” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>). This pattern of revelation tends to be more common than rare and is evident in the experiences of Nephi as he tried several different approaches before successfully obtaining the plates of brass from Laban (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?span=3-4" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 3–4</a>). Ultimately, he was led by the Spirit to Jerusalem, “not knowing beforehand the things which [he] should do” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.6" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 4:6</a>). And he did not learn how to build a ship of curious workmanship all at one time; rather, Nephi was shown by the Lord “from time to time after what manner [he] should work the timbers of the ship” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.1" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 18:1</a>).</p>

These priceless treasures were revealed as circumstances warranted and as the timing was right.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p14" pid="ju4md-kYwUeqqVVZDY46dg" hash="yTeWTQ">President Joseph F. Smith explained how this pattern of revelation occurred in his life: “As a boy … I would frequently … ask the Lord to show me some marvelous thing, in order that I might receive a testimony. But the Lord withheld marvels from me, and showed me the truth, line upon line … , until He made me to know the truth from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, and until doubt and fear had been absolutely purged from me. He did not have to send an angel from the heavens to do this, nor did He have to speak with the trump of an archangel. By the whisperings of the still small voice of the spirit of the living God, He gave to me the testimony I possess. And by this principle and power He will give to all the children of men a knowledge of the truth that will stay with them, and it will make them to know the truth, as God knows it, and to do the will of the Father as Christ does it. And no amount of marvelous manifestations will ever accomplish this” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1900, 40–41).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p15" pid="2Rj_B7F8AkSErfhDhKcsoA" hash="bB7fGA">We as members of the Church tend to emphasize marvelous and dramatic spiritual manifestations so much that we may fail to appreciate and may even overlook the customary pattern by which the Holy Ghost accomplishes His work. The very “simpleness of the way” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.41" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 17:41</a>) of receiving small and incremental spiritual impressions that over time and in totality constitute a desired answer or the direction we need may cause us to look “beyond the mark” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4.14" class="scriptureRef">Jacob 4:14</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p16" pid="iVBA8tfHn0-gdfEkxU21Iw" hash="PEbA5A">I have talked with many individuals who question the strength of their personal testimony and underestimate their spiritual capacity because they do not receive frequent, miraculous, or strong impressions. Perhaps as we consider the experiences of Joseph in the Sacred Grove, of Saul on the road to Damascus, and of Alma the Younger, we come to believe something is wrong with or lacking in us if we fall short in our lives of these well-known and spiritually striking examples. If you have had similar thoughts or doubts, please know that you are quite normal. Just keep pressing forward obediently and with faith in the Savior. As you do so, you “cannot go amiss” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/80.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 80:3</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p17" pid="n4XysH97xky-F2J52mQBuQ" hash="H7m1jg">President Joseph F. Smith counseled: “Show me Latter-day Saints who have to feed upon miracles, signs and visions in order to keep them steadfast in the Church, and I will show you members … who are not in good standing before God, and who are walking in slippery paths. It is not by marvelous manifestations unto us that we shall be established in the truth, but it is by humility and faithful obedience to the commandments and laws of God” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1900, 40).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p18" pid="lrUgrCCDOk2IqE-HEggfSg" hash="ZKCE4g">Another common experience with light helps us learn an additional truth about the “line upon line, precept upon precept” pattern of revelation. Sometimes the sun rises on a morning that is cloudy or foggy. Because of the overcast conditions, perceiving the light is more difficult, and identifying the precise moment when the sun rises over the horizon is not possible. But on such a morning we nonetheless have sufficient light to recognize a new day and to conduct our affairs.</p>

An important episode from Church history illustrates this principle.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p20" pid="pujZM_UsHE6dkN96ZoUPCw" hash="hn9rVA">In the spring of 1829, Oliver Cowdery was a schoolteacher in Palmyra, New York. As he learned about Joseph Smith and the work of translating the Book of Mormon, Oliver felt impressed to offer his assistance to the young prophet. Consequently, he traveled to Harmony, Pennsylvania, and became Joseph’s scribe. The timing of his arrival and the help he provided were vital to the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p21" pid="eyntt2MhckuG_i3djIFQXw" hash="mPN73A">The Savior subsequently revealed to Oliver that as often as he had prayed for guidance, he had received direction from the Spirit of the Lord. “If it had not been so,” the Lord declared, “thou wouldst not have come to the place where thou art at this time. Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind; and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.14-15" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 6:14–15</a>).</p>

Apparently Oliver had not recognized how and when he had been receiving direction from God and needed this instruction to increase his understanding about the spirit of revelation. In essence, Oliver had been walking in the light as the sun was rising on a cloudy morning.</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p23" pid="D05jLQIz2UaZRNfrAnNDHw" hash="LMG3Ew">In many of the uncertainties and challenges we encounter in our lives, God requires us to do our best, to act and not be acted upon (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.26" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 2:26</a>), and to trust in Him. We may not see angels, hear heavenly voices, or receive overwhelming spiritual impressions. We frequently may press forward hoping and praying—but without absolute assurance—that we are acting in accordance with God’s will. But as we honor our covenants and keep the commandments, as we strive ever more consistently to do good and to become better, we can walk with the confidence that God will guide our steps. And we can speak with the assurance that God will inspire our utterances. This is in part the meaning of the scripture that declares, “Then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 121:45</a>).</p>
        <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2011/04/the-spirit-of-revelation.p24" pid="qTLbDuh2skafJHkoZVyHPg" hash="oeFazw">As you appropriately seek for and apply unto the spirit of revelation, I promise you will “walk in the light of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/2.5" class="scriptureRef">Isaiah 2:5</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/12.5" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 12:5</a>). Sometimes the spirit of revelation will operate immediately and intensely, other times subtly and gradually, and often so delicately you may not even consciously recognize it. But regardless of the pattern whereby this blessing is received, the light it provides will illuminate and enlarge your soul, enlighten your understanding (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.7" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:7</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28" class="scriptureRef">32:28</a>), and direct and protect you and your family.</p>

This majestic vision ushered in “the dispensation of the fulness of times” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/1.10" class="scriptureRef">Ephesians 1:10</a>) and is one of the signal events in the history of the world.</p>

A personage appeared at his bedside, called the young boy by name, and declared “he was a messenger sent from the presence of God … and that his name was Moroni” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.33" class="scriptureRef">verse 33</a>). He instructed Joseph about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.

Thus, the introductory events of the Restoration revealed a correct understanding of the Godhead, emphasized the importance of the Book of Mormon, and anticipated the work of salvation and exaltation for both the living and the dead. This inspiring sequence is instructive about the spiritual matters of highest priority to Deity.</p>

My mom was a descendant of pioneers who sacrificed everything for the Church and kingdom of God. My dad was not a member of our Church and, as a young man, had desired to become a Catholic priest.

We had just returned home from attending our Sunday meetings together, and I asked my dad when he was going to be baptized. He smiled and said, “You are the one always asking me about being baptized.

Then he said, “Here is my question. Each week in priesthood meeting I listen to the bishop and the other priesthood leaders remind, beg, and plead with the men to do their home teaching and to perform their priesthood duties. If your church truly has the restored priesthood of God, why are so many of the men in your church no different about doing their religious duty than the men in my church?” My young mind immediately went completely blank.

Men who hold the priesthood are not inherently better than other men, but they should act differently. Men who hold the priesthood should not only receive priesthood authority but also become worthy and faithful conduits of God’s power. “Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.42" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 38:42</a>).</p>

Amaleki, a descendant of Jacob, declared: “I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/omni/1.26" class="scriptureRef">Omni 1:26</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/converted-unto-the-lord.p24" pid="4-o7BqfNLEOF1LILDlrkTQ" hash="AlZ9sw">Knowing by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ is important and necessary. But earnestly coming unto Him and giving our whole souls as an offering requires much more than merely knowing. Conversion requires all of our heart, all of our might, and all of our mind and strength (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 4:2</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2012/10/converted-unto-the-lord.p25" pid="DxeF_5p5g0auj9Ncic79RQ" hash="7x0x1w">King Benjamin’s people responded to his teaching by exclaiming, “Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>). Accepting the words spoken, gaining a testimony of their truthfulness, and exercising faith in Christ produced a mighty change of heart and a firm determination to improve and become better.</p>

Clearly, these faithful souls had become deeply devoted to the Lord and His teachings.</p>

Ten virgins, five who were wise and five who were foolish, took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Please think of the lamps used by the virgins as the lamps of testimony. The foolish virgins took their lamps of testimony but took no oil with them. Consider the oil to be the oil of conversion.</p>

Such relations are not merely a curiosity to be explored, an appetite to be satisfied, or a type of recreation or entertainment to be pursued selfishly. They are not a conquest to be achieved or simply an act to be performed. Rather, they are in mortality one of the ultimate expressions of our divine nature and potential and a way of strengthening emotional and spiritual bonds between husband and wife. We are agents blessed with moral agency and are defined by our divine heritage as children of God—and not by sexual behaviors, contemporary attitudes, or secular philosophies.</p>

As Jesus emphasized to the Apostle Peter, “The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.41" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 26:41</a>).</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/04/we-believe-in-being-chaste.p23" pid="B-Ex4GEC8UqDJ_ApnhiwWg" hash="7OWdcg">The precise nature of the test of mortality, then, can be summarized in the following question: Will I respond to the inclinations of the natural man, or will I yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit and put off the natural man and become a saint through the Atonement of Christ the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 3:19</a>)? That is the test. Every appetite, desire, propensity, and impulse of the natural man may be overcome by and through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. We are here on the earth to develop godlike qualities and to bridle all of the passions of the flesh.</p>

Heavenly Father desires us to be together in the light and filled with hope. In contrast, Lucifer labors to make the sons and daughters of God confused and unhappy and to hinder their eternal progression. The overarching intent of the father of lies is that all of us would become “miserable like unto himself” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 2:27</a>). Lucifer wants us ultimately to be alone in the dark and without hope.</p>

He does not have a body, and his eternal progress has been halted. Just as water flowing in a riverbed is stopped by a dam, so the adversary’s eternal progress is thwarted because he does not have a physical body. Because of his rebellion, Lucifer has denied himself all of the mortal blessings and experiences made possible through a body of flesh and bones. He cannot learn the lessons that only an embodied spirit can learn. He resents the reality of a literal and universal resurrection of all mankind. One of the potent scriptural meanings of the word <span class="emphasis">damned</span> is illustrated in his inability to continue developing and becoming like our Heavenly Father.</p>

One of the ultimate ironies of eternity is that the adversary, who is miserable precisely because he has no physical body, entices us to share in his misery through the improper use of our bodies. The very tool he does not have is thus the primary target of his attempts to lure us to spiritual destruction.</p>

To those who know and understand the plan of salvation, defiling the body is an act of rebellion (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.36-37" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:36–37</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.34-35" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 64:34–35</a>) and a denial of our true identity as sons and daughters of God. As we look beyond mortality and into eternity, it is easy to discern that the counterfeit companionship advocated by the adversary is temporary and empty.</p>

The Savior is often referred to as the Great Physician, and this title has both symbolic and literal significance. All of us have experienced the pain associated with a physical injury or wound. When we are in pain, we typically seek relief and are grateful for the medication and treatments that help to alleviate our suffering. Consider sin as a spiritual wound that causes guilt or, as described by Alma to his son Corianton, “remorse of conscience” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 42:18</a>). Guilt is to our spirit what pain is to our body—a warning of danger and a protection from additional damage. From the Atonement of the Savior flows the soothing salve that can heal our spiritual wounds and remove guilt. However, this salve can only be applied through the principles of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, and consistent obedience. The results of sincere repentance are peace of conscience, comfort, and spiritual healing and renewal.</p>

The first lesson focuses upon the blessings that come to individuals and families as they faithfully obey this commandment.

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p7" pid="3cmZSQ4A80aJgpYg7olcLw" hash="FBTDtA">Sister Bednar’s mother is a faithful woman and an inspired homemaker. From the earliest days of her marriage, she carefully has kept the household financial records. For decades she has accounted conscientiously for the family income and expenditures using very simple ledgers. The information she has collected over the years is comprehensive and informative.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p8" pid="vINw2Xft6kKj1Sxp_-bcuw" hash="dlTCyw">When Sister Bednar was a young woman, her mother used the data in the ledgers to emphasize basic principles of provident living and prudent home management. One day as they reviewed together various categories of expenses, her mother noted an interesting pattern. The costs for doctor visits and medicines for their family were far lower than might have been expected. She then related this finding to the gospel of Jesus Christ and explained to her daughter a powerful truth: as we live the law of tithing, we often receive significant but subtle blessings that are not always what we expect and easily can be overlooked. The family had not received any sudden or obvious additions to the household income. Instead, a loving Heavenly Father had bestowed simple blessings in seemingly ordinary ways. Sister Bednar always has remembered this important lesson from her mother about the help that comes to us through the windows of heaven, as promised by Malachi in the Old Testament (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10" class="scriptureRef">Malachi 3:10</a>).</p>
			</span>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p9" pid="zLW6raB_BEiBR8MoBdlSZA" hash="qPvszw">Often as we teach and testify about the law of tithing, we emphasize the immediate, dramatic, and readily recognizable temporal blessings that we receive. And surely such blessings do occur. Yet some of the diverse blessings we obtain as we are obedient to this commandment are significant but subtle. Such blessings <span class="pageBreak" page-number="18"></span>can be discerned only if we are both spiritually attentive and observant (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.14" class="scriptureRef">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p10" pid="uqr95OG8p0uMQxetcw_X8Q" hash="YmBCZg">The imagery of the “windows” of heaven used by Malachi is most instructive. Windows allow natural light to enter into a building. In like manner, spiritual illumination and perspective are poured out through the windows of heaven and into our lives as we honor the law of tithing.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p11" pid="AQt3Hf7b3UCyZvL1kaWDsg" hash="Ip1BRA">For example, a subtle but significant blessing we receive is the spiritual gift of gratitude that enables our appreciation for what we have to constrain desires for what we want. A grateful person is rich in contentment. An ungrateful person suffers in the poverty of endless discontentment (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/12.15" class="scriptureRef">Luke 12:15</a>).</p>

Eyes and ears of faith (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.19" class="scriptureRef">Ether 12:19</a>) are needed, however, to recognize the spiritual gift of enhanced discernment that can empower us to identify job opportunities that many other people might overlook—or the blessing of greater personal determination to search harder and longer for a position than other people may be able or willing to do. We might want and expect a job offer, but the blessing that comes to us through heavenly windows may be greater capacity to act and change our own circumstances rather than expecting our circumstances to be changed by someone or something else.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p13" pid="y2u8_4p9P0KdZFkVV9Pk4w" hash="fRkGdQ">We may appropriately desire and work to receive a pay raise in our employment to better provide the necessities of life. Eyes and ears of faith are required, however, to notice in us an increased spiritual and temporal capacity (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/2.52" class="scriptureRef">Luke 2:52</a>) to do more with less, a keener ability to prioritize and simplify, and an enhanced ability to take proper care of the material possessions we already have acquired. We might want and expect a larger paycheck, but the blessing that comes to us through heavenly windows may be greater capacity to change our own circumstances rather than expecting our circumstances to be changed by someone or something else.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p14" pid="IiBSDPdSIUSRtF5co_TYBg" hash="k2Y2Vg">The stripling warriors in the Book of Mormon (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/53" class="scriptureRef">Alma 53</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?span=56-58" class="scriptureRef">56–58</a>) prayed earnestly that God would strengthen and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies. Interestingly, the answers to these prayers did not produce additional weapons or an increased number of troops. Instead, God granted these faithful warriors assurance that He would deliver them, peace to their souls, and great faith and hope for their deliverance in Him (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/58.11" class="scriptureRef">Alma 58:11</a>). Thus, the sons of Helaman did take courage, were fixed with a determination to conquer, and did go forth with all of their might against the Lamanites (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/58.12-13" class="scriptureRef">Alma 58:12–13</a>). Assurance, peace, faith, and hope initially might not seem like the blessings warriors in battle might want, but they were precisely the blessings these valiant young men needed to press forward and prevail physically and spiritually.</p>

We might plead for prosperity, and we receive enlarged perspective and increased patience, or we petition for growth and are blessed with the gift of grace. He may bestow upon us conviction and confidence as we strive to achieve worthy goals. And when we plead for relief from physical, mental, and spiritual difficulties, He may increase our resolve and resilience.</p>

We also will remember the Lord’s declaration:</p>

The Council on the Disposition of the Tithes was established by revelation and consists of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Presiding Bishopric (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/120" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 120</a>). As I prepared in December of 2004 to attend my first meeting of this council, I eagerly anticipated a most remarkable learning opportunity.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p22" pid="UnJbjxuIh0SydkWOQhcBYg" hash="KDL94Q">I still remember the things I experienced and felt in that council. I gained a greater appreciation and reverence for the Lord’s laws of finance for individuals, for families, and for His Church. The basic financial program of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—for both income and disbursement—is defined in sections 119 and 120 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Two statements found in these revelations provide the foundation for the fiscal affairs of the Church.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p23" pid="-upn5gZOBUyzNZDlGAHwjQ" hash="k0haww">Section 119 simply states that all members “shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, … saith the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/119.4" class="scriptureRef">verse 4</a>).</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p24" pid="spwDXYeGRkCl9B5BVacFtw" hash="KCk5Gg">Then, concerning the authorized disbursement of the tithes, the Lord said, “It shall be disposed of by a council, composed of the First Presidency of my Church, and of the bishop and his council, and by my high council; and by mine own voice unto them, saith the Lord” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/120.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 120:1</a>). The “bishop and his council” and “my high council” referred to in this revelation are known today as the Presiding Bishopric and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, respectively. These sacred funds are used in a rapidly growing church to spiritually bless individuals and families by constructing and maintaining temples and houses of worship, supporting missionary work, translating and publishing scriptures, fostering family history research, funding schools and religious education, and accomplishing many other Church purposes as directed by the Lord’s ordained servants.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p25" pid="TIbJGJmdsECVlxqsxyEltg" hash="Qp5DNg">I marvel at the clarity and brevity of these two revelations in comparison to the complicated financial guidelines and administrative procedures used in so many organizations and governments around the world. How can the temporal affairs of an organization as large as the restored Church of Jesus Christ possibly operate throughout the entire world using such succinct instructions? To me the answer is quite straightforward: this is the Lord’s work, He is able to do His own work (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.20" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 27:20</a>), and the Savior inspires and directs His servants as they apply His directions and labor in His cause.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p26" pid="RUES71m2pEyr2jUnzuGJXA" hash="NsJbHQ">In that first council meeting I was impressed by the simplicity of the principles that guided our deliberations and decisions. In the financial operations of the Church, two basic and fixed principles are observed. First, the Church lives within its means and does not spend more than it receives. Second, <span class="pageBreak" page-number="20"></span>a portion of the annual income is set aside as a reserve for contingencies and unanticipated needs. For decades the Church has taught its membership the principle of setting aside additional food, fuel, and money to take care of emergencies that might arise. The Church as an institution simply follows the same principles that are taught repeatedly to the members.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2013/10/the-windows-of-heaven.p27" pid="nNNsSV3QfkWVgxCD9L7tLw" hash="J8cDzw">As the meeting progressed, I found myself wishing that all members of the Church could observe the simplicity, the clarity, the orderliness, the charity, and the power of the Lord’s own way (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104.16" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 104:16</a>) for conducting the temporal affairs of His Church. I have now participated in the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes for many years. My gratitude and reverence for the Lord’s pattern has grown each year, and the lessons learned have become even more profound.</p>

As I travel the earth, I learn about your hopes and dreams, your varied living conditions and circumstances, and your struggles. I have attended Church meetings with you and visited in some of your homes. Your faith strengthens my faith. Your devotion makes me more devoted. And your goodness and willing obedience to the law of tithing inspires me to be a better man, husband, father, and Church leader. I remember and think of you each time I participate in the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes. Thank you for your goodness and faithfulness as you honor your covenants.</p>

				<span class="pageBreak" page-number="87"></span>I have a dear friend who, in the early years of his marriage, was convinced he and his family needed a four-wheel-drive pickup truck. His wife was sure that he did not need but merely wanted the new vehicle. A playful conversation between this husband and wife initiated their consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of such a purchase.</p>

Shortly after taking possession of the new vehicle, my friend wanted to demonstrate the utility of the truck and validate his reasons for wanting to purchase it. So he decided he would cut and haul a supply of firewood for their home. It was in the autumn of the year, and snow already had fallen in the mountains where he intended to find wood. As he drove up the mountainside, the snow gradually became deeper and deeper. My friend recognized the slick road conditions presented a risk, but with great confidence in the new truck, he kept going.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p11" pid="-olJbrWwCkm-kVKGJrpJcg" hash="B0rChA">Sadly, my friend went too far along the snowy road. As he steered the truck off of the road at the place he had determined to cut wood, he got stuck. All four of the wheels on the new truck spun in the snow. He readily recognized that he did not know what to do to extricate himself from this dangerous situation. He was embarrassed and worried.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/04/bear-up-their-burdens-with-ease.p12" pid="UaAVsu2rNEqIWgN2rvbACQ" hash="jdOo1w">My friend decided, “Well, I will not just sit here.” He climbed out of the vehicle and started cutting wood. He completely filled the back of the truck with the heavy load. And then my friend determined he would try driving out of the snow one more time. As he put the pickup into gear and applied power, he started to inch forward. Slowly the truck moved out of the snow and back onto the road. He finally was free to go home, a happy and humbled man.</p>

It was the load that enabled him to return to his family and his home.</p>

Our individual load is comprised of demands and opportunities, obligations and privileges, afflictions and blessings, and options and <span class="pageBreak" page-number="88"></span>constraints. Two guiding questions can be helpful as we periodically and prayerfully assess our load: “Is the load I am carrying producing the spiritual traction that will enable me to press forward with faith in Christ on the strait and narrow path and avoid getting stuck? Is the load I am carrying creating sufficient spiritual traction so I ultimately can return home to Heavenly Father?”</p>

But bearing a load is a necessary and essential part of the plan of happiness. Because our individual load needs to generate spiritual traction, we should be careful to not haul around in our lives so many nice but unnecessary things that we are distracted and diverted from the things that truly matter most.</p>

Most of us know that when we do things wrong and need help to overcome the effects of sin in our lives, the Savior has made it possible for us to become clean through His redeeming power. But do we also understand that the Atonement is for faithful men and women who are obedient, worthy, and conscientious and who are striving to become better and serve more faithfully? I wonder if we fail to fully acknowledge this strengthening aspect of the Atonement in our lives and mistakenly believe we must carry our load all alone—through sheer grit, willpower, and discipline and with our obviously limited capacities.</p>

A missionary is a follower of Christ who testifies of Him as the Redeemer and proclaims the truths of His gospel.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p9" pid="NNMpVSa2xEmj3M3PVMwg0Q" hash="yXDYxA">The Church of Jesus Christ always has been and always will be a missionary church. The individual members of the Savior’s Church have accepted the solemn obligation to assist in fulfilling the divine commission given by the Lord to His Apostles, as recorded in the New Testament:</p>

					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p12" pid="5Odx7M9n3kSUyO1HbrcxSg" hash="8K2e5w">Latter-day Saints take seriously this responsibility to teach all people in all nations about the Lord Jesus Christ and His restored gospel. We believe the same Church founded by the Savior anciently has been reestablished on the earth by Him in the latter days. The doctrine, principles, priesthood authority, ordinances, and covenants of His gospel are found today in His Church.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p13" pid="AKBBYXaQkk2nIGTRlB4h-g" hash="jM-Wqw">When we invite you to attend church with us or to learn with the full-time missionaries, we are not trying to sell you a product. As members of the Church, we do not receive prizes or bonus points in a heavenly contest. We are not seeking simply to increase the numerical size of the Church. And most importantly, we are not attempting to coerce you to believe as we do. We are inviting you to hear the restored truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ so you can study, ponder, pray, and come to know for yourself if the things we are sharing with you are true.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p14" pid="zKVzLeCxHUW4FLgeRcWHVQ" hash="Sk18Zg">Some of you may respond, “But I already believe in Jesus and follow His teachings,” or “I am not sure if God really exists.” Our invitations to you are not an attempt to diminish your religious tradition or life experience. Bring all that you know is true, good, and praiseworthy—and test our message. Just as Jesus beckoned two of His disciples to “come and see” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/1.39" class="scriptureRef">John 1:39</a>), so we urge you to come and see if the restored gospel of Jesus Christ enlarges and enriches that which you already believe to be true.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p15" pid="a0WymEliy0Wr0cMUCbQSxg" hash="3Q78Eg">Indeed, we feel a solemn responsibility to carry this message to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. And that is precisely what we are doing with a force today of more than 88,000 full-time missionaries laboring in over 150 sovereign states around the world. These remarkable men and women help the members of our Church fulfill the divinely appointed and individual responsibility each of us has to proclaim the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:1</a>).</p>

					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p17" pid="CxMWT6mrSU6QGpdlIKlcjQ" hash="fhb-GA">But our eagerness to declare this message is not merely the result of a sense of spiritual duty. Rather, our desire to share the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with you is a reflection of how important these truths are to us. I believe I can best describe why we are so forthright in seeking to explain our beliefs to you through an experience my wife and I had many years ago with two of our sons.</p>

						<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p18" pid="cv-WdxgpMkiMzkxv-ky00g" hash="4amIcA">One evening Susan and I stood near a window in our home and watched two of our little boys playing outside. During the course of their adventures, the younger of the two boys was injured slightly in a small accident. We quickly recognized that he was not seriously hurt, and we decided not to provide immediate assistance. We wanted to observe and see if any of our family discussions about brotherly kindness had sunk in. What happened next was both interesting and instructive.</p>
						<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p19" pid="uGgjEzmbf0i6T37qP5cZ-w" hash="XngFSQ">The older brother consoled and carefully helped the younger brother back into the house. Susan and I had positioned ourselves near the kitchen so we could see what next took place, and we were prepared to intervene immediately if additional bodily harm seemed likely or a serious accident was imminent.</p>
						<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p20" pid="QSMR-BzcW0Skw3GYR432pw" hash="g0i-aA">The older brother dragged a chair to the kitchen sink. He climbed up on the chair, assisted his brother onto the chair, turned on the water, and proceeded to pour a large quantity of dishwashing soap onto the scratched arm of his little brother. He did his best to gently wash away the dirt. The reaction of the little brother to this procedure can only be described accurately using language from the holy scriptures: “And they shall have cause to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 16:2</a>). And did that little boy howl!</p>
						<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p21" pid="7U4a5knYWUujtp8mpo_muQ" hash="PDKL8g">After the scrubbing was finished, the arm was carefully dried with a towel. Eventually the screaming stopped. The older brother next climbed up onto the kitchen counter, opened a cabinet, and found a new tube of medicated ointment. Though the scratches on his little brother were not large or extensive, the older brother applied almost all of the ointment in the tube to the entire injured arm. The screaming did not resume, as the little brother clearly liked the soothing effect of the ointment much more than he appreciated the cleansing effect of the dishwashing soap.</p>
						<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p22" pid="9hw8ZIa8oEmZYb8-KM_Mkw" hash="2efiqA">The older brother returned again to the cabinet in which he had found the ointment and located a new box of sterile bandages. He then unwrapped and put bandages all up and down his brother’s arm—from the wrist to the elbow. With the emergency resolved, and with soap bubbles, ointment, and wrappers all over the kitchen, the two little boys hopped down from the chair with bright smiles and happy faces.</p>
						<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p23" pid="Nmt30RkAd0GVPWnKmZl3Vg" hash="bY1Ebw">What happened next is most important. The injured brother gathered up the remaining bandages and the almost empty tube of ointment, and he went back outside. He quickly sought out his friends and began to put ointment and bandages on their arms. Susan and I both were struck by the sincerity, enthusiasm, and rapidity of his response.</p>
						<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p24" pid="M0ShcymQvEWZbOtIXQkgpQ" hash="IBOkjw">Why did that little boy do what he did? Please note that he immediately and intuitively wanted to give to his friends the very thing that had helped him when he was hurt. That little boy did not have to be urged, challenged, prompted, or goaded to act. His desire to share was the natural consequence of a most helpful and beneficial personal experience.</p>

					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p25" pid="5hsY-K6HkEmKMjLtzTgv8w" hash="ymV3hQ">Many of us as adults behave in precisely the same way when we find a treatment or medication that alleviates pain with which we have long suffered, or we receive counsel that enables us to face challenges with courage and perplexities with patience. Sharing with other people things that are most meaningful to us or have helped us is not unusual at all.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p26" pid="b_ohWwXTb0y2SoF5ff2yqQ" hash="HGZrdQ">This same pattern is especially evident in matters of great spiritual importance and consequence. For example, an account in a volume of scripture known as the Book of Mormon highlights a dream received by an ancient prophet-leader named Lehi. The central feature in Lehi’s dream is the tree of life—which is a representation of “the love of God” that is “most desirable above all things” and “most joyous to the soul” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.22-23" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 11:22–23</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.12,15" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 8:12, 15</a>).</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p27" pid="lUVgJ5-d3UiIZtjX2p9taQ" hash="RIS5bQ">Lehi explained:</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p28" pid="lL6C06QsaEugFjKTeCECVQ" hash="m38LbA">“And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p29" pid="F5DFcwBmCEi5tR2aOWTDJw" hash="eSZ0sw">“<span class="emphasis">And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also</span>” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.11-12" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 8:11–12</a>; emphasis added).</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p30" pid="LejssH4qh0Cg2QsjkDt32Q" hash="fnrXOg">The greatest manifestation of God’s love for His children is the mortal ministry, atoning sacrifice, and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. The fruit on the tree can be considered a symbol for the blessings of the Savior’s Atonement.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p31" pid="ivUD5fYo7UWKwr-fjnzkLA" hash="qRU05g">Lehi’s instant response to partaking of the fruit of the tree and experiencing great joy was an increased desire to share with and serve his family. Thus, as he turned to Christ, he also turned outward in love and service.</p>
					<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2014/10/come-and-see.p32" pid="Z0xTDvB5w0-lj62FqSKubg" hash="nyegVA">Another important episode in the Book of Mormon describes what happened to a man named Enos after his earnest and pleading prayer was heard and answered by God.</p>

We also have experienced the cleansing, the peace of conscience, the spiritual healing and renewal, and the guidance that are obtained only by learning and living the principles of the Savior’s gospel.</p>

One day while playing with my friends, I accidentally broke a window in a store near our home. As the glass shattered and the security alarm blared, a paralyzing fear filled my heart and mind.

My parents eventually coaxed me out from a hiding place under my bed and helped me to make amends with the store owner. Fortunately, my jail sentence was commuted.</p>

Such faith and hope invite into our lives the sweet peace of conscience for which we all yearn. The power of the Atonement makes repentance possible and quells the despair caused by sin; it also strengthens us to see, do, and become good in ways that we could never recognize or accomplish with our limited mortal capacity.

It even subdues the haunting concern that we never can be good enough spiritually and never will measure up to the Lord’s requirements and expectations. In truth, we cannot be good enough or measure up relying solely upon our own capacity and performance. Our works and desires alone do not and cannot save us. “After all we can do” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 25:23</a>), we are made whole only through the mercy and grace available through the Savior’s infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.10,14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:10, 14</a>). Certainly, “we believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.3" class="scriptureRef">Articles of Faith 1:3</a>).</p>

As we fear God more completely, we love Him more perfectly. And “perfect love casteth out all fear” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.16" class="scriptureRef">Moroni 8:16</a>). I promise the bright light of godly fear will chase away the dark shadows of mortal fears (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.25" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:25</a>) as we look to the Savior, build upon Him as our foundation, and press forward on His covenant path with consecrated commitment.</p>

But the Lord does not use contemporary philosophies and practices of leadership to accomplish His purposes (see <a href="/scriptures/ot/isa/55.8-9" class="scriptureRef">Isaiah 55:8–9</a>).

As we work together in unity on perplexing problems, our collective understanding of an issue has been enlarged in marvelous ways by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>

This ordinance “is a sign and a commandment which God has set for [His children] to enter into His kingdom.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt; Baptism is administered in the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood.

The act of partaking of the sacrament, in and of itself, does not remit sins. But as we prepare conscientiously and participate in this holy ordinance with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, then the promise is that we may &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt; have the Spirit of the Lord to be with us. And by the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost as our constant companion, we can &lt;span class="emphasis"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt; retain a remission of our sins.&lt;/p&gt;

May I respectfully suggest that our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son do not intend for us to experience such a feeling of spiritual renewal, refreshment, and restoration just once in our lives. The blessings of obtaining and always retaining a remission of our sins through gospel ordinances help us understand that baptism is a point of departure in our mortal spiritual journey; it is not a destination we should yearn to revisit over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

Each successive ordinance elevates and enlarges our spiritual purpose, desire, and performance. The Father’s plan, the Savior’s Atonement, and the ordinances of the gospel provide the grace we need to press forward and progress line upon line and precept upon precept toward our eternal destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p8" pid="ZurZ0FQsAkyOwBbhZNnb4w" hash="xIiJBQ">Every year tens of thousands of young men and young women, and many senior couples, eagerly anticipate receiving a special letter from Salt Lake City. The content of the letter affects forever the person to whom it is addressed, as well as family members and a great number of other people. Upon arrival, the envelope may be opened neatly and patiently or ripped apart excitedly and with great haste. Reading this special letter is an experience never to be forgotten.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p9" pid="olPYnSiQaEeyonV0Pq85Lw" hash="sr_RVg">The letter is signed by the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the first two sentences read as follows: “You are hereby called to serve as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You are assigned to labor in the ______ Mission.”</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p10" pid="R7LTh4Hx10a9zJhokTSuiw" hash="ICAN7w">Please note that the first sentence is a call to serve as a full-time missionary in the Lord’s restored Church. The second sentence indicates an assignment to labor in a specific place and mission. The important distinction expressed in these two sentences is essential for all of us to understand.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p11" pid="UNTESpwFZk67Ud496h6eXw" hash="09QfCg">In the culture of the Church, we often talk of being called to serve in a country such as Argentina, Poland, Korea, or the United States. But a missionary is not called to a place; rather, he or she is called to serve. As the Lord declared through the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1829, “If ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p12" pid="UbZgdxDxnEeTr9_6Xi7Nrg" hash="VXwSdw">Each mission call and assignment, or a later reassignment, is the result of revelation through the Lord’s servants. A call to the work comes from God through the President of the Church. An assignment to one of the more than 400 missions presently operating around the world comes from God through a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, acting with the authorization of the Lord’s living prophet. The spiritual gifts of prophecy and revelation attend all mission calls and assignments.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p13" pid="GHfKVxDHg0KLJVqYbq07dw" hash="-XCWkQ"><a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/80" class="scriptureRef">Section 80 of the Doctrine and Covenants</a> is a record of a mission call to Stephen Burnett extended by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1832. Studying this call to Brother Burnett can help us to (1) understand more clearly the distinction between being “called to the work” as a missionary and “assigned to labor” in a particular place and (2) appreciate more completely our individual and divinely appointed responsibility to proclaim the gospel.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p14" pid="iF5sAQtTv0qAIZK0V69nog" hash="sHGevg"><a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/80.1" class="scriptureRef">Verse 1</a> of this section is a call to serve: “Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Stephen Burnett: Go ye, go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature that cometh under the sound of your voice.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p15" pid="zJbjZpEqzUqdOE5X4fsMog" hash="PlW1kQ">Interestingly, <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/80.2" class="scriptureRef">verse 2</a> informs Brother Burnett about his assigned missionary companion: “And inasmuch as you desire a companion, I will give unto you my servant Eden Smith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p16" pid="PQGupPt9HkuSFzQ0GI4bCg" hash="BfD74w"><a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/80.3" class="scriptureRef">Verse 3</a> indicates where these two missionaries are to labor: “Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p17" pid="Mjl92xRzAEKc5zHDgvaI6g" hash="qDnmhA">I do not believe that the phrase “it mattereth not” as used by the Lord in this scripture suggests that He does not care where His servants labor. In fact, He cares deeply. But because the work of preaching the gospel is the Lord’s work, He inspires, guides, and directs His authorized servants. As missionaries strive to be ever more worthy and capable instruments in His hands and do their best to fulfill faithfully their duties, then with His help they “cannot go amiss”—wherever they serve. Perhaps one of the lessons the Savior is teaching us in this revelation is that an assignment to labor in a specific place is essential and important but secondary to a call to the work.</p>

				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p21" pid="OYTUJXs6vUisDnKivq6HJg" hash="fACKkA">Some of you may be asking yourselves why I have chosen to discuss in a priesthood session of general conference this seemingly obvious distinction between being called to the work and assigned to labor. My answer to this question is quite straightforward: my experience has taught me that these principles are not well understood by many members of the Church.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p22" pid="-d6X5h_7hES_lFzcaQETOQ" hash="7etGBQ">The single greatest reason for addressing this matter is what I have learned over time about the concern, the worry, and even the guilt felt by many missionaries who for various reasons were reassigned to a different field of labor during their time of service. Such reassignments sometimes are necessary because of events and circumstances such as physical accidents and injuries, delays and challenges in obtaining visas, political instability, creating and staffing new missions, or the evolving and ever-changing needs around the world in the work of proclaiming the gospel.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p23" pid="igXRlsoU8ku8HGamVxIDuw" hash="9yodCw">When a missionary is reassigned to a different field of labor, the process is precisely the same as for the initial assignment. Members of the Quorum of the Twelve seek inspiration and guidance in making all such reassignments.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p24" pid="F-QSxunV2EOEJS0yTmM70g" hash="w_8lRg">I recently spoke with a faithful man who shared with me the deepest feelings of his heart. In a meeting, I had just explained the difference between being called to the work and assigned to labor. This good brother shook my hand and with tears in his eyes said to me, “The things you helped me learn today have lifted a burden from my shoulders that I have carried for more than 30 years. As a young missionary, I was initially assigned to a field of labor in South America. But I was unable to obtain a visa, so my assignment was changed to the United States. All these years I have wondered why I was unable to serve in the place to which I had been called. Now I know I was called to the work and not to a place. I cannot tell you how much this understanding has helped me.”</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p25" pid="RFOqWlTzhEOUQV0xXa-xOA" hash="Wx97Ng">My heart ached for this good man. As I have taught these basic principles throughout the world, countless individuals have expressed privately to me the same sentiment as the man I just described. I am addressing this subject today because not a single member of this Church should carry an unnecessary burden of misunderstanding, uncertainty, anguish, or guilt about an assignment to labor.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p26" pid="dxwIik5T8UacKSFUj_ZR7Q" hash="NCMF2g">“Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> As you ponder the words of this scripture and open your heart, I hope and pray you will invite the Holy Ghost to carry deep into your soul the understanding, the healing, and the restoring you may need.</p>
				<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work.p27" pid="JHrQbN2iaEGXvmcx2uKZEg" hash="QABD3g">One additional reason I have felt impressed to discuss this topic is my personal experience assigning missionaries over many years. For the Twelve, nothing affirms the reality of ongoing latter-day revelation more powerfully than seeking to discern the Lord’s will as we fulfill our responsibility to assign missionaries to their respective fields of labor. I witness that the Savior knows and is mindful of each of us one by one and name by name.</p>

Working as a missionary certainly is one but not the only important building block in the process of creating a strong foundation for a lifetime of spiritual growth and service. Priesthood and temple blessings, both of which precede arriving in an assigned field of labor, also are necessary to fortify and strengthen us spiritually throughout our entire lives.</p>
