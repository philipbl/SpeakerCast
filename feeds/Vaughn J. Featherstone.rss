      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p1" guid="d0f73f51-f8f7-4612-a334-996e3b68c0a6" pid="G4VxNxBX2UCzHmujFnpHJw" hash="afOJHw">My beloved brothers and sisters of the great Church of Jesus Christ, I would like you to know how humble I am at this great opportunity. I kind of like Ed Gardner’s story. His wife is hard of hearing and she wore a hearing aid; as they sat one evening in the living room, and she was knitting and looking down, he looked out over his newspaper and, speaking about his wife, he said, “You know, I am just kind of proud of you.” And she looked up and said, “You know, I am getting tired of you, too.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p2" guid="ce79afd4-7acc-4a95-9f27-2bd262fe3646" pid="vtqzwpsJTE6QkrkoSoeWxg" hash="s5jv6w">When President Lee and President Tanner under the direction of President Joseph Fielding Smith talked to me on the phone, I wasn’t exactly sure I heard what I thought I heard.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p3" guid="217e9f6d-0ee9-49f5-8a26-684515692d39" pid="kvs5yZMZVkiLjlRk4vbCUw" hash="j3kDtw">For over twenty years now, I have been coming to the priesthood sessions of conference at about four o’clock. I watch the afternoon sessions at home on TV until about twenty to four and then drive down here and wait outside with my sons or with friends. We come inside to priesthood meeting when they open the doors and sit for two or three hours before the meeting starts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p4" guid="7cb4d423-db16-46fd-b5de-8068931ba16d" pid="hxpsP8iGu0SUSrtcfhOXMQ" hash="dQ5pBg">During that time I have had one single purpose in mind. Along with hearing the words of the apostles and prophets and great General Authorities I have looked into their faces and studied them. And I am sure each time that I have found purity of heart. I have found integrity. I have found great love and understanding. I have found self-discipline. I have found all the fine qualities that a holder of the priesthood would like to have. And then I have gone back renewed and decided that I want to put the things I have seen in their faces into mine.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p5" guid="7e5c3ba5-dc8f-4b50-9e77-5b47e5e78149" pid="Yffyudsxi0KnzuNRj3NEaA" hash="-WTJ2g">After this call came the other day, I went out into the backyard, and in my mind’s eye I could see hosts of Aaronic Priesthood bearers—young men who are fine and good and true, who are dedicated to the Lord with all their heart and soul, who want to put that same look into their face which we see in the faces of the brethren here before us today. And they were doing it and they were obedient and following their leaders.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p6" guid="12266a54-ae78-4fd8-a038-4db8e1b7f234" pid="4txeFv1GXEChHDP75Z7vpA" hash="67tO6w">And in my mind’s eye, with great sadness, I saw another great group of Aaronic Priesthood bearers who were not able to put this into their faces because they were disobedient; they were being persuaded by friends and peers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p7" guid="8c0aac87-5332-4125-a245-1083e4c3821f" pid="DUGApohTnU2oPFfgCnS_ZA" hash="Imf1kA">Then I saw a third group that troubled me even more, because these were they who would have been faithful had they had the leadership. If someone had reached out a hand and lifted them and picked them up and cared for them, they could have put integrity and love and purity of heart—all of these fine qualities—into their lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p8" guid="dcc2f088-25b5-4b21-819b-bcbd64b1fb0b" pid="J8m5kSw4gkGPYL5MnMIt0g" hash="f2yleQ">I am more grateful to my wife than I could ever express to you. She has to be the sweetest, kindest human being that I have ever known, and she has this look in her face that I have seen in the apostles and prophets and the General Authorities. And I have five sons. Two of them are on missions, one in the Gulf States and one in North Carolina-Virginia. Both of these boys are Eagle Scouts, and they both, at least from the words we get from them, are striving with all their might to serve the Lord in their mission calls.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p9" guid="374452e0-5155-4782-9961-b4595a35c4b4" pid="oqIWWAuxCECeuAyVZPohfA" hash="M8viZg">I have two other boys at home—Joe and Scott—who are also Eagle Scouts, and we are very proud of them, and they are following and being obedient as they should be. Then I have a young son, eleven, Lawrence, who I believe has the stature of Mormon. He is a large and mighty young man, and I am very proud of him. Then we have one daughter, after the five boys, Jill, and I am sure she was sent as a special angel into our home.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p10" guid="d990a80d-5ef9-41af-a152-565bc3ced3d2" pid="13WBEgb8U0OwaG7bABUy9g" hash="XsOr3A">I am grateful for the confidence of Bishop [Victor L.] Brown. As I have considered this past week—and it’s the longest week I have ever lived in my life—as I have considered the great souls that I know across the Church and the powerful influence and the great direction they have and the great willingness to follow the Lord, I am humble that he would call one such as I, or that the Lord would call me through him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p11" guid="b545d2b7-8d51-473f-be66-9bd2e5c1b88c" pid="aCa3kuz5CE6l0xuCTgLbFg" hash="rHOh4A">May I bear testimony to you. I should first mention that sweet mother of mine, and my in-laws. These are wonderful people. My sweet mother has pretty well raised our family alone. She has given the guidance and mental and physical ambition; she has bred this into us and wanted us to make something of ourselves, and I am so proud of her.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p12" guid="58bec408-2017-4f94-9a06-36268d01c858" pid="u3NiwXW8NU-ImvEvQ08b1A" hash="ywo--w">In closing let me just quote to you the words of the prophet in the book of Alma, when Aaron had spoken all the day long to the king of all the Lamanites, and finally the king believed; and these are the words:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p13" guid="914f0c70-a55c-4314-a9ee-138ae8620281" pid="Dr_cBfwcO0WQba5Cw7lu6Q" hash="gZd5zw">“And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded these things unto him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p14" guid="01a06d81-1ea0-443e-9d7c-b5e5331d8e00" pid="bNAJJ9VCk0Gz5tPTuWAaLw" hash="6zw4Fg">“But Aaron said unto him; If thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God. … believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p15" guid="182bf140-2fd5-4dc4-bd1c-4c391828e181" pid="FyWCjcMqF064rXjhVVpaww" hash="aprTTw">“And it came to pass that when Aaron had said these words, the king did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he did prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p16" guid="61f097a2-9867-4dc9-b2eb-3d3cfa803e21" pid="JoImo0P_HkGuxuy9jznNDA" hash="1wIqVg">“O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee. …” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.15-18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:15–18</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p17" guid="10b89e5c-663d-430c-939b-4f5617b77f1e" pid="Abnb87VrTkSTt-v02tbTeA" hash="WC0r5w">There is a great host of Aaronic Priesthood bearers who would give away all their sins, they would give away all that the world would offer, and they would give away their riches, if they but knew that he was there. Our solemn responsibility today is to help these Aaronic Priesthood bearers understand and know the great callings, know that God does live, which I testify he does, and that we have living prophets upon the earth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/04/a-challenge-to-the-priesthood.p18" guid="dc1f4271-19d4-4d20-bbf3-d37f5e6ab9f6" pid="8vKcFpH2h0qA2xyGnaWFBg" hash="WweqZA">During those twenty years I have watched our beloved prophet and the Council of the Twelve come in, I know these are inspired men, these are holy men; they are prophets. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

I have thought of questions that might enter the mind of a young Aaronic Priesthood bearer. One such question would be, Where can I go to get a commitment to the Church like the brethren, the bishops in the wards, the stake presidents? What is it that causes a man to go early in the morning and work late at night, and give his heart and soul to the kingdom of God? Where can I go to find a commitment to the Savior like you have? And then another question, Where can I get a testimony?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p2" guid="446582ec-736d-48e9-8484-3b21d0ba2f68" pid="ISzk9uoYG0GEjwzjRxasig" hash="qqN2XQ">I would like to brush away the fluff if we could and maybe go to that source where I gained my special testimony. It happened to be in the scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p3" guid="85c9386c-41ba-458e-b5d5-52ac23e9d206" pid="fstE62JGnUOYPOH2qzuYUw" hash="vGcdFA">Let’s go back first to the young man Enoch. As Enoch journeyed in the land, the voice of the Lord came unto him and told him to prophesy and call the people to repentance. And Enoch answering said unto the Lord:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p4" guid="37141512-8148-4a43-b7ce-5fe0d11ebe5e" pid="Sa4A4k88S0W5CQ874MKluw" hash="hs5wfg">“Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p5" guid="fb910cb4-01ba-4eb6-8a30-625ab18e75c6" pid="s613k_kVb0G-HSBN58LlIw" hash="bZY-sQ">“And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. …</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p6" guid="b5add2f7-0f98-4d95-82e7-ebc2fa364d54" pid="U8I8kJMJWkOYO2vXd1Uajw" hash="BR0Jig">“… and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.31-32,34" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:31–32, 34</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p7" guid="50032eca-b8c9-4277-ad2b-0f7e204a7217" pid="DCwP0xs4pEKu4bZo2baC3w" hash="ihuUAg">These powers would be given to Enoch if he would but follow this great lead and accept the call. Enoch accepted the call. And then you will recall the tremendous thing that happened—and I think this is absolutely beautiful, the way it is described in the scriptures, how the people described Enoch after he received the call. They said: “… and there is a strange thing in the land; a wild man hath come among us.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.38" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:38</a>.) I think that is a tremendous description of one who serves totally and fully in the Lord’s service.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p8" guid="7f202bd2-770d-4211-a93b-338e60b7d295" pid="LDaIhPJcCUGV6vpFWIPxYw" hash="Qsc3wg">Enoch, of course, had some great associations. He happened one time to be conversing with the Lord, and he said, “How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p9" guid="52cb6fd8-6cc4-48e2-879b-1103984be181" pid="uf79Qa6dAUmAZwwTXhitaw" hash="Skyg4w">“And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still; … and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever.” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.29-30" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:29–30</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p10" guid="b2ce595c-c0ee-4b99-8fac-b6d4378e7983" pid="wy5lro5IQk6qMZCLQTnAnw" hash="Qas31w">I want you to know that when I read those sacred words, I felt and had the feelings, I believe, that Enoch might have had in some small degree. And each of you can have those same feelings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p11" guid="619ce1f8-f32e-4cba-890b-65655213893f" pid="4uHv_GcBVEeDyU6rWcKCzw" hash="VrFRcw">And then, I believe, later on Enoch had the privilege of seeing all the generations of man and beholding them in their wickedness, and then Enoch wept and stretched out his arms; and the scripture says, “And his heart swelled wide as eternity. …” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.41" class="scriptureRef">Moses 7:41</a>.) I think that is a beautiful description.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p12" guid="1e68b718-852a-4c84-80d0-3d39058db171" pid="ssM10tkNnUK077RYNC76hA" hash="gPE5Tg">I heard our modern prophet say something similar. He wept and then he said, “As I thought about my responsibility, my heart and soul went out to the entire membership of the Church.” Doesn’t that have a familiar ring of the prophets?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p13" guid="8c1a8543-e773-438e-8781-0b3de44a37ab" pid="3vAROEyHoUq7BjipFuL3hQ" hash="7IQsFQ">Then what about Jeremiah? The Lord called Jeremiah and said, I knew thee before thou wast born, “and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.” And then the scripture records: “Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/jer/1.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Jer. 1:5–6</a>.) And yet the Lord took this young man and made of him the great prophet Jeremiah.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p14" guid="eef7f56f-80f3-4255-bc41-fee802cc9ac5" pid="6QPrKCkmtUqbrF4bCNMnig" hash="PlSQ8Q">And then again, let’s take a look at Amos. The Lord called Amos to go down to Israel and prophesy; Amos did this, and Amaziah, the king’s priest, was wroth and angry. He came to Amos and said, “O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, … But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king’s chapel, and it is the king’s court”—go to Judah and prophesy there and eat bread and leave us alone. And then Amos said, I think with all the courage and all the dignity of a prophet, “I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit. And the Lord … said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. Now therefore hear thou the word of the Lord.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/amos/7.12-16" class="scriptureRef">Amos 7:12–16</a>.) And with all the righteous integrity of one who had this calling, he did exactly that.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1972/10/the-sure-word-of-god.p15" guid="d8d8949b-1e9b-40f0-83b6-d7599ab60521" pid="OK4hs5mJaUqmpJ14UcLbOA" hash="5ZXHMg">Then I want to tell you the type of experience I had when I read the Book of Mormon, and this great soul Enos, a young man, the son of a prophet in this case, said:</p>

Romney was invited by a newsman to answer a question. The question was this: Do you have a welfare program in your church? And President Romney responded, “Yes, and if you join the Church, you can contribute to it also.”</p>

Welfare is literally giving and not receiving in the Church of Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p3" guid="9f7dae12-68aa-4a4a-8614-b39c1c71a362" pid="cVFwstv-206RQfQXTwfLNw" hash="S5a7Fg">In the 107th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we read: “The office of a bishop is in administering all temporal things;” and also to be a judge in Israel, “to do the business of the church, to sit in judgment upon transgressors. …” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.68,72" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 107:68, 72</a>.)</p>

(<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/72.10" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 72:10</a>.)</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p5" guid="5900178b-8678-41d4-abcc-b1e2aa7f63e1" pid="i6yuZejiO0yhheoIf3df4Q" hash="m7IYMg">Now in the Church in order to fill the bishops storehouse we have a commodity budget, and we assign this out to the regions; they in turn assign it to the stakes and the wards. In some cases it is in commodities and in some cases it is in money, cash in lieu. And as these funds come into the Church, then we use them to take care of the needs of the poor throughout the regions of the Church.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p6" guid="83535740-4b16-45fc-bbcb-e8433c412586" pid="gWt1p2MeJEWEQygkIu2Q_g" hash="iny5wA">Now, brethren, during the past year we have not taken sufficient into the bishops storehouse to have a full year’s inventory. We have about an eight and a half months’ inventory. This is partially due to the commodity price index rising from .185 on January 1 to .285 on August 1, 1973, on the wholesale index. Now you can see we had to use cash in lieu funds to buy products which are not produced in the storehouse. We used many of these funds for that purpose and this has been a factor in reducing our inventory to eight and a half months. We will build this back to a full year inventory at the end of this year.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p7" guid="c6c60336-0cc9-4a02-aea5-e5da2f16a880" pid="JATbK2-Jv0ShdftLOe7c7w" hash="pqQTgg">The storehouse is to furnish the food for approximately 3 percent of the Church. Around 96,000 people receive commodities from the storehouse. We have a one-year inventory to supply needs for this 3 percent drawing from the storehouse. Brethren, bishops, those who administer these great funds and commodities, would you recall with me some principles that I think are urgent?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p8" guid="640f3187-f9bd-4e9a-99c6-192cf71f2d40" pid="xhKhKlkliEyT7HrrWNNqmw" hash="fFWewQ">For example, in the bishops storehouse we have foods that are going to the homes of our less fortunate Saints. We feel possibly as you deal with these commodities you may need to make some slight adjustments. We feel the best commodities that are produced on our projects should be brought into the storehouses, not the culls from the farm or from the flocks or from the herds of cattle. We think it ought to be the very best, for do we not recall the scripture, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 25:40</a>.) I believe that is a two-edged sword, and if we give to the Lord, or give to these fine Saints who receive from the bishops storehouse the culls, I believe then that we might be dealt with justly by the Lord in a like manner.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p9" guid="1e2e367d-a9c8-4a65-b728-8108c977253c" pid="eUlFfOmYf0ydM0Rrq41D-A" hash="J0P9Bg">Now there are some principles we also need to understand. One is this: when stake presidents and bishops contribute to the general committee from your projects, would you consider that we must have the very best. For example, we had one stake president in a nearby stake who the central storehouse called and said, “We need a few head of cattle.” The wholesale index that the Church was working on was a little under that which represented the present market. He said, “No, we won’t furnish you the cattle. We will sell them and then we will give you the cash in lieu,” which he did. They gave us the cash in lieu, brethren. We had to go out on the wholesale market and buy dressed beef at an up price. Now you think about that. It is all the Lord’s money. I don’t believe he would be pleased with that kind of a transaction. I wouldn’t want to offend anyone. I just think we ought to give the best we have to the Lord’s storehouse.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p10" guid="834af02d-c527-4a73-9e29-10c8a79ca652" pid="EgttKxd3tUuzB4fcuTQ9-g" hash="Q37RQQ">I think there is another thing we must consider: have your eating habits changed a little over the past year? Ours have, greatly. We used to eat potatoes regularly, but when they got up to $1.69 for ten pounds, we decided to not eat as much of that product as we used to. We switched to rice. Our meat diet has considerably decreased. Our grocery mix has changed at home. However, we understand that those who are receiving commodities through the storehouse are receiving just as much meat as they were previously. Now we don’t want them to be treated any better or any worse than anyone else in the Church. We just want them to be treated with dignity, and so it might be well for you to adjust that mix a little bit as you are doing in your own homes.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p11" guid="0eaa9ea0-46b8-4282-89d6-317954bf39c1" pid="iiqmrrWtnkmJhcQgHgOAzQ" hash="byJxkQ">Let me give you a better example. In the business world every groceryman understands that in a particular section, if you want to raise the gross you don’t have to raise the price. You can raise the gross profit by changing the product mix. A very simple mathematical example will tell you how to do this. Let’s take for example, in one section you had a product markup of zero on 60 percent of your products in that section. Sixty percent times zero is zero. It contributes no gross points to the overall gross mark up. If you had a 20 percent mark up on the remaining 40 percent, 40 percent times 20 equals 8 percent, so you contributed eight gross points to your overall gross in that section.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p12" guid="fb25834b-8d46-427d-9061-82e199de4707" pid="F8EEiXE4EEGlqa-HpET9ow" hash="4GuWTQ">Now, brethren, let’s say we reversed things and took those high mark up items at 20 percent and displayed them on the heavy traffic impulse ends where the customers are more likely to buy, and took the low mark up items off those ends and put them on the shelf in a less favorable position, then we change the product mix. Now, say we get 20 percent markup on 60 percent of our gross and 0 percent on 40 percent. We get 40 percent times nothing is still nothing; 60 percent times 20 is 12 gross points, so we have increased our gross by four points by just changing the mix without having raised the price.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1973/10/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p13" guid="fb1bd158-21ee-41cb-acc1-c009adb1bdc6" pid="mvR8xp4TP02n1h6G3pmZPw" hash="xzGtcQ">Brethren, that is a great principle in welfare. Our home food bill is no more than it was six months ago or a year ago. We had to change the mix. We feel, bishops, you might well change the mix on those who are eating out of your bishops storehouse. When potatoes are $1.69 for ten pounds, let’s switch to rice. When meat is as high as it is, let’s not do as one bishop did, continue to give one family 67 pounds of beef each month. I don’t know that there are too many families here that are eating 67 pounds of beef each month. Those Saints receiving commodities through the bishops storehouse should not be receiving more than you are using in your homes. I hope this is a principle that we will remember and use very wisely.</p>

This is just Vaughn Featherstone speaking, not the prophet. We are trying to spend the Lord’s sacred funds in the best possible way. Use your Relief Society president as she goes into the homes to help determine how much should be used.</p>

As President Lee discussed in his talk the great compromise in many different areas, I want to tell you what is going on in the area of work. The subject I would like to address myself to the young men of the Church is <span class="emphasis">work. </span>Brethren, there is no substitute for work. You cannot be lazy. Businesses who say, “Come with us and work for us; the wages are high and the labor is easy; the work week has been reduced considerably,” have only shame to offer. You are destroying your soul and character when you accept such an offer. The Lord expects us to be industrious; he expects us to be mentally and physically ambitious with all our hearts and souls. And I promise you this—that this compromise work attitude never was what the Lord intended.</p>

Monson has said in his W formula: “Work will win when wishy-washy wishing won’t.” Dorothea Brande in her book <span class="emphasis">Wake Up and Live </span>(Cornerstone Library, Inc., New York, 1968), says that we ought to “act as though it were impossible to fail.” That is true, brethren, in the Church.

Between naps, I mowed four times, two times lengthwise, two times across, until the lawn looked like a green velvet checkerboard. Then I dug around every tree, crumbling the big clods and smoothing the soil with my hands, then finished with the edger, meticulously lining up each stroke so that the effect would be perfectly symmetrical. And I carefully trimmed the grass between the flagstones of the front walk. The shears wore my fingers raw, but the walk never looked better.</p>

This is not due to the principles or the teachings of the Church, but rather to the shortcomings of its members. I sat in a conference some years ago when Elder Matthew Cowley said, “A mother can take care of seven children, but seven children will not later take care of that same mother.” The Church has the solution to all of life’s problems. The Savior did not leave us without direction in caring for our wonderful senior Saints. He was our model. You recall his beautiful, compassionate experience with the widow in the city of Nain. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/7.11-15" class="scriptureRef">Luke 7:11–15</a>.)</p>

First, the responsibility rests with the individual to do all he or she can to be a contributing member of society and of the Church, and give service to friends and children and loved ones. All these give soul satisfaction so needed. When health is sufficient to warrant, the Church provides many blessed opportunities for great service. The rich experience of these loved ones can be of such importance to the Church.</p>

Others may be called upon to officiate in the temples. Some may visit the temple regularly to do endowment work. Genealogical research is fascinating, stimulating, and fulfilling. Many can and should be called to teach Primary, Sunday School, and Relief Society. Our youth love mature Saints as teachers because they have time to care. Bishops may call the brethren to be home teachers and the sisters to do Relief Society visiting teaching.</p>

The family changed the diaper regularly. Is that more than he would have done for them? No. We must not forget our family members.</p>

I believe the Prophet has not called this conference to have us trifle with words. I would like to discuss a subject which possibly could be led into by this little story:</p>

I believe there is a need to do some things. I am going to use a visual aid tonight. But we don’t have one, so, in your mind’s eye, wherever you are across the far corners of the earth, would you picture a huge scroll sliding down from the ceiling? On it are listed the names of those who purchased pornographic literature. The list is large enough so that all may see. Is your name on the list?</p>

My young friends, how about all of you who have committed fornication? Or have been involved in petting? Suppose their names were on this huge scroll, so that all may see. Now, I can tell you this, I bear my solemn witness that if you do not self-inflict a purging in your lives, the time may well come when there might not be a scroll, but it will be as though there were. It may be as though it had been shouted from the tops of houses. People cannot hide sin. You cannot mock God and hold the Lord’s holy priesthood and pretend to propose that you are his servant.</p>

At the close of our great and beloved prophet’s wonderful discourse and counsel to us, at least 200 or 300 men got up and just started moving en masse toward all the doors. The closing hymn hadn’t been sung, the prayer hadn’t been rendered. And these men, inconsiderate, lacking in discipline, simply got up and moved out of the Assembly Hall to save five minutes.</p>

I don’t see any of the men that I prize most, leaving any meetings early except in an emergency. I believe they have the dignity to not offend God.

I wonder what he felt the next time he raised his arm to the square and said, “On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.” (The Scout Oath.) And yet the oath we take in the priesthood is many times more serious to us.</p>

Another problem: an overweight girl from Ogden went to see her bishop. In the purity and goodness of charity, trying to help the girl, he counseled her that it might be a good idea to lose a few pounds. Pitifully heartbroken, she went home and told her father. It had cankered her soul. The father, of course, negative toward the Church all of his life, waiting for something like this, sprung like a cat on the bishop’s back, and they came down to see me and wanted their memberships transferred out of the bishop’s ward. I asked them why, because I didn’t know all this background, and they said, “Well, our bishop suggested to our daughter that she might lose a few pounds and make herself a little more attractive.” Now I want you to know that I defended that great bishop. I said to this family, “You are wrong. That sweet bishop, out of purity and love for your daughter, felt and did that which he was impressed to do. I am sure it was a message from God to your daughter, and she let it canker her soul. The strange thing is that she was probably up in her bedroom the night before praying, ‘Heavenly Father, I am lonely. I need someone. Please help me. Help me to find someone so I won’t be so lonely.’” And yet oftentimes we are offended because a sweet bishop gives us some instruction which is hard for us to live.</p>

I think it is irreverent, brethren of the priesthood, to come to meetings late and then perform your assignments at the sacrament table late while the meetings are beginning. What an irreverent thing it is to prepare the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper and to do it just before the meeting starts, and to be hurrying around and joking about it. It ought to be a sweet experience, one that is a spiritual experience, where all is done in quiet and is completed 10 or 15 minutes before the meeting, where only few see the preparation. Members of the ward come in, and the sacrament table is set. And also what about those who are irreverent in meetings? I think the Lord expects his priesthood holders above all others to be reverent.</p>

These concerns have led me to address this subject. Someone has said, “Though argument does not change belief, the lack of it destroys belief.”</p>

In a very serious talk with his parents, the young soldier asked if they loved America. He asked how they felt about this great and glorious nation. Both mother and father got a little teary-eyed and said that they loved this country dearly, that it was more precious to them than their own life. “Why didn’t you tell me that when I was growing up?” he said. “I never heard you once say that you loved America. You never taught me to love it. I can’t tell you what an ungrateful pup I have been. I had to go to Vietnam to find out what the United States of America is all about. I would gladly lay down my life for it. I would have given anything to know how you felt about it when I was growing up.”</p>

This veteran sat down at his kitchen table and wrote a longhand letter to Dr. MacFarland. He wrote, “My wife and I don’t have much. I doubt we will ever have enough money to travel outside of Arizona. I was a soldier in World War II and was taken prisoner. For two years we didn’t hear one bit of news as to how the war was going. In all those months I never lost faith,” he said, “and then one morning I saw the American flag and a band of soldiers coming over the hill. I don’t know if anyone can understand the love I felt for my country that day, and have all of my life. I felt the same way the other night when I heard you talk.” Then he wrote, “Dr. MacFarland, you’re quite a guy. You just stay in there laying them on the landing deck.”</p>

Someone asked me once how I felt about amnesty for the draft card burner and the deserter. I told him that I thought every one of them should be taken before General Moroni to be judged. We need to feel again what it means to be a citizen of the United States of America. We need to feel the thrill and sensation and have the swellings within our bosom about this country. The priesthood of God should be an example of patriotism and loyalty to our country. As I talk about the United States of America, each one should consider his homeland, his flag, and his country. The scriptures give us a description of a great, great soul when they describe Moroni.</p>

Without this image, man has no free will and frequently neither liberty nor the capacity for liberty.’ He further said, ‘In this struggle for freedom, at home and abroad, our greatest weapon, both a sword and a shield will be our love of and faith in God.’”</p>

He will make us a mighty people, a pure people, a Christlike people, a worthy people, a free people. The Latter-day Saints bear witness and we know the witness is true that we have a modern prophet, that the Book of Mormon is a record of God’s dealings with people who had problems similar to the problems we have in this day. And they were a great people who loved this land and thus we find the course we must take in following in their footsteps. These things are true, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

We recognize that priesthood leaders living in the developing areas of the world in the 1970s will need the same careful, in-depth training that was provided during the 1930s and 1940s to stake presidents and bishops in the United States and Canada by President Lee and President Romney.</p>

With her conversion, there came a great motivation to learn how to properly care for her family. She asked, as she expected another baby, “What do I need to do to have a ‘healthy Mormon baby?’” She took a special course provided by the Relief Society on child care. She was enthusiastic about the lessons and did her best to apply the principles she learned. The second baby was born strong and vigorous and continues to be healthy. The health missionary who helped those teaching the Relief Society course is a local sister called on a full-time health mission. She has since been released from her mission but is still serving her people as a health resource person through the branch Welfare Services Committee.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/food-storage.p1" pid="FsQaTZV2SkClL6r6quaQTw" hash="uHsYCw">Brethren of the priesthood, sisters of the Relief Society, President Henry D. Moyle suggested that when someone speaks we ought to get three things out of the message. First and least important (but still very important), we ought to get what is said. Second, and more important, we ought to have a spiritual experience. Third, and most important, we should keep the commitments we make to ourselves. Let’s write them down and follow through. Don’t ever make a commitment to yourself you don’t intend to keep—if you do, you weaken your character.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/food-storage.p2" pid="bltK7nXfXUeFXXIyVh8J1w" hash="LAfn5A">For twenty-six years, since I was fifteen, I was involved in the grocery industry. I learned much about human nature during those years. I remember the effects that strikes, earthquakes, and rumors of war had on many very active Latter-day Saints. Like the five foolish virgins, they rushed to the store to buy food, caught in the panic of knowing that direction had been given by the prophet but not having followed that direction—fearful that maybe they had procrastinated until it was everlastingly too late.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/food-storage.p3" pid="k8MOky1TpUeKi9ttZdY0xw" hash="rdYqQA">It was interesting because only in Latter-day Saint communities did people seem to buy with abandon. It was not a few Latter-day Saints—it was a significant number. It caused great increases in sales. One such experience came when a so-called prophecy by someone outside the Church was greatly publicized.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/food-storage.p4" pid="ckf2DM1KbUuTjEhk5qa7BA" hash="cjChLQ">How foolish we can sometimes be! We have a living prophet; we have God’s living oracles, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles. Let us follow the Brethren and be constant. We need have no fear if we are prepared.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/food-storage.p5" pid="nSB5PuE1WEWx8SFzcCsDaw" hash="-uwc9A">Brothers and sisters, what have we done in our stakes and wards to see that every Latter-day Saint has a year’s reserve of food to sustain life? Let’s not only keep teaching the principle, but let’s also teach our people how.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/food-storage.p6" pid="OQcFGXQDQEWRXdzoKhRj2g" hash="XmIZjg">This morning I would like to discuss food storage. Let me suggest three or four things we can do. Start by taking an inventory—take a physical count of all of your reserves. This would be a great family home evening project if you’re prepared. If not, it may be terribly embarrassing to you in front of your family. Imagine how the powerful testimony you bear concerning a living prophet must sound to your children, who know that as a family head you have been counseled for years to have a year’s reserve of food on hand. We need to know where we are. Every family should take an inventory—get all the facts.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/food-storage.p7" pid="mpE8MEBYC0afHq3kTu-uFg" hash="0hiCsA">Second, decide what is needed to bring your present reserve levels to a year’s supply. Then make a list and prepare a plan. Consider first, what are the basics?—wheat (or grain from your locale), sugar or honey, dried milk, salt, and water. Most of us can afford such basics. Buy them from your monthly food budget allowance. The Church discourages going into debt to buy for storage.</p>
      <div class="figure" uri="/general-conference/1976/04/food-storage.f2">
	<p pid="I4vWhPNeHUiN_YoATJQfsA" hash="DTJOyA">Now that you know where you are and where you need to be, the third step is to work out a time schedule for when you will reach your goal. I suggest that one year from today we ought to have a year’s supply of food in all active—and many inactive—members’ homes in the Church. Where food storage violates the law of your land, then abide the law. However, even in those cases we can plant gardens and fruit trees and raise rabbits or chickens. Do all you can within the laws of your community, and the Lord will bless you when the time of need comes. Now here are some suggestions how:</p>

          <span class="label">1.</span>
          <p pid="5IQB6g9hEkSBiKOv7WvLAw" hash="NijLYg">Follow the prophet. He has counseled us to plant a garden and fruit trees. This year don’t just think about it—do it. Grow all the food you possibly can. Also remember to buy a year’s supply of garden seeds so that, in case of a shortage, you will have them for the following spring. I’m going to tell you where to get the money for all the things I’m going to suggest.</p>

I hope that if any of God’s children are out in spiritual darkness, you will come to them with a lamp and light their way; if they are out in the cold of spiritual bleakness with its frigidity penetrating their bones, you will come to them holding their hands a little way, you will walk miles and miles with them lifting them, strengthening them, encouraging them and inspiring them.”</p>

This is an eternal and true principle. Many in the Church have attained such total self-reliance. Each individual has the responsibility to take care of his own employment needs. Yet, sometimes as quorum or ward leaders we consider this principle and withdraw from our responsibility, feeling that the individual can work out his own problems. The fact is that we have a great responsibility. To help us to understand and fulfill that responsibility, there are two principles regarding employment that I should like to discuss:</p>

Food and water are lowered to him but no ladder. He wants out desperately. He begs his captors to let him go. He tries to bargain with them but nothing works. Months pass. The begging, the scheming becomes a way of life. After a long time he is granted what he wants, what he has been striving for with all his will, day and night—the freedom to come out of his pit and go on his way in complete freedom.</p>

The ward welfare services committee discusses the needs of the individual. Each member of the quorum or group presidency immediately involves quorum or group members to help locate employment. Thus the entire priesthood unit becomes involved by assisting in trying to locate job openings.</p>

When we do, we have 100 times more exposure, we have 100 times more chance for success. It is one thing to talk about a problem and another thing to actually contribute to the solution. Ward welfare services committees are organized to get results. A quorum and ward totally united in fasting, prayer, and works on behalf of one individual in need of work will produce miracles.</p>

It includes the individual, the quorum, the ward, the stake, the region, and community resources available. Some areas have Church employment centers, but these are organized to compensate for lack of total quorum and ward commitment. This is because the priesthood <span class="emphasis">have not</span> accepted and are not living or functioning the way the Lord would have us do. In the past the process from the quorum, to the ward, to the stake, to the region has been too slow. Not because the principle is wrong, but because priesthood leaders are not functioning properly in this area of their stewardship. Jobs are lost due to time lag between employment needs being matched with employment opportunities.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/principles-of-welfare.p31" pid="clAUqw3LtEijAezNPp426A" hash="RoXQGg">We as a people do not understand the quorum organization yet. When we do, we will find there will be a “power surge” through the Church that will electrify the world. The priesthood quorum is the Lord’s organization for the brotherhood of men and brethren in the kingdom. The quorum is to function primarily to assist the quorum member in spiritual growth and development. The temporal welfare of every quorum member is also the responsibility of every other quorum member.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1976/10/principles-of-welfare.p32" pid="UBoFzjhbB0y13oFL_-8P5g" hash="wov4JA">There is a holy brotherhood in a good quorum that draws the members together with bands stronger than steel. The quorum is a brotherhood of charity wherein the “pure love of Christ” prevails. When this “charity” pervades all that is done, then every member has a Christlike interest in every other member. Quorum members feel the weight of the burden which is carried by their unemployed brother as though they themselves were unemployed. They are motivated to action. The correlation and efforts of the quorum are directed by the quorum president.</p>

It has been glorious and fulfilling beyond all expectations. When we first arrived, Sister Featherstone went to the Lord and said: “We don’t have much time. Please let me learn quickly so that the work will go forth.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p3" pid="gtB467OUbEGt2552kRMeDQ" hash="xcuzSw">Later she said, “The Lord has answered my prayers. He taught me several great lessons. One of those lessons came after the first three or four weeks in the mission field. I was unable to find a few minutes each day to repair to a quiet spot. When I was home I would take about forty-five minutes in the afternoon and go out and curry down my Arabian horse. I would retreat into a world of my own for those few minutes.”</p>

She went to the Lord and knelt in prayer and said, “Please, Heavenly Father, help me to find some time for myself while I am here.”</p>

And that work standard is compared to our work standard and not someone else’s.</p>

Friday Elder Curtis, who was splitting with Elder Aloi, came to work with us and afterwards we took them home. Elder Aloi invited us in to see what a real elders’ apartment looks like. He went through the back door to open the front door, and in a moment he came out beaming.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p8" pid="aBlsL4wTuU2uQvL15i4LAw" hash="Iu0KFQ">‘Elder, come and see what has been brought to us.’ There on the table was a large supply of groceries. After a while Elder Curtis told us that Elder Aloi and his companion had found a family that didn’t have anything to eat, so they took all of their own food out to them. Our hearts just about broke,” wrote Sister Weidel. “The Lord does take care of his own.”</p>

I cannot remember when I gained a testimony, but I do remember many experiences that have enriched and built upon the foundation I have. Of the many humbling experiences I’ve had, these past eight months have brought me closer to the Lord than any other period. I’ve lived through three revolutions in Mexico, which really built my testimony. Writing lessons for the Church brings one very close to the Lord, and he did bless me with more than I can tell you. But this mission has given me more twenty-four-hour spirituality than I have ever had.</p>

My husband died while my oldest son was in Chile on his mission, and I was really humbled during that trying period. I am thankful for this experience of hard work and great blessings. With humility and thanksgiving, Sister Alder.”</p>

Before they arrived, I received a letter from their daughter. In part she said: “Dear President Featherstone, you are getting two of the most wonderful folks in the world in a few weeks to serve in your mission for eighteen months. They are just tickled pink to be serving under you. They told me they plan to do whatever you tell them to do. You enjoy mom and dad. We’ll miss them, so please take good care of them while they are there.”</p>

There are a few, however, who rationalize themselves out of a call or try to justify poor performance in the mission field—like the man who received his pay envelope and noticed that he had been shorted five dollars. He went to the paymaster and said, “You shorted me five dollars in my pay envelope this week.”</p>

Many of us understand the blessings that come when children and grandchildren kneel down at night and say, “Dear Heavenly Father, please bless grandma and grandpa, who are out in Texas on a mission.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1978/10/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p16" pid="W2TJbvjnD0mDBtmHudJm7Q" hash="ytpi5A">Sister Olsen mothered twelve children, and she supported all of her sons on missions. Now they are supporting her on a mission. I have felt the love between missionaries and their families every day of my mission.</p>

At the time, he drove cars across the country for a foreign car company. When his boss, who was not LDS, heard he was going to be gone for two years to serve a mission, he said, “If you will stay at home and work for me, I will give you a $28,000 Ferrari.” Elder Grannis completed his mission a month ago as a presiding zone leader.</p>

He came from a large family. The father found that he needed to pick up a part-time job to help support his son. This was not quite enough, and so the sweet mother went to work in the school lunch program so that she could be home when her children were home. Even with this additional money, the elder fell a little further behind each month. A choice friend occasionally gives me several $100 bills to share where they are needed. When I interviewed this elder, I asked him how he was doing financially. His eyes clouded up, and he said was really trying, but his folks weren’t sending him quite enough. He said, “President, I haven’t been wasting. I haven’t eaten anything for three days, trying to cut back.” Then he said, “Even my little sister is helping. She received a one-dollar bill for her birthday, and she put it in an envelope and sent it to me because she thought I needed it more than she did.” Then he wept openly. I reached into my shirt pocket, and extracted two crisp $100 bills, and said, “A choice friend of mine asked me to give these to you.” He put his head down in his hands and was overcome.</p>

He wondered how this would be when he received his mission call to Texas, where the mission president had only served two or three months. While he was in the Missionary Training Center listening to the final session of October general conference, he heard President Tanner announce that the next speaker would be Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy and newly called president of the Texas San Antonio Mission. When Elder Gifford was later called to be an assistant to the president, he shared his patriarchal blessing promise with us. Do you think he has any question about whose work this is?</p>

He knew his parents and bishop wanted him to stay and complete his mission. In one of the many interviews we had, he said that five previous elders in his ward had abandoned their missions and had returned home early. I thought what a great disservice the first elder did to the other young men who followed his poor example. I made a solemn vow that this elder would not go home until his mission was completed successfully. Every week for thirteen to fifteen weeks he would write in his letter to the president all the reasons he should be released from his mission. Each week I wrote a letter of response.</p>

He has a great warmth and a great talent to teach; he loves and cares for people; and he is extremely spiritual. He returned home with an honorable release from a very successful mission, married a beautiful girl in the temple, and now they live near the temple where they visit regularly. This elder set a great example for all prospective missionaries from his ward.</p>

The greatest desire of his life was that the surgery would make him acceptable for a mission. A year before he entered the mission field, he had his final operation. Since he has been on his mission, he has averaged seventy to eighty hours a week in proselyting. He is greatly loved by all.</p>

In one interview his companion told me that Elder Sheffield’s shoulder separates and falls out of place quite often. When this happens he is in severe pain. It happens most often during the night. When I interviewed Elder Sheffield, I suggested that we put him in a local hospital here and have the doctors do what needed to be done to correct this problem. He looked me in the eye, and with a sternness seldom seen he said, “President, I have spent most of my life in hospitals, and when I complete my mission I am returning to several more major surgical operations. I promised the Lord that if he would let me serve a mission, I would not spend one day in the hospital during the two years no matter how sick I was or how much I suffered.”</p>

I’m sure we love you already.” (Bless them, they didn’t even know me, and yet they could love me.) They continued: “We are not too young anymore. William Keith Clark is eighty-one years old. He has been a bishop’s counselor, a bishop, and a patriarch for thirty-one years. I, Ellen Clark, am seventy-six years of age. I have been a music director and a teacher in all the organizations of the Church, ward and stake. We have had an abundant life and love to teach the gospel. We have ten children, all married in the temple and working in the Church. We had our reunion recently—fifty-six grandchildren and twenty-six great-grandchildren! This is four missions for my husband and three for me. Our happiest moments are teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.” Every missionary is a story of love and sacrifice. I love them so much. Their great devotion to the cause, their love for the Lord, and their willingness to serve him, whose work this is, will bless their lives and their posterity forever.</p>

And I about made up my mind to pray and see if I couldn’t try to quit being the kind of boy I was and be better. So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn’t come. Why wouldn’t they? It weren’t no use to try and hide it from Him … I knowed very well why they wouldn’t come. It was because my heart warn’t right; it was because I weren’t square: it was because I was playing double. I was letting on to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth say I would do the right thing and the clean thing. But deep down in me, I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. YOU CAN’T PRAY A LIE … I found that out.” (New York: Platt &amp; Munk, 1960, pp. 445–46.)</p>

You can’t pray a lie; and regardless of what may be decided by a common judge, actual forgiveness cannot take place until true repentance has preceded it. The common judge serves as the Lord’s agent. A bishop may be deceived, but the Holy Ghost cannot. When confession takes place, it ought to be from the inner-most depths of the heart and soul.</p>

Oh, beloved brothers and sisters, “the shepherd should not recoil from the diseased sheep” (Victor Hugo, <span class="emphasis">Les Miserables,</span> New York: Random House, n.d., p. 32). The bishops in this kingdom have been endowed with wisdom, judgment, and mercy from on high. They can relieve the burden of the repentant sufferer.</p>

But,” he continued, “last night I was reading in <span class="emphasis">The Miracle of Forgiveness</span> again, and I realized that every major transgression must be confessed.

We did not lie to the bishop, who was my wife’s father; he simply talked with us and signed our recommends. We then went to the stake president, and he did not interview us. He signed our recommends, and we went to the temple unworthily. While we were on our honeymoon,” he continued, “we decided to make it up to the Lord. We decided we would pay more than our share of tithing and more than our share of building fund; we would accept every assignment to the welfare farm and do all else we were asked to do. We decided we were not worthy to go to the temple, and we did not go for a year. It has been forty-two years since the transgression, and we have lived as near Christlike lives as we know how.

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p1" pid="HKvZTTgMb0OgzQ6HFk7TEg" hash="CgXQJQ">My beloved brothers and sisters, I would like to share my personal feelings about a parable of great hope and compassion. The Savior said, “A certain man had two sons.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.11" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:11</a>.) The younger of the two sons seemed always to be in the shadow of his older, more mature brother. Compliments would come freely to the older brother. His age and size were in his favor; he could work harder. The younger son, always compared to his older brother, never quite measured up. He tired more quickly, did not get all the work done, and probably had a fairly poor self-image. He may, have determined that the “system” was against him. He was not being judged on his own merits. He decided to leave home and start in a new environment.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p2" pid="sWlAo-zGtEOanQ1L9jGw_A" hash="sgHBLQ">The parable continues: “And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.12" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:12</a>.) Apparently the father had previously discussed with his sons that one day each would receive an inheritance. The inheritance would be a free-will gift from the father. It is doubtful that either son actually earned much more than his room and board. Nevertheless, the father “divided unto him his living.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.12" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:12</a>.) This, in essence, was approval for the younger man to strike out on his own with his inheritance. The father loved him. He may have had an idea what the younger son would do with his share. The younger brother “gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.13" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:13</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p3" pid="oprV5vXchk23cqTwdq-FkQ" hash="UhZFow">He may have intended to do something honorable. However, he found, after arriving in the distant city in a far country, people did not just automatically gather round and make him welcome. He was in a predicament, no influence and no friends. True friends must be earned, others can be bought. The younger son found that flies are attracted by honey. He began to flash his inheritance around. The flies came. Not only did he not invest or use his money wisely, he wasted it on riotous living. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.13" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:13</a>.) There were evil and drunken men and vile and adulterous women whose lust for his companionship was gone when the money was spent.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p4" pid="4MHKSzGlJ0qfyMy6b1jPlg" hash="8KR-Sw">“And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.14" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:14</a>.) Conditions were bad, for not only had he used up all his inheritance, but even the average citizen waxed sore. He had been taught to work at home and apparently attempted to find work. He may have gone to many who had been his friends when he was “flush.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p5" pid="kNJoiq8ec0OuLyZNc9a-lg" hash="S970bg">The prodigal began to be in want and “went and joined himself to a [certain] citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.15" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:15</a>.) Now he was not only destitute, but also forced to take the most humble kind of work. In such great poverty was he that “he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.16" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:16</a>.) The Savior is undoubtedly showing us the contrast and the depths of poverty and need to which he had sunk. He had indulged with all who came when he had money. Now not even one of his supposed friends so much as gave him a husk of corn so that he might feed at least as well as the swine.</p>

The father had been faithful and had worked hard all his life, a frugal man with character and integrity. Would he turn his son away? The younger son arose and came unto his father—undoubtedly a long journey.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p12" pid="T6dcH8L9AkqrWGdDz7Rnhw" hash="nYZpkw">Now, the older son may have noticed that since the younger brother’s leaving, the father seemed always preoccupied. His father had little interest in the work. He would work a bit, then leave the field to look down the road, each time returning with a faraway look in his eyes. Not only did the older brother have to do his own work and make up for the younger brother’s absence, but he also had an additional work load which was previously done by the father. It also seemed that his father paid him little attention. Before the younger brother’s leaving, there was always a word of praise for the way the older son worked. Now, there was little or no fun, no singing, no dancing, and precious little talk. Both the mother and father would sit at night and stare into the open fire. Days, weeks, even months passed thus.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1982/10/however-faint-the-light-may-glow.p13" pid="ngrxoxg7okO_bY6HkmUcQw" hash="edg6JA">The Master states: “But when [the younger son] was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</p>

The long journey probably had been made with little or no footwear, so the robe and shoes were necessities. But the father also had a ring brought for his son’s hand. This was an unexpected gift, an expression of the gratitude of the father for the son’s return.</p>

Perhaps he thought he should have taken his inheritance also. He would not have wasted it, but increased it. In spite of these thoughts, he had stayed at home and been a dutiful son. There was no music, no dancing for his righteous life; and yet when his younger brother returned, all of these things celebrated his coming.</p>

The father must have realized the oversight; he may even have apologized. The great concern for his younger son was off his mind. He remembered he had not been as complimentary to the older son as usual. He recalled the older son’s more intense work to compensate—no dancing, no music, no sumptuous feasts. Hearts were too heavy for those things.</p>

Every man, woman, or youth who returns home after a prodigal journey or an inactive period will find the Savior waiting with open arms. His atoning act will satisfy justice and extend mercy to all who will “come unto him.” (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 18:11</a>.)</p>

They need the sweet, abiding love of a compassionate parent or loving brother or sister. Jesus will bless every member of the Church who will go out and bring someone back.</p>

When accountability comes then each of us determines how we shall feed and care for that light. If we shall live righteously that light will glow until it suffuses the whole body, giving to it health and strength and spiritual light as well as bodily health. If we shall live unrighteously that light will dwindle and finally almost flicker out. Yet it is my hope and my belief that the Lord never permits the light of faith wholly to be extinguished in any human heart, however faint the light may glow. The Lord has provided that there shall still be there a spark which, with teaching, with the spirit of righteousness, with love, with tenderness, with example, with living the Gospel, shall brighten and glow again, however darkened the mind may have been. And if we shall fail so to reach those among us of our own whose faith has dwindled low, we shall fail in one of the main things which the Lord expects at our hands.” (In Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 114.)</p>

He said, “This morning I did not participate in the missionary preparation workshops, but I was listening, I was listening. I have been thinking, thinking a lot.” Then, with great emotion he said, “I have made a decision to go on a mission.”</p>

The bishopric attended, dressed in suits. Many of the youth had already been in swimming. Everything stopped while a great old high priest gave an opening prayer. During the prayer there was a splashing in the pool. The counselor in the bishopric said: “I think I have always been practical enough, so I opened one eye to see who it was that was so irreverent as to swim during the prayer. A twelve-year-old Spanish boy, who could not swim, had somehow gotten into the deep end of the pool and was drowning. His eyes reflected fear and terror. I took two steps, dove into the pool, suit, shoes and all, pulled the young man to the side and helped him out. He sat on the edge of the pool and I waited in the pool. The good old high priest prayed on and on.”</p>

He had a serious heart attack. He is in the LDS Hospital, and we wondered if you knew.” I had not known. I told him that I would like to see him but I had to catch a plane in a little over an hour. I didn’t see how I could get up to the hospital before I had to leave. He then said, “Oh, that’s okay. Dad is going to be released tomorrow to return home.”</p>

I took my briefcase, airplane tickets, and drove to the LDS Hospital to see Bruford Reynolds. As I walked through the door, our eyes met. The love between a great man and boy spanned the years. I went over to him and sat down, and we talked. Then I said, “I know you have been administered to, but would you feel all right if I knelt by your bed and offered a prayer?” I knelt down and together we prayed. When I finished, my eyes were filled with tears, as were his. Then I bent down over him and kissed him on the forehead and left.</p>

Lee gave a marvelous talk which he entitled <span class="emphasis">A Leader—The Champion of Youth</span> (Salt Lake City: Young Men’s Mutual Improvement Association, 1968). Since having heard and read the talk, I would like not only to address my remarks to that subject but to qualify as champion of and for the youth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/a-champion-of-youth.p2" pid="sdowu0w_M0uk2CQ1i8ziSg" hash="BCYADQ">I recall the story of a teacher helping a young student on with his galoshes. They seemed smaller than his shoes. She got down on both knees and pushed, pulled, and stretched one boot until she finally got it on. Then she went through the same struggle and finally got the other one on. As she finally finished pulling it on, he said, “These are not my galoshes.” The teacher pulled and struggled and finally got them off. Then he said, “They are my sister’s, but my mother made me wear them.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/a-champion-of-youth.p3" pid="tBWmx_zVAE69fV1dniYRWg" hash="SxY87g">Some who work with youth may feel that they do not “fit” the calling. It is not always comfortable to work with the youth, but for me, as God is my witness, I love them.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/a-champion-of-youth.p4" pid="5r0fV_HnFkqX19R4ZZxgkw" hash="KaRf9g">At an encampment in Finland, the Scouts decided I should know how to sauna. Finns heat their saunas to 170 or 180 degrees. President Olli Roto, the stake president who was teaching me, along with the Scouts, who were experts, made a small bundle of birch branches. When we really began to perspire, he took the bundle of birch leaves and swatted me all over my back, chest, and legs, and said, “That brings the blood to the surface.” I said, “It works.” Then we ran down and dove into the Baltic Sea, then went back into the sauna. It’s amazing what we learn when we’re working with youth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/a-champion-of-youth.p5" pid="6LfAqmp7PUWdBtwhiX5Rrg" hash="OuBM7Q">Elder Orson F. Whitney said: “You parents of the wilful and the wayward! Don’t give them up. Don’t cast them off. They are not utterly lost. The Shepherd will find his sheep. They were his before they were yours—long before he entrusted them to your care; and you cannot begin to love them as he loves them. They have but strayed in ignorance from the Path of Right, [but] God is merciful to ignorance. Only the fulness of knowledge brings the fulness of accountability. Our Heavenly Father is far more merciful, infinitely more charitable, than even the best of his servants, and the Everlasting Gospel is mightier in power to save than our narrow finite minds can comprehend” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, p. 110).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/a-champion-of-youth.p6" pid="onj0-Id3PU6QZR1w-mC09g" hash="KNo1RQ">Elder Lee in his talk referred to Horace Mann, who was “called to dedicate a great school for boys. … he said, ‘If this school costing all the millions that it has cost is able to save but one boy, it is worth all that it has cost.’ One of his friends said to him after the meeting, ‘You let your enthusiasm run away with you, didn’t you? You don’t mean that the millions we have spent here would be worth it all if we saved just one boy.’ Horace Mann looked at him and replied, ‘No, my friend, it wouldn’t be too much to spend if that one boy were my son.’”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/a-champion-of-youth.p7" pid="6vC6IMTejUa1-buOjhtgYg" hash="hJLhog">Then Elder Lee with great power and emotion said: “I want to tell you it wouldn’t be too much if that were one of my grandsons. They’re precious to me and some of them are stubborn, hard-headed, and rascals just like their grandfather, hard to manage and difficult. If somebody, please, God, would just steer them past this dangerous age so that maybe they will find themselves like someone tried to help me when I was at that dangerous age, I would be most grateful” (<span class="emphasis">A Leader—The Champion of Youth,</span> p. 3).</p>

Tom Perry, the Utah South Area Presidency, and the Young Women presidency recently held meetings for all the seminary students in the Salt Lake area. In Salt Lake City, youth filled the Tabernacle, the Assembly Hall, and the Salt Palace auditorium, and 4,000 youth crowded the grounds of Temple Square and listened to the public address system. We had 23,000 young people in the Marriott Center at BYU, 3,200 at Dixie College, and over 3,000 at Snow College. The total count exceeded the number of seminary students enrolled by 5,000.</p>

The response has been wonderful. The youth of the Church are one of the most powerful forces for good on the earth today.</p>

This generation will face trials and troubles that will exceed those of their pioneer forebears. Our generation has had some periods of respite from the foe. The future generation will have little or none. But their great faith in the Lord will give them needed strength.</p>

President Wilford Woodruff said in a general conference in 1898, “Concerning the work of the dead, the Prophet Joseph Smith said that in the resurrection those who had been worked for would fall at the feet of those who had done their work, kiss their feet, embrace their knees and manifest the most exquisite gratitude.” I believe our youth will rescue an entire generation. Their work will bring these same feelings and emotions from parents and grandparents of those spiritually rescued.</p>

In the 26th chapter of Alma we read: “Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.</p>

Debbie, a beautiful teenage girl, spoke at stake conference. Among other things she said, “I want to tell you about a friend I had when I went through high school.” She said she felt homely but her friend told her she was beautiful. When there were dances, he would dance with her. He built her up. She said: “He was my very best friend. He was handsome and popular, and he lived his religion. I never heard him swear, he never violated the Word of Wisdom, and he faithfully went to church.</p>

I did what he did, and I would have followed him anywhere. I cannot express the love and respect I have for him. I was not his girlfriend, but I sure loved him. He is on a mission now, and we write regularly. He still loves me and is still my best friend. He is my older brother.”</p>

Lee talked about our young men in the military. He said, “I listened to a doctor recently who said that the medical journals reported that the boys who had become mentally unbalanced in large majority [in World War II], were the boys who had broken homes, whose wives or sweethearts had been unfaithful at home.” Then he said this: “We have heard much in this conference about our boys. We have heard but little about our girls” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1945, p. 165).</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/a-champion-of-youth.p21" pid="N802gzzZyESk6SZ_OuTHUA" hash="b6Ph1w">Women are endowed with special traits and attributes that come trailing down through eternity from a divine mother. Young women have special God-given feelings about charity, love, and obedience. Coarseness and vulgarity are contrary to their natures. They have a modifying, softening influence on young men. Young women were not foreordained to do what priesthood holders do. Theirs is a sacred, God-given role, and the traits they received from heavenly mother are equally as important as those given to the young men.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1987/10/a-champion-of-youth.p22" pid="Os2E1oQwQ0Km3gApgRsfrQ" hash="Vwodfw">Sometimes misguided women or men direct our youth away from their divinely appointed role. Worlds without end, men will never be able to bear children. Every young woman may be a procreator with God and carry a little one under her breast either in this life or in the eternal worlds. Motherhood is a wonderful, priceless blessing, no matter what all the world may say. Priesthood ordination is a blessing to men. There are serious consequences when either motherhood or priesthood is abused or laid aside.</p>

Who will ever forget President Benson’s marvelous recent counsel to the young men and the young women of the Church? Both of these talks have been distributed to the Church in pamphlet form (see <span class="emphasis">To Young Men of the Priesthood,</span> pamphlet, 1986; <span class="emphasis">To the Young Women of the Church,</span> pamphlet, 1986).</p>

For tieing knots, yes. Knot tieing is Tenderfoot duty, but it is important. In one sense this whole business of living and doing is one of tieing knots, the kind of knots that will hold and not give under stress and strain. We see all around us the evidence of failure, of knots that slipped when they should have held. They are evident in career failures, in business failures, in professional failures, in marriage failures. To be able to tie the right knot for the right reason, for the right occasion, and to have it hold against every stress is a part of the process of being prepared” (Boy Scouts Program, 10 Feb. 1985).</p>

As we marshal your forces in your true identity as deacons, teachers, and priests in the holy Aaronic Priesthood, we mobilize an army of Israel such as has never been known before in the Church.

We live in the season of the world when good has become evil and evil, good. We have heard outcries against the things which we hold precious and dear—prayer and God. We see attempts at legalization of drugs, abortion, homosexuality, and other compromising, drifting philosophies. Some of the brightest in our generation have been swept by giant waves onto treacherous shoals. We may not have been all that we should have been as parents, but we have loved our children, this church, our homelands, and cared for people in all nations. Some of the best blood of our generation has been spilled to preserve freedom. We have sacrificed many things to provide those who would follow better things than we had. This may well be another opportunity to reach our own by serving others.</p>

As the world moves deeper and deeper into sin, this wonderful Church stands like a giant granite boulder.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1999/10/one-link-still-holds.p5" pid="ZvKPhqmNlkiRjvg78Gk-KQ" hash="sfcB1g">Aren’t you proud that the Church teaches us the truth? We don’t have to wonder about earrings for boys and men, tattoos, spiked hair, the four-letter words, and obscene gestures. We have prophets who model the standards. They teach that the Ten Commandments are not outdated. The word of the Lord has thundered down through the generations: “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ex/20.7" class="scriptureRef">Ex. 20:7</a>). Profaning God’s name is a great offense to the Spirit, and to do so is Satan’s great ploy to mock our God.</p>

Stealing is an affront to God. This commandment is one of only 10. Cheating, lying, bearing false witness are all types of stealing.</p>

No matter how strong the winds of public opinion may blow, the Church is immovable. “God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Laws, consensus, consenting adults that teach contrary to the gospel are wrong even if the majority accepts them. Sin is sin, and that is God’s truth. The Apostle Paul declared, “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3.16" class="scriptureRef">1 Cor. 3:16</a>).</p>

I love the story told at the funeral of Henry Eyring’s father. When he was a young man coming across the border from the Mexican colonies to the United States, the customs man said, “Son, do you have any pornography in your suitcase or trunks?” He responded, “No sir, we don’t even own a pornograph.” It’s wonderful to be that pure and naive. We know pornography is addictive and destructive. It has companions it travels with: drinking, smoking, and drugs. It uses some types of music, dancing, the Internet, and television. Those who produce it are godless and have no conscience. They know the consequences, but they don’t care. Like those who peddle drugs, they will never be around to pick up the pieces when you’re all broken up. But we will—your parents, bishops, and leaders.</p>

It is, however, the one human endeavor most damaging in consequence when done without care or competence. To carry a student in harm’s way because of either ignorance or arrogance—because we do not know or do not care—is an act far worse than a bungled surgery. Our mistakes will not bleed. Instead, they carry hidden scars whose mean and tragic consequence may not be seen until years have passed and remedy is painful and impossible.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Obedience is a wonderful and a great privilege. In Abraham 4:18 [<a href="/scriptures/pgp/abr/4.18" class="scriptureRef">Abr. 4:18</a>] it states, “And the Gods watched those things which they had ordered until they obeyed.” What if the elements had not obeyed? They would have been damned or held back. So it is with us. Obedience to God is truly the only way to really be free and exercise our agency. Satan teaches the opposite and, with each wrong choice, binds us with chains. I promise you, obedience is a wonderful privilege.</p>

One Saturday morning, she got off work about 7:00 or 8:00 <small>A.M.</small> She went to bed for a couple of hours and then got up. She had invited all her relatives to dinner. There must have been 35 or 40. She decorated the tables and arranged the chairs and put all the dishes and silverware out. She cooked and baked all day long. The dirty pots and pans and dishes stacked up.</p>

The front door closed, and I heard my mother coming to the kitchen. I was pleased and thought she would be. The door swung open, and even at the age of 11, I recognized that she was startled. She looked around the kitchen, looked at me, and then there was a look I didn’t recognize at the time. I do now. It was something like “Thanks. I am tired. I think you understand, and I love you.” And she came over and hugged me. There was a light in her eye and a warmth in my heart. I learned it is a wonderful feeling to turn on the lights in our parents’ eyes.</p>

There was a large framed board. It had the pictures of all the young men serving in the military. Priests who had been at the sacrament table a few months earlier were now in the war. Each week it would be updated. Those who were killed in action had a gold star by their picture; those who had been wounded, a red star; and those missing in action, a white star.

Thursday we all got up. There were five boys and two sisters. We skipped breakfast so we would have a real appetite for Thanksgiving dinner.

Time was running out. I looked at my father, then my mother. I thought, <span class="emphasis">Please, now, someone, anyone, please can’t we have a prayer.</span> I was almost panicky; then all of a sudden everyone started to eat.
