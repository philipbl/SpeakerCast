      <description>My brothers and sisters, this is indeed an occasion for me and my family. I would like to say to Brother Sill that I have listened to him all my life, and this is one time I wish he had never stopped.</description>

I would like to say to Brother Sill that I have listened to him all my life, and this is one time I wish he had never stopped.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p2" pid="8wocN9hcPEqHdzV99Q-pJg" hash="wLkPsQ">I would like to tell you an event in my life which I think typifies what is going through my mind and has gone through my mind the last few weeks. The event started with a phone call from a Mr. Marion T. Romney. My secretary came to me in a meeting, and she said, “A Marion T. Romney wants to talk to you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p3" pid="-eL7PmAHB0O8UBBeDLO9hw" hash="OtU_Og">I said, “I think that’s Marion <span class="emphasis">G.</span> Romney.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p4" pid="VcOnzOY55UeWI0LFoZV9-A" hash="-_g2gw">“He said you would leave this meeting if I told you that he was calling you.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p5" pid="-JIjeVK1mES1D3SkgJV2iQ" hash="XD_Uog">I said, “He’s right.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p6" pid="V1rQwrHEa0qGe-9fqla2_g" hash="PyunEA">I think my secretary would like to have told his secretary that I would call back. But I went to the phone, and Brother Romney asked me five questions. He asked me if I would go on a mission; he asked me if I was worthy; he was concerned about my 17-year-old son, my finances, and my health.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p7" pid="Om5oSmaoa0aZViuEqJ4Eqw" hash="QTRYWA">I will tell you this, something I learned long ago: It is a question of free agency. On any one of those five questions, had I had to give a no I would have lost my free agency. I was financially able, I was morally able, and I knew the law of consecration and what it meant; and I appreciated the opportunity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p8" pid="f26LCNOtqkywvmC8BKioRQ" hash="e3T0TQ">I called my wife immediately afterward and then went home. I talked with my wife, as Elder L. Tom Perry talked with his wife. We have married similar spirits. She has followed me all over the world. We have moved 15 times. She has learned two languages, brought up our children, and has always supported me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p9" pid="670m0-UXq0ajud42fETMMw" hash="C2NoVw">I remember one time after coming back from an international trip. I had been gone for some time. My wife sat down on the arm of the chair, and I put my head on her shoulder. It was near the end of the month, and she asked me if I had completed my home teaching. I will be honest; I had other things in mind. But I went and did my home teaching. That is her training. So it was; I was beginning to learn the law of consecration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p10" pid="wAC_ZcraCk-DH2gvdkbJIA" hash="Zq2GFg">A few weeks later the phone rang again. This time it was a man whom I have greatly admired—Brother Arthur Haycock. I spoke to him briefly; and then, the prophet’s voice—distinctive, clear, the clarion call.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p11" pid="LN-xGTN0REiBT2SrtNHkvQ" hash="2Hh1Uw">“Brother Hales, do you mind if we change your mission?”</p>

But I figured someone else would have that call, and I said, “I will be glad to go to whatever place you send me.”</p>

I felt like the man who had fallen off a precipice, who was grabbing on to a limb which was giving way slowly, and who cried fervently in a prayer, “Save me!” And as he looked down to the rocks far below, a voice came clear and strong: “Let go, and you will be protected.” At that, the man looked up in the air again and said, “Is somebody else up there?”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p20" pid="DWOjwaFbMEux6lPddrYg0g" hash="bV5tfw">I have learned from Joseph Fielding Smith, and have talked to young people, about the law of consecration. It is not one particular event; it is a lifetime, day by day, in which we all strive to do our best that we might live honorable lives, that we might live the best we can in the service of others, as President Joseph Fielding Smith talked about—not as his grandfather, Hyrum Smith, gave his life when he was with the Prophet, but giving our lives each day.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p21" pid="ODNvctv8yEypqx5PowN6-Q" hash="iSl3JA">With that, the prophet talked to my wife. We held each other in our arms and said nothing, and we knew that we had and that we would dedicate and consecrate our lives to that mission, whatever it might be, in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We asked our questions which Elder Ashton taught us: “Why me?” And that is past us.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p22" pid="0QLT3qTY50KuUTElLJAuSA" hash="HapXhQ">I will say this: It is not in death or in one event that we give our lives, but in every day as we are asked to do it.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p23" pid="UCaQvzd-wEyJYezBJRFz4w" hash="neav2A">In the Regional Representative work, I have been able, over the past five years, to have the hardening of the steel—to watch and work with these men who have been called as special witnesses of God, that they might know and teach and train the priesthood holders with whom they deal.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p24" pid="96VCvTYWyEC9NP-gEZzfHw" hash="MMu7Mg">Do you realize that these men have revelation every Sunday when a stake is formed? As a Regional Representative assisting and kneeling in prayer with them as they give voice through the Spirit, one is able to participate in knowing that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that we have a prophet of God who is here this day, and that we have special witnesses who will lead and guide us, if we will but listen to their voice.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p25" pid="XxRoPdJThU-HWPnf7evOVA" hash="qgr_vg">I ask the Lord in prayer that I might be able to be an example to help lift others, as these men have been over the years. My 17-year-old son said to me, “Dad, do you think, really, you will ever be like them?”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p27" pid="AEifRvyLX0ybkC1DC6WaBw" hash="RJzi9Q">I dedicate my life and service, and as Paul declared in First Corinthians, “And my speech and preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</p>

They are a great strength to me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/04/a-question-of-free-agency.p30" pid="yhx8ls7CQEW-hB3pzzDGVw" hash="X9KuTQ">I ask the Lord’s blessings, that I might be one in purpose with the Twelve and with all the General Authorities, and with you, my brothers and sisters; and I say to the priesthood holders that any one of you could be here this day. One cannot ask the question “Why me?” and dwell on it. But I will do as the prophet has said, to put behind me my past life and dedicate and consecrate all my time, talents, and efforts to His work. And I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

There is no better man to follow and be next to than Adney Y. Komatsu. He is a man of God, simple and humble, with whom I hope to be able to spend the rest of my life in the service of the Lord. There is a great spirit that comes from the choir. These things make it possible for me to discuss a subject which is close to my heart.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p2" pid="klZmUr3T3UuhFAl-uVdhfQ" hash="7R4T6g">Spend a few thoughtful moments with me, if you would, discussing the phrase “We can’t do it alone.” Many of us have varying degrees of testimonies. We have all been given the Spirit of Christ at birth. It was a gift. We all have a testimony which we have developed ourselves throughout our lives which the Holy Ghost has helped us to obtain. We may know that God lives. We may know that Jesus is the Christ. We may know that he gave his life for our redemption, that he is resurrected that we might live, and that he is alive today. We may know that Joseph Smith has restored The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the last dispensation of the fulness of times. Yes, we live in that choice period of time which is the “last dispensation” before the second coming of Jesus Christ. We live in the “fulness of times”—a time when the scriptures that have been revealed to us are virtually all the scriptures available to mankind. We may know that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God who has all the keys of the priesthood vested in him to lead this church by revelation in these latter days. Yet, my brothers and sisters, with all of this knowledge, why is it that some of us fail to learn the very critical point that we did not come to this life to live it alone?</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p3" pid="cYjh511IBUOgzZVFoWF7jA" hash="uMeF0A">You can’t hide your actions from self and others. Polonius’ advice to his son, Laertes:</p>

The “isolated self” shut off from the Light of Christ makes us become fallible—open to delusion. The balance and perspective which come from caring about others and allowing others to care for us form the essence of life itself. We need the inspired help of others to avoid deceiving ourselves. It has always been a mystery to me why the intellectual elite sometimes shut themselves off from the Spirit of God.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p5" pid="6PwMVq7Ay0KeLK06SezIWA" hash="_C9AIg">I am here to bear my testimony that we were with our Heavenly Father before we came to this life. The scriptures tell us so. We also know that we chose to take a physical body, to come to live in this estate, to live His commandments, and to have opposition in all things. The opposition which we must have is to make us strong; the fire which we withstand is to harden our spiritual steel.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p6" pid="cdwhjYuWpk6DxN3ST0mo3A" hash="ikukuA">It is also God’s plan that we cannot return to his presence alone, without the help of someone else. James put it best: “Faith without works is dead, being alone.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/james/2.17" class="scriptureRef">James 2:17</a>.) The gospel plan requires giving and receiving. Faith alone is not enough. We need “works” to serve and to be served. We can’t do it alone.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p7" pid="7zXEpvnz302UXldbMeVuYg" hash="osSwFw">The many missions which we have in life cannot be embarked upon successfully without the help of others. Birth requires earthly parents. Our blessing as a child, our baptism, our receiving the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, our receiving membership in his church, ordination to the priesthood, going on a mission, being married, having children of our own, blessings during illness and times of need—all require the help of others. And all these are acts of love and service which require the help of others and the giving of help to others.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p8" pid="EIXg2B-B3kmm6jEmngrb9A" hash="Gq6q5g">When we return to our Heavenly Father, he does not want us to come back alone. He wants us to return with honor with our families and those whom we have helped along the road of life. In preparing this message, it has become very clear to me that the true nature of the gospel plan is the interdependence we have upon one another in this life and the estate in which we now live.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p9" pid="HwS3Zl9fNkqJYMBdmcOQ3Q" hash="Uy_uJg">It is clear to me that we have imperfections of body, imperfections of mind and intellect—that we are not perfect. And for that reason we are dependent on others. We must be self-sufficient ourselves, but that does not mean independent of help of others. We cannot gain a testimony without having the help of the Holy Ghost. We cannot do genealogy without having the help of those who came before us—our forebears. We are here to see if we will serve the “least of these our brothers,” and since I’ve been a General Authority I have come to find out that the President of the Church, his counselors, and the Twelve Apostles consider themselves the least of us.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p10" pid="XULDuaazHEC1a2ChdKYrLg" hash="VysPlA">A just God has placed us here on the planet earth where we experience suffering and imperfection all around us. And this life and estate are necessary because in this life we experience something we cannot do any other place. The life we had before and the life we will have hereafter will leave our bodies, spirits, and minds in a more perfect state. But we did not and will not have the opportunities to give of ourselves in the same way as we can in this life. What a simple truth of a gospel principle! As we suffer and serve in this life, we are fulfilling a very essential part of the gospel plan.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p11" pid="uTwlPkpgEU6ghyVTPCqSJQ" hash="Ts7LLQ">When I was a lieutenant in the air force, our squadron selected as its motto “Return with Honor.” We realized that this motto applied to all members of the flight. It did not just apply to us as individuals. We flew jet fighter planes in a fingertip formation. For a moment, fold your thumb under your hand and look at the back of your hand with your fingers extended. You will see a flight of four planes with a leader and three wingmen. You are protected on the left and on the right, and the leader is concentrating on his goals. If for a moment you will separate and put two fingers on either side, you will still see a leader and a wingman, one plane ahead of the other, and one plane on the wing to protect. We all knew and were taught from bitter experience that a “loner” out of formation was unprotected and would surely be destroyed.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p12" pid="rQJVr53xmUGaewnugMxatQ" hash="dAZ98A">Why then do many of us “go it alone” and deny those who love us most the joy and blessings which come from sharing? The principle of helping one in need is well expressed in the touching love story of Thomas Moore, a famous nineteenth century Irish poet, who, when he returned from a business trip found his wife had locked herself in her upstairs bedroom and had asked to see no one. Moore learned the terrible truth that his beautiful wife had contracted smallpox and her milky complexion was now pocked and scarred. She had looked at herself in the mirror and demanded that the shutters be drawn, and that she never see her husband again. Thomas Moore did not listen. He went upstairs to the darkened room and started to light the lamp. His wife pleaded with him to let her remain in darkness alone. She felt it best not to subject her husband to seeing his loved one with her beauty marred. She asked him to go.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1975/10/we-can-t-do-it-alone.p13" pid="E5ZSq8nr206lQYHA4o4y3w" hash="7t13og">Moore did go. He went downstairs and spent the rest of the night in prayerful writing. He had never written a song before, but that night he wrote not only words but also composed music. As daylight broke, Moore returned to his wife’s darkened room. “Are you awake?” he asked.</p>

This withdrawal will ultimately lead us to rebellion against those who would like to be our friends, those who can help us most, even our family. But worst of all, we finally reject ourselves.</p>

Such retreat will ultimately lead them into the darkening influence of the adversary, which leads to despondency, loneliness, frustration, and to thinking of themselves as worthless. After one thinks of himself as worthless, he then ofttimes turns to associates who corrode those delicate spiritual contacts, rendering their spiritual receiving antennas and transmitters useless. What good is it to associate with and ask advice of someone who is disoriented himself and only tells us what we want to hear? Isn’t it better to turn to loving parents and friends who can help us reach for and attain celestial goals?</p>

Individuals in difficulty often say: “I’ll do it alone,” “Leave me alone,” “I don’t need you,” “I can take care of myself.” It has been said that no one is so rich that he does not need another’s help, no one so poor as not to be useful in some way to his fellowman.

They would glide to the ground, their wings fluttering—unsure, afraid, and not knowing how to fly.

Recently I received a letter written by a young lady who went on a long, dark journey, a journey that ultimately led her into moral transgression. Her story is important because she is going through the anguish of full repentance and now is beginning to feel the joy that honest repentance can bring. She has asked that her personal experience be shared with you in the hope that there might be one who can be helped and not take that same journey. She writes (excerpts from a letter):</p>

By then it was easy for me to convince myself that making love was all right as long as I truly felt that I loved the man. So I made love and desecrated the temple of my body. I became pregnant. When I realized my condition, I went to the young man and told him of my problem. He wanted nothing to do with me or my baby. He did say he would pay for an abortion, however, if I so desired.</p>

He took time out of his busy schedule to hear of my terrible transgressions. Oh, how I prayed to my Heavenly Father before my interview. The bishop was kindly. He asked that I would have the courage to tell him everything; that I would not hold anything back. As I tried to touch lightly on my transgressions and go on, I <span class="emphasis">couldn’t!</span> A horrible tightening in my throat and chest made it impossible for me to go on.

He emphasized that he, himself, could not forgive me. That was the Lord’s decision. He helped me to understand that I <span class="emphasis">could</span> be forgiven, that my Heavenly Father loves me, that I could gain an awareness of my future goals and not constantly condemn myself all of my life, thus halting my eternal progression. He asked me to read the <span class="emphasis">Miracle of Forgiveness</span> by President Spencer W. Kimball. It helped a great deal in making me aware of the process of forgiveness. We had several appointments, the bishop and I, so that he could help me to see my course toward reestablishing myself in good standing in the Church.</p>

He lived in the preexistence in the spirit world; he dwelt with God his Father. He is the Son, Jesus Christ. We took a mortal body upon us. We’ll have opposition; we will taste death and be resurrected because of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. He will be granted a degree of glory. We can have that same degree of glory—the celestial kingdom; if we are worthy. We can dwell once again with God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ throughout all the eternities.</p>

If you are a young man or young woman or retired couple and the Spirit bears witness to you that you should go on a mission to declare this message to the world, make your commitment today.

He is a living testimony that, by overcoming pain and adversity, we can cleanse our souls and strengthen our faith and testimony in Jesus Christ. Indeed, in terms of the trials he has had to face, he is in many ways a modern-day Job.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p4" pid="CzWa224vNka6ae9wrj-3zA" hash="ZZLbvg">The story of Job in the Old Testament relates three of the great tests we all should be prepared to face at some period in our lives. First, temporal setbacks. Job lost all he owned. Second, physical illness that will test our faith and testimony. And third, depression. Job said, “Why died I not from the womb?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/3.11" class="scriptureRef">Job 3:11</a>.) “My soul is weary of my life.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/10.1" class="scriptureRef">Job 10:1</a>.) But the great lesson of Job is that, “in all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/job/1.22" class="scriptureRef">Job 1:22</a>.) Too often when adversity strikes, we use it as a justification to commit sin and turn away from the teachings of Jesus Christ, the prophets who lead us, and our family and friends. Job maintained his testimony and was blessed for his unwavering faith that God lived and that he would dwell in God’s presence.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p5" pid="U1Us23jr0E-jFdL8Xm4HTg" hash="rudImw">President Kimball, being a righteous man like Job, has endured many trials—cancer of the throat, heart surgery, boils, cranial surgery, and numerous other afflictions. President Kimball’s experiences serve as an example of how we should meet similar adversity and suffering in our lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p6" pid="18pkKsjx5UuemhTEzpBlIA" hash="s5sQug">President Kimball has not sinned or charged God foolishly. He has kept his integrity and his testimony, and sung the praises of his Lord throughout his many physical trials. We have never heard him complain about his trials. On the contrary, his challenge has been, “Give me this mountain” to climb. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/josh/14.12" class="scriptureRef">Josh. 14:12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p7" pid="LfY-ButL_EWMKGevCbM9JQ" hash="RiwF1A">The courage and faith of President Kimball to overcome adversity are an example to all of us, to testify that we, too, can meet the challenges of life. Our aches and pains are but little hurts in comparison to his. After his throat operation, President Kimball had no voice. During a testimony meeting in the temple, President David O. McKay asked him to bear his testimony. He could not speak a word. He could only utter inaudible, breathy sounds. He wrote a note to President McKay afterwards and asked, “Why would you do that to me?” The President answered, “Spencer, you must get your voice back, for you still have a great mission to perform.” (What a moving example of the love of one prophet for another.) President Kimball was obedient. He learned how to control air in his throat and to use the scar tissue that developed in his larynx and his remaining vocal cord. He regained his voice and carried on his great work. The accomplishment of President Kimball’s prophetic mission will stand equal to any in this or any other dispensation.</p>

I remember one night in Samoa when both President and Sister Kimball had temperatures of 104 degrees. Early the next morning they were the first ones on the bus. He conducted the meetings, and they fulfilled all their busy schedule throughout the day, not just enduring, but being gracious and considerate and thinking of the needs of everyone else around them.</p>

He wondered if he was worthy of such a great calling. After he hung up the telephone, it was Camilla who assured him, “You can do it, Spencer. You can do it.” Camilla is a perfect example of being one with her companion. When asked about her health, her reply was “When he is well, I’m well.”</p>

He asked if I would come to Salt Lake City to serve as a General Authority for the rest of my life. I was overcome with emotion. My reply: “President Kimball, I just don’t know what to say.” Then he said, “I only want you to say yes.” The lesson was clear; there is no need for an eloquent speech to express our commitment or our love and devotion when accepting a call from the prophet. He already knows these things.</p>

He finished typing and spun around in his chair to greet me. In one hand was a thirty-two-page letter from a young man who had read his bookThe Miracle of Forgiveness and, in the other, his personally typed reply to answer the special needs of a young man who wanted and needed his help to repent. The message was a clear one to me: No matter how busy you are, never forget those who need your help.</p>

I have observed it. At the Copenhagen Denmark Area Conference held August 3–5, 1976, President Kimball went to see Thorvaldsen’s beautiful sculpture <span class="emphasis">The Christus,</span> the resurrected Christ, which has been reproduced, as you know, for the visitors’ centers in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and New Zealand. After a few spiritual moments admiring <span class="emphasis">The Christus,</span> President Kimball bore his testimony to the caretaker who stood nearby. As he turned to the statue of Peter and pointed to the large set of keys in Peter’s right hand, he proclaimed: “The keys of priesthood authority which Peter held as President of the Church I now hold as President of the Church in this dispensation.” Then he stated to the caretaker, “You work every day with Apostles in stone, but today you are in the presence of living Apostles.” He then introduced President N. Eldon Tanner, Elder Thomas S. Monson, and Elder Boyd K. Packer. He presented the caretaker with a Book of Mormon in Danish, and bore his testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The caretaker was moved to tears in acknowledgment of the Spirit he felt in the presence of a prophet and Apostles. He acknowledged to me as we left the church, “Today I have been in the presence of servants of God.”</p>

He does not demand or expect those around him to work at his pace, but at their pace. He is a man of action, demonstrated by the simple sign on his desk that says, “Do It.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p15" pid="9euu4_N3nkiTfJT-Er5C7A" hash="E31VwQ">For those who work with him, his example eliminates phrases such as “I’ll try” or “I’ll do my best.” His example and love motivate those who follow his example to achieve higher goals and lengthen their stride toward perfection. He has that rare ability to encourage each of us to do better than our best and to keep striving until we exceed our goals.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p16" pid="hJudQm9tH0mUNFwsTr1KoA" hash="EPmBVw">During the planning and preparation for the Mexico, Central and South America area conferences in February 1977, we were scheduled to hold meetings in La Paz, Bolivia, which is twelve thousand feet above sea level. Dr. Ernest L. Wilkinson and Dr. Russell M. Nelson advised us that President Kimball should have four to six hours’ rest to acclimate his heart and blood pressure to the high altitude. President Kimball is very tightly scheduled during area conferences, and this allows little time for rest. (In reality, the doctors accompanied the General Authorities so that we could keep up with President Kimball.)</p>

They only smiled and said, “You can try.”</p>

I saw President Kimball make two small red check marks next to La Paz, Bolivia, where there were two meetings that he was not scheduled to attend. “What are these meetings? Why am I not attending?” he asked. There was a pause; then I replied, “That’s a rest period, President Kimball.” And he remarked, “Are you tired, Elder Hales?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p19" pid="YmtFNeX8NUqkBwDeLrm0UA" hash="KxIC8w">We arrived in La Paz, and the first meeting was a cultural event. He would not rest. My head ached; it felt as though it would explode in adjusting to the altitude, and we breathed oxygen to attempt to speed up our being acclimated to the twelve-thousand-foot altitude; but President Kimball took no oxygen. He greeted, embraced, and shook hands with two thousand Saints.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1981/10/examples-from-the-life-of-a-prophet.p20" pid="gkyzDT8uwUmsMdCX2F37BA" hash="5Tx5EA">After the last meeting, he invited one thousand more of his beloved Lamanites, who had come down from the Altiplano, to come shake his hand. They came and embraced him and shook his hand vigorously. He wanted to show his love for the Lamanites.</p>

He asked President Kimball if it would be possible for him to stop soon. President Kimball said, “If you knew what I knew, you wouldn’t ask me that question.” President Kimball is driven by the knowledge that we are preparing for the second coming of Jesus Christ. He knows that it is his responsibility, along with those who are chosen to work with him, to take the message to all nations in their own tongue and language.</p>

What I am afraid of is that I will meet the Savior and he will say, ‘You could have done better.’”</p>

If we knew what President Kimball knows, then we, too, would work with all our heart, might, mind, and strength.</p>

But I don’t want to be saved; I want to be exalted.” He then would tell us that the Lord would sustain him as the prophet, and we should not slow the Church down because of him.</p>

There is truth in that example. We can’t hurt a stranger as much as we can a loved one. We know just what to do to hurt our companions, parents, or brothers and sisters. We know where they are vulnerable. We know how they can be hurt the most by our actions. To many it seems to be a test of faith in life to be wounded by those closest to us. Of Jesus it is said in Zechariah that when asked where he had received the wounds in his hands, he would say that he “was wounded in the house of [his] friends.” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/zech/13.6" class="scriptureRef">Zech. 13:6</a>.) Isn’t it true that God, our Father, and his Son grieve when we sin? When we fail to be obedient and accept the atoning sacrifice of our Lord, aren’t we hurting Him who loves us most?</p>

Suffering can take us one of two ways. It can be a strengthening and purifying experience combined with faith, or it can be a destructive force in our lives if we do not have the faith in the Lord’s atoning sacrifice. The purpose of suffering, however, is to build and strengthen us. We learn obedience by the things we suffer. We should be humbled and drawn to the Lord, as in the case of the prodigal son who appreciated his home only after going into the world and experiencing sorrow when he shut out his loved ones. (See <a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/15.11-32" class="scriptureRef">Luke 15:11–32</a>.) So suffering in his case was a vital part of his repentance.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p2" pid="ZWvRaVhpCUq9BupMksU4uQ" hash="Jj4H6w">In turning to the forty-first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we find where the first Presiding Bishop was called—Edward Partridge. There it was said that he was a guileless man. Concerning that particular attribute, I would like to say of Bishop Brown, Bishop Peterson, and Bishop Clarke how guileless they are and how well they have served. In searching for a Presiding Bishopric, the Lord and the Brethren go through the kingdom to find three men who would be willing to enter a javelin-catching contest.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p3" pid="UiTfucJnlUawo2HwBapamA" hash="IurEDw">Bishop Vandenberg, Bishop Simpson, and Bishop Featherstone have been great examples to me over the years. When I was a bishop in a ward, they were serving in the Presiding Bishopric.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p4" pid="cHi4XZHbIUi_KXIYYduMQQ" hash="Ku532A">If I could give a tribute today at this Easter time to the more than ten thousand bishops and branch presidents throughout the world, I would say how much the office of the bishop embodies the Savior’s characteristics. There are great bishops throughout the world. There is something that happens to a man when he becomes a bishop because he learns more than anything else to honor the call. Once a bishop is ordained, he is never released—the reason being that he holds within him the confidences, which will go to the grave with him, for those whom he serves.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p5" pid="WS9VH5h9O0C2DbP576W4Jw" hash="qlP8mw">The mantle of the bishop includes being president of the Aaronic Priesthood and president of the priests quorum, being a common judge in Israel, being presiding high priest, assisting in temporal matters, providing for the welfare of the Saints through auxiliaries and priesthood councils, and being responsible for tithes and offerings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p6" pid="bbgJdjFMKkGrWQgwQkGnwA" hash="g6mxVA">Have you ever wondered about this mantle which comes upon a bishop? He can sit in a sacrament meeting and look out at his flock and know who is in trouble, look at his Aaronic Priesthood—the deacons, the teachers, and the priests—and know which ones need his counsel. There is a hopeless feeling when you are released as a bishop to become a General Authority, and then return to your home ward where you have been serving and realize you have lost the power of discernment with the ward members. You can’t do what you did as a bishop.</p>

And yet, the Savior himself embodied that characteristic which a bishop and all of us should have. He said, “What, could ye not watch with me one hour?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:40</a>.) They did not understand.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p8" pid="sAHGJ9tVmUy_Zkaa1xaufw" hash="bOLBlg">Sometimes, experience is the best teacher of discernment. We are reminded of President Harold B. Lee who had to lose his sweet companion so that he might understand the agony and anguish of a single person who has lost his or her companion, turning his attention to the singles of the Church. It is in moments like this that we learn.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p9" pid="lhbTf-5aukGlcwip8MitOw" hash="cAOsGA">I remember, too, my mother as she went through eight years of being paralyzed. The last year and a half she needed care around the clock, and my dear father cared for her. One night, a few weeks before she passed away, I knelt at her bed after a word of prayer and she said, “I would like to go to heaven to see Papa.”</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p15" pid="WnFYa_pwWEGjNrMOUMKmcA" hash="uEvDXw">There are many priesthood leaders here from all over the world. These stake presidents, Regional Representatives, and General Authorities know the truth of the counsel once given us by one of the Presiding Bishops of this dispensation, Elder LeGrand Richards. After a weighty discussion in the temple with all the General Authorities, he said, “Now, Brethren, I understand all that we discussed, but until the bishops move, nothing will happen. Everything above the bishop is all talk.” He taught a great lesson.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p16" pid="1GdFBTkhVkKIb8zutWpw-Q" hash="Iq_dRQ">Each priesthood leader who is here this day must go home and make sure the bishops understand the messages which we have heard, for it is in their interviews with the youth, it is in their interviews in calling the people to positions, it is in their compassion for the needy and the widows that the important spiritual things happen in the lives of the Saints. The bishop who utilizes the resources at his hands—the auxiliaries, the priesthood—to fulfill the needs of his people, is a true bishop, not one who follows slavishly a handbook to the detriment of his people.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p17" pid="oNUpgFRIQ0qzqyEiRysoEg" hash="SRsszA">Having said this, I would like to ask the youth and adults who are here, and all within the sound of my voice, that every night and morning you pray for your bishop. He needs your help. He cannot carry the responsibilities on his shoulders without your help and prayers.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p18" pid="afwYCdkyXUKXUzBhlTi3LQ" hash="7fSphw">The story is told of the young child who misbehaved in sacrament meeting. Father and Mother were embarrassed by his actions. Finally, Father was a little disturbed and took the child out. As he went down the aisle, he gave the child a little squeeze. The child knew he was in trouble. As the father turned to go out of the chapel, the child, now up over his father’s shoulder, said, “Bishop, help me!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p19" pid="6iM8jn0wCkeoN996eTtiDg" hash="EFTtgA">All members of the Church can turn to their bishops when they are in need of help and can feel secure in his love for them and can have confidence in following his counsel. Bishops learn not to judge people against a standard of perfection. A bishop learns that he will rejoice with those over whom he presides in any progress they make.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p20" pid="LKy4lkn2eUSo1hlRSNof-g" hash="jPtaTw">In the forty-first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, on that day when Edward Partridge was called, the superscription says, “The members were striving to do the will of God so far as they knew it.” And that’s true today. We strive to do the Lord’s will so far as we know it. The section goes on to say that the Lord asks us to assemble ourselves together to agree upon his word. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/41.2" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 41:2</a>.) If we do that, there will be unity. That unity has been here today. May the Lord’s blessings continue, that “by the prayer of your faith,” as the Lord promises, “ye shall receive my law, that ye may know how to govern my church and have all things right before me.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/41.3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 41:3</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p21" pid="oWtxiVLCoE2W652eEfxfgQ" hash="U2aSdQ">In conclusion, let’s turn to the story of Elijah and Elisha. Elijah had gone from his duties to go up to a cave. The Lord came to him, and he was called to go back to his duties. He had not had a convert for some period of years, but when he went back he found Elisha, who immediately followed him. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.title" class="scriptureRef">1 Kgs. 19</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p22" pid="6AEvkpJSU0CitAGEDF58UQ" hash="ecH6hA">They dwelt and worked together for a few years until the time came when all the priesthood leaders knew that it was time for Elijah to be translated. Elijah and Elisha stood at the banks of the River Jordan. Fifty other priesthood holders stood in view far off as the two stood by the Jordan. “And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.” And Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for thee.” Can you imagine? Then Elijah was translated and departed in a flaming chariot, and the only thing that was left was his mantle. Elisha picked up the mantle, then turned toward the fifty priesthood leaders who were standing afar off. He had to return over the river, so he picked up the cloak, smote the River Jordan, and it parted. (See <a href="/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/2.1-15" class="scriptureRef">2 Kgs. 2:1–15</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p23" pid="Ru8TIe2JhEWjIylmZQTYPw" hash="WW9aQg">I now stand at the Jordan with two sweet counselors, Bishop Eyring and Bishop Pace, as we attempt to cross the River Jordan to serve together. I ask for the blessings of Bishop Brown, Bishop Clarke, and Bishop Peterson, and all those who are here, that my counselors and I might also have that river part so we may return and go about our mission.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p24" pid="NqUcm0-sK0O5JCjBypVSdA" hash="oZyuMw">Bishop Pace said to me when he received his call, “You don’t know me that well.” My response was, “No, but the Lord does.” Bishop Eyring and I have known each other since boyhood. He is a man of God. Sitting in this audience today is Wilber Cox. Both Bishop Eyring and I have served as counselors to him in a stake presidency. He molded us in a way in which we have been blessed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p25" pid="07KpRc2eWEyGdYwasEkybQ" hash="Od31ng">I appreciate being taught by the example of my mother and father. Mother, for fifteen years, was a Relief Society president. After I received my driver’s license, she had me drive her to deliver the welfare supplies and care for the needy. Father would always have me polish the sacrament trays when I was a deacon, and we would bring them home and wash the sacrament cloths and honor the priesthood. When he was in the bishopric, he took care of the outside of the building; and we, as Aaronic Priesthood boys, assisted him.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/04/the-mantle-of-a-bishop.p26" pid="vjNsGMuhzkGmvogn_wg2Vw" hash="lZaa3Q">May the Lord’s blessings be with each and every one of us. It is my testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ. Of this I have no doubt. I give you my testimony with those who have prophesied this day. As I look into their eyes and feel the love I have for them, I ask that we might be able to work together in harmony. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

In the atonement of Jesus Christ, we have been given an example to follow—that of the eldest son of God the Father. I would like to talk for just a few minutes today about the atoning sacrifice and what it has meant in my life, from the perspective of a bishop, in helping us endure to the end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p3" pid="lGyT5Bq9MU2-cQx58BWhwQ" hash="oIEkAg">I’d like first to start in the book of Ether in the Book of Mormon where we are given a very clear lesson as we read about the brother of Jared going before the Lord. Many times when we pray, we merely restate our problems; and this was the case with the brother of Jared. As you may recall, he was directed to take his people across the waters. He had built his barges, but there was no light, there was no air, there was no visible means of propulsion or navigation. And so he went to the Lord and asked, “Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.22" class="scriptureRef">Ether 2:22</a>.) And the Lord replied, “What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.23" class="scriptureRef">Ether 2:23</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p4" pid="MDp6-yUUvkilvNJ4tR974w" hash="RrlqJg">The brother of Jared just a few short verses before this had been scolded by the Lord for a period of three hours for not praying to him. And in this environment, the brother of Jared went away to devise a specific plan. And when he did, he brought sixteen stones, beautiful crystals, laid them before the Lord on the top of Mount Shelem, and there asked the Lord to touch the stones with His finger.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p5" pid="EsUtaJ9nY02-fzotu4pplQ" hash="UUiZFw">The lesson I would like to bring out from this story is that when the Lord touched these stones, the brother of Jared saw His finger. The Lord said, as the brother of Jared fell to the ground, “Arise, why hast thou fallen?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.7" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:7</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p6" pid="cSvo-s2iXkCHJTgD-umjzw" hash="nZmRtQ">And the Lord got an answer that was quite remarkable when the brother of Jared, looking to the Lord, said, “I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.8" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:8</a>.) In verse 16 the Lord explained: “Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.16" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:16</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p7" pid="AhgdykRJjk-2DwotOqk0nw" hash="ZBKZZw">The Lord asked if he had seen more of Him than His finger: “Sawest thou more than this?” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.9" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:9</a>.) The brother of Jared answered, “Nay; Lord, show thyself unto me.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.9-10" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:9–10</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p8" pid="lRyxuNy0q0iPMBQfYT0QtQ" hash="-O-SNw">The Lord then asked the brother of Jared if he would believe in His words; and he said, “Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.12" class="scriptureRef">Ether 3:12</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p9" pid="VNlu-75wZE2BCZQ52u4GWw" hash="4UOEgw">The Lord thus showed Himself twenty-five hundred years before He was actually born as a babe in Jerusalem. He then bore testimony of the fact that He would be Jesus the Christ, that He would come before His people, and that He would be the atoning sacrifice, that all mankind might live.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p10" pid="FOI_kj_b9Eibth9M0sny1w" hash="7YNXiA">As we move closer to the atoning sacrifice in the Garden of Gethsemane, we find in John 17 that there Jesus offered an intercessory prayer. “I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do … before the world was.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.4-5" class="scriptureRef">John 17:4–5</a>.) He then went on to say in verse 24, “For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.24" class="scriptureRef">John 17:24</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p11" pid="dqASk52ylkeSGBCcVdBXGg" hash="Y86wXQ">And so with the love of God the Father, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane. He dropped to His knees in prayer, even sweating great drops of blood. And then, as He departed to go out to see His disciples, He found them asleep. He asked, “What, could ye not watch with me one hour?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.40" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:40</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p12" pid="m-SEQEq1KkSYHGT1-X7A7w" hash="1CNrUw">How many of us are sleeping when those around us are hurting and are in need? How many of us give our testimonies of the Lord, but then do not listen, as in <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.20" class="scriptureRef">1 Jn. 4:20</a>, “For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?”</p>

And for you and me, there is great solace, for “there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/22.43" class="scriptureRef">Luke 22:43</a>.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1985/10/lessons-from-the-atonement-that-help-us-to-endure-to-the-end.p14" pid="p0XQ4541rEi8ZYr4av2eLg" hash="wdEu6g">Do we not understand that we, too, will have moments in our lives when we will be brought to our knees, when we will need help to endure to the end? Even Joseph Smith showed impatience after being in jail for a few months and wondered why he could not get on with his mission. At that time the Lord said to Joseph, “All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:7</a>.) The ways in which we handle our trials are part of the maturing of the physical and spiritual man.</p>

In the trial where Pilate knew very well that the man before him was not guilty, he, for political reasons, had to bring in a verdict of guilty. And in this, Jesus was silent. We learn a good deal from this in our lives when enemies contend against us and when we are falsely accused. There are times when it is best to follow the Lord’s example and not attempt to answer every accusation made against us.</p>

It is comforting to know that, though suffering, Jesus Christ was able to look down from the cross and be concerned for His mother, that she should be properly cared for, as He asked for the help of a disciple. This is one of the great messages we have heard this conference—that we turn some of our attention from our own trials and tribulations to concern and caring for others.</p>

Jesus had cried with a loud voice, “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.” The verse goes on to say, “… and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.46" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:46</a>.) Jesus had endured to the end.</p>

However, in heaven a multitude awaited the advent of the Son of God into the spirit world to declare their redemption from the bands of death. Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame. The spirit and the body were to be united, never again to be divided, that they might receive a fulness of joy. While the vast multitude waited and commenced rejoicing in the hour of their deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared. He preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of the resurrection and redemption of mankind from the Fall and from individual sins on conditions of repentance. (See <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.16-19" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 138:16–19</a>.)</p>

For me, as I see that setting, it is very clear that one accepted Jesus Christ and gave his testimony that Jesus was the Son of God, and the other rejected Him. This is typical of all mankind. Each one of us will someday, either in this life or in the life to come, have to give our testimony that He is truly the Son of God, the Savior of all mankind, Jesus Christ.</p>

Are there times in our lives when we think that we have been forsaken by God, or by our fellow men, or by our families? That is the moment when we have to turn our thoughts back to Christ and endure to the end. We know there is a great purpose in Christ’s suffering because this was an act of free agency. Jesus could have called upon legions of angels to bring Him down from the cross, but He did not. He endured to the end that we would have the benefits of the atoning sacrifice; that mercy could be brought into the world; that justice would be satisfied; that we might be resurrected; and that we might be able to earn, through our obedience, eternal life in the presence of God the Father and Jesus Christ.</p>

A father who was very wealthy asked if I could talk to his family. His daughter had recently been through a divorce. I went to see her and her children. Her father could have provided for all of their needs and cares, but he said it was time for them to live more modestly and to help support themselves, to be more self-sufficient, to be able to stand on their own. This experience is similar to the Lord’s asking His Father, “Why hast thou forsaken me?” for the family’s reaction was, “Why would Father do this now when we need him the most?” But you see, he was preparing them that they might be strengthened by providing for their own needs, so that when they did gain their inheritance, they would be able to endure to the end and remain self-sufficient.</p>

But for me, one of the greatest lessons was taught after Jesus had died, and was resurrected, and came out of the sepulchre. There was Mary—she did not recognize Him at first—then upon recognizing Him, came toward Him. He said, “Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to my Father,” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.17" class="scriptureRef">John 20:17</a>), knowing that He was going to return to His Father in Heaven and then come back to earth and show himself to many as a resurrected being.</p>

Coming full circle back to 3 Nephi, I think of Jesus coming to the temple as a resurrected being after much devastation of the land, similar to what has happened in Mexico recently with earthquakes and rending of the land. In the account in 3 Nephi, the people who were there returned to the temple, and there the Lord came, introduced by His Father: “Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.7" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 11:7</a>.) They were asked to listen to Him, and He descended among them. The most significant event is that the two thousand or so who were assembled at the temple each had the opportunity of thrusting his hands in the sides and in the wounds of the Savior to know of a surety that He lives. And for this they had a few centuries of peace in the land, and all were one.</p>

In fact, the Atonement was the very purpose of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, coming to earth. Unfortunately, we sometimes deviate from that which we know.</p>

By turning the airplane at less than two degrees at a time, the instructor succeeded in turning the airplane completely upside down. My inner ear could not detect the transition because he kept positive gravity upon us at all times. Therefore, I did not know that, when he gave the airplane to me, it was upside down. Everything on the airplane, every instrument, was exactly right except for the landing gear, which was upside down; and every reaction I made had an opposite reaction from what I thought it would have. This is called vertigo, and it taught me a great lesson.</p>

Although we know of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, of His obedience, of His willingness to serve and to be an example to us, and of His message to “come, follow me,” there are times when we get off course, less than a degree at a time, and do not know that we turn totally upside down.</p>

Lee. I was a young man visiting Salt Lake, and he asked me to come by his office. He knew something I didn’t know—that someone would be asking me to represent their organization. He put both of his hands on my shoulders, looked me directly in the eye, and said, “Be careful who you give your name to.”</p>

When we go into the waters of baptism, we take upon us His name and promise that we will always be obedient. Every time we take the sacrament, we remind ourselves that we will always remember Him, that we will take His name upon us, and that we will always keep His commandments. For that obedience, we are told that we will always have His Spirit to be with us. We will always have the spiritual gyroscope that will guide us so that we will never have to encounter spiritual vertigo and that we will never be off course.</p>

Of this I have no doubt. Of this I have never had a doubt since I was a young boy. I testify that the men who are seated here upon this stand—The First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve—are prophets, seers, and revelators. I testify that a prophet of God is among us, even President Spencer W. Kimball, who in his enduring to the end is an example for all of us. That we may watch and be guided by his actions and his love is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Over the past fifty years, inspired leaders have taught welfare principles to help us plan ahead for difficult times that may come in our lives. The Church has grown and is now spread over many countries throughout the world. But the strength of the Church and the Lord’s real storehouse is in the homes and hearts of his people.</p>

With pain, dehydration, fever, and total enervation, an important welfare lesson was learned—that one could suddenly be thrust into a condition of intense need. Experiences such as this help us to become more aware of the needs of others and to realize that many people throughout the world live with these problems every day.</p>

The great teachings of priesthood welfare principles have been taught by many prophets who have gone before in this and other dispensations, and by living prophets here today. They give us direction for the conduct of our lives.</p>

          <p pid="zfuB0EGXEEKLR6cLjX_G6g" hash="QuBjaw">The welfare plan is an integral part of the plan of salvation. Some have become confused about what “welfare” really means. Some approaches to welfare in the world foster idleness, give subsidies with no labor required, create a burden of debt, and promote greediness—an appetite for things of this world rather than the riches of eternity.</p>
          <p pid="1jCC7Ow5Z0OoZ8qunbfAkg" hash="SdoH8Q">Too often rich and poor alike shut their hearts to the divine attributes of love and compassion. The rich languish in their abundance and justify turning the poor away as “welfare cases.” The poor are likewise entrapped, becoming dependent on others in a system destined to trample initiative, undermine family responsibility, foster divisiveness, and erect barriers to equity, opportunity, and fellowship.</p>
          <p pid="Z4JNUAAaJ0GkAohXXq1wxw" hash="2wsFNg">The Lord rejects such welfare programs. His plan meets the needs of all, however abundant or modest their circumstances. His purpose is to provide for our eternal welfare. “The prime duty of help to the poor [in body and spirit] … is not [solely] to bring temporal relief to their needs, but salvation to their souls.” (J. Reuben Clark, Jr., address given 9 July 1941, transcript, Church Historical Department.)</p>
          <p pid="HpohpNIK30SAM4HuxaKQbA" hash="H3iN5w">We are also told that “the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.1" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 12:1</a>.) However, it is the disposition of many men that when all things are done for them, they “harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One—yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.</p>
          <p pid="TGXLBI7-NkqqhVR8TS77dA" hash="7C0Sug">“And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, … they will not remember him.” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Hel. 12:2–3</a>.)</p>
          <p pid="JTVSzqRRlkmbAchbJ7PJcA" hash="TL5Ejg">It is a sobering thought that the purpose of having opposition in all things, trials and tribulations in our lives, commands a concern for the needy in order to humble us and draw us closer to the Lord our God and nearer to perfection.</p>

          <p pid="5u37DR5bcUubxCrCS-_pxA" hash="p4COtw">The scriptures provide the spiritual framework for the welfare plan.

          <p pid="y7jhQ6axk0SeRCYhpY59pw" hash="kc_CIg">The welfare plan builds faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. It shares this position in common with other gospel activities. Temporal challenges humble us and become spiritual opportunities. Temporal challenges bring us to our knees in prayer, seeking heavenly guidance and assistance from the Lord as well as from our brothers and sisters.</p>
          <p pid="jlvk0SYyY0Wby1zkK6GUNw" hash="6VYSkw">As we persist in putting welfare principles to work, adding our strengths and resources to those possessed by others, we can overcome our adversities. Overcoming temporal obstacles demonstrates to us that nothing is too hard for the Lord. Our faith in Christ is confirmed.</p>
        </li>

          <span class="label">4.</span>
          <p pid="3kxc5E5KJ0WPVkeZOKUkbQ" hash="USvT9A">By living welfare principles, we can develop self-reliance. The welfare program requires that we develop self-reliance and live providently. Provident living requires us to develop proper attitudes—a willingness to forego luxuries, to avoid excess, and to fully use what we have—learning to live within our means.</p>
          <p pid="_XLInM5fnEmClCWgxOJk_w" hash="_7-5VA">Unrestricted by programs and projects, bricks and mortar, the Lord’s real storehouse is indeed in the homes and the hearts of His people. As the members of the Church follow the counsel to become self-reliant, they represent an immense pool of resources, knowledge, skills, and charity available to help one another. This storehouse, the Lord has said, is “for the poor of my people, … to advance the cause, which ye have espoused, to the salvation of man, and to the glory of your Father who is in heaven.” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.3-4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 78:3–4</a>.)</p>

          <span class="label">5.</span>
          <p pid="BYDkeFfnO066amJ-x8BBOA" hash="RNCBAQ">The welfare plan builds love and compassion for our fellowmen. As we live the principles of welfare, love and compassion will abound in our homes, in our worship, and in our service to others. Gone will be the lamentable practices of intemperance and abuse of wives and children. Abused children become abusive parents. It is everybody’s responsibility to see that this cycle of abuse is stopped. It is hypocritical to talk of compassion to others while we are rude or abusive within our own families. Let us put our own homes in order, seeing that the spiritual and emotional needs of our families are met. Then no one will escape our empathy and concern—be they rich or poor; old or young; family, neighbors, or strangers within our reach.</p>
          <p pid="YOdHKRZkhU-gnbQ29y4O9g" hash="u0hDeQ">There are many Christian acts of charity in our community that have come to my attention. There are many guardian angels in our communities who care for the transients with a hot meal and a warm place to sleep for an evening. There are many who take custody of orphans and homeless to share their quiet love and compassion. Alma (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.28" class="scriptureRef">Alma 34:28</a>) says if Saints turn away the needy, they are “as hypocrites who do deny the faith.”</p>
          <p pid="zQAHyW6lDUG3JN_N52Kpkw" hash="mleY8g">I know of a family who once a month holds a “provident living family council.” With mother and father, the children determine how $25 out of their budget—in addition to their tithes and offerings—will be distributed to an individual in need. Last month, $25 went to a young child in the Primary Children’s Medical Center. This is one way to teach compassion to children, especially as they visit the sick child in the hospital. (By the way, the children now want to save more money to give to the needy in next month’s budget.) This family does other charitable acts, too. They do not give money and feel that they have done their compassionate service.</p>
          <p pid="YtRshZyAEUu88G03_r7Y0A" hash="sSgPMg">One family made room in their small home for a neighbor family whose home was being repaired after a fire. They were giving not what was convenient for them, but rather what was <span class="emphasis">needed</span> by the neighbor.</p>
          <p pid="dsZZQ3W69Ee-yAZVk9-KeA" hash="v2aNMA">Another family invited their eighteen-year-old son’s friend who needed a home to stay with them for a year while he prepared for a mission. They provided an environment of emotional support and spiritual example and enabled him to earn his own money for his mission. On his mission he grew in maturity, self-esteem, and confidence. Since his mission, with self-reliance, he has gone forward to strengthen others.</p>
          <p pid="dYACBG3r3EW8_Xa73wZYeQ" hash="Bt3aXQ">Financial need is an important part of welfare, but there are other equally important essential elements that, through love and compassion, build self-reliance—emotionally and physically—helping one to be useful and productive and to be a help.</p>

          <p pid="_Ngf_D2SZUWwZJHtPfmwyA" hash="6dO1ew">The welfare plan sanctifies both the giver and the receiver. We are all both givers and receivers. President Marion G. Romney has said, “There is an interdependence between those who have and those who have not. The process of giving exalts the poor and humbles the rich. In the process, both are sanctified.” (Ensign, Nov. 1982, p. 93.)</p>
          <p pid="WuoqKYZU60ah7ZBj7G9ygQ" hash="bxPvZg">No one is exempt from giving to the impoverished. The counsel is: “And again, I say unto the poor … I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: <span class="emphasis">I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.”</span> (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.24" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:24</a>; italics added.)</p>
          <p pid="H6TcVhsACU64TjfZEdabYw" hash="ibXc8Q">No one is exempt from receiving. To the rich, the reality is: “For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, … calling on his name, and begging for a remission of [our] sins” through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ? (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.19-20" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 4:19–20</a>.)</p>

          <span class="label">7.</span>
          <p pid="MDQVgABlJkWV6sanul5Y2w" hash="RbcbJg">The welfare plan builds a Zion People. Zion is characterized in scripture as a city in which the people “were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.” (Moses 7:18.) Zion is “every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.” (D&amp;C 82:19.) This promised Zion always seems to be a little beyond our reach. We need to understand that as much virtue can be gained in progressing toward Zion as in dwelling there. It is a process as well as a destination. We approach or withdraw from Zion through the manner in which we conduct our daily dealings, how we live within our families, whether we pay an honest tithe and generous fast offering, how we seize opportunities to serve and do so diligently. Many are perfected upon the road to Zion who will never see the city in mortality.</p>
          <p pid="TWlVYpxkdk2ZVQMMV2Ri4g" hash="aT2E_Q">So, my bothers and sisters, when we think of welfare, let us think of the plan revealed by our Lord for the eternal welfare of our souls. It is a plan to build faith, love, compassion, self-reliance, and unity. When adapted to local needs throughout the world by vigorous priesthood leaders, the plan sanctifies both givers and receivers and prepares a Zion people.</p>
          <p pid="W83ONMPq7UCg3MGoDnPcLw" hash="zHlGQQ">With these basic welfare principles in mind, today we are being asked to teach and practice the doctrine of work, self-reliance, provident living, giving, and caring for the poor; to increase our generous fastoffering donations to help those in need; to increase our compassionate service, involving the family in charitable acts of service to one another and to our neighbors.</p>
          <p pid="6vcQ_3_0HkGmPeFRVAMAqg" hash="BvQm9w">I bear you my testimony that we live in a dispensation of time when there have been ministering angels. The angel Moroni was one such heavenly messenger. His visit was essential to the restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. But, Joseph Fielding Smith taught us that “it is contrary to the law of God for the heavens to be opened and messengers to come to do anything for man that man can do for himself.” (<span class="emphasis">Doctrines of Salvation,</span> 3 vols., comp. Bruce R. McConkie, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–57, 1:196.)</p>
          <p pid="eYffCAcDpEGMR3wygPJ5aA" hash="DmFUqA">That you and I might realize that we have the power and responsibility to help those in need, as ministering angels for the Lord Jesus Christ, that we will be loved because we love, be consoled because we are compassionate, be forgiven because we have demonstrated the capacity to forgive, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Life’s plan and the challenge to be successful are demonstrated in an Aesop Fable, “The Man, the Boy, and the Donkey.” The objective of the man and the boy was to journey to the city marketplace and sell the donkey for winter provisions. As they started to town, the father rode the donkey. In the first village, the villagers said, “What an inconsiderate man, riding the donkey and making his son walk!” So the father got off the donkey and let his son ride.</p>

To our intelligence we add knowledge as we search for answers, study, and educate ourselves. To our knowledge we add experience, which should lead us to a level of wisdom. In addition to our wisdom, we add the help of the Holy Ghost through our prayers of faith, asking for spiritual guidance and strength. Then, and only then, do we reach an understanding in our hearts—which motivates us to “do what is right; let the consequence follow.” (<span class="emphasis">Hymns,</span> 1985, no. 237.) The feelings of an understanding heart give us the sweet spirit of assurance of not only knowing but doing what is right no matter what the circumstances. The understanding in our hearts comes from a close interdependence of study and prayer.</p>

About three to four years ago, Joe was an alcoholic. Linda, while she did not drink, was co-dependent emotionally on the behavior of an alcoholic husband. She was nearing a nervous breakdown. She had made the decision to save herself and the children from the manipulative behavior of a husband suffering from alcoholism. So she left home, taking the children, except for a fourteen-year-old son.</p>

We cannot remember that Lucifer, a son of God the Father, a brother of Jesus Christ, rebelled against God’s plan and, in his rebellion, promised he would bring us all back home. But Lucifer would have denied us our free agency, the freedom to make decisions. We cannot remember that his plan was not accepted by us because, without choice, there would not have been a purpose for coming to this mortal probation. We would not have had opposition or repentance. We would not have learned obedience.</p>

His team earned the opportunity to play in a New Year’s Day bowl game. Before 100,000 spectators and a large TV audience, his team lost by a huge score. It turned out that he and the other members of his team had not kept the training rules that their coach had tried to teach them. They paid a dear price. They had to live with the consequences of knowing they were not prepared to play the big game; they had to live with the final, very embarrassing score.</p>

When it came time for him to go to the trainer to learn emergency procedures and to precondition his mental and physical responses so that they would be automatic, even instantaneous, this all-American would put his arm around the instructor and say, “Check me off for three hours of emergency procedure.” Then, instead of training, he would go to the swimming pool, pistol range, or to the golf course. Later in the training the instructor said to him, “What are you going to do when there is an emergency and you are not prepared?” His answer, “I am never going to bail out; I am never going to have an emergency.” He never learned the emergency procedures which he should have mastered in preparatory training.</p>

His parachute opened at once. And he slammed to the ground. He received serious injuries but survived.</p>

Some years ago Father, then over eighty years of age, was expecting a visit from a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on a snowy winter day. Father, an artist, had painted a picture of the home of the Apostle. Rather than have the painting delivered to him, this sweet Apostle wanted to go personally to pick the painting up and thank my father for it. Knowing that Father would be concerned that everything was in readiness for the forthcoming visit, I dropped by his home. Because of the depth of the snow, snowplows had caused a snowbank in front of the walkway to the front door. Father had shoveled the walks and then labored to remove the snowbank. He returned to the house exhausted and in pain. When I arrived, he was experiencing heart pain from overexertion and stressful anxiety. My first concern was to warn him of his unwise physical efforts. Didn’t he know what the result of his labor would be?</p>

The walks must be clean. He should not have to come through a snowdrift.” He raised his hand, saying, “Oh, Robert, don’t ever forget or take for granted the privilege it is to know and to serve with Apostles of the Lord.”</p>

While serving in the Aaronic Priesthood, we passed the sacrament using stainless steel sacrament trays which, as a result of spilled water, were often dulled with hard water spots. As a holder of the Aaronic Priesthood, I was responsible for helping to prepare the sacrament. Father asked me to bring home the trays, and together we cleaned them with steel wool until every tray sparkled. When I passed the sacrament, I knew we had participated in making the sacrament ordinance a little more sacred.</p>

This is where Joseph Smith was led to the golden plates which were later translated into the Book of Mormon. Father also took me to the Sacred Grove, where Joseph Smith had prayed to Heavenly Father and was visited in a vision by God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. We prayed together in the grove and expressed our desire to be true and faithful to the priesthood which we held. Father later painted a picture of the place where we had prayed and gave it to me as a reminder of our promises made that day together. It hangs in my office today and serves as a reminder each day of my sacred experience and promises made with my earthly father as well as my Heavenly Father.</p>

The last two years of her life required 24-hour care, he being called by Mother every few minutes, day or night. I shall never forget his example of loving care for his cherished companion. He told me it was small payment for over fifty years of my mother’s loving devotion to him.</p>

On one occasion he was under tremendous stress to produce an advertising campaign. He had come home on a Friday evening and worked most of the night. Saturday morning, after a few hours working in the yard, he retired to his studio to create an advertising campaign for a new product. My sister and I found great delight in chasing each other round and round the dining room table, which was situated in a room directly over his head. He had told us to please stop at least twice, but to no avail. This time he came bounding up the steps and collared me. He sat me down and taught a great lesson. He did not yell or strike me even though he was very annoyed.</p>

One of the greatest privileges and responsibilities given to us is that of being a parent—helping to bring to earth a child of God and having the sacred responsibility to love, care, and guide children back to our Heavenly Father. In many ways earthly parents represent their Heavenly Father in the process of nurturing, loving, caring, and teaching children. Children naturally look to their parents to learn of the characteristics of their Heavenly Father. After they come to love, respect, and have confidence in their earthly parents, they often unknowingly develop the same feelings towards their Heavenly Father.</p>

Nineteen years ago, after my being set apart by the Quorum of the Twelve in the temple as an assistant to the Twelve Apostles, Elder LeGrand Richards gave me two pieces of wisdom that have come to me over and over in the past fifty-some-odd hours that I have known of this call. First was, “Oh, to be a boy and have your whole life ahead of you.” I was forty-two years of age. I am now sixty-one and am once again a boy. There are men sitting on this stand who have been Apostles and in the First Presidency for half my age.</p>

From a tiny acorn, I would grow a great oak tree.” Then he said, “I did it in business, and the oak tree shook. An acorn came down, and they sent me out as a mission president. Then I grew another oak tree; they sent me out a second time as a mission president, and then a third.” Then he talked of being a Presiding Bishop. And each time the oak tree would shake, an acorn would be planted.</p>

I am in need of your prayers at this time of my calling. To be an Apostle of the Lord, I am finding, is a process—a process of repentance and humility, to look inward as we’ve been instructed and ask for forgiveness and strength to be what I should be. Unfortunately, I am not a perfect man, and infallibility does not come with the call. Therefore, I must ask for forgiveness from Heavenly Father for those things which I have done which are less than perfect and ask forgiveness of anyone I might have offended knowingly or unknowingly because of my personality or style.</p>

I have been privileged to work among the finest Brethren that this earth can have in the Quorum of the Seventy—working together and forging our testimonies to further the Lord’s work.</p>

Our testimony provides a guiding light that leads to a commitment which directs our conduct and our way of life. Our testimony is true north on a spiritual compass. It is a moving force that cannot be seen but can truly be felt. It is a burning within that tells us what is right. It is when “your heart tells you things your mind doesn’t know” (Harold B. Lee, “Be Loyal to the Royal within You,” in <span class="emphasis">Speeches of the Year: BYU Devotional and Ten-Stake Fireside Addresses 1973,</span> Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1973, p. 101).</p>

Faith is testimony; testimony is faith. Having a strong testimony allows us to help others in their search for truth. Our testimony is a gift from God. It should be shared, but we do not have the authority to bestow a testimony upon someone else, because a personal testimony is granted by the Holy Ghost. It can aid others in gaining knowledge for themselves—a knowledge abiding in the heart that leaves no room for doubt.</p>

Every one of them has had an unshakable testimony of the reality of God, the divine sonship of Jesus Christ, the truth of the gospel, the Book of Mormon, and the calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith. How did they receive their testimonies? Can we obtain a testimony in the same way?</p>

Joseph had serious reflection about religions of his time. He read in the scriptures that if he lacked wisdom, he could ask of God, and wisdom would be given to him. The passage of scripture found in <a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef">James 1:5</a> came to his heart with great power and feeling. Joseph reflected on the scripture again and again. He retired to the woods to express in humble prayer the desire of his heart, to do as James directed—to ask of God.</p>

They appeared to this young man, who in the eyes of the world seemed to be a common lad, revealing in a few brief moments more truth about the nature of God than was had among all the churches and professions of belief in the entire world. The boy prophet, Joseph, now knew that God the Father and Jesus Christ were separate personages. Each had a body of flesh and bones. They could indeed reveal themselves to their chosen prophets just as they did to the prophets in ancient times. Living testimony, personal revelation, is the foundation stone of true religion.</p>

The Prophet’s martyrdom was a voluntary acceptance of death to seal the testimony of the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135.1" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 135:1</a>) and to bear holy witness of Jesus Christ and his gospel in this dispensation. We do not give our testimony and life in the manner that Joseph Smith, the martyred Prophet, gave his life. Rather, we give testimony by devoted service in our lives each day to lift and strengthen others.</p>

If we consider their lives carefully, we can discover the process by which testimony comes. For example, President Brigham Young received a testimony of the truth of the Book of Mormon after two years of studious consideration. President John Taylor required only three weeks to discover that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ embodied the true religion that existed anciently as recorded in the Bible and now again restored to the earth. President Wilford Woodruff searched diligently for six years before finding the truth. He finally found it in the teachings and testimony of two Mormon missionaries. President Lorenzo Snow was the fifth President of the Church. When he met the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1831, he wrote, “A light arose in my understanding which has never been extinguished” (Daniel H. Ludlow, ed., <span class="emphasis">Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</span> 4 vols., New York: Macmillan, 1992, 3:1367).</p>

McKay was the ninth President of the Church. In his boyhood he desired to know, as Joseph Smith had known, of the reality of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. One day while herding cattle in the foothills near his home, he sought a testimony through prayer. He said:</p>

When he finished his prayer, he waited for an answer. Nothing seemed to happen. Disappointed, he rode slowly on, saying to himself at the time, “No spiritual manifestation has come to me. If I am true to myself, I must say I am just the same ‘old boy’ that I was before I prayed” (ibid.).</p>

While serving a mission in Scotland, Elder McKay received a powerful spiritual manifestation. He later commented, “Never before had I experienced such an emotion. … It was a manifestation for which as a doubting youth I had secretly prayed most earnestly on hillside and in meadow. It was an assurance to me that sincere prayer is answered ‘sometime, somewhere.’” (Francis M. Gibbons, <span class="emphasis">David O. McKay,</span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1986, p. 50).</p>

Though prayer is important in gaining a testimony, we cannot merely ask in prayer for a testimony and expect it to be given immediately to us.</p>

We can compare testimony to the process of watching a photograph develop. Powerful impressions of the Spirit come like flashes of light on receptive photographic film. Like the chemicals needed to develop the picture, certain spiritual conditions and experiences are needed in our lives for our personal testimony to develop into a certain truth and knowledge. And like a photograph, a testimony, if not carefully preserved, will fade with time.</p>

They come when a decision is made to strive to be obedient. Testimonies come during efforts to help, lift, and strengthen others. They come from prayer and from studying the scriptures and applying them in our lives. Whatever our circumstances, there seem to be moments in each of our lives when we can be given the knowledge that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. There is no greater search in life that we can embark upon than the quest to gain a testimony of the truth.</p>

They taught us the importance of being kind to one another, obeying the commandments, and how to receive a fulness of joy and merit eternal life. They have pleaded with us to live more Christlike lives, to emulate the Savior in all we do, and to qualify ourselves to be worthy of the saving and exalting blessings available only in the holy temples of the Lord.

We live in a world of turmoil where we find sadness and destruction in every corner of the world—much of which is brought about by man’s failure to listen to the words of the true prophets of God. How different would the lives have been of those who lived in all dispensations if they had listened to the prophet Moses and followed the Ten Commandments?</p>

The prophets of old taught well the importance of listening to the voice of prophets. The story of Jehoshaphat found in 2 Chronicles 20 is an example. King Jehoshaphat had several great armies coming to battle with him in an attempt to possess his land. Understandably, he was seized with dreadful fear, so he proclaimed a fast throughout all his kingdom and gathered the people of Judah together to plead for guidance from the Lord. Jehoshaphat humbly and earnestly prayed: “O our God, … we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/2-chr/20.12" class="scriptureRef">2 Chr. 20:12</a>).</p>

If the power of the priesthood were not upon the earth, the adversary would have freedom to roam and reign without restraint. There would be no gift of the Holy Ghost to direct and enlighten us; no prophets to speak in the name of the Lord; no temples where we could make sacred, eternal covenants; no authority to bless or baptize, to heal or comfort. Without the power of the priesthood, “the whole earth would be utterly wasted” (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/2.1-3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 2:1–3</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/2.1-3" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 2:1–3</a>). There would be no light, no hope—only darkness.</p>

Through priesthood power we can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost to lead us to truth, testimony, and revelation. This gift is available on an equal basis to men, women, and children. Through the blessings of the priesthood, we can be equipped with “the whole armour of God, that [we] may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil” (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/eph/6.11-18" class="scriptureRef">Eph. 6:11–18</a>).

Before this world was created, the premortal Council in Heaven was held under the direction of the priesthood. The formation of the universe and of the world upon which we live was brought to pass—not by chance, but through the power of the priesthood. The great Creator spoke, and the elements obeyed. The processes of nature that enable us to exist on this planet, the resources of this world that sustain life—all were set into motion and continue their course through the power of God’s magnificent priesthood. While most of the earth’s inhabitants do not recognize this priesthood power, all living creatures are its beneficiaries.</p>

I would like to tell you a story, brethren—a true story about a man named Abinadi. Abinadi was a prophet who preached repentance to a wicked people and a wicked king. He preached boldly and courageously, knowing that he was putting his own life in jeopardy because of his words.</p>

(See <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.1-9" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 13:1–9</a>.)</p>

The Aaronic Priesthood is the preparatory priesthood. It prepares you for the higher priesthood—the Melchizedek Priesthood. As bearers of the Aaronic Priesthood, you must learn to obey the Lord’s commandments. Honor your mother and father, keep the Sabbath day holy, do not take the Lord’s name in vain, honor womanhood, be chaste, do not lie or steal, live the Word of Wisdom, and pay an honest tithing and a generous fast offering. If you keep these commandments and others, you will be richly blessed.</p>

The sacrament that you administer each week is in remembrance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The wondrous gift of the Atonement overcomes physical death unconditionally, and it is infinite because it is for all who have lived or will ever live in mortality. Through the Atonement, we are all redeemed from the Fall of Adam and will be resurrected.</p>

When we are <span class="emphasis">one</span> with God, we walk with spiritual light. Our diligence in keeping the commandments allows the Holy Ghost to dwell within us. We are given the gift of personal revelation. This is a spiritual light that protects us and serves as a beacon, guiding us in righteous ways. It dispels the darkness of the adversary. So powerful is this light that it can reach us even when we are drawn into a black hole of sin so deep and so dark that we believe no spiritual light could ever penetrate.</p>

You learned a simple law of nature, which is also a spiritual law: Light and darkness cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Satan and his disciples cannot tolerate the spiritual light of the gospel; they must immediately depart. Satan cannot command you to do anything. With the priesthood, you can command him to depart in your thoughts and in your actions.</p>

There is no joy in sin. As the prophet Alma taught his son, “Wickedness never was happiness” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/41.10" class="scriptureRef">Alma 41:10</a>).</p>

To fail to do so because of peer pressure is to have the fear of man—to be more afraid of what man thinks about us than what God thinks about us. I have never understood why someone would have a greater concern about man’s opinion than about God’s opinion.</p>

We were all blessed recently to receive an important message from modern prophets, entitled “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” (see <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102). This proclamation warns us what will happen if we do not strengthen the family unit in our homes, our communities, and our nations. Every priesthood holder and citizen should study the proclamation carefully.</p>

They do not preach that which is popular with the world. President Ezra Taft Benson taught that “popularity is never a test of truth” (“Fourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet,” in <span class="emphasis">1980 Devotional Speeches of the Year</span> [1981], 29).</p>

The reason is very simple. Upon receiving revelation, prophets have no choice but to proclaim and reaffirm that which God has given them to tell the world. Prophets do this knowing full well the price they may have to pay. Some who choose not to live the commandments make every effort to defame the character of the prophets and demean their personal integrity and reputation. In response, the prophets remain silent and merely turn the other cheek. The world may see this as weakness, but it is one of the greatest strengths a man can have—to be faithful, unyielding, and unwavering to that which he knows to be true, accepting whatever consequences may follow.</p>

Priesthood leaders do not have the right to change revealed principles and commandments just for the sake of being popular with the world. Nor do prophets have the authority to alter God’s commandments in order to make them more palatable to those who are weak in their resolve to live worthily.</p>

In his grief the parent had suggested that the Church leader was unchristian in denying the child the full benefits of membership in the Church.</p>

In response to the accusation of not being a Christian, the leader said, “If I were to attempt to change the commandments, at that very moment I would no longer be following Christ’s teachings.”</p>

To the woman taken in adultery, Christ did not soften the commandment to not commit adultery. Rather, He counseled her to “sin no more” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.11" class="scriptureRef">John 8:11</a>). He promises all of us forgiveness through repentance. It is we who must change, not the commandments.</p>

Let us study and ponder the scriptures and listen to the counsel of living prophets. Let us teach and testify of the truthfulness of the commandments in our homes and elsewhere as directed by the Spirit. Let our lives reflect our love of the Lord by being obedient to the commandments and reaping the promised blessings both in this life and in the life to come. “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/19.17" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 19:17</a>).</p>

Our highest aspiration is to be like them. The Apostle Paul taught that God is the father of our spirits (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/heb/12.9" class="scriptureRef">Heb. 12:9</a>). From the proclamation we read, “In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life.” The proclamation also reiterates to the world that “marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> Nov. 1995, 102).</p>

To receive the blessings of the sealing that our Heavenly Father has given to us, we have to keep the commandments and conduct ourselves in such a way that our families will want to live with us in the eternities. The family relationships we have here on this earth are important, but they are much more important for their effect on our families for generations in mortality and throughout all eternity.</p>

When families are functioning as designed by God, the relationships found therein are the most valued of mortality. The plan of the Father is that family love and companionship will continue into the eternities. Being one in a family carries a great responsibility of caring, loving, lifting, and strengthening each member of the family so that all can righteously endure to the end in mortality and dwell together throughout eternity. It is not enough just to save ourselves. It is equally important that parents, brothers, and sisters are saved in our families. If we return home alone to our Heavenly Father, we will be asked, “Where is the rest of the family?” This is why we teach that families are forever. The eternal nature of an individual becomes the eternal nature of the family.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p20" pid="o5JlEvZm-0-QZVYkgH4_Tw" hash="WcdMOw">The eternal nature of our body and our spirit is a question often pondered by those who live in mortality. All people who will ever live on earth are members of a human family and are eternal children of God, our loving Heavenly Father. After birth and tasting of death in mortality, all will be resurrected because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God the Father. Depending on our individual obedience to the laws, ordinances, and commandments of God, each mortal can have the blessing of attaining eternal life; that is, returning to live in the presence of their Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, having eternal increase for all the eternities to come. Through making and keeping the sacred covenants found in the temple ordinances, individuals can return to the presence of God and will be reunited with their families eternally.</p>

In the past year I have witnessed the blessings of joy which come to those who honor and revere the gospel teaching of the eternal family during times of adversity in their lives.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p23" pid="xTbcwFkUIEO0kjRifxRKrg" hash="Wapjng">A few months ago I had the opportunity of visiting a man who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. As a devoted priesthood holder, he was confronted with the realities of mortality. He found strength, however, in the example of the Savior, who said, in the Lord’s Prayer, “After this manner therefore pray ye: … Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/6.9-10" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 6:9–10</a>). My friend took courage in knowing that as Jesus was required to endure great pain and agony in the Garden of Gethsemane while completing the atoning sacrifice, He uttered the words, “O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.42" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:42</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p24" pid="yXZrKB9-9UqgXSKOGs1owQ" hash="_QQuPw">My friend came to accept the phrase “Thy will be done” as he faced his own poignant trials and tribulations. As a faithful member of the Church, he was now confronted with some sobering concerns. Particularly touching were his questions, “Have I done all that I need to do to faithfully endure to the end?” “What will death be like?” “Will my family be prepared to stand in faith and be self-reliant when I am gone?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p25" pid="jZ5Hnxjv3UumVzoRc5EGEA" hash="NHDjXA">We had the opportunity to discuss all three questions. They are clearly answered in the doctrine taught to us by our Savior. We discussed how he had spent his life striving to be faithful, to do what God asked of him, to be honest in his dealings with his fellowmen and all others, to care for and love his family. Isn’t that what is meant by enduring to the end? We talked about what happens immediately after death, about what God has taught us about the world of spirits. It is a place of paradise and happiness for those who have lived righteous lives. It is not something to fear.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p26" pid="YsYoRg3sSkm6Ow5PQbt92A" hash="mb7rsQ">After our conversation, he called together his wife and the extended family—children and grandchildren—to teach them again the doctrine of the Atonement that all will be resurrected. Everyone came to understand that just as the Lord has said, while there will be mourning at the temporary separation, there is no sorrow for those who die in the Lord (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/rev/14.13" class="scriptureRef">Rev. 14:13</a>; <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.46" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 42:46</a>). His blessing promised him comfort and reassurance that all would be well, that he would not have pain, that he would have additional time to prepare his family for his departure—even that he would know the time of his departure. The family related to me that on the night before he passed away, he said he would go on the morrow. He passed away the next afternoon at peace, with all his family at his side. This is the solace and comfort that comes to us when we understand the gospel plan and know that families are forever.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p27" pid="f0mktfLFCUaFJiA9o7nyXA" hash="ecX4pg">Contrast these events with an incident which happened to me when I was a young man in my early twenties. While serving in the Air Force, one of the pilots in my squadron crashed on a training mission and was killed. I was assigned to accompany my fallen comrade on his final journey home to be buried in Brooklyn. I had the honor of standing by his family during the viewing and funeral services and of representing our government in presenting the flag to his grieving widow at the graveside. The funeral service was dark and dismal. No mention was made of his goodness or his accomplishments. His name was never mentioned. At the conclusion of the services, his widow turned to me and asked, “Bob, what is really going to happen to Don?” I was then able to give her the sweet doctrine of the Resurrection and the reality that, if baptized and sealed in the temple for time and all eternity, they could be together eternally. The clergyman standing next to her said, “That is the most beautiful doctrine I have ever heard.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p28" pid="Adi7pBcmnE2Lwjkpmi6bnA" hash="GP8mpg">The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ brings great comfort in stressing times of mortality. It brings light where there is darkness and a calming influence where there is turmoil. It gives eternal hope where there is mortal despair. It is more than just beautiful doctrine. It is a reality in our lives that if we can be obedient and obtain the eternal rewards that God grants us, if we will draw nigh unto Him and embrace the eternal doctrine, we will be blessed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p29" pid="VxjOIvvyt0mUOjOcm4AyWA" hash="PjdzUw">Another incident that has touched my life recently happened when a young man with a terminal illness passed away. He knew that his illness would first take away his manual dexterity and his ability to walk, then its progression would take his ability to speak, and finally his respiratory system would cease to function. But he also had faith that families are forever. With this knowledge, he spoke to each of his children through video recordings for use when he was gone. He produced recordings to be given to his sons and daughters at important, sacred occasions in their lives, such as baptisms, priesthood ordinations, and weddings. He spoke to them with the tender love of a father who knew that while his family was forever, for a time he would not physically be able to be with them, but spiritually he would never leave their side.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p30" pid="rEZSjJeiJEizPZsiXvCnkw" hash="RdCpzw">The examples of faith shown by steadfast widows and widowers, along with that of their children, after the passing of a spouse or parent are an inspiration to all of us. Great lessons can be learned as we observe their faith and obedience as they strive to remain faithful so that they can once again be together as families through eternity.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p31" pid="aH8HaaQAt0a1Mva6yQ9Nlg" hash="CndUDA">The knowledge and understanding of the doctrine that God lives and Jesus is the Christ and that we have an opportunity to be resurrected and live in the presence of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, makes it possible to endure otherwise tragic events. This doctrine brings a brightness of hope into an otherwise dark and dreary world. It answers the simple questions of where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going. These are truths that must be taught and practiced in our homes.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1996/10/the-eternal-family.p32" pid="TZrsW8ujL06TH6A6IAz3BA" hash="pDTdYw">God lives. Jesus is the Christ. Through His Atonement we will all have the opportunity of being resurrected. This is not just an individual blessing; it is much more than that. It is a blessing to each one of us and to our families. That we may be eternally grateful, that we can live in the presence of God the Eternal Father and His Son Jesus Christ, that we may be together in the eternities to come, that we might understand the joy, and that we not only teach this doctrine but live true to it in our lives and in our families, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

A desire to know the truth is like a seed which grows in the fertile ground of faith, patience, diligence, and long-suffering (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27-41" class="scriptureRef">Alma 32:27–41</a>). There have been some miraculous conversions recorded in the scriptures. The miraculous conversion of Saul is one such example illustrated when he asked two vital questions: “Who art thou, Lord? … [and] What wilt thou have me to do?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/9.5-6" class="scriptureRef">Acts 9:5–6</a>). On occasion individuals can have such experiences, but for the most part, conversion happens over a period of time as study, prayer, experience, and faith will help us to grow in our testimony and conversion.</p>

Alma then had to demonstrate great faith in the words of Abinadi as he sought to bring about a mighty change of heart. This change of heart strengthened his conversion with a desire to forsake his sins. The conversion of each member of the Church is not unlike that of Alma (see Mosiah 17).</p>

In the conversion process, we experience repentance, which brings about humility and a broken heart and contrite spirit, preparing us for baptism, remission of sins, and receiving the Holy Ghost. Then, over time and through our faithfulness, we overcome trials and tribulations and endure to the end.</p>

Honoring the priesthood and being obedient in living the commandments are important elements in the conversion process. Adult male members receive the Aaronic Priesthood soon after baptism. After a period of time, if worthy, they should receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, and each individual in the family shares the blessings of the priesthood in the home. Women are welcomed and enjoy the blessings of sisterhood in the Relief Society. Youth develop friendships as they associate in the Young Men and Young Women organizations. The children are blessed as they are taught and feel the love of caring teachers in the Primary.</p>

We are taught that a seed can grow, become a tree, and bear fruit. But we have to have good soil to accept the good seed, and that is one of our roles in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—that we provide the soil which nurtures the seed so it can grow and bear fruit and that the fruit remains (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.16" class="scriptureRef">John 15:16</a>). Many are strong enough to endure to the end. Without receiving a warm hand of fellowship, some become discouraged and unfortunately may lose the spirit that brought them to the waters of baptism. What was once a centerpiece in their existence is pushed aside for what they may perceive to be an offense, more pressing matters of the day, or it is simply lost in the shuffle of living. To labor for the conversion of one’s self and others is a noble and joyful task.</p>

Peter was still learning, as we must continue to learn. “Lovest thou me?” asked the Savior three times (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.15-17" class="scriptureRef">John 21:15–17</a>). “Lovest thou me?” Peter was hurt and taken aback. “Thou knowest that I love thee,” he replied (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/21.17" class="scriptureRef">John 21:17</a>).

It was the Passover season. The people were celebrating and rejoicing in the goodness of God for having saved their forefathers. Jesus had assembled His Apostles in the Upper Room for the Last Supper. He gave a foreshadow of the events to come, of His atoning sacrifice so that all mankind—those who had lived, those who were then living, and all those who would ever live on earth—would benefit from His atoning sacrifice. By Him and through Him all men would be resurrected. Mercy would overcome justice. Provision was made that we could repent from our sins, be obedient to His commandments, and be able to return to His presence. This was doctrine that was not easy for those who lived in His time to understand. At the conclusion of the evening, He instituted the sacrament.</p>

Our solar system centers on the sun, one of a huge group of stars on the order of 100 billion stars swirling around a huge pinwheel-shaped mass called the Milky Way galaxy, which is about 100,000 light-years across. Astronomers cannot see to the end of the universe, but evidence suggests that the vastness of space contains billions of galaxies stretching for an expanse of 5 billion to 15 billion light-years away from the sun.

His Son, Jesus Christ, was at His right hand and participated with Him in the creation of this world and many other worlds. This is the same Jesus who came to earth as a babe in Bethlehem. This is what the scriptures mean when they speak of the condescension of God.</p>

Jesus participated in the Great Council of Heaven, where it was decided that earth, a mortal world, would be created and that our spirits would dwell in a temporal, physical body. In mortality we have the opportunity to accept Jesus Christ and learn to keep His commandments.</p>

When we comprehend His divinity and His greatness, we remember Him with reverence and humility. When we read of the Nativity and the birth of a babe in Bethlehem; of the growing-up years of the youth of Jesus in Nazareth; of His mission around the Sea of Galilee, Capernaum, and Cana; and then of His final days in Jerusalem and His sacrifice, we are in remembrance of Him. All of these things are brought to mind.</p>

All of these miracles were manifestations of His divine power, culminating in His Atonement and His Resurrection.</p>

Jesus tried to bring them to live a higher law. When He was resurrected, He said, “In me is the law of Moses fulfilled” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.17" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 9:17</a>). Jesus taught how to progress beyond the behavioral law of Moses when He gave the Beatitudes and the Lord’s Prayer. He taught a law of love, a law of forgiveness of one another. He taught that we should do unto others as we would want others to do unto us. He taught that we should love the Lord with all our hearts and our neighbor as ourselves. When the people, still thinking in terms of the law of Moses mentality, asked, “Who is our neighbor?” He gave the parable of the good Samaritan, showing that the compassion that He was teaching should go across cultural and ethnic lines and applies to all. Many people who had been keeping the law of Moses rejected His gospel of love.</p>

How we treat our family members, our neighbors, business associates, and all we meet will reveal if we have taken His name upon us and do always remember Him. How we conduct our lives, all we do and all we say, reflects on how we remember Him. If we truly love Him, we will keep His commandments as He has asked. Very simply, He said, “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.15" class="scriptureRef">John 14:15</a>).</p>

Jesus is the great Mediator. Though omnipotent and omniscient, all-powerful and all-knowing, He is our friend. After counseling early Brethren of the Church to “set in order your own house,” He said, “I will call you friends, for you are my friends” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.43,45" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 93:43, 45</a>). With all of His greatness, He has said that He is our friend. We have been asked to be a friend to our neighbors and to teach them the gospel, and to be a friend to new converts, that the fruit of our labors may remain (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/15.16" class="scriptureRef">John 15:16</a>). Our prophet has asked us to be a friend. Can our prophet expect anything less?</p>

That Spirit of the Lord is light. “Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the light of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.28" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 11:28</a>; see also <a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.18" class="scriptureRef">3 Ne. 9:18</a>). “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/8.12" class="scriptureRef">John 8:12</a>). This is “the light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.13" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 88:13</a>). Light and darkness cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Where the light of Christ is found, the darkness of Lucifer, even Satan, must depart, defeated. May we follow the light and choose the right.</p>

He had the ability to die from His mortal mother, Mary, and the ability to overcome death from His immortal Father. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, went willingly and deliberately to His death, having told His followers that this would happen. Why? one might ask. The answer: to give immortality to all mankind and the promise of eternal life to those who believed in Him (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/3.15" class="scriptureRef">John 3:15</a>), to give His own life for a ransom for others (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/20.28" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 20:28</a>), to overcome Satan’s power, and to make it possible for sins to be forgiven. Without Jesus’ Atonement, there would be an impassable barrier between God and mortal men and women. When we comprehend the Atonement, we remember Him with awe and gratitude.</p>

She turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus. Thinking He was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.” Jesus said to her, “Mary.” Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord” (New International Version, <a href="/scriptures/nt/john/20.15-16,18" class="scriptureRef">John 20:15–16, 18</a>).</p>

For you and me, we have to understand the loving nature of our Savior. We are not left alone. He has given us this day, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, a restoration of the gospel in these latter days. He has provided another testament of Jesus Christ in the Book of Mormon. He has restored the priesthood and the keys that He gave to Peter, James, and John when He was with them and they were His Apostles. They came to Joseph Smith and restored those same keys in 1829. Additional priesthood keys were brought by Elijah, Moses, and Elias after the appearance of the Savior in the Kirtland Temple on April 3rd of 1836. These keys have been given for the ordinances of the temple (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.title" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 110</a>).</p>

I went from the bed to a wheelchair to standing and walking in over a five-month period. … I have learned many great truths from my diverse trials this past year. Prayers are really answered. Fasting is a power in my family. Love has kept me alive. … I have learned what I can tolerate. … Throughout all of this I have learned that I am a lot stronger than I thought. I have learned that if you need help, it is OK to ask for it; we all have our limits, strengths, and weaknesses. … All knowledge … is ‘spendable currency’ for me. Like a baby bird broken from its shell, I am learning to fly again” (letter from Elizabeth Merkley).</p>

The Lord has called young men to be missionaries. Missionaries are not sent just to have friends and families bid them good-bye. They are called to serve an honorable mission and return home with honor. To do that, they know who they are—missionaries of the Lord’s Church. They know their objective—to find and teach those who are ready to receive the gospel of Jesus Christ and to help establish His Church. They develop patience in overcoming trials and tribulations which surely will come. They are humble enough to learn new skills and have a determination to endure to the end. No matter what a missionary sacrifices to go on a mission, he must be obedient on his mission to receive the blessings that are rightfully his.</p>

I am naturally shy. I get nervous and tongue-tied talking to strangers.” Or “I have difficulty learning and the discussions will be difficult for me.” The Lord doesn’t promise to remove our handicaps when we become missionaries; but by making the extra effort it will take, we develop more ability to cope with individual shortcomings, and that coping ability will be needed throughout our lives in our relationship with others, in our employment, and in our families. Everyone has something they must learn to master. Some are just more obvious than others.</p>

When a young elder leaves the comfort of family and friends and masters the skills of functioning in the real world, he becomes a man and develops more faith in the Lord to guide him.</p>

Giving the best he knows when he arrives will not fulfill the calling. Enduring requires doing better than your best of today by developing additional gifts as granted from the Lord. It takes faith to listen to the Lord and to mission leaders and learn how to accomplish whatever missionaries are called to do. Of course, it is difficult. That’s what makes it such a gift and why it has such great rewards. We must recognize who we are and achieve our ultimate purpose. We must then resolve to overcome all obstacles with great determination to endure to the end.</p>

To endure to the end takes great faith. In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus “fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.39" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:39</a>).</p>

Some may say if we have enough faith, we can sometimes change the circumstances that are causing our trials and tribulations. Is our faith to change circumstances, or is it to endure them? Faithful prayers may be offered to change or moderate events in our life, but we must always remember that when concluding each prayer, there is an understanding: “Thy will be done” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.42" class="scriptureRef">Matt. 26:42</a>). Faith in the Lord includes trust in the Lord. The faith to endure well is faith based upon accepting the Lord’s will and the lessons learned in the events that transpire.</p>

It is my prayer that we can find the faith, courage, and strength to endure to the end so that we may feel the joy of faithfully returning to the arms of our Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Because of skilled doctors; a caring and well-trained medical staff; my wife, Mary, who is my patient, loving, and constant caregiver; and the prayers offered by so many in my behalf, I have been blessed with renewed health and strength. Thank you for your concern and for your prayers.</p>

It is a message to lead you and me to the Great Healer, the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is a plan to read the scriptures, pray, ponder, repent if necessary, and be healed with the peace and joy of His Spirit. May I share my ponderings as I went through the healing process.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/healing-soul-and-body.p3" pid="qY245m92Fk6tys4hhXtPjQ" hash="VBLU_Q">While I was lying in my hospital bed and for several weeks at home, my physical activity was severely restricted by intense pain which disabled my weakened body, but I learned the joy of freeing my mind to ponder the meaning of life and the eternities. Since my calendar was wiped clean of meetings, tasks, and appointments, for a number of weeks I was able to turn my attention away from matters of administration to matters of the eternities. The Lord has told us, “Let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43.34" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 43:34</a>). I discovered that if I dwelt only upon my pain, it inhibited the healing process. I found that pondering was a very important element in the healing process for both soul and body. Pain brings you to a humility that allows you to ponder. It is an experience I am grateful to have endured.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/1998/10/healing-soul-and-body.p4" pid="PvGoV6FG6EG3qpbjpFyloA" hash="DnVXpA">I pondered deeply the purpose of pain and studied in my mind what I could learn from my experience and began to comprehend pain a little better. I learned that the physical pain and the healing of the body after major surgery are remarkably similar to the spiritual pain and the healing of the soul in the process of repentance. “Therefore, care not for the body, neither the life of the body; but care for the soul, and for the life of the soul” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.37" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 101:37</a>).</p>

To receive the Lord’s comfort, we must exercise faith. The questions Why me? Why our family? Why now? are usually unanswerable questions. These questions detract from our spirituality and can destroy our faith. We need to spend our time and energy building our faith by turning to the Lord and asking for strength to overcome the pains and trials of this world and to endure to the end for greater understanding.</p>

The family members feel the pain of separation but are comforted by the peace that comes from priesthood blessings, family prayers, and the knowledge of the Resurrection that assures them they will be reunited with their loved one in the not-too-distant future.

Repentance brings about spiritual healing of the soul. In an address to his people, King Benjamin said, “Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.38" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 2:38</a>).</p>

Father Adam and Mother Eve taught their sons and daughters the gospel. The sacrifices of Abel were accepted by the Lord, whom he loved. Cain, on the other hand, “loved Satan more than God” and committed serious sins. Adam and Eve “mourned before the Lord, because of Cain and his brethren,” but they never ceased to teach their children the gospel (see <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.12,18,20,27" class="scriptureRef">Moses 5:12, 18, 20, 27</a>; <a href="/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.1,58" class="scriptureRef">Moses 6:1, 58</a>).</p>

It is frightening to allow our children to learn from the mistakes they may make, but their willingness to choose the Lord’s way and family values is greater when the choice comes from within than when we attempt to force those values upon them.

They will have to pay their debt to justice; they will suffer for their sins; and may tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last, like the penitent Prodigal, to a loving and forgiving [mother’s and] father’s heart and home, the painful experience will not have been in vain.

I also learned that I would not be left alone to meet these trials and tribulations but that guardian angels would attend me. There were some that were near angels in the form of doctors, nurses, and most of all my sweet companion, Mary. And on occasion, when the Lord so desired, I was to be comforted with visitations of heavenly hosts that brought comfort and eternal reassurances in my time of need.</p>

He was baptized to witness to His Father that He would be obedient in keeping His commandments.

We need to do a better job of teaching our children and our grandchildren to understand what it means to enter the kingdom of God, for we will be held accountable. Many members of the Church do not fully understand what happened when they went into the waters of baptism. It is very important for us to understand the marvelous gift of the remission of sins, but there is much more. Do you understand and do your children understand that when they are baptized they are changed forever? Adult converts to the Church often have a better understanding of this transformation because they feel the contrast as they come out of the world into the kingdom of God.</p>

Our young men and women are bombarded with ugly things of the world. Companionship with the Spirit will give them the strength to resist evil and, when necessary, repent and return to the strait and narrow path. None of us are immune from the temptations of the adversary. We all need the fortification available through the Holy Ghost. Mothers and fathers should prayerfully invite the Holy Spirit to dwell in their dedicated homes. Having the gift of the Holy Ghost helps family members make wise choices—choices that will help them return with their families to their Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, to live with Them eternally.</p>

They love God and their fellowmen. Their minds and hearts are centered on the Savior’s atoning sacrifice. From the moment of their respective conversions, Enos, Alma the Younger, Paul, and others turned wholeheartedly to the task of bringing themselves and their fellowmen to God. Worldly power and possessions lost their former significance. The sons of Mosiah refused an earthly kingdom and risked their lives for the sake of others. These faithful sons were driven by the hope that they might be able to help save even one soul—thus winning for themselves and their brethren a place in God’s eternal kingdom.</p>

Our dress will be modest, our thoughts pure, our language clean. The movies and television we watch, the music we listen to, the books, magazines, and newspapers we read will be uplifting. We will choose friends who encourage our eternal goals, and we will treat others with kindness. We will shun the vices of immorality, gambling, tobacco, liquor, and illicit drugs. Our Sunday activities will reflect the commandment of God to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. We will follow the example of Jesus Christ in the way we treat others. We will live to be worthy to enter the house of the Lord.</p>

You have valuable experience. You have raised a family and served in the Church. Just go and be yourselves.

I learned this firsthand while serving as a mission president in England. I assigned a couple who had been serving in the visitors’ center to work in a small, struggling unit. They were somewhat fearful of having to leave the “safe haven” of the visitors’ center. But with faith they went to work. Within six months, a unit which had 15 to 20 people coming to sacrament meeting had over 100 attending because of this couple’s fellowshipping, working with the priesthood. To this day, they and their children refer to that time as the greatest experience of their lives.</p>

When it came time for them to leave, the entire branch rented a bus so they could go to the airport, four hours away, and say good-bye to their special friends.</p>

He beseeched them to leave their familiar settings behind and become fishers of men. What is asked of couple missionaries is less than half a tithe of the time they will spend on earth. In the eternal perspective, a mission is but a few moments away from familiar settings, family, and having retirement fun with old friends.</p>

Couples are sometimes concerned that in their absence they will miss weddings, births, family reunions, and other family events. We have learned that the impact on families while grandparents are on missions is worth a thousand sermons. Families are greatly strengthened as they pray for their parents and grandparents and read letters sent home which share their testimonies and the contribution they are making in the mission field.</p>

As a result, they are more willing to serve in their callings in the Church. It teaches us all to be more charitable as we exchange letters and send packages. When we receive letters and news from you, it strengthens our testimonies. Even though you retired from your profession and should have been happy by all the world’s standards, by going on your mission you have shown us a new way to be happy. You have found happiness money can’t buy. We have seen you overcome medical and other types of adversities and have seen you blessed for your willingness to go and leave your children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.

Many of us were baptized at eight years of age, which the scriptures tell us is the age of accountability when we have the ability to know right from wrong, to know who we are—children of God—why we are here on earth, and what we are trying to accomplish (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68.25,27" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 68:25, 27</a>).</p>

The Aaronic Priesthood is called the preparatory priesthood. This second decade of our lives is a preparatory period. It is a time in which we prepare to make the great decisions that lie ahead. We prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, to take upon us our temple covenants, and to fulfill all of our priesthood responsibilities so that we can fulfill our duty to God.</p>

It is one of the basic ways we witness our faith in Him and our obedience to His laws and commandments. Tithing is one of the commandments that qualifies us, by our faith, to enter the temple—the house of the Lord.</p>

When asked whether members of the Church could be baptized for the dead if they had not paid their tithing, President John Taylor, then of the Quorum of the Twelve, answered: “A man who has not paid his tithing is unfit to be baptized for his dead. … If a man has not faith enough to attend to these little things, he has not faith enough to save himself and his friends.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

By sacrificing to the Lord what we may think we need or want for ourselves, we learn to rely on Him. Our faith in Him makes it possible to keep temple covenants and receive eternal temple blessings. Pioneer Sarah Rich, wife of Charles C. Rich, wrote in her journal after leaving Nauvoo, “Many were the blessings we had received in the House of the Lord, which [have] caused joy and comfort in the midst of all our sorrows, and enabled us to have faith in God, knowing He would guide us and sustain us in the unknown journey that lay before us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

Payment of tithing encourages us to be honest in our dealings with our fellowmen. We learn to trust that what we have been given, through the blessings of the Lord and our own diligent efforts, is sufficient for our needs.</p>

Early in this dispensation, the Lord commanded certain members of the Church to live the higher law of consecration—a law received by covenant. When this covenant was not kept, great tribulations came upon the Saints.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> The law of consecration was then withdrawn. In its place the Lord revealed the law of tithing for the whole Church.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> On July 8, 1838, He declared:</p>

Until the day when we are required to live this higher law, we are commanded to live the law of the tithe, which is to freely<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> give one-tenth of our income annually.</p>

Some of these blessings are temporal, just as tithes are temporal. But like the outward physical ordinances of baptism and the sacrament, the commandment to pay tithing requires temporal sacrifice, which ultimately yields great spiritual blessings.</p>

Although they earned little, they faithfully paid their tithing and saved all that they could to journey to the house of the Lord. After a year, the husband’s brother—not a member of the Church—unexpectedly came forward and offered them two airplane tickets. This temporal blessing made possible the spiritual blessings of their temple endowments and sealing. An additional spiritual blessing came later as the brother, touched by the couple’s humble faithfulness, joined the Church.</p>

But to receive them, we must obey the law upon which they are predicated.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> In the case of tithing, the Lord has said, “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>

Sadly, this is what we do when we fail to pay our tithing. We say no to the very blessings we are seeking and praying to receive. If you are one who has doubted the blessings of tithing, I encourage you to accept the Lord’s invitation to “prove [Him] now herewith.” Pay your tithing. Unlock the windows of heaven. You will be abundantly blessed for your obedience and faithfulness to the Lord’s laws and commandments.</p>

As the hymn says, it is “sacrifice [that] brings forth the blessings of heaven,” not the sum of our contributions.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> Members who freely give a full 10 percent of their annual income receive all of the promised blessings of tithing, whether the amount is a widow’s mite or a king’s ransom.</p>

Etched in the beautiful stained glass windows which had been brought from Europe was the name of their donor; carved into the majestic pulpit made from the cedars of Lebanon were the initials of a wealthy benefactor; the most desirable pews were named after prominent families who had donated the most to the chapel building fund.</p>

I have sat on this council for 17 years, as the Presiding Bishop of the Church and now as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Without exception, the tithing funds of this Church have been used for His purposes.</p>

Too often we as parents do not teach and encourage our children to live this law because their contribution only amounts to a few cents. But without a testimony of tithing, they are vulnerable. In their teenage years, they become attracted to clothes, entertainment, and expensive possessions and risk losing the special protection that tithing provides.</p>

When he returns home and faces the pressures of schooling, starting a family, and a career, will the law of tithing become easier to live? Likewise, will a young woman be worthy to serve the Lord and make celestial marriage covenants without having gained a testimony of tithing for herself? Will she be prepared to teach her children a law she has not learned by her own experience? O what faithfulness is required of fathers and mothers who would unitedly call down the protective blessings of tithing upon their family and the blessings that are rightfully theirs! Said President Lorenzo Snow: “Teach the children to pay tithing, so that it may be perpetually observed. If we observe this law, no matter what our enemies may do, the Lord will preserve us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span></p>

Your bishop will be gentle and kind. He will understand the challenges you face. If you cannot pay back what you missed paying in the past, go forward. Begin today. Share with your bishop your commitment to pay a full tithe in the future, and work out a plan to return to the temple as soon as possible. As soon as you have demonstrated your faith in paying tithing over a period of time and kept the other necessary commandments, you will be able to enjoy the eternal blessings of the temple. I plead with you, do not let this opportunity pass by. Do not procrastinate.</p>

Help your young men and young women consult their records and take inventory of their annual increase. What a marvelous opportunity this is to plant the seed of faith in the hearts of your children. You will start them on a path that leads to the temple. The generations of your ancestors before you and your posterity after you will rise up and call you blessed, for you will have prepared your children to perform saving ordinances on their behalf. It is no coincidence, my brothers and sisters, that under the direction of God’s living prophet on the earth today, President Gordon B. Hinckley, temples are spreading over the earth. Keeping the commandments, which includes paying our tithing, will qualify us to enter those temples, be sealed to our families, and receive eternal blessings.</p>

I know of two missionaries who visited a very poor family. The family’s home was made of pressboard and sticks, with a dirt floor and no electricity or beds. Each evening the father, a farm laborer, spent his entire day’s wages on groceries for dinner. Departing from their humble home, the senior companion thought to himself, “The law of tithing will surely be a stumbling block to this family. Perhaps we shouldn’t bring it up for a while.” A few moments later, the junior companion, who had grown up in similar circumstances in his own country, voiced his own thoughts aloud: “I know the principle of tithing isn’t taught for four more discussions, but can we please teach it the next time we visit? They need to know about tithing now because they need the help and the blessing of the Lord so much.”</p>

I have experienced them in my life and in the life of my family. The test of our faith is whether we will live the law of tithing by our obedience and sacrifice.

Consider the Prophet Joseph Smith: throughout his life he faced daunting opposition—illness, accident, poverty, misunderstanding, false accusation, and even persecution. One might be tempted to ask, “Why didn’t the Lord protect His prophet from such obstacles, provide him with unlimited resources, and stop up the mouths of his accusers?” The answer is, Each of us must go through certain experiences to become more like our Savior. In the school of mortality, the tutor is often pain and tribulation, but the lessons are meant to refine and bless us and strengthen us, not to destroy us. Said the Lord to faithful Joseph:</p>

Said the Prophet Joseph to the early Saints in Nauvoo, “You need an endowment, brethren, in order that you may be prepared and able to overcome all things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> How right he was! Being blessed with the temple covenants and endowed with power made it possible for the Latter-day Saints to endure tribulation with faith.

In Gethsemane, while His disciples slept, He suffered the sins of all mankind and bled from every pore. He was betrayed, arrested, questioned, struck, spat upon, and beaten. After interrogation by the ruling council, He was mocked by Herod and finally taken to Pilate, where He was made to stand before an angry mob. Whipped and crowned with thorns, He was forced to carry His cross to Golgotha. Nails were driven into His hands and feet. His body was raised up between common thieves. Soldiers cast lots for His earthly possessions, and vinegar was given to quench His thirst. After six hours,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> He commended His spirit into the hands of His Father, gave up the ghost, and died.</p>

A similar scene of storms and destruction unfolded in the New World. In short, we see the terrible tempest raging.</p>

Sometimes we don’t understand death, illness, mental and physical disabilities, personal tragedies, war, and other conflict. Some of these are a necessary part of our mortal probation. Others, as Enoch foresaw, are part of the preparation for the Savior’s Second Coming, when “the heavens shall be darkened, and a veil of darkness shall cover the earth; and the heavens shall shake, and also the earth; and great tribulations shall be among the children of men, but,” said the Lord, “my people will I preserve.” And when Enoch saw all these things, he “received a fulness of joy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span></p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p2" pid="lSecoiqU1ECVKTlpWWnIbw" hash="bONftw">Gaining a testimony and becoming converted begins with study and prayer, then living the gospel with patience and persistence and inviting and waiting upon the Spirit. The life of Joseph Smith and the pattern of the Restoration are excellent examples of this process. As you listen to my message today of the events of the Restoration, look for the steps that lead to testimony: desiring to know the truth, pondering in our hearts, then feeling and obediently following the promptings of the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p3" pid="BZgSFia8a0aEe6OkbryZ4A" hash="clxNWA">Joseph Smith was born on December 23, 1805, in Sharon, Vermont. He came into a family that prayed and studied the Bible. In his youth, he became interested in religion and discovered a “great confusion” over the doctrines of Christ, with “priest contending against priest, and convert against convert.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p4" pid="WO_9ImEg80GL5TzDxCY2iQ" hash="KX8v1g">This confusion was not unique to his community. It began centuries earlier in what has been called the Great Apostasy. The day of Christ “shall not come,” said the Apostle Paul, “except there come a falling away first.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p5" pid="7ayvHJ1Okka_TVFc_8-qeA" hash="kr9jkA">A few decades after Christ’s Resurrection, His Apostles were killed, His teachings were corrupted, and the priesthood was taken from the earth. But Paul, seeing our day, prophesied “that in the dispensation of the fulness of times [God would] gather together in one all things in Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> He would restore Christ’s true Church to the earth once more.</p>

The Bible was translated and published. A new land was discovered. The spirit of reformation swept through the Christian world, and a nation was founded on the principles of freedom.</p>

      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p8" pid="Qcc9gt8EgkOpP-pMb7muBg" hash="3G408g">Joseph turned to the Bible for answers. “If any of you lack wisdom,” he read in the Epistle of James, “let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

As he called upon God, “a pillar of light … descended,” brighter than the noonday sun, and “two Personages” appeared. “One of them spake … , calling [Joseph] by name and said, pointing to the other—<span class="emphasis">This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

They answered his question. They taught him that the true Church of Christ had been lost from the earth. Joseph learned that these members of the Godhead were separate and distinct beings, They knew him by name, and They were willing to answer his prayers. The heavens were opened, the night of apostasy was over, and the light of the gospel began to shine forth.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p11" pid="fWJJ1ae5ZU--m7nrhXqLkg" hash="eXO-ug">Like Joseph, many of us find ourselves seeking the light of truth. Just as the world was prepared for the Restoration, each of us is prepared to receive the light of the gospel in our own lives. Sometimes that preparation comes through a change in our circumstances—through meeting a new friend, moving to a new community, a change of employment, the birth of a child, the death of a loved one, illness, misfortune, and even tragedy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p12" pid="VIKihNVoAkOHSMpp7ivp4g" hash="9tOQhg">During these times of transition, we seek answers to the important questions of life: Who are we? Where did we come from? Why are we here on earth? And where are we going after we die? Joseph was not born with this knowledge, and neither were we. We must find it.</p>

For many, this means overcoming feelings of doubt and unworthiness, being humble, and learning to exercise faith.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p14" pid="unYvavZPukiTyVgy7xhj9A" hash="_V57Ew">During the three years following his First Vision, Joseph felt very humble. Often, he said, “I … felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> But he did not lose faith or forget the power of prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p15" pid="YKJ-7_FGTUGlVflu-_KI2Q" hash="PPcIWw">On September 21, 1823, at the age of 17, he knelt to ask “for forgiveness of [his] sins and follies, and [to receive] a manifestation … of [his] state and standing before [God].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> As he prayed, a light once again appeared, increasing “until the room was lighter than at noonday.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> In that light there stood a personage dressed in a robe of “exquisite whiteness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> He called Joseph by name and introduced himself as Moroni. He said “that God had a work for [Joseph] to do”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> and told him of an ancient record written on gold plates, which, when translated, became the Book of Mormon. The book contained a record of the fulness of the gospel, as taught to Moroni’s ancestors by Jesus Christ. Joseph was directed to obtain that record, buried near his family’s home in a nearby hill, which is now called Cumorah.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p16" pid="ouqJ9WOVgEi3j06hSlafpw" hash="0U1Kow">The next day, Joseph found the plates, but the time had not yet arrived to bring them forth. Moroni instructed Joseph to meet him there that same day each year for the next four years.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p17" pid="M4NBUd3x60eKtxMBX9CO6g" hash="X5l78g">Joseph obeyed. Each year he went to the hill where Moroni gave him “instruction”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> concerning the Restoration of Christ’s Church. Much like the Savior’s childhood described in the New Testament, Joseph “increased in wisdom and stature”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> and “waxed strong in spirit.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span></p>

Some newly baptized members become discouraged about their wisdom and stature in the gospel—about what they do not know. They forget the obedient effort, gospel tutoring, and spiritual maturation that were part of Joseph’s early experiences. Those who are longtime members should also remember that regular spiritual instruction and learning are required if we are to wax strong in the Spirit.</p>

He also received an ancient instrument for translating them, called the Urim and Thummim. Using this sacred interpreter, along with the Holy Ghost, Joseph began the work of translation in December of that year.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> In time he was joined by a schoolteacher named Oliver Cowdery, who acted as his scribe.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

Like new investigators, they wanted to know more. Joseph knew what to do.</p>

While they were praying, John the Baptist appeared “in a cloud of light.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> He was the one who had baptized the Savior in life. He held the priesthood keys necessary to perform that ordinance by the authority of God.</p>

And all who are prepared and worthy for baptism may receive it from one whose authority has been passed unbroken from the hands of John the Baptist in this dispensation.</p>

As in times of old, members of the Church were instructed to build a temple, which was dedicated in Kirtland, Ohio, on March 27, 1836. One week later, on April 3, a meeting was held there. Following a solemn and silent prayer, Joseph and Oliver saw the Lord Jesus Christ standing before them. He who had said, “Foxes have holes, and the birds … have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> had come to His holy house. Moses, Elias, and Elijah also appeared there and committed the keys of the kingdom, the saving ordinances, to Joseph.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>

Every major event of the Restoration—the First Vision, the appearance of Moroni and the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, the restoration of the priesthood, and the appearance of Jesus Christ following the dedication of His holy temple—was preceded by prayer.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2003/10/receiving-a-testimony-of-the-restored-gospel-of-jesus-christ.p29" pid="Llh8Fs1VhEeBf-Az2tCMyw" hash="s1Sjeg">Since that time, 116 temples have been dedicated. I have attended a number of these sacred meetings. Dedicatory prayers have been offered. The Holy Ghost has been present in abundance. During these times, among many others, I have felt the undeniable witness of the Spirit of God, like a fire burning in my heart, that the restored gospel is true.</p>

Nephi gives a clear and compelling account of the process, which includes desiring, believing, having faith, pondering, and then following the Spirit. Let’s hear it as related by Nephi: “For it came to pass after I had <span class="emphasis">desired</span> to know the things that my father had seen [in a vision of the tree of life], and <span class="emphasis">believing</span> that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat <span class="emphasis">pondering</span> in mine heart I was <span class="emphasis">caught away in the Spirit</span> of the Lord, yea, … <span class="emphasis">the Spirit [spoke] unto me.</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span></p>

Our growing testimony brings us increased faith in Jesus Christ and His plan of happiness. We are motivated to repent and obey the commandments, which, with a mighty change of heart, leads to our conversion. And our conversion brings divine forgiveness, healing, joy, and the desire to bear our witness to others.</p>

May I suggest accepting the invitation extended by Moroni in the Book of Mormon: “And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span> For some, this happens quickly. For others, it happens gradually over the years.</p>

But only those who have been baptized and confirmed can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands by one in authority, which makes His constant companionship possible.</p>

If we are not obedient to the laws, principles, and ordinances of the gospel, the Holy Ghost will withdraw. He cannot be with us if we are angry in our hearts, contentious with our companions, or critical of the Lord’s anointed.

He loved his family and rejoiced that some of his children kept the Lord’s commandments. But he must have been heartbroken when his sons “Laman and Lemuel partook not of the fruit” representing the love of God. “He exceedingly feared for [them]; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off from the presence of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

However, when we exercise our faith by teaching our children and doing what we can to help them, our fears will diminish. Lehi girded up his loins, and with faith “he did exhort [his children] with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord would be merciful to them.” And “he bade them to keep the commandments of the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

We should not let their choices weaken our faith. Our worthiness will not be measured according to their righteousness. Lehi did not lose the blessing of feasting at the tree of life because Laman and Lemuel refused to partake of its fruit. Sometimes as parents we feel we have failed when our children make mistakes or stray. Parents are never failures when they do their best to love, teach, pray, and care for their children. Their faith, prayers, and efforts will be consecrated to the good of their children.</p>

She directed the tiny vessel down the river to a safe place—to where the pharaoh’s daughter bathed.</p>

But, like Jochebed, we also weave around our children a protective basket—a vessel called “the family”—and guide them to safe places where our teachings can be reinforced in the home and at church.</p>

What they learned from us, they will teach their children, and the work of eternal families will go on.</p>

Sometimes the Spirit prompts us as parents to seek special help beyond ourselves through such resources as doctors and qualified counselors. The Spirit will direct when and how such help should be obtained.</p>

  <span class="emphasis">Hold family councils.</span>
</span> Sometimes we are afraid of our children—afraid to counsel with them for fear of offending them. There are priceless blessings to be obtained from counseling together with our families, showing a genuine interest in the lives of our family members. Occasionally, family councils may involve all family members as part of a family home evening or other special gatherings. But we should regularly counsel with each of our children individually.</p>

As we listen with love and refrain from interrupting, the Spirit will help us learn how we can be of help to our children and teach them.</p>

Because he knew his father. Through the inevitable misunderstandings, conflicts, and follies of the son’s youth, I can visualize his father being there with an understanding and compassionate heart, a soft answer, a listening ear, and a forgiving embrace. I can also imagine his son knowing he could come home because he knew the kind of home that was awaiting him. For the scriptures say, “When he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

Though some of the sheep may wander, the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold. Either in this life or the life to come, they will return. They will have to pay their debt to justice; they will suffer for their sins; and may tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last, like the penitent Prodigal, to a loving and forgiving father’s heart and home, the painful experience will not have been in vain. Pray for your careless and disobedient children; hold on to them with your faith. Hope on, trust on, till you see the salvation of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span></p>

In his epistle to the Hebrews in the New Testament, the Apostle Paul taught that “faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> And how do we gain faith? How do we gain evidence of our Savior, whom we have not seen? The scriptures teach us:</p>

But sometimes the faith of even the most devoted followers was tested. After the Crucifixion Thomas heard his brethren testify that the Savior had risen from the tomb. But instead of believing their words, Thomas declared, “Except I shall see … , I will not believe.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> Later this beloved Apostle was given the opportunity to touch the prints of the nails in the Savior’s hands and confessed, “My Lord and my God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> The Savior then lovingly taught him as He has taught all of us what it means to have faith: “Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

But there are still many prophecies yet to be fulfilled! In this and other conferences, we hear living prophets prophesy and testify of Christ’s <span class="emphasis">Second</span> Coming. They also witness of the signs and wonders all about us, telling us that Christ will surely come again. Are we choosing to believe their words? Or despite their witnesses and warnings, are we waiting for evidence—are we “walking in darkness at noon-day,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> refusing to see by the light of modern prophecy, and denying that the Light of the World will return to rule and reign among us?</p>

However, some lack faith that He lives, that He is the Savior of the world, and that His Church has been restored to the earth.

I’ve always wanted to believe, but how do I do it?” This morning I desire to answer that question.</p>

The first step to finding faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is to let His word—spoken by the mouth of His servants, the prophets—touch your heart. But it is not enough merely to let those words wash over you, as if they alone could transform you. We must do our part. Or as the Savior Himself said, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> In other words, hearing requires an active effort. “Faith without works is dead.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span> It means taking seriously what is taught, considering it carefully, studying it out in our minds. As the prophet Enos learned, it means letting others’ testimonies of the gospel “[sink] deep into [our] heart[s].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span> Let us review some of the elements of Enos’s profound, faith-building experience:</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2004/10/finding-faith-in-the-lord-jesus-christ.p19" pid="WaDGOjD62UOUwjITVlT6yw" hash="JrpHZg">First, Enos heard the gospel truths from his father, just as you are hearing them in your families and in this conference. Second, he let his father’s teachings about “eternal life, and the joy of the saints”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span> sink deep into his heart. Third, he was filled with a desire to know for himself whether these teachings were true and where he himself stood before his Maker. To use Enos’s words, “My soul hungered.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_25">25</span> By this intense spiritual appetite, Enos qualified himself to receive the Savior’s promise: “Blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span> Fourth, Enos obeyed the commandments of God, which enabled him to be receptive to the Spirit of the Holy Ghost. Fifth, Enos records, “I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_27">27</span> It wasn’t easy. Faith did not come quickly. In fact, Enos characterized his experience in prayer as a “wrestle which [he] had before God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_28">28</span> But faith did come. By the power of the Holy Ghost, he did receive a witness for himself.</p>

I testify that the reward is worth the effort. Remember the pattern: (1) hear the word of God, spoken and written by His servants; (2) let that word sink deep into your heart; (3) hunger in your soul for righteousness; (4) obediently follow gospel laws, ordinances, and covenants; and (5) raise your voice in mighty prayer and supplication, asking in faith to know that Jesus Christ is our Savior. I promise that if you do these things sincerely and unceasingly, the words Christ spoke to His disciples will be fulfilled in your life: “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_29">29</span></p>

[First, they found it in his] kidneys, [then his] brain, [and] then [his] lungs. [He] couldn’t fight it any longer.

Hopefully, you and your children will find peace as you seek answers to the purpose of life. Our faith is acquired through prayer with a sincere desire to draw close to God and trust in Him to bear our burdens and give us answers to life’s unexplained mysteries of the purpose of life: Where did we come from? Why are we here on earth in mortality? And where are we going after our mortal sojourn on earth? All is well with your little one because he died before the age of accountability of eight years of age and he is in the presence of God. Seek faith, and may the blessings of God be with you.”</p>

At these times only faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement can bring us peace, hope, and understanding. Only faith that He suffered for our sakes will give us the strength to endure to the end. When we gain this faith, we experience a mighty change of heart, and like Enos, we become stronger and begin to feel a desire for the welfare of our brothers and sisters. We pray for them, that they too will be lifted and strengthened through faith on the Atonement of our Savior Jesus Christ.</p>

My prayer was that “the Holy Ghost [would] touch hearts, and somewhere a spouse … [would] quietly nudge his or her companion, and a moment of truth [—a moment of decision—would] occur.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> One sister later wrote me about that experience. She said, “We were sitting in the comfort of our family room enjoying conference on television. … As you spoke, my heart was touched so deeply. I looked over at my husband and he looked at me. That moment changed my life forever.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p2" pid="lT3d1usNS06ytON4J1w16w" hash="8RkHrw">If you are or will soon be the age of a senior missionary, I come to you this afternoon to witness of the blessings that can change your life forever. Your Heavenly Father needs you. His work, under the direction of our Savior Jesus Christ, needs what you are uniquely prepared to give. Every missionary experience requires faith, sacrifice, and service, and these are always followed by an outpouring of blessings.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p3" pid="dtjlntl2-UONNhIMhce7zg" hash="TDqoAg">As we discuss these blessings, you will naturally consider what I have called the four Fs: fear, family concerns, finding the right mission opportunity, and financial challenges.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> May I yet add another more important and powerful F—faith. Only through our faith can we heed God’s counsel to “choose ye this day, whom ye will serve”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span>—“to serve the Lord God who made you.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> And only through a <span class="emphasis">trial</span> of our faith can we receive the miraculous blessings we seek for ourselves and our families. “For if there be no faith among the children of men God can do no miracle among them; wherefore, he showed not himself until <span class="emphasis">after</span> their faith.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

A humble couple from Idaho met fear with faith when the Lord called them to Russia. They wrote the following acceptance letter: “No one would have imagined we would be called to this assignment. We have no idea how we will learn the language or manage to be of service, and although we accept with much trepidation, going completely on faith, we know that the Lord and His prophet know more than we do where we should serve.” Ten months later the Stockholm Sweden Temple welcomed 30 Saints from a small branch in Russia led by this couple from Idaho who had barely begun to learn the Russian language. The scriptures tell us, “God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Thus, God’s work is carried out by His children: “That faith also might increase in the earth. … That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p5" pid="OFfg37MFUku4B1UclZceyg" hash="P0TUTA">Another couple faced family concerns with faith. A faithful sister wrote: “The decision to serve a mission was not hard. But my 90-year-old mother was extremely apprehensive about our leaving. She took great comfort when she heard that our families would be blessed as we serve.” A faithful brother expressed similar concerns about leaving his elderly parents, to which his father responded: “Don’t use your mother and me as an excuse not to go on a mission with your wife. You pray about it and follow the guidance of the Spirit.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p6" pid="jJsnV332OkKUUeuNhatR2A" hash="I3XKng">To an earlier generation of missionaries called to leave their families, the Lord offered this reassurance: “And if they will do this in all lowliness of heart, … I, the Lord, give unto them a promise that I will provide for their families.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p7" pid="HBsZgHy85kynFFEkmpN2hQ" hash="SvExxw">Certainly family concerns are real and should not be considered lightly. But we cannot meet our family challenges without the blessings of the Lord; and when we sacrifice to serve as full-time missionary couples, those blessings will flow. For example, one couple worried about leaving their youngest daughter who was no longer active in the Church. Her faithful father wrote: “We prayed for her continually and fasted regularly. Then, during general conference, the Spirit whispered to me, ‘If you will serve, you will not have to worry about your daughter anymore.’ So we met with our bishop. The week after we received our call, she and her boyfriend announced they were engaged. Before we left for Africa, we had a wedding in our home. [Then we gathered our family together and] held a family council. … I bore testimony of the Lord and Joseph Smith … and told them I would like to give each of them a father’s blessing. I started with the oldest son and then his wife and proceeded to the youngest … [including our new son-in-law].”</p>

In family council meetings, we can give our children the opportunity to express their support, offer special assistance we may need, and receive priesthood blessings to sustain them in our absence. Where appropriate, we may be able to receive priesthood blessings from them as well. As the faithful father in this story blessed his family members, his son-in-law felt the influence of the Holy Ghost. The father wrote: “By the end of our first year [the] heart [of our son-in-law] began to soften toward the Church. Just before we returned home from our mission, he and our daughter came to visit us. In his suitcase was the first set of Sunday clothes he had ever owned. They came to Church with us, and after we returned home he was baptized. A year later, they were sealed in the temple.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span></p>

As He said, “If any man serve me, him will my Father honour.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

If this is your situation, remember that the right mission call may not be to a far-off country with a strange sounding name. The right call for you may be within your stake or area. “Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Counsel with your extended family and your bishop or branch president. As the Lord’s servants understand your temporal situation, you will be able to receive the eternal blessings of full-time missionary service.</p>

The reasonable sacrifice of your means will not only bless other missionaries and those they serve; it will bless you and your family as well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p12" pid="p77sdtHzBEOj-N_uxlsBUg" hash="j5XM8A">Now, to those who were not able to serve a mission in their youth, may I speak directly to you. Perhaps over the years you have been burdened by feelings of regret or felt less than adequate because you did not have a missionary opportunity to serve and grow when you were younger. My advice to you: look forward, not back. Begin preparing for your mission as a senior missionary couple today! Save a little money each month. Study the scriptures. Accept Church callings. Pray to feel the Lord’s love for others and receive His love and confidence in you. You can one day claim <span class="emphasis">all</span> the blessings of missionary service!</p>

After 51 years of marriage, I was asked, “What part of life would you want to live over again?” I did not hesitate to reply, “When my wife and I served together in the great missionary work of the Lord.” The sentiments of another missionary couple echo those of my wife and myself: “Our decision to go on a mission brought new vigor, new emotions, new friends, new places, new challenges. It brought us closer together as husband and wife; we had a common goal and a real partnership. And best of all, it brought new spiritual growth, instead of spiritual retirement.” Brothers and sisters, let us not go into spiritual retirement.</p>

Over the next six months, would it be possible for each of you to consider recommending one or more missionary couples beyond those presently planning to serve? Your greatest resource in meeting this challenge will be those senior members of your ward who have already served missions. In my own ward, an inspired bishop called a special meeting of prospective and returned missionary couples. As we bore our testimonies of sacrifice and service, the Spirit witnessed to us all that a call to serve is indeed a call to “know the richness of [the Lord’s] blessing[s].”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/04/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p15" pid="yiZc-a2AgUegy4jvLv-nrA" hash="2paYkg">I’ve heard of a stake president who has arranged a senior missionary class to inspire prospective missionary couples and help them prepare to serve. Priesthood leaders, as you prayerfully seek to encourage full-time missionary service, remember that when a couple is called, they not only help accomplish the work of the Lord throughout the world; they plant a seed of service in their families that will blossom for generations to come. I continue to be grateful for the influence of my parents, who served as couple missionaries in England and set an example for their posterity.</p>

Go to him. Share your feelings. Where missionary service is concerned, the Lord expects us to express our desires. As we do, we can trust that the same Spirit that prompts us to seek a mission call will inspire a prophet to call us to the right assignment.</p>

There are calls to teach the gospel to those who desire to receive the truth, including to youth in the Church Educational System; calls to work in welfare and humanitarian service; in temples; in family history centers, mission offices, and historic sites; calls to “do the greatest good unto thy fellow beings, and … promote the glory of him who is your Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

A couple in Hawaii nurtured a little branch of 20 members to 200 and prepared 70 members to attend the temple together. A couple in Peru arranged for medicine and Christmas toys to be provided to 550 children in an orphanage. A couple in Cambodia taught institute classes and gave leadership to a branch which, after only 10 months, grew to 180 members. A couple in Russia helped local farmers increase their yield of potatoes to 11 times that of the state farms, while a couple in the Philippines helped nearly 700 poorly nourished families learn to raise rabbits and cultivate vegetable gardens. A couple in Pennsylvania assisted 60 individuals, half of them members of other faiths, in preparing their family genealogical records. A couple in Ghana helped drill and refurbish wells, bringing water to 190,000 people in villages and refugee camps.</p>

I express my gratitude for all these and the thousands of others who are serving in so many capacities, contributing millions of hours in service to their fellow man.</p>

Now is the time to prepare; now is the time to be called, the time to sacrifice. Now is the time to share your gifts and talents, and now is the time to receive God’s blessings for you and your family. “There is a constant need for more couple missionaries,” President Gordon B. Hinckley has said.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> As this work rolls forward, that need is increasing. Let us, in our richest years of experience, maturity, wisdom, and most of all, our faith, rise to meet that need as only <span class="emphasis">we</span> can.</p>

From our life’s experience we can look back and recognize the goodness of our Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, to us and our families. As one faithful brother explained, “My wife and I would like to serve five missions—one for each of the beautiful children God has blessed us with!” Whatever blessings we have received individually, I testify that we have all received the greatest blessing of all: “God [our Heavenly Father] so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> and His Son, Jesus Christ, “loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> I bear my special witness that His atoning sacrifice is the ultimate expression of that love.</p>

To the world we testify that he was the prophet of God foreordained to bring about the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This he did under the direction of our Savior, who said to an earlier prophet, “My name is Jehovah, and I know the end from the beginning; therefore my hand shall be over thee.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p2" pid="mhUwS7DTc0CDkFBM_61luA" hash="Cektgw">I acknowledge the Lord’s hand in the Restoration of the gospel. Through the inspired sacrifices of God’s children through the ages, the foundation of the Restoration was laid, and the world is preparing for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p3" pid="2BbPicoxxUOBTtx9xJnBYg" hash="OQDSHw">His gospel was first established on the earth beginning with Adam and has been taught in every dispensation through such prophets as Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and others. Each of these prophets foretold the coming of Jesus Christ to atone for the sins of the world. Those prophecies have been fulfilled. The Savior did establish His Church. He called His Apostles and established His priesthood. Most importantly, He laid down His life and took it up that all will rise again, thus carrying out the atoning sacrifice. But that was not the end.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p4" pid="rWiSmjFCb02rffykeBI5bw" hash="mjg4dQ">After the Savior’s Resurrection, He commissioned His Apostles to lead the Church and administer gospel ordinances. Faithful to this charge, they were persecuted, and some were eventually martyred. As a result, the Lord’s priesthood authority was no longer on earth, and the world fell into spiritual darkness. In the centuries that followed, God’s children had the Light of Christ, could pray, and could feel the influence of the Holy Ghost. But the fulness of the gospel had been lost. There was no one left on earth with the power and authority to lead the Church or perform sacred ordinances such as baptism, conferral of the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the saving ordinances of the temple. Almost everyone was denied access to the scriptures, and most people were illiterate.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p5" pid="F8UwbVxM6kiNgwpzPtNPUA" hash="ei-1SQ">Making the scriptures available and helping God’s children learn to read them was the first step to the Restoration of the gospel. Originally the Bible was written in Hebrew and Greek, languages unknown to common people throughout Europe. Then, about 400 years after the Savior’s death, the Bible was translated by Jerome into Latin. But still the scriptures were not widely available. Copies had to be written by hand, usually by monks, each taking years to complete.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p6" pid="YOUOjuK9rEKsc_7q2WBEoA" hash="8WLn4Q">Then, through the influence of the Holy Ghost, an interest in learning began to grow in the hearts of people. This Renaissance or “rebirth” spread throughout Europe. In the late 1300s, a priest named John Wycliffe initiated a translation of the Bible from Latin into English. Because English was then an emerging, unrefined language, church leaders deemed it unsuitable to convey God’s word. Some leaders were certain that if people could read and interpret the Bible for themselves, its doctrine would be corrupted; others feared that people with independent access to the scriptures would not need the church and would cease to support it financially. Consequently, Wycliffe was denounced as a heretic and treated accordingly. After he died and was buried, his bones were dug up and burned. But God’s work could not be stopped.</p>

By 1455 Johannes Gutenberg had invented a press with movable type, and the Bible was one of the first books he printed. For the first time it was possible to print multiple copies of the scriptures and at a cost many could afford.</p>

In 1492 Christopher Columbus set out to find a new path to the Far East. Columbus was led by the hand of God in his journey. He said, “God gave me the faith, and afterwards the courage.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

In the early 1500s young William Tyndale enrolled at Oxford University. There he studied the work of the Bible scholar Erasmus, who believed that the scriptures are “the food of [a man’s] soul; and … must permeate the very depths of [his] heart and mind.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Through his studies, Tyndale developed a love for God’s word and a desire that all God’s children be able to feast on it for themselves.</p>

In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli printed 67 articles of reform. John Calvin in Switzerland, John Knox in Scotland, and many others assisted in this effort. A reformation had begun.</p>

He believed a direct translation from Greek and Hebrew into English would be more accurate and readable than Wycliffe’s translation from Latin. So Tyndale, enlightened by the Spirit of God, translated the New Testament and a portion of the Old Testament. His friends warned him that he would be killed for doing so, but he was undaunted. Once, while disputing with a learned man, he said, “If God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the scripture than thou dost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

But the belief for which he gave his life was not lost. Millions have come to experience for themselves what Tyndale taught throughout his life: “The nature of God’s word is, that whosoever read it, … it will begin immediately to make him every day better and better, till he be grown into a perfect man.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

Because of a disagreement with the church in Rome, King Henry VIII declared himself the head of the church in England and required that copies of the English Bible be placed in every parish church. Hungry for the gospel, people flocked to these churches, reading the scriptures to one another until their voices gave out. The Bible was also used as a primer to teach reading. Though martyrdoms continued across Europe, the dark night of ignorance was coming to an end. Declared one preacher before being burned, “We shall this day light such a candle, by God’s Grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p14" pid="MDCRyaO0gEOlld9ThBOjaQ" hash="oLGATA">We express gratitude to all who lived in England and throughout Europe who helped kindle that light. By God’s grace, the light grew brighter. Aware of the divisions within his own country, English King James I agreed to a new official version of the Bible. It has been estimated that over 80 percent of William Tyndale’s translations of the New Testament and a good portion of the Old Testament (the Pentateuch, or Genesis through Deuteronomy, and Joshua through Chronicles) were retained in the King James Version.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> In time, that version would find its way to a new land and be read by a 14-year-old plowboy named Joseph Smith. Is it any wonder that the King James Version is the approved English Bible of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints today?</p>

Among them were the Pilgrims, who landed in the Americas in 1620, the very part of the world Columbus had explored over 100 years earlier. Other colonists soon followed, including those like Roger Williams, founder and later governor of Rhode Island, who continued to search for Christ’s true Church. Williams said that there was no regularly constituted church of Christ on earth, nor any person authorized to administer any church ordinance, nor could there be until new Apostles were sent by the great Head of the church, for whose coming he was seeking.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span></p>

Under God’s hand, they secured religious freedom for every citizen with an inspired Bill of Rights. Fourteen years later, on December 23, 1805, the Prophet Joseph Smith was born. The preparation was nearing its completion for the Restoration.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2005/10/preparations-for-the-restoration-and-the-second-coming-my-hand-shall-be-over-thee.p17" pid="onf0plWxXU28haRUw0D7Uw" hash="wZEL1w">As a young man, Joseph “was called up to serious reflection”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> on the subject of religion. Because he was born in a land of religious freedom, he could question which of all the churches was right. And because the Bible had been translated into English, he could seek an answer from the word of God. He read in the book of James, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> and he did as directed. In answer to Joseph’s prayer, God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to him.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> This humble farm boy was the prophet chosen by God to restore the ancient Church of Jesus Christ and His priesthood in these latter days. This restoration was to be the last, the dispensation of the fulness of times, restoring all the priesthood blessings which man could possess on earth. With this divine commission, his work was not to reform nor was it to protest what was already on the earth. It was to restore what had been on earth and had been lost.</p>

On September 21, 1823, Joseph Smith was visited by the angel Moroni, who taught him of an ancient record containing “the fulness of the everlasting gospel … preparatory to the second coming of the Messiah.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Recorded on plates of gold, the Book of Mormon gives an account of Christ’s ministry in the Western Hemisphere, just as the Bible records His life and ministry in the Holy Land. Joseph received the gold plates four years later and, in December of 1827, began to translate the Book of Mormon.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

Their desire to receive this blessing for themselves prompted the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood on May 15, 1829, under the hands of John the Baptist.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>

After centuries of spiritual darkness, the power and authority to act in God’s name, to perform sacred ordinances, and to lead His Church were once again upon the earth.</p>

A few days later, on April 6, Christ’s true Church in these latter days was once again organized, at the home of Peter Whitmer Sr. in Fayette, New York. Describing the effects of these events upon the world, Elder Parley P. Pratt wrote:</p>

The Doctrine and Covenants was accepted by the Church on August 17, 1835. The Pearl of Great Price translation of the book of Abraham also began in that year.</p>

The Kirtland Temple was dedicated on March 27, 1836.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> In that temple, the Savior appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, followed by the appearances of Moses, Elias, and Elijah, who gave additional priesthood keys to the Prophet.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span></p>

In 1844 Joseph Smith conferred all the keys of the priesthood upon Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and their fellow Apostles. The Prophet said: “I have lived until I have seen this burden, which has rested on my shoulders, rolled on to the shoulders of other men; … the keys of the kingdom are planted on the earth to be taken away no more for ever. … No matter what becomes of me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span> Sadly, three months later, on June 27, Joseph Smith the Prophet and his brother Hyrum were martyred at Carthage, Illinois.</p>

In the Lord’s service the path is not always easy. It often requires sacrifices, and we will likely experience adversity. But in serving Him, we discover that His hand is truly over us. So it was for Wycliffe, Tyndale, and thousands of others who prepared the way for the Restoration. So it was for the Prophet Joseph Smith and all who helped usher in the restored gospel. So it is and will be for us.</p>

They were called to <span class="emphasis">give</span> their lives for the gospel. We are called to <span class="emphasis">live</span> our lives for the same purpose.

For “behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things,” Lehi told Jacob. “Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18">18</span></p>

Only by yielding to temptation and sin can we be kept from that joy. And yielding is exactly what Satan wants us to do.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/to-act-for-ourselves-the-gift-and-blessings-of-agency.p10" uuid="079ce64b-bf3d-4e49-abc2-0db3d865441e" pid="udse0sB4S02NeAoYhQqFSw" hash="L4s47Q">I once had an opportunity to accompany President Spencer W. Kimball to a distant land. We were given a tour of the various sites in the area, including underground catacombs—burial grounds for people who had been persecuted by Christian zealots. As we came up the dark, narrow stairs of that place, President Kimball taught me an unforgettable lesson. He pulled my coattail and said, “It has always troubled me what the adversary does using the name of our Savior.” He then said, “Robert, the adversary can never have joy unless you and I sin.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/to-act-for-ourselves-the-gift-and-blessings-of-agency.p11" uuid="88044800-cfa9-42b5-8bfc-139803ea76bb" pid="LMx_MOBQY0SXkiLUcZUSDA" hash="ohf5CA">As I contemplated this comment and studied the scriptures, I began to understand what President Kimball may have meant. I recalled the word of the Lord to all the inhabitants of the earth as recorded in the Book of Mormon: “Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the whole earth except they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice, because of the slain of the fair sons and daughters of my people.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> It is our sins that make the devil laugh, our sorrow that brings him counterfeit joy.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/to-act-for-ourselves-the-gift-and-blessings-of-agency.p12" uuid="ebc20a63-d1eb-42dd-a78d-19049aab9a1c" pid="sh-3wi7v0U6lYfolRJfp6A" hash="yjsgTA">Although the devil laughs, his power is limited. Some may remember the old adage: “The devil made me do it.” Today I want to convey, in absolutely certain terms, that the adversary cannot make us do anything. He does lie at our door, as the scriptures say, and he follows us each day.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20">20</span> Every time we go out, every decision we make, we are either choosing to move in his direction or in the direction of our Savior. But the adversary must depart if we tell him to depart. He cannot influence us unless we allow him to do so, and he knows that! The only time he can affect our minds and bodies—our very spirits—is when we <span class="emphasis">allow</span> him to do so. In other words, we do not have to succumb to his enticements!</p>

Today I ask, have we received that Spirit? Are we following on the strait and narrow path that leads to God and eternal life? Are we holding onto the iron rod, or are we going another way? I testify that how we choose to <span class="emphasis">feel</span> and <span class="emphasis">think</span> and <span class="emphasis">act</span> every day is the way we get on the path, and stay on it, until we reach our eternal destination.</p>

All of us make mistakes. That is why Lehi, who understood the Savior’s role in preserving and reclaiming our agency, taught Jacob—and us: “The Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21">21</span> That is the key—“to act for themselves and not to be acted upon.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/to-act-for-ourselves-the-gift-and-blessings-of-agency.p15" uuid="95c69c6b-4eed-42dc-8697-0409a81f012e" pid="lN8N1qAB_UWwMwL6eBpYeA" hash="SXRcng">In these latter days, as in the times of old, we must avoid being acted upon by acting for ourselves to avoid evil. The Holy Ghost will prompt us. Joseph was told to flee from Potiphar’s wife. Abraham obeyed the commandment to flee out of the land of Ur. Lehi was instructed to flee Jerusalem before it was destroyed. And to protect the Savior’s life, Mary and Joseph were prompted to flee into Egypt.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/to-act-for-ourselves-the-gift-and-blessings-of-agency.p16" uuid="d8e9fdb2-6338-4210-886b-ab4a6e188795" pid="kuJRqSKLYU2Sm4pYhAWm2A" hash="COaTAQ">The promptings that come to us to flee evil reflect our Heavenly Father’s understanding of our particular strengths and weaknesses and His awareness of the unforeseen circumstances of our lives. When these promptings come, they will not generally stop us in our tracks, for the Spirit of God does not speak with a voice of thunder. The voice will be as soft as a whisper, coming as a thought to our minds or a feeling in our hearts. By heeding its gentle promptings, we will be protected from the destructive consequences of sin.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/04/to-act-for-ourselves-the-gift-and-blessings-of-agency.p17" uuid="93155fcd-aed1-4663-bb94-0c28f9d84ea7" pid="EnvdDuH6gUCr93fQ7HtS-A" hash="ydhAdw">But if we ignore those promptings, the light of the Spirit will fade. Our agency will be limited or lost, and we will lose the confidence and ability to act. We will be “walking in [spiritual] darkness at noon-day.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22">22</span> Then how easy it is to wander into strange paths and become lost! How quickly we are bound in the chains of sin spoken of by Lehi to his rebellious sons.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23">23</span> For example, if we make choices that put us deeply in debt, we will lose our agency to meet our wants and needs or to save for that inevitable rainy day. If we choose to break the law, we may be put in prison, where our agency is so limited that we cannot choose where we go, who we see, or what we do. Spirit prison is very much like that. Therefore, to retain our agency we must daily walk in the light of our Lord and Savior and follow the path of obedience. It is the only path that leads to our Father in Heaven.</p>

I speak especially to those overcome by the thick darkness of addiction. If you have fallen into destructive, addictive behaviors, you may feel that you are spiritually in a black hole. As with the real black holes in space, it may seem all but impossible for light to penetrate to where you are. How do you escape? I testify the only way is through the very agency you exercised so valiantly in your premortal life, the agency that the adversary cannot take away without your yielding it to him.</p>

We have the responsibility to use it in behalf of others, to lift and strengthen others in their trials and tribulations. Some of our brothers and sisters have lost the full use of their agency through unrighteous choices. Without exposing ourselves to temptation, we can and should invite others to receive the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Through friendship and love, we may lead them along the path of obedience and encourage them to use their agency to make the right choices once again.</p>

Agency was manifested in the Council in Heaven as we chose to follow our Heavenly Father’s plan and come to mortality for this probationary period. Agency allows us to be tested and tried to see whether or not we will endure to the end and return to our Heavenly Father with honor. Agency is the catalyst that leads us to express our inward spiritual desires in outward Christlike behavior. Agency permits us to make faithful, obedient choices that strengthen us so that we can lift and strengthen others. Agency used righteously allows light to dispel the darkness and enables us to live with joy and happiness in the present, look with faith to the future, even into the eternities, and not dwell on the things of the past. Our use of agency determines who we are and what we will be.</p>

Agency leads us to act: to seek that we may find, to ask that we may receive guidance from the Spirit, to knock on that door that leads to spiritual light and ultimately salvation. I bear special witness that our Savior Jesus Christ is the source of that light, even the Light and Life of the World. As we use our agency to follow Him, His light will grow within us brighter and brighter until that perfect day<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_26">26</span> when we are welcomed into the presence of our Father in Heaven for all eternity. That we will use our agency to that sacred and glorious end, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="24"></span>The holy scriptures are the word of God given to us for our salvation. The scriptures are essential in receiving a testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel. The scriptures given to us by God in these latter days are the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. These sacred records bear testimony of the Savior and lead us to Him. That is why great prophets like Enos cried unto the Lord in faith to preserve the scriptures.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2006/10/holy-scriptures-the-power-of-god-unto-our-salvation.p2" pid="DIWT8IB1ukyS0_j6VQ59Ew" hash="VR7GuQ">Will you open with me the cover of the Book of Mormon? Look on the title page. We read that it is “written by way of commandment, … by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation.” It has “come forth by the gift and power of God,” and its interpretation is “by the gift of God”—by the Holy Ghost. It shows “what great things the Lord [has] done” and has given to us “that [we] may know the covenants of the Lord,” that we might not be “cast off forever.” Most importantly, it has been written to convince us “that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God.”</p>

Here we learn that this prophetic record is “holy scripture comparable to the Bible.” It contains “the fulness of the everlasting gospel, … outlines the plan of salvation, and tells [us] what [we] must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.” It promises each of us that “all who will come unto [the Savior] and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved.”</p>

But Lehi didn’t get very far before the Lord commanded him to send his sons back. Why? To retrieve the scriptures, the brass plates, which were so important that Lehi’s sons risked their lives and lost all their worldly possessions to recover them! Ultimately, it was the Lord’s help and Nephi’s faith that miraculously delivered the plates into his hands. When Nephi and his brothers returned, Lehi, their father, rejoiced. He began to search the holy scriptures “from the beginning,” and “found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth … insomuch that [Lehi and his posterity] could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto [their] children.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

The Lord had commanded Lehi to flee Jerusalem because it was going to be captured by the Babylonians and to journey across the sea to the promised land in a divinely designed ship. But Lehi’s children were bitterly divided into two factions. Those who followed righteous Nephi—the Nephites—retained the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="26"></span>scriptures when they departed the Lamanites, and “their souls were illuminated by the light of [God’s] everlasting word.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

When the Jaredites were righteous, they were blessed; and when they rejected the word of the Lord and refused to repent, the Spirit of the Lord ceased striving with them.

The Mulekites brought no scriptures with them; so about 400 years later, when Mosiah and the Nephites found them, the Mulekites’ language was corrupted, and they had lost their belief in their Creator. They did not know who they were. When the Mulekites learned that the Lord had sent the Nephites with the plates of brass, which contained the scriptural record of the Jews, they rejoiced and joined themselves to the Nephite civilization.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="48"></span>What a joy to be in your presence, brethren, as you are gathered across this world. I am reminded of the words of the hymn: “Behold! A royal army, with banner, sword, and shield, is marching forth to conquer on life’s great battlefield.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> Indeed, you are the royal army of God, faithful and true.</p>

Although you do not remember it, you enlisted in this cause with a single decision, made long ago in our premortal existence. There, in the Grand Council in Heaven, you decided to obey the will of your Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. Remember this: you are a son of God who decided to follow the Savior when it mattered most, and that makes you a great man indeed.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2007/04/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision.p3" pid="-eAKiGQDg0yOwTOcAlHrlA" hash="nIxXig">Because of that divine decision which determined your eternal progression, you received a physical body, gained the agency to choose good over evil, and are now growing and preparing to take upon yourselves the attributes of our Savior. You have been baptized and have received the Holy Ghost. You are learning who you are, why you are here, and where you are going. And now you have received the Aaronic Priesthood!</p>

These decisions include receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood, going to the temple, serving a mission, getting an education, selecting an occupation, and choosing a companion and being sealed for time and for all eternity in the holy temple. There is a time and season for all of our decisions. Make sure you make decisions in the proper time and season. All of these life-altering decisions will be made in a very busy, relatively short period during your 20s—during what I call the “Decade of Decision.”</p>

For example, I practiced deciding when to bail out of an airplane if the fire warning light came on and I began to spin out of control. I remember one dear friend who didn’t make these preparations. He would find a way out of simulator training and then go to play golf or swim. He never learned his emergency procedures! A few months later, fire erupted in his plane, and it spun toward the ground in flames. Noting the fire warning light, his younger companion, having developed a preconditioned response, knew when to bail out of the plane and parachuted to safety. But my friend who had not prepared to make that decision stayed with the plane and died in the crash.</p>

As you are Aaronic Priesthood bearers, it is important that you prepare now. You must develop your own preconditioned responses for the important decisions you will make in the next decade of your life. You must know what to do and when to do it when each decision presents itself. Remember that making no decision at all could be just as deadly as making the wrong decision. <span class="pageBreak" page-number="49"></span>Many of the decisions you make or don’t make will have eternal consequences.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Now is the time</span> to become a disciple of Jesus Christ, which means accepting His invitation to “come, follow me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> This is the decision we made in our premortal lives. Now we must make it again here in mortality, every day, in every situation by taking the Savior’s name upon us, remembering His atoning sacrifice, and keeping His commandments. This we covenanted to do when we were baptized, and we have the opportunity to renew those covenants each week as we partake of the sacrament.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Now is the time</span> to organize and prepare ourselves to have the Holy Ghost as our constant companion. This means doing what your parents and leaders have taught you to do—study the scriptures; pray morning and night; keep a neat, well-groomed appearance; follow a schedule; set and achieve goals; be honest in your dealings; keep commitments; and be worthy of the priesthood you bear. Always, always live the standards, revealed by prophets, in the booklet <span class="emphasis">For the Strength of Youth.</span></p>

        <span class="emphasis">Now is the time</span> to decide who your friends are and to become worthy of a righteous eternal companion. It is very simple, brethren. As my mother taught me, “Birds of a feather flock together.” Your peer group can inspire you to do great things or tempt you into strange and miserable paths. True friends make it easier to live the gospel. They never make us choose between their ways and the Lord’s ways. They help us be the kind of person that attracts other true friends. And they help us <span class="emphasis">become</span> the kind of person a righteous companion can choose to be with forever. If you want those kinds of friends, ask yourself: “Am I that kind of friend to others? Am I the kind of person I want my eternal companion to be?”</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Now is the time</span> to prepare for your mission. Depending upon your individual circumstance, you may be able to serve a full-time proselyting mission. While this is important, remember that even more important is going to the temple <span class="emphasis">on the way</span> to your mission. A mission is a priceless opportunity to keep temple covenants by living the law of consecration—giving all of your time, gifts, and talents to the Lord and serving Him with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. I have always felt that the two years you serve will be a tithing of time on the first 20 years of your life. But even if you are not able to serve a full-time mission, you can prepare for one day in the future, when the time is right, to go to the temple to make sacred covenants so that you can receive your eternal blessings.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Now is the time</span> to prepare for training, education, and an occupation. As young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, you are in the internship of life. Your diligence in school now will qualify you to keep President Hinckley’s counsel in the future—to get all of the education you can.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Decide now to do your best in school and at work. Then, when opportunities knock, you will be ready to open <span class="pageBreak" page-number="50"></span>the door and take advantage of them. We should all remember: “To every man is given a gift.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> Develop your gifts and talents. Young men, prayerfully select classes, training programs, and jobs that will prepare you for greater opportunities and more responsibility in the future.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Now is the time</span> to obey. In the premortal existence, ours was not a selective obedience. We did not pick and choose which parts of the eternal plan to follow. I learned that lesson on our first night flying solo in pilot training when all of us were given the instruction: “Don’t fly acrobatic patterns at night. You are beginning pilots without instrument flight training.” Some time later, an otherwise good pilot and a great friend chose to disobey that command. As he flew loops and barrel rolls through the night sky over Texas, he looked through the cockpit canopy and thought he saw stars above him, but he was really seeing the lights of oil rigs below. He was experiencing vertigo: the g-forces on his plane made it seem he was right side up, yet he was upside down. As he pulled up on the stick to climb higher into the night sky, he dove toward the earth and crashed into the twinkling lights of the oil field below.</p>

Brethren young and old, when we practice selective obedience, we change our position relative to the Lord—and usually by only one degree at a time. As the deceptive forces of the adversary work on us, we cannot detect them, and we experience spiritual vertigo. While it may <span class="emphasis">seem</span> like we are going in a safe direction, we are in fact headed for disaster. In the preexistence, our decision to follow the Lord was all-or-nothing. Following that pattern through our mortal probation will get each of us back to our Heavenly Father.</p>

        <span class="emphasis">Now is the time</span> to use our time properly. “This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> I testify that your time on earth will be sufficient if you learn to use it wisely in your youth. “O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span></p>

        <span class="emphasis">Now is the time</span> to safeguard your birthright. Nearing the end of his life, the Old Testament prophet Jacob gave a father’s blessing to each of his sons. Reuben was the firstborn and had the birthright—special blessings intended just for him.

Eyring as a counselor in the First Presidency, Elder Quentin L. Cook in the Quorum of the Twelve, and Elder Walter F. González in the seven Presidents of the Seventy. I offer them my love and support and testify that they are called of God by a living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, “according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Personal revelation is the way we know for ourselves the most important truths of our existence: the living reality of God, our Eternal Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ; the truthfulness of the restored gospel; and God’s purpose and direction for us.</p>

This afternoon I would like to share a few of these personal examples and pray that they will inspire each of us to seek the blessings <span class="pageBreak" page-number="87"></span>of personal revelation in our own lives.</p>

Romney in reorganizing a stake. During the long, quiet ride to the conference, our conversation turned to the spiritual dimensions of our assignment. Elder Romney taught me about how the Lord blesses us with revelation. “Robert,” he said, “I have learned that when we are on the Lord’s errand, we have His blessings to accomplish whatever we are asked to do.” Elder Romney further explained that we would arrive in the distant city, kneel in prayer, interview priesthood holders, kneel in prayer again, and the Holy Ghost would reveal to us the person whom the Lord had chosen to be the new stake president. He promised me it would be one of the great spiritual experiences of my life, and it was.</p>

By personal revelation. Personal revelation is the way Heavenly Father helps us know Him and His Son, learn and live the gospel, endure to the end in righteousness, and qualify for eternal life—to return back into Their presence.</p>

President Lorenzo Snow had studied the gospel for several years before joining the Church. But he did not receive a witness until two or three weeks after his baptism when he retired in secret prayer. “The Spirit of God descended upon me,” he said. “O, the joy and happiness I felt, [for] I then received a perfect knowledge that God lives, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and of the restoration of the holy Priesthood, and the fulness of the Gospel.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

But more is required. While still a regional representative, I had the opportunity to learn from another Apostle, Elder Boyd K. Packer. We were assigned to reorganize a stake and began by kneeling in prayer together. After interviewing priesthood leaders and having prayer, Elder Packer suggested that we walk around the building together. As we walked, he demonstrated a vital principle of seeking personal revelation—the principle the Lord taught Oliver Cowdery: “Behold, … you must study it out in your mind.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> We pondered our assignment, counseled together, and listened to the voice of the Spirit. When we went back, we prayed and studied further, and then we were prepared to receive revelation.</p>

As a General Authority, I was assigned to help reorganize a stake presidency under the direction of Elder Ezra Taft Benson. After praying, interviewing, studying, and praying again, Elder Benson asked if I knew who the new <span class="pageBreak" page-number="88"></span>president would be. I said I had not received that inspiration yet. He looked at me for a long time and replied he hadn’t either. However, we <span class="emphasis">were</span> inspired to ask three worthy priesthood holders to speak in the Saturday evening session of conference. Moments after the third speaker began, the Spirit prompted me that he should be the new stake president. I looked over at President Benson and saw tears streaming down his face. Revelation had been given to both of us—but only by continuing to seek our Heavenly Father’s will as we moved forward in faith.</p>

Lee taught this lesson when he came to organize a new stake in the district where we were living. Elder Lee asked me, as a newly sustained bishop, if I would join him at a press conference. There, an intense young reporter challenged Elder Lee. He said to him, “You call yourself a prophet. When was the last time you had revelation, and what was it about?” Elder Lee paused, looked directly at him, and responded in a sweet way, “It was yesterday afternoon about three o’clock. We were praying about who should be called as the president of the new stake, and it was made known to us who that individual should be.” The reporter’s heart changed. I will never forget the Spirit that came into that room as Elder Lee bore his powerful witness of revelation that can be received by those faithfully seeking to do the Lord’s will.</p>

The more we receive and acknowledge personal revelation, the more our testimonies grow. As a bishop, my testimony grew each time I received revelation to extend callings to ward members. That testimony has been strengthened each time I witness General Authorities and officers, Area Seventies, and stake presidents called or given new assignments. More importantly, I am strengthened by the personal revelations I receive in my role as a son of God, a husband, and a father. I am so thankful for the guidance and direction of the Spirit in our home as we seek for direction in family matters.</p>

Kimball received the revelation on the priesthood.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> And after praying about providing temple blessings to more members of the Church, President Hinckley received revelation about the building of smaller temples.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

By design, most miracles are spiritual demonstrations of God’s power—tender mercies gently bestowed through impressions, ideas, feelings of assurance, solutions to problems, strength to meet challenges, and comfort to bear disappointments and sorrow.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="29"></span>Like you, I appreciated the participation in the solemn assembly. But I thought I might give one point of doctrine and help. When we raised our hands to the square in the solemn assembly, it was not just a vote in that we gave of ourselves a private and personal commitment, even a covenant, to sustain and to uphold the laws, ordinances, commandments, and the prophet of God, President Thomas S. Monson. I so appreciated participating with you and raising my right hand to the square.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="30"></span>I know with surety that our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ live. The Atonement is real. God the Father and Jesus Christ are distinct, separate, immortal beings. They know us as individuals, and They hear and answer our sincere prayers. The Savior testified to the inhabitants of the New World, “I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> The Holy Ghost has testified to me that these things are true.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/04/gaining-a-testimony-of-god-the-father-his-son-jesus-christ-and-the-holy-ghost.p5" pid="E4M7p53oAkirIpzQ8Pka0g" hash="Ng0eBw">I began to gain my testimony in my youth when I reflected on 13 prophetic statements called the Articles of Faith, written by Joseph Smith. It was in Primary that we memorized them. They describe the basic beliefs of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. The first of these statements reads, “We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span></p>

As a 14-year-old boy he wanted to know which of the many Christian churches he should join. In the Bible, in the book of James of the New Testament, he read, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> Obediently he knelt in prayer and was visited by God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. He described Them as “two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above [Joseph] in the air. One of them [God the Father] spake unto [him], calling [him] by name and said, pointing to the other—<span class="emphasis">This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</span>”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

The young prophet learned the truth about our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, because he sought to know from the scriptures his Heavenly Father’s will and then he faithfully obeyed.</p>

When Jesus was a 12-year-old boy, His mother, Mary, and His earthly father, Joseph, found Him teaching in the temple. Jesus asked them, “Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> But Jesus was not speaking of Joseph’s business.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="31"></span>Who is this Jesus? He participated with His Father in the Creation of the world and was responsible, under the direction of His Father, to create all things on the face of the earth. “And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Jesus Christ is the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. He is our Mediator with the Father. He is the Savior who laid down His life for us and pleads our cause with the Father. Therefore, we pray to Heavenly Father in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus, the Son, is not the same being as His Father, but He is <span class="emphasis">like</span> His Father. He too is a glorified being of power and authority.</p>

In His great Intercessory Prayer, which is found in the Bible in the book of John, it is unmistakably clear that Jesus acknowledges He is the Son. Listen to His words as He reports the obedient completion of His earthly mission to His Father in Heaven:</p>

In those hours alone, He again made it clear that He was not performing His own work. He prayed, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> In this most crucial moment for Him and for all of us, He was not talking to Himself or relying on His own strength. He was calling upon His Father, God Omnipotent, to sustain Him and allow Him to do His Father’s will; and His Father sent an angel “from heaven, strengthening him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> I so love the love that the Father has for His Son and for all of us.</p>

I also testify that God our Eternal Father lives and loves each of us, for we are His children.

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="72"></span>We have gathered together as one, we have taken upon us the name of Jesus Christ, and we are Christians. One of the questions we would ask: why then, if we have that love of the Savior, would someone want to be an antagonist or to attack us?</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/christian-courage-the-price-of-discipleship.p2" pid="1th9hXnpvkmiMz9EELOhWg" hash="JAuDoQ">Recently a group of bright, faithful young Latter-day Saints wrote down some of the most pressing questions on their minds. One sister asked, “Why doesn’t the Church defend itself more actively when accusations are made against it?”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/christian-courage-the-price-of-discipleship.p3" pid="lU3iijHLsE2pQEDtZuk1kg" hash="GB0HEg">To her inquiry I would say that one of mortality’s great tests comes when our beliefs are questioned or criticized. In such moments, we may want to respond aggressively—to “put up our dukes.” But these are important opportunities to step back, pray, and follow the Savior’s example. Remember that Jesus Himself was despised and rejected by the world. And in Lehi’s dream, those coming to the Savior also endured “mocking and pointing … fingers” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8.27" class="scriptureRef">1 Nephi 8:27</a>). “The world hath hated [my disciples],” Jesus said, “because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.14" class="scriptureRef">John 17:14</a>). But when we respond to our accusers as the Savior did, we not only become more Christlike, we invite others to feel His love and follow Him as well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/christian-courage-the-price-of-discipleship.p4" pid="jJlPrJT10UK7Wv539bwdtA" hash="AMruCw">To respond in a Christlike way cannot be scripted or based on a formula. The Savior responded differently in every situation. When He was confronted by wicked King Herod, He remained silent. When He stood before Pilate, He bore a simple and powerful testimony of His divinity and purpose. Facing the moneychangers who were defiling the temple, He exercised His divine responsibility to preserve and protect that which was sacred. Lifted up upon a cross, He uttered the incomparable Christian response: “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/luke/23.34" class="scriptureRef">Luke 23:34</a>).</p>

But to “love [our] enemies, bless them that curse [us], do good to them that hate [us], and pray for them which despitefully use [us], and persecute [us]” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/5.44" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 5:44</a>) takes faith, strength, and, most of all, Christian courage.</p>

Though he “suffer[ed] severe persecution at the hands of all classes of men, both religious and irreligious” (<a href="/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.27" class="scriptureRef">Joseph Smith—History 1:27</a>), he did not retaliate or give in to hatred. Like all true disciples of Christ, he stood with the Savior by loving others in a tolerant and compassionate way. <span class="emphasis">That</span> is Christian courage.</p>

We show forth His love, which is the only power that can subdue the adversary and answer our accusers without accusing them in return. That is not weakness. <span class="emphasis">That</span> is Christian courage.</p>

Although the king vigorously opposed Abinadi and eventually sentenced him to death, Abinadi boldly taught the gospel and bore his testimony anyway. Because Abinadi took advantage of that opportunity, a priest named Alma was converted to the gospel and brought many souls unto Christ. The courage of Abinadi and Alma was Christian courage.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="73"></span>Experience shows that seasons of negative publicity about the Church can help accomplish the Lord’s purposes. In 1983 the First Presidency wrote to Church leaders, “Opposition may be in itself an opportunity. Among the continuing challenges faced by our missionaries is a lack of interest in religious matters and in our message. These criticisms create … interest in the Church. … This provides an opportunity [for members] to present the truth to those whose attention is thus directed toward us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

We can answer with love those who have been influenced by misinformation and prejudice—who are “kept from the truth because they know not where to find it” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123.12" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 123:12</a>). I assure you that to answer our accusers in this way is never weakness. <span class="emphasis">It is</span> Christian courage in action.</p>

Fortunately, the Lord knows the hearts of our accusers and how we can most effectively respond to them. <span class="emphasis">As true disciples seek guidance from the Spirit, they receive inspiration tailored to each encounter.</span> And in every encounter, <span class="emphasis">true disciples respond in ways that invite the Spirit of the Lord.</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/christian-courage-the-price-of-discipleship.p13" pid="EdJ18bLUx0CRL-2MhTh26Q" hash="Fe0N9Q">Paul reminded the Corinthians that his preaching was “not with the enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.4" class="scriptureRef">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>). Because that power resides in the Spirit of the Lord, we must never become contentious when we are discussing our faith. As almost every missionary learns, Bible bashing always drives the Spirit away. The Savior has said, “He that hath the spirit of contention is not of me” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.29" class="scriptureRef">3 Nephi 11:29</a>). More regrettable than the Church being accused of not being Christian is when Church members react to such accusations in an un-Christlike way! May our conversations with others always be marked by the fruits of the Spirit—“love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, [and] temperance” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/gal/5.22-23" class="scriptureRef">Galatians 5:22–23</a>). To be meek, as defined in Webster’s dictionary, is “manifesting patience and longsuffering: enduring injury without resentment.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> Meekness is not weakness. It is a badge of Christian courage.</p>

Surely our Heavenly Father is saddened—and the devil laughs—when we contentiously debate doctrinal differences with our Christian neighbors.</p>

We cannot change the doctrines of the restored gospel, even if teaching and obeying them makes us unpopular in the eyes of the world. Yet even as we feel to speak the word of God with boldness, we must pray to be filled with the Holy Ghost (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/acts/4.29,31" class="scriptureRef">Acts 4:29, 31</a>). We should never confuse boldness with Satan’s counterfeit: overbearance (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.12" class="scriptureRef">Alma 38:12</a>). True disciples speak with quiet confidence, not boastful pride.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/christian-courage-the-price-of-discipleship.p16" pid="Ej3WULsrXkqCTtc_GaFRxA" hash="qjrxyA">
        <span class="emphasis">As true disciples, our primary concern must be others’ welfare, not personal vindication.</span> Questions and criticisms give us an opportunity to reach out to others and demonstrate that they matter to our Heavenly Father and to us. Our aim should be to help them understand the truth, not defend our egos or score points <span class="pageBreak" page-number="74"></span>in a theological debate. Our heartfelt testimonies are the most powerful answer we can give our accusers. And such testimonies can only be borne in love and meekness. We should be like Edward Partridge, of whom the Lord said, “His heart is pure before me, for he is like unto Nathanael of old, in whom there is no guile” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/41.11" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 41:11</a>). To be guileless is to have a childlike innocence, to be slow to take offense and quick to forgive.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/christian-courage-the-price-of-discipleship.p17" pid="xhdJvB6_VUqHCVmE3sz8ng" hash="_0djqw">These qualities are first learned in the home and family and can be practiced in all our relationships. To be guileless is to look for our own fault first. When accused, we should ask as the Savior’s Apostles did, “Lord, is it I?” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/26.22" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 26:22</a>). If we listen to the answer given by the Spirit, we can, if needed, make corrections, apologize, seek forgiveness, and do better.</p>

We need them, and they need us. As President Thomas S. Monson has taught, “Let us learn respect for others. … None of us lives alone—in our city, our nation, or our world.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/christian-courage-the-price-of-discipleship.p19" pid="68MpKCEnLUuU7B96PWMnjQ" hash="GxrJ9g">As the Savior demonstrated with Herod, <span class="emphasis">sometimes true disciples must show Christian courage by saying nothing at all.</span> Once when I was golfing, I barely brushed up against a large cholla cactus, which seems to shoot needles like a porcupine. Thorns from that plant stuck all over my clothing, even though I had barely touched the cactus plant. Some situations are like that plant: they can only injure us. In such instances, we are better off to keep our distance and simply walk away. As we do, some may try to provoke us and engage us in argument. In the Book of Mormon, we read about Lehonti and his men camped upon a mount. The traitorous Amalickiah urged Lehonti to “come down” and meet him in the valley. But when Lehonti left the high ground, he was poisoned “by degrees” until he died, and his army fell into Amalickiah’s hands (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/47" class="scriptureRef">Alma 47</a>). By arguments and accusations, some people bait us to leave the high ground. The high ground is where the light is. It’s where we see the first light of morning and the last light in the evening. It is the safe ground. It is true and where knowledge is. Sometimes others want us to come down off the high ground and join them in a theological scrum in the mud. These few contentious individuals are set on picking religious fights, online or in person. We are always better staying on the higher ground of mutual respect and love.</p>

Nehemiah’s enemies entreated him to meet them on the plain, where “they thought to do [him] mischief.” Unlike Lehonti, however, Nehemiah wisely refused their offer with this message: “I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/neh/6.2-3" class="scriptureRef">Nehemiah 6:2–3</a>). We too have a great work to do, which will not be accomplished if we allow ourselves to stop and argue and be distracted. Instead we should muster Christian courage and move on. As we read in Psalms, “Fret not thyself because of evildoers” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/ps/37.1" class="scriptureRef">Psalm 37:1</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2008/10/christian-courage-the-price-of-discipleship.p21" pid="Nm20uV807UOrmJP0HSeHPg" hash="zOf1nQ">Evil will always be with us in this world. Part of mortality’s great test is to be in the world without becoming like the world. In His Intercessory Prayer, the Savior asked His Heavenly Father, “I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/17.15" class="scriptureRef">John 17:15</a>). But even as the Savior warned of persecution, He promised peace: “Peace I leave with <span class="pageBreak" page-number="75"></span>you, my peace I give unto you. … Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.27" class="scriptureRef">John 14:27</a>). I testify that with the mantle of His peace upon us, the First Presidency’s promise will be fulfilled: “The opposition which may seem hard to bear will be a blessing to the kingdom of God upon the earth.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span></p>

Whatever their race, creed, religion, or political persuasion, if we follow Christ and show forth His courage, we must love them. We do not feel we are <span class="emphasis">better than</span> they are. Rather, we desire with our love to show them a<span class="emphasis"> better way</span>—the way of Jesus Christ. His way leads to the gate of baptism, the strait and narrow path of righteous living, and the temple of God. <span class="emphasis">He</span> is “the way, the truth, and the life” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/john/14.6" class="scriptureRef">John 14:6</a>). Only through Him can we and all our brothers and sisters inherit the greatest gift we can receive—eternal life and eternal happiness. To help them, to be an example for them, is not for the weak. It is for the strong. It is for you and me, Latter-day Saints who pay the price of discipleship by answering our accusers with Christian courage.</p>

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="7"></span>How blessed we are to be led by a living prophet! Growing up during the Great Depression, President Thomas S. Monson learned how to serve others. Often his mother asked him to deliver food to needy neighbors, and she would give homeless men odd jobs in exchange for home-cooked meals. Later as a young bishop, he was taught by President J. Reuben Clark, “Be kind to the widow and look after the poor” (in Thomas S. Monson, “A Provident Plan—A Precious Promise,” <span class="emphasis">Ensign,</span> May 1986, 62). President Monson looked after 84 widows and cared for them until they passed away. Through the years, his service to members and neighbors throughout the world has become the hallmark of his ministry. We are grateful to have his example. Thank you, President Monson.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p2" pid="bbv_3iQaTkOTvVNUS4_5dA" hash="r5k_Ig">Brothers and sisters, as did President Monson, our children are growing up in times of economic uncertainty. Just as our grandparents and great-grandparents learned vital lessons through economic adversity, what we learn now, in our present circumstances, can bless us and our posterity for generations to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p3" pid="enrleVODjkmGSxngccXdXQ" hash="ioKOiw">Today I speak to all whose freedom to choose has been diminished by the effects of ill-advised choices of the past. I speak specifically of choices that have led to excessive debt and addictions to food, drugs, pornography, and other patterns of thought and action that diminish one’s sense of self-worth. All of these excesses affect us individually and undermine our family relationships. Of course some debt incurred for education, a modest home, or a basic automobile may be necessary to provide for a family. Unfortunately however, additional debt is incurred when we cannot control our wants and addictive impulses. And for both debt and addiction, the hopeful solution is the same—we must turn to the Lord and follow His commandments. We must want more than anything else to change our lives so that we can break the cycle of debt and our uncontrolled wants. I pray that in the next few minutes, and throughout this conference, you will be filled with hope in our Savior, Jesus Christ, and find hope in the doctrines of His restored gospel.</p>

Let me assure you that your situation is not beyond the reach of our Savior. Through Him, every struggle can be for our experience and our good (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 122:7</a>). Each temptation we overcome is to strengthen us, not destroy us. The Lord will never allow us to suffer beyond what we can endure (see <a href="/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.13" class="scriptureRef">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>).</p>

He knows where, when, and <span class="emphasis">how</span> to tempt us. If we are obedient to the promptings of the Holy Ghost, we can learn to recognize the adversary’s enticements. Before we yield to temptation, we must learn to say with unflinching resolve, “Get thee behind me, Satan” (<a href="/scriptures/nt/matt/16.23" class="scriptureRef">Matthew 16:23</a>).</p>

We must ask for help from our Heavenly Father and seek strength through the Atonement of His Son, Jesus Christ. In both temporal and spiritual things, <span class="pageBreak" page-number="8"></span>obtaining this divine assistance enables us to become provident providers for ourselves and others.</p>

To provide providently, we must practice the principles of provident living: joyfully living within our means, being content with what we have, avoiding excessive debt, and diligently saving and preparing for rainy-day emergencies. When we live providently, we can provide for ourselves and our families and also follow the Savior’s example to serve and bless others.</p>

Our world is fraught with feelings of entitlement. Some of us feel embarrassed, ashamed, less worthwhile if our family does not have everything the neighbors have. As a result, we go into debt to buy things we can’t afford—and things we do not really need. Whenever we do this, we become poor temporally <span class="emphasis">and</span> spiritually. We give away some of our precious, priceless agency and put ourselves in self-imposed servitude. Money we could have used to care for ourselves and others must now be used to pay our debts. What remains is often only enough to meet our most basic physical needs. Living at the subsistence level, we become depressed, our self-worth is affected, and our relationships with family, friends, neighbors, and the Lord are weakened. We do not have the time, energy, or interest to seek spiritual things.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p10" pid="UMjZIMCqnEqCwxQGuNO4Lw" hash="tbA4Yw">How then do we avoid and overcome the patterns of debt and addiction to temporal, worldly things? May I share with you two lessons in provident living that can help each of us. These lessons, along with many other important lessons of my life, were taught to me by my wife and eternal companion. These lessons were learned at two different times in our marriage—both on occasions when I wanted to buy her a special gift.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p11" pid="-hoE6vOXVkuGrCaxqJUQRA" hash="fgE9zQ">The first lesson was learned when we were newly married and had very little money. I was in the air force, and we had missed Christmas together. I was on assignment overseas. When I got home, I saw a beautiful dress in a store window and suggested to my wife that if she liked it, we would buy it. Mary went into the dressing room of the store. After a moment the salesclerk came out, brushed by me, and returned the dress to its place in the store window. As we left the store, I asked, “What happened?” She replied, “It was a beautiful dress, but <span class="emphasis">we can’t afford it!</span>” Those words went straight to my heart. I have learned that the three most loving words are “I love you,” and the four most caring words for those we love are “We can’t afford it.”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p12" pid="a-zDDkASwEihnJR80jBFjw" hash="dV_aLg">The second lesson was learned several years later when we were more financially secure. Our wedding anniversary was approaching, and I wanted to buy Mary a fancy coat to show my love and appreciation for our many happy years together. When I asked what she thought of the coat I had in mind, she replied with words that again penetrated my heart and mind. “Where would I wear it?” she <span class="pageBreak" page-number="9"></span>asked. (At the time she was a ward Relief Society president helping to minister to needy families.)</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p13" pid="OE2wj392gUi4OXLB6-WHYA" hash="A8FEVQ">Then she taught me an unforgettable lesson. She looked me in the eyes and sweetly asked, “Are you buying this for me or for you?” In other words, she was asking, “Is the purpose of this gift to show your love for me or to show me that you are a good provider or to prove something to the world?” I pondered her question and realized I was thinking less about her and our family and more about me.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p14" pid="_0frDMfrsEiTuCmfzA4p_g" hash="2hU1Wg">After that we had a serious, life-changing discussion about provident living, and both of us agreed that our money would be better spent in paying down our home mortgage and adding to our children’s education fund.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p15" pid="btBg_0xWZkCen3i_DrEpkg" hash="Kur8kQ">These two lessons are the essence of provident living. When faced with the choice to buy, consume, or engage in worldly things and activities, we all need to learn to say to one another, “We <span class="emphasis">can’t</span> afford it, even though we want it!” or “We <span class="emphasis">can</span> afford it, but we don’t <span class="emphasis">need</span> it—and we really don’t even want it!”</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p16" pid="EGG0wE72ik6F3NuxgL5alw" hash="fYQFsw">There is an equally important principle underlying these lessons: we can learn much from communicating with our husbands and wives. As we counsel and work together in family councils, we can help each other become provident providers and teach our children to live providently as well.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p17" pid="MYFYkmwUwUWVGsUbN-Y5gw" hash="YmFDTQ">The foundation of provident living is the law of the tithe. The primary purpose of this law is to help us develop faith in our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. Tithing helps us overcome our desires for the things of this world and willingly make sacrifices for others. Tithing is the great equitable law, for no matter how rich or poor we are, all of us pay the same one-tenth of our increase annually (see <a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/119.4" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 119:4</a>), and all of us receive blessings so great “that there shall not be room enough to receive [them]” (<a href="/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10" class="scriptureRef">Malachi 3:10</a>).</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p18" pid="xm8L_un0vU2IllGMaUccGQ" hash="0ARBHA">In addition to our tithes, we should also be an example with the payment of fast offerings. A fast offering is at least the cost of the two consecutive meals from which we fast each month. By not eating these two meals, we draw close to the Lord in humility and prayer and also participate in anonymous giving to bless our brothers and sisters all over the world.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p19" pid="tNFZVuiWIkiHh8_UtGS2vQ" hash="qdK3sw">Another important way we help our children learn to be provident providers is by establishing a family budget. We should regularly review our family income, savings, and spending plan in family council meetings. This will teach our children to recognize the difference between wants and needs and to plan ahead for meaningful use of family resources.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p20" pid="S3VXGFBQ7k-ef9OzCEo4GA" hash="X4PWtQ">When our boys were young, we had a family council and set a goal to take a “dream vacation” down the Colorado River. When any of us wanted to buy something during the next year, we would ask each other, “Do we really want to buy that thing now, or do we <span class="pageBreak" page-number="10"></span>want to take our dream trip later?” This was a wonderful teaching experience in choosing provident living. By not satisfying our every immediate want, we obtained the more desirable reward of family togetherness and fond memories for years to come.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p21" pid="1eSYGv6rkkSJ5fjJAimb0A" hash="8TrwGA">Whenever we want to experience or possess something that will impact us and our resources, we may want to ask ourselves, “Is the benefit temporary, or will it have eternal value and significance?” Truthfully answering these questions may help us avoid excessive debt and other addictive behavior.</p>
      <p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2009/04/becoming-provident-providers-temporally-and-spiritually.p22" pid="W2I3qopPt0GwgC16mBUkrg" hash="I6qw-Q">In seeking to overcome debt and addictive behaviors, we should remember that addiction is the craving of the natural man, and it can never be satisfied. It is an insatiable appetite. When we are addicted, we seek those worldly possessions or physical pleasures that seem to entice us. But as children of God, our deepest hunger and what we should be seeking is what the Lord alone can provide—His love, His sense of worth, His security, His confidence, His hope in the future, and assurance of His love, which brings us eternal joy.</p>

We must say, as did King Lamoni’s father, “I will give away all my sins to know thee” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.18" class="scriptureRef">Alma 22:18</a>). Then we can go to Him with steadfast determination and promise Him, “I will do whatever it takes.” Through prayer, fasting, obedience to the commandments, priesthood blessings, and His atoning sacrifice, we will feel His love and power in our lives. We will receive His spiritual guidance and strength through the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Only through our Lord’s Atonement can we obtain a mighty change of heart (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>; <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14" class="scriptureRef">Alma 5:14</a>) and experience a mighty change in our addictive behavior.</p>

Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.51" class="scriptureRef">2 Nephi 9:51</a>).</p>

The hunger of addiction can only be replaced by our love for Him. He stands ready to help each one of us. “Fear not,” He said, “for you are mine, and I have overcome the world” (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.41" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 50:41</a>).</p>

May each of us also overcome worldly temptation by coming unto Him and by becoming provident providers both temporally and spiritually for ourselves and others is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

Belief in God is widely questioned and even attacked in the name of political, social, and even religious causes. Atheism, or the doctrine that there is no God, is fast spreading across the world.</p>

Growth and progress would be temporary, accomplishment without value, challenges without meaning. There would be no ultimate right and wrong and no moral responsibility to care for one another as fellow children of God. Indeed, without God, there would be no mortal or eternal life.</p>

One prominent religious scholar has even taught that imagining God in the form of man is creating a graven image and is idolatrous and blasphemous.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> But God Himself said, “Let <span class="emphasis">us</span> make man in <span class="emphasis">our</span> image, after <span class="emphasis">our </span>likeness.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span></p>

God further taught, “By mine Only Begotten [Son] I created these things.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> The Father and the Son are separate and distinct individuals—as any father and son always are. This may be one reason the name of God in Hebrew, <span class="emphasis">Elohim,</span> is not singular but plural.</p>

From the book of Ether in the Book of Mormon, we read, “And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Later the Lord revealed Himself, saying, “Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and … I [will] appear unto my people in the flesh.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

Of the Savior Jesus Christ, the Prophet Joseph Smith recounts, “His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

He was the prophet chosen to restore the ancient Church of Christ in this, the last time when the gospel will be on the earth before the return of Jesus Christ. Like all the prophets who opened the work of God in their dispensations, Joseph was given especially clear and powerful prophetic experiences to prepare the world for the Savior’s Second Coming.</p>

But each of us has agency to choose.

The Holy Ghost, the third member of the Godhead, is a personage of spirit.

When we do not do what is right or when our outlook is dominated by skepticism, cynicism, criticism, and irreverence toward others and their beliefs, the Spirit cannot be with us. We then act in a way that the prophets describe as the <span class="emphasis">natural man.</span></p>

He mocked the believers and demanded that the prophet Alma convince him with a sign of God’s existence and power. Alma’s response is as meaningful today as it was then: “Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_24">24</span></p>

If you cannot remember believing in God or if you have ceased to believe or if you believe but without real conviction, I invite you to seek a testimony of God now. Do not be afraid of ridicule. The strength and peace that come from knowing God and having the comforting companionship of His Spirit will make your efforts eternally worthwhile.</p>

The stripling warriors did not have to wonder what their parents believed. They said, “We do not doubt our mothers knew it” (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/alma/56.47-48" class="scriptureRef">Alma 56:47–48</a>). Do our children know what we know?</p>

I told him I wasn’t old enough to see that film. He was puzzled until his grandmother explained to him that the rating system by age didn’t apply to Grandpa. He came back to me and said, “I get it now, Grandpa. You’re never going to be old enough to see that movie, are you?” And he was right!</p>

To truly understand their hearts, we must do more than just be in the same room or attend the same family and Church activities. We must plan and take advantage of teaching moments that make a deep and lasting impression upon their minds and hearts.</p>

I have learned that what makes a priesthood or Scout activity most meaningful to a boy is not just getting a merit badge but having the opportunity to sit and talk with a leader who is interested in him and his life.</p>

Do you take the time to have them take the earplugs from their MP3 players and all the other devices so that they can hear you and feel of your love? The more I live, the more I recognize that the teaching moments in my youth, especially those provided by my parents, have shaped my life and made me who I am.</p>

Research shows that during the most important transitions of life—including those periods when youth are most likely to drift away from the Church—the greatest influence does not come from an interview with the bishop or some other leader but from the regular, warm, friendly, caring interaction with parents.</p>

I remember as a young man asking permission to play baseball through dinnertime. “Just put my meal in the oven,” I said to my mother. She responded, “Robert, I really want you to take a break, come home, be with the family for dinner, and then you can go out and play baseball until dark.” She taught all of us that where family meals are concerned, it’s not the food but the family interaction that <span class="pageBreak" page-number="96"></span>nourishes the soul. My mother taught that the greatest love we give is within our homes.</p>

Most important is asking them questions, letting them talk, and then being willing to listen—yes, listen and listen some more—even hearken with spiritual ears! Several years ago I was reading the newspaper when one of my young grandsons snuggled up to me. As I read, I was delighted to hear his sweet voice chattering on in the background. Imagine my surprise when, a few moments later, he pushed himself between me and the paper. Taking my face in his hands and pressing his nose up to mine, he asked, “Grandpa! Are you in there?”</p>

Then she tenderly explained, tears flowing down her cheek, “Recently I have been working with my fourth daughter by actually doing her projects with her. It has made all the difference in our lives and our relationship. But oh, what sadness I feel when I realize what I lost by not doing this with my other three daughters.” The saddest words of tongue and pen are those that say, “It might have been!”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span></p>

Remember the lesson of King Benjamin’s people. As a result of his teachings, many of the adults had a mighty change of heart (see <a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.2" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 5:2</a>). But then it says that “there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of King Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe. … And their hearts were hardened” (<a href="/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26.1,3" class="scriptureRef">Mosiah 26:1, 3</a>).</p>

We can teach them to walk in the light, but that light cannot be borrowed. They must earn it for themselves. They must obtain their own light of testimony directly from the source of spiritual light—God Himself—through <span class="pageBreak" page-number="97"></span>prayer and study and pondering. They must understand who they are and who Heavenly Father wants them to become. How do we help them?</p>

In these sacred settings, we can also help them understand, deep in their hearts, who they are and how fortunate they are to have come to this earth and to our home and to participate in the covenants we have taken in the temple to be a family forever. In every interaction we share, we demonstrate the principles and blessings of the gospel.</p>

Will we help them put on that armor so they can withstand the fiery darts of the adversary? To truly choose the Lord’s way, they must know His way.

When Cain took his brother’s life because he loved Satan more than God, his spiritual progress was stopped.</p>

One day my father assigned me to varnish a wooden floor. I made the choice to begin at the door and work my way <span class="emphasis">into</span> the room. When I was almost finished, I realized I had left myself no way to get out. There was no window or door on the other side. I had literally painted myself into a corner. I had no place to go. I was stuck.</p>

Though we are spiritually stuck, there is always a way back. Like repentance, turning around and walking across a newly varnished floor means more work—a lot of resanding and refinishing!

        <span class="pageBreak" page-number="71"></span>On this Sabbath morning, we give thanks for and testify of the living reality of our Savior. His gospel has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormon is true. We are led by a living prophet today, President Thomas S. Monson. Above all, we bear solemn witness of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the eternal blessings that flow from it.</p>

Through the humiliation of a public trial and the agony of crucifixion, He waited upon His Father, willing to be “wounded for our transgressions … [and] bruised for our iniquities.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Even as He cried out, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span> He waited upon His Father—exercising His agency to forgive His enemies,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> see that His mother was watched over,<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> and endure to the end until His life and mortal mission were finished.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

How do we do this? The scriptures give us an answer in one simple phrase: we “wait upon the Lord.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Tests and trials are given to all of us. These mortal challenges allow us and our Heavenly Father to see whether we will exercise our agency to follow His Son.

Won’t all of us, sometime, have reason to ask, “O God, where art thou?”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span> Yes! When a spouse dies, a companion will wonder. When financial hardship befalls a family, a father will ask. When children wander from the path, a mother and father will cry out in sorrow. Yes, “weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15">15</span> Then, in the dawn of our increased faith and understanding, we arise and choose to wait upon the Lord, saying, “Thy will be done.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

As a young man, President David O. McKay prayed for a witness of the truthfulness of the gospel. Many years later, while he was serving his mission in Scotland, that witness finally came.

      <span class="pageBreak" page-number="34"></span>The Savior told His disciples about a son who left his wealthy father, went to a far country, and wasted his inheritance. When a famine arose, the young man took the lowly job of feeding swine. He was so hungry that he wanted to eat the husks meant for the animals.</p>

In the Savior’s words, “he came to himself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> He remembered who he was, realized what he had been missing, and began to desire the blessings freely available in his father’s house.</p>

At these times we should strive to <span class="emphasis">come to ourselves</span> and come back into the light of our Savior’s love.</p>

Desiring these blessings, including a life of joy and happiness, is an essential part of Heavenly Father’s plan for each one of us.

How, then, do we help others, ourselves, and our families increase our desires to follow the Savior and live His gospel? How do we strengthen our desires to repent, become worthy, and endure to the end? How do we help our youth and young adults let these desires work in them until they are converted and become true “saint[s] through the atonement of Christ”?<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span></p>

For the sacrament to be a spiritually cleansing experience each week, we need to prepare ourselves <span class="emphasis">before</span> coming to sacrament meeting. We do this by deliberately leaving behind our daily work and recreation and letting go of worldly thoughts and concerns. As we do, we make room in our minds and hearts for the Holy Ghost.</p>

More than just thinking about the facts of the Savior’s suffering and death, our pondering helps us to recognize that through the Savior’s sacrifice, we have the hope, opportunity, and strength to make real, heartfelt changes in our lives.</p>

Let them search the scriptures for themselves and teach one another from their own experiences.</p>

This preparation is made throughout the week by living gospel standards. When young men prepare, bless, and pass the sacrament in worthiness and reverence, they literally follow the example of the Savior at the Last Supper<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> and become like Him.</p>

As we renew the covenant to keep the commandments, we obtain the companionship of the Holy Ghost to lead us back into our Heavenly Father’s presence. No wonder we are commanded to “meet together oft to partake of [the] bread and [water]”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> and to partake of the sacrament to our souls.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7">7</span></p>

We become worthy by steadily and steadfastly obeying the commandments. This obedience begins in childhood and intensifies through experiences in the Aaronic Priesthood and Young Women during the years of preparation. Then, hopefully, priests and Laurels set goals and specifically prepare themselves to be endowed and sealed in the temple.</p>

How do we personally gain that strength? We strive to obtain a testimony of Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, the reality of the Atonement, and the truthfulness of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Restoration. We sustain our leaders, treat our families with kindness, stand as a witness of the Lord’s true Church, attend our Church <span class="pageBreak" page-number="36"></span>meetings, honor our covenants, fulfill parental obligations, and live a virtuous life. You may say that sounds like just being a faithful Latter-day Saint! You are right. The standard for temple recommend holders is not too high for us to achieve. It is simply to faithfully live the gospel and follow the prophets.</p>

These include obedience, making sacrifices to keep the commandments, loving one another, being chaste in thought and action, and giving of ourselves to build the kingdom of God. Through the Savior’s Atonement and by following these basic patterns of faithfulness, we receive “power from on high”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> to face the challenges of life. We need this divine power today more than ever. It is power we receive only through temple ordinances. I testify that the sacrifices we make to receive temple ordinances are worth every effort we can make.</p>

The Savior said to Peter, “When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> I am impressed that today’s youth have deep desires to serve and bless others—to make a difference in this world. They also crave the joy that their service brings.</p>

All of us have an “imperative duty”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span> to assist our youth in preparing for lifelong service by helping them become self-reliant. In addition to the spiritual self-reliance we have been discussing, there is temporal self-reliance, which includes getting a postsecondary education or vocational training, learning to work, and living within our means. By avoiding debt and saving money now, we are prepared for full-time Church service in the years to come. The purpose of both temporal and spiritual self-reliance is to get ourselves on higher ground so that we can lift others in need.</p>

As the poet reminds us, “Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: ‘It might have been!’”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> Let us not live our lives in regret of what we did or did not do!</p>

And “when [the son] was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and … kissed him.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> In honor of his son’s return, he called for a robe, a ring, and a celebration with a fatted calf<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span>—reminders that no blessings will be withheld if we faithfully endure in walking the path back to our Heavenly Father.</p>

As we act on our desires and come to ourselves, we will be “encircled about eternally in the arms of his love”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span> and welcomed home.

I invited the students to imagine that the Church was on one side of the podium, right here, and the world was just a foot or two away on the other side. This represented the “very short distance between where the world was and where the Church standards were” when I was in college. Then, standing before the students 30 years later, I held up my hands in the same manner and explained, “The world has gone far afield; [it has traveled; it is nowhere to be seen;] it has proceeded way, way out, all the way out of this [building and around the world]. … What we and our children and our grandchildren have to remember is that the Church will remain constant, [it’s still right here; yet] the world will keep moving—that gap is [becoming] wider and wider. … Therefore, be very careful.

Adam gathered his posterity and prophesied of things to come. Moses gathered the children of Israel and taught them the commandments he had received. The Savior taught multitudes gathered both in the Holy Land and on the American continent. Peter gathered believers in Jerusalem. The first general conference in these latter days was convened just two months after the Church was organized, and conferences have continued to this very day.</p>

It will not always be so. The world is moving away from the Lord faster and farther than ever before. The adversary has been loosed upon the earth. We watch, hear, read, study, and share the words of prophets to be forewarned and protected. For example, “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” was given long before we experienced the challenges now facing the family. “The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles” was prepared in advance of when we will need it most.</p>

You may not like what comes from the authority of the Church. It may contradict your [personal] views. It may contradict your social views. It may interfere with some of your social life. But if you listen to these things, as if from the mouth of the Lord Himself, with patience and faith, the promise is that ‘the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; … and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name’s glory’ (<a href="/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21.6" class="scriptureRef">D&amp;C 21:6</a>).”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span></p>

Now we receive the printed Church magazines within three weeks of the general conference. No longer do we have to wait months for the talks to arrive by mail. On a computer, phone, or other electronic device, we can read, listen to, watch, and share the teachings of the <span class="pageBreak" page-number="8"></span>prophets.

They are continually being refined so that they are easier to use and more relevant to our lives. On LDS.org you will find resources to help you study the gospel, strengthen your home and family, and serve in your calling. You can also find your ancestors who need temple ordinances and resources to support you in the work of salvation, including sharing the gospel. Parents can take the lead in preparing their children for baptism, the priesthood, full-time missions, and the temple. They can help us walk the strait and narrow path of temple ordinances and covenants and qualify for the blessing of eternal life.</p>

I also began to understand that God and Christ are literally a Father and a Son—separate, distinct, individual beings who are wholly unified in Their purpose. “We love [Them], because [They] first loved us.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> And over and over again I observed how They love one another and work together for our good. Listen to a few of the many scriptures that teach this truth:</p>

Research shows that many resist organized religion. Many are in debt and unemployed. A majority like the <span class="emphasis">idea</span> of marriage, but many are reluctant to take that step. A growing number don’t want children. Without the gospel and inspired guidance, many are wandering in strange paths and losing their way.</p>

That eternal plan includes holding fast to the iron rod—cleaving to God’s word and the word of His prophets. We need to tighten our grip on the rod that leads us back to Him. Now is the “day of choosing”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1">1</span> for all of us.</p>

You are the pilots. You are responsible to think about the consequences of every choice you make. Ask yourself, “If I make this choice, what is the worst thing that could happen?” Your righteous choices will keep you from getting off course.</p>

Similarly, He will help us know whether to fight, flee, or go with the flow of our unfolding circumstances. He will speak to us through prayer, and when we pray, we will have the Holy Ghost, who will guide us. We have the scriptures, the teachings of living prophets, patriarchal blessings, the counsel of inspired parents, priesthood and auxiliary leaders, and, above all, the still, small voice of the Spirit.</p>

When I was a young adult, my stake president was an investment banker on Wall Street. He taught me, “You are rich if you can live happily within your means.” How can you do it? Pay your tithing and then save! When you earn more, save more. Don’t compete with others to have expensive toys. Don’t buy what you can’t afford.</p>

Seek out scholarships and grants. Obtain part-time employment, if possible, to help pay your own way. This will require some sacrifice, but it will help you succeed.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/meeting-the-challenges-of-todays-world.p18" pid="YzcN9cDiWUCECm8pRutwAw" hash="rQZ6lw">Education prepares you for better employment opportunities. It puts you in a better position to serve and to bless those around you. It will set you on a path of lifelong learning. It will strengthen you to fight against ignorance and error. As Joseph Smith taught: “Knowledge does away with darkness, suspense and doubt; for these cannot exist where knowledge is. … In knowledge there is power.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9">9</span> “To be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> Education will prepare you for what is ahead, including marriage.</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/meeting-the-challenges-of-todays-world.p19" pid="KFQxaPh6i0qJQFVSFnL-ug" hash="IOWWAg">Again, may I speak frankly? The track that leads to marriage passes through the terrain called dating! Dating is the opportunity for lengthy conversations. When you date, learn everything you can about each other. Get to know each other’s families when possible. Are your goals compatible? Do you share the same feelings about the commandments, the Savior, the priesthood, the temple, parenting, callings in the Church, and serving others? Have you observed one another under stress, responding to success and failure, resisting anger, and dealing with setbacks? Does the person you are dating tear others down or build them up? Is his or her attitude and language and conduct what you would like to live with every day?</p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/meeting-the-challenges-of-todays-world.p20" pid="zYH_XtdWjE223TypAv5oCg" hash="lr6Jlg">That said, none of us marry <span class="emphasis">perfection;</span> we marry <span class="emphasis">potential</span>.

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/meeting-the-challenges-of-todays-world.p21" pid="c2aTiVOmt0ag1xbc4LnqPA" hash="WakKWg">Speaking plainly, please don’t date all through your 20s just to “have a good time,” thus delaying marriage in favor of other interests and activities. Why? Because dating and marriage aren’t final destinations. They are the gateway to where you ultimately want to go. “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11">11</span></p>

If you want to marry a wholesome, attractive, honest, happy, hardworking, spiritual person, <span class="emphasis">be</span> that kind of person. If you <span class="emphasis">are</span> that person and you are not married, be patient. Wait upon the Lord. I testify that the Lord knows your desires and loves you for your faithful devotion to Him. He has a plan for you, whether it be in this life or the next. Listen to His Spirit. “Seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> In this life or the next, His promises will be fulfilled. “If ye are prepared ye shall not fear.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span></p>

A wonderful Church member recently told me, “I didn’t raise my children on money; I raised them on faith.” There is a great truth to that. Begin exercising your faith in every area of your life. If you don’t, you will suffer what I would call “faith atrophy.” The very strength needed to exercise your faith will be diminished. So exercise your faith every day, and you will “wax stronger and stronger … and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14">14</span></p>
		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/meeting-the-challenges-of-todays-world.p24" pid="6Jphsz2MoESunRODUsP0YA" hash="THydfQ">To be ready for marriage, make certain you are worthy to take the sacrament and hold a temple recommend.

In my young adult years, I sought counsel from my parents and from faithful, trusted advisers. One was a priesthood leader; another was a teacher who believed in me. Both said to me, “If you want my counsel, be prepared to take it.” I understood what that meant. Prayerfully select mentors who have your spiritual well-being at heart. Be careful about taking advice from your peers. If you want more than you now have, reach <span class="emphasis">up,</span> not across!<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16">16</span></p>

Only <span class="emphasis">your</span> faith and prayers will cause you to lift yourself and have the mighty change of heart.

Because of the Savior’s atoning sacrifice for you, the power is in you.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17">17</span> You have your agency, you have strong testimonies if you are obedient, and you can follow the Spirit that guides you.</p>

		<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2015/10/meeting-the-challenges-of-todays-world.p28" pid="Vm8C3vXVM02dHtIN2GSbkw" hash="NjyZug">In the Savior’s parable of the prodigal son, the son had many blessings awaiting him, but before he could claim them, he had to look closely at his life, his choices, and his circumstances. The miracle that happened next is described in the scriptures with a simple phrase: “He came to himself.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19">19</span> May I encourage you to come to yourself? In the Church, when important decisions must be made, we often hold council meetings. Family councils serve a similar purpose. You may want to conduct what I’ll call a “personal council.” After praying, spend some time alone. Think about what is ahead. Ask yourself: “What areas of my life do I want to strengthen so that I can strengthen others? Where do I want to be a year from now? two years from now? What choices do I need to make to get there?” Just remember, you are a pilot, and you are in charge. I testify that as you come to yourself, your Heavenly Father will come to you. By the comforting hand of His Holy Spirit, He will help you along.</p>

		&lt;p class="kicker" pid="c7ymac1ZkE-EyDBmM0KW1w" hash="CwoWaA"&gt;I express my love and gratitude to Heavenly Father for the gift of the Holy Ghost, through which He reveals His will and sustains us.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p5" pid="11zRfz65nUKxvm56_01Gtg" hash="kRPnRg"&gt;My beloved brothers and sisters, I speak today as a servant of the Lord and also as a great-grandfather. To you and to my beloved posterity, I teach and bear testimony of the remarkable gift of the Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p6" pid="lzwVM0Skmkqbhg-aCUfaiQ" hash="oYnK_w"&gt;I begin by acknowledging the Light of Christ, which is given to “every man [and woman] that cometh into the world.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; All of us benefit from this holy light. It is “in all and through all things,”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; and it allows us to distinguish right from wrong.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p7" pid="uJMitz7lukqEx9YQJ9R2tQ" hash="68SfDw"&gt;But the Holy Ghost is different from the Light of Christ. He is the third member of the Godhead, a distinct personage of spirit with sacred responsibilities, and one in purpose with the Father and the Son.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p8" pid="dPZCq-2vZUmy1Ad4O0sa9w" hash="q3kxPQ"&gt;As members of the Church, we may experience the companionship of the Holy Ghost continually. Through the restored priesthood of God, we are baptized by immersion for the remission of our sins and then confirmed members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In this ordinance, we are given the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands of the holders of the priesthood.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; Thereafter, we can receive and retain the companionship of the Holy Ghost by always remembering the Savior, keeping His commandments, repenting of our sins, and worthily partaking of the sacrament on the Sabbath day.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p9" pid="LI7cwdT6HE2cHaDp98Naqg" hash="rZixaQ"&gt;The Holy Ghost provides personal revelation to help us make major life decisions about such things as education, missions, careers, marriage, children, where we will live with our families, and so on. In these matters, Heavenly Father expects us to use our agency, study the situation out in our minds according to gospel principles, and bring a decision to Him in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p10" pid="Y2VYm2p-kUOENfJ1_P-9rg" hash="dCjPiQ"&gt;Personal revelation is essential, but it is only one part of the work of the Holy Ghost. As the scriptures attest, the Holy Ghost also testifies of the Savior and God the Father.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; He teaches us “the peaceable things of the kingdom”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_7"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; and causes us to “abound in hope.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; He “leadeth [us] to do good … [and] to judge righteously.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_9"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; He gives “to every man [and woman] … a [spiritual] gift … that all may be profited thereby.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; He “giveth [us] knowledge”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_11"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt; and “bring[s] all things to [our] remembrance.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; Through the Holy Ghost, we “may be sanctified”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; and receive “a remission of [our] sins.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_14"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt; He is the “Comforter,” the same who was “promised unto [the Savior’s] disciples.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_15"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p11" pid="wfjwSvi85EaCduojpd483w" hash="OIkJ3g"&gt;I remind all of us that the Holy Ghost is not given to control us. Some of us unwisely seek the Holy Ghost’s direction on every minor decision in our lives. This trivializes His sacred role. The Holy Ghost honors the principle of agency. He speaks to our minds and our hearts gently about many matters of consequence.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_16"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p12" pid="W9T63LAS9kaPxw0sw85_OA" hash="6gO8TA"&gt;Each of us may feel the influence of the Holy Ghost differently. His promptings will be felt in different degrees of intensity according to our individual needs and circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p13" pid="2p1ZhkNu-Uatpv_GfToTiw" hash="XZY_zw"&gt;In these latter days, we affirm that only the prophet may receive revelation through the Holy Ghost for the entire Church. Some forget this, as when Aaron and Miriam tried to convince Moses to agree with them. But the Lord taught them and us. He said:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p14" pid="3J4uVm166UKD95c6BY6JqQ" hash="kxyE7g"&gt;“If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him. …&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p15" pid="JmMheEma6UmJRCc1hbAYZQ" hash="PTCwPQ"&gt;“With him will I speak mouth to mouth.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_17"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p16" pid="kpl2vg2qiECOeipIWqoc9g" hash="iO5CPA"&gt;Sometimes the adversary tempts us with false ideas that we may confuse with the Holy Ghost. I testify that faithfulness in obeying the commandments and keeping our covenants will protect us from being deceived. Through the Holy Ghost, we will be able to discern those false prophets who teach for doctrine the commandments of men.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_18"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p17" pid="ww4edexQfEqkdja2k3_4NA" hash="LnIHDA"&gt;As we receive the inspiration of the Holy Ghost for ourselves, it is wise to remember that we cannot receive revelation for others. I know of a young man who told a young woman, “I’ve had a dream that you are to be my wife.” The young woman pondered that statement and then responded, “When I have the same dream, I’ll come and talk to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p18" pid="_qJj-5LdGEeXRRtXgtF0jQ" hash="I9b8SQ"&gt;All of us may be tempted to let our personal desires overcome the guidance of the Holy Ghost. The Prophet Joseph Smith pleaded with Heavenly Father for permission to lend the first 116 pages of the Book of Mormon to Martin Harris. Joseph thought it was a good idea. At first the Holy Ghost did not give him confirming feelings. Eventually, the Lord allowed Joseph to lend the pages anyway. Martin Harris lost them. For a season, the Lord withdrew the Prophet’s gift to translate, and Joseph learned a painful but valuable lesson that shaped the remainder of his service.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p19" pid="deJNHAsZHUW19Ga4-5dvew" hash="Qpk-PA"&gt;The Holy Ghost is central to the Restoration. Regarding his boyhood reading of &lt;a href="/scriptures/nt/james/1.5" class="scriptureRef"&gt;James 1:5&lt;/a&gt;, the Prophet Joseph recounted, “Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_19"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt; The power described by Joseph Smith was the influence of the Holy Ghost. As a result, Joseph went into a grove of trees near his home and knelt down to ask of God. The First Vision that followed was truly momentous and magnificent. But the path to that in-person visitation of the Father and the Son began with a prompting from the Holy Ghost to pray.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p20" pid="TaYRx6wqgUKzNjBtPX-8YA" hash="l94AOw"&gt;The revealed truths of the restored gospel came through the pattern of seeking in prayer and then receiving and following the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Consider these examples: translating the Book of Mormon; the restoration of the priesthood and its ordinances, beginning with baptism; and the organization of the Church—to name a few. I testify that today, revelation from the Lord to the First Presidency and the Twelve comes according to this same sacred pattern. This is the same sacred pattern that allows personal revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p21" pid="ORvhkhdP5Uqa_8V3iaNFzA" hash="gymUdA"&gt;We pay tribute to all who have followed the Holy Ghost to receive the restored gospel, beginning with Joseph Smith’s own family members. When young Joseph told his father about Moroni’s visit, his father received a confirming witness for himself. Immediately, Joseph was released from his farm responsibilities and encouraged to follow the angel’s direction.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p22" pid="6WU0hfEvEkeOXjnRLIxSOQ" hash="7aByTg"&gt;Let us, as parents and leaders, do likewise. Let us encourage our children and others to follow the direction of the Holy Ghost. In doing so, let us follow the example of the Holy Ghost ourselves, leading through gentleness, meekness, kindness, long-suffering, and love unfeigned.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_20"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p23" pid="GAPxiv9BqEW8QkZH95L32w" hash="TqspsQ"&gt;The Holy Ghost is a medium for God’s work in families and throughout the Church. With that understanding, may I share a few personal examples of the Holy Ghost in my own life and Church service? I offer them as a personal witness that the Holy Ghost blesses us all.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p24" pid="DB4M9GlNZkO1t97eCOL8vw" hash="njLDWw"&gt;Many years ago, Sister Hales and I planned to host some of my work associates at a special dinner in our home. On my way home from the office, I had an impression to stop at the house of a widow whom I home taught. When I knocked on the sister’s door, she said, “I have been praying for you to come.” Where did that impression come from? The Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p25" pid="1vDdap7hqU-JsJTJ14O3fg" hash="iVgCAw"&gt;Once, following a serious illness, I presided at a stake conference. To conserve my energy, I planned to leave the chapel immediately after the priesthood leadership session. However, following the benediction, the Holy Ghost said to me, “Where are you going?” I was inspired to shake hands with everyone as they left the room. As one young elder stepped forward, I was prompted to give him a special message. He was looking down, and I waited for his eyes to come up and meet mine, and I was able to say, “Pray to Heavenly Father, listen to the Holy Ghost, follow the promptings you are given, and all will be well in your life.” Later the stake president told me that the young man had just returned early from his mission. The stake president, acting on a clear impression, had promised the young man’s father that if he brought his son to the priesthood meeting, Elder Hales would speak with him. Why did I stop to shake everyone’s hand? Why did I pause to talk to this special young man? What was the source of my counsel? It’s simple: the Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p26" pid="OVgiBMAe_0uI3_9r2gpPdw" hash="NjXzHg"&gt;In early 2005, I was guided to prepare a general conference message about senior missionary couples. Following the conference, a brother recounted: “As we listened to conference, … immediately the Spirit of the Lord touched my very soul. … There was no mistaking the message for me and for my sweetheart. We were to serve a mission, and the time was now. When I … looked at my wife, I realized that she had received the very same impressions from the Spirit.”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_21"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt; What had brought this strong simultaneous response? The Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p27" pid="-I08W-hIkEqYy51fgQl6YQ" hash="_WbCBg"&gt;To my own posterity and all within the sound of my voice, I offer my testimony of the personal revelation and constant flow of daily guidance, caution, encouragement, strength, spiritual cleansing, comfort, and peace that have come to our family through the Holy Ghost. Through the Holy Ghost, we experience “the multitude of [Christ’s] tender mercies”&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_22"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt; and miracles that do not cease.&lt;span class="noteMarker" ref="f_23"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2016/04/the-holy-ghost.p28" pid="zJAjPM3WXUCYyEzo0sA6Mw" hash="S2x4kQ"&gt;I bear my special witness that the Savior lives. I express my love and gratitude to Heavenly Father for the gift of the Holy Ghost, through which He reveals His will and sustains us in our lives. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

You come to church to learn so that you can go home to teach and serve your family, neighbors, and friends. Don’t be afraid. Have faith to testify of what you know to be true. Think how full-time missionaries grow because they are faithfully living a consecrated life—using their time and talents and bearing testimony to serve and bless others. As you share your testimony of the gospel, your faith will grow and your confidence will increase!</p>

For more than a hundred years, Church leaders have called us to set aside uninterrupted time each week. But many of us are still missing the blessings. Family home evening is not a lecture from Mom and Dad. It is our family time to share simple spiritual concepts and experiences, to help our children learn to care and share, have fun together, bear testimony together, and grow and progress together. As we hold family home evening every week, our love for one another will grow stronger and we will suffer less.</p>

Whenever we raise our voices in anger, the Spirit leaves our companionships and families. When we speak in love, the Spirit can be with us. Let us remember that our children and grandchildren measure our love by how much devoted time we give them. Above all, don’t lose patience and don’t give up!</p>

What can parents do? We cannot pray away another’s agency. Remember the father of the prodigal son, who patiently waited for his son to “[come] to himself,” all the while watching for him. And “when he was yet a great way off,” he ran to him.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_13">13</span> We can pray for guidance about when to speak, what to say, and yes, on some occasions, when to be still. Remember, our children and family members already chose to follow the Savior in their premortal realm. Sometimes it is only by their own life’s experiences that those sacred feelings are awakened again. Ultimately, the choice to love and follow the Lord has to be their own.</p>

A disciple is one who has been baptized and is willing to take upon him or her the name of the Savior and follow Him. A disciple strives to become as He is by keeping His commandments in mortality, much the same as an apprentice seeks to become like his or her master.</p>
			<p class="para" uri="/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ.p6" pid="4hCrn53xbEGCajbJ2z6ykw" hash="LgUIZA">Many people hear the word <span class="emphasis">disciple</span> and think it means only “follower.” But genuine discipleship is a state of being. This suggests more than studying and applying a list of individual attributes. Disciples live so that the characteristics of Christ are woven into the fiber of their beings, as into a spiritual tapestry.</p>

In the Savior’s day, there were many who claimed to be righteous in one or another aspect of their lives. They practiced what I have called selective obedience. For example, they kept the commandment to refrain from work on the Sabbath yet criticized the Savior for healing on that holy day.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_2">2</span> They gave alms to the poor but offered only their excess—what they did not need for themselves.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_3">3</span> They fasted but only with long faces.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_4">4</span> They prayed but only to be seen of men.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_5">5</span> Jesus said, “They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_6">6</span> Such men and women may focus on mastering a specific attribute or action but do not necessarily become as He is in their hearts.</p>

They are interwoven characteristics, added one to another, which develop in us in interactive ways. In other words, we cannot obtain one Christlike characteristic without also obtaining and influencing others. As one characteristic becomes strong, so do many more.</p>

We measure our faith by what it leads us to do—by our obedience. “If ye will have faith in me,” the Lord promised, “ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_8">8</span> Faith is a catalyst.

It is cleanliness and holiness in mind and body. Virtue is also power. As we faithfully live the gospel, we will have power to be virtuous in every thought, feeling, and action. Our minds become more receptive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and the Light of Christ.<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_10">10</span> We embody Christ not only in what we say and do but also in who we are.</p>

It is knowledge that transforms us so that our “light cleaveth unto [His] light” and our “virtue loveth [His] virtue.”<span class="noteMarker" ref="f_12">12</span> By our virtuous living, we make the journey from “I believe” to the glorious destination of “I know.”</p>
